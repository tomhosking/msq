Meteorites bring water,Astronomy_4176,Is this because it lacks an atmosphere and its water was lost in space ?,"So Mars I assume was bombarded by meteorites, just like the Earth was and it has a stronger gravity than the Moon, yet it doesn't have oceans either ?",134

How do astronomers choose their research topic?,Astronomy_4177,What does the process look like from choosing a topic for the PhD to doing research in a specific topic?,"Let's say that you're very interested in exoplanets, would you as a new PhD on the topic be offered and accept a position in a project which does galaxies instead?",0
