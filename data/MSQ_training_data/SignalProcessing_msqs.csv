How to implement a filter in matlab,SignalProcessing_1839,"My understanding of the matlab function is that it takes 3 arguments: 'b' = array of numerator coefficients , 'a' = array of denominator coefficients and 'array' = the array to be filtered.So if you wanted to filter an array with a filter H(z) where:  $$   H(z) = \frac{b_1 + b_2z^{-1}}{a_1 + a_2z^{-1}} $$  and store it in an array called ""result"" then you would write  result = filter( [b1 b2] , [a1 a2] , array );   Now I tried to implement the 'filter' function ( with the number of coefficients in the numerator and denominator limited to 2) by getting the difference equation from H(z) then using it to get the resultant array but this route does not seem to work, ie  $$   H(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{b_1 + b_2z^{-1}}{a_1 + a_2z^{-1}} $$  $$   X(z) (b_1 + b_2z^{-1}) = Y(z)(a_1 + a_2z^{-1}) $$  $$ b_1x[n] + b_2x[n-1] = a_1y[n] + a_2y[n-1] $$  $$ \implies y[n] = \frac{b_1}{a_1}x[n] + \frac{b_2}{a_1}x[n-1] - \frac{a_2}{a_1}y[n-1]  $$  Meaning the matlab code should look something like  function [ result ] = myFilter( b , a , audio ) %MyFilter %a,b = Two Element Arrays %array = the array we want to filter  N = size(audio,2);  for i = 1:N    if( i == 1 )        result(i) = ( b(2)/a(1)) * audio(i);     else        result(i) = ( b(1) / a(1) ) * audio(i) + ...                    ( b(2) / a(1) ) * audio(i-1) - ...

factoring poles / zeros: off by constant gain compared with textbook,SignalProcessing_3328,"(From Schaum's DSP outline, 2nd edition, problem 5.32)  Book says factor it and extract H(z) from the factored product:  $$ H(z)H(z^{-1})= \frac{ \frac{5}{4} - \frac{1}{2}z - \frac{1}{2}z^{-1}  }{ \frac{10}{9}- \frac{1}{3}z - \frac{1}{3}z^-1 } $$  ok.. no problem... so i convert to the form used by the book for nearly every problem:  $$ H(z)H(z^{-1})=  \left( \frac{z^{-1}}{z^{-1}} \right) \left( \frac{ \frac{5}{4} - \frac{1}{2}z - \frac{1}{2}z^{-1}  }{ \frac{10}{9}- \frac{1}{3}z - \frac{1}{3}z^-1 } \right) $$  $$ H(z)H(z^{-1})= \left( \frac{ - \frac{1}{2}  + \frac{5}{4}z^{-1} - \frac{1}{2}z^{-2}  }{ \frac{1}{3}  + \frac{10}{9}z^{-1}-  \frac{1}{3}z^{-2} } \right) $$  Then I apply quadractic formula to determine the zeros and poles:  [tex] [tex]  Then I rewrite [tex] in factored form:  $$ H(z)H(z^{-1})=\frac{\left(1-\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}\right)(1-2z^{-1})}{\left(1-\frac{1}{3}z^{-1}\right)(1-3z^{-1})} $$  At this point I realize that I have a different answer from the book which says, the answer at this point should be:  $$ H(z)H(z^{-1})=\frac{\left(1-\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}\right)(1-\frac{1}{2}z)}{\left(1-\frac{1}{3}z^{-1}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{3}z\right)} $$  I think... well... ok.. it should be equivalent to my version... i can rewrite my equation to get it to match the book.. so i try that:  $$ H(z)H(z^{-1})=\frac{\left(1-\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}\right)(-2z^{-1})(1-\frac{1}{2}z)}{\left(1-\frac{1}{3}z^{-1}\right)(-3z^{-1})(1-\frac{1}{3}z)} $$  $$ H(z)H(z^{-1})=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\frac{\left(1-\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}\right)(1-\frac{1}{2}z)}{\left(1-\frac{1}{3}z^{-1}\right)(1-\frac{1}{3}z)} $$  At this point i'm scratching my head wondering why it doesn't match because its off by a different gain?",Wondering why the gain doesn't matter when picking out H(z) from the factorization of [tex]?,0
