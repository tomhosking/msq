0,Is there any way to help color blind people feel the true color like normal people?,"I am Mild Deutans by taking a color blind test.  Deutans is defined by a result as ""Deutans are people with deuteranomaly, a type of red-green color blindness in which the green cones do not detect enough green and are too sensitive to yellows, oranges, and reds. As a result, greens, yellows, oranges, reds, and browns may appear similar, especially in low light. It can also be difficult to tell the difference between blues and purples, or pinks and grays.""  This maps to me. But can I be cured? Or if not, is it possible for me to have a imagine of my blinded color?  "
1,How long does it take to die from drowning?,"Here is the text I'm having trouble with (from Foundations of Legal Research and Writing 5th Edition by Bast and Hawkins):     To their horror, they saw two bodies in the deep end of the pool. They all jumped into the pool and pulled out the bodies. The two women tried to revive Joseph and Phil while the two men called the police and fire departments. When they arrived, the police and firefighters joined the Andersons and the Cookes in trying to revive the two boys. The two boys were rushed to the hospital but died a few hours later.    A few hours later?  Is that plausible (realistic)? "
2,recovery expectations/timeline for ankle-joint osteosynthesis removal,"A 70 year relative complains on occasional pain due to osteosynthesis titanium remaining in a leg, also she fears potential complication if her diabetes starts to progress. Does it make sense to remove considering it is there for 10 years? Can one expect her walking and travelling in a month or few? "
3,Why I am lossing memory if I work hard?,"I am a software engineer and you know that it requires to think in logical way to develop code. I am also hard working to reach the dead lines just to do not loss job. But from last 6 months forgetting lot of things in my daily life, I am not able to remember atleast what I did in the morning. Will it be common to have such memory loss or else will it cause permanent loss? I am not able to avoid my thoughts about work as I need to finish work by deadlines. Is there a way to avoid such memory loss? "
4,What's important when getting an artificial sunlight lamp?,Artificial daylight lamps are frequently recommended as an intervention to improve mood in the winter months.   Image from Wikipedia and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license  What's know about how they can be used the best way? Do we have knowledge that some lamps are better than others? 
5,What is the proper time to eat Vitamin B2 and B6?,"I am usually told to take particular medicines before dinner or after dinner. Does this apply to  Vitamin B2 and B6?  More detailly,    Should I eat them in 30 minutes near dinner (after longer time, in shorter time, right after dinner or it doesn't matter ?) Is it better to eat at other time than near dinner? If I am not allowed to eat them near dinner, what time is second best to eat ? (Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Dusk, Night, MidNight ? specific range of a day would be better . )   There are many sites talking about this, such as [website]But none of them provided an evident. I would be glad to see medical thesis, paper or credible research results.  "
6,Do pharmaceuticals which increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain significantly increase histamine levels?,"I imagine any medication that has an effect on catecholamines would in some way increase histamine levels as well, just for the fact that histamine is part of the 'fight or flight' response and seems to go along with catecholamine activation. (I'm not super knowledgeable on neurophysiology, so please excuse my ignorance of its complexities and the extent of different pathways).   Q 1: If an individual has problems with high histamine levels related to frequent stress response activation and subsequent cortisol spikes, would medications such as adderall and other stimulants greatly exacerbate histamine related physiological imbalances? Note: high histamine levels prevail in spite of antihistamine use.  Q 2: If, as I suspect, stimulant medications do have too much of an effect on histamine levels, what alternatives are there for remedying low dopamine levels and poor executive functioning due to depression and ADHD?  "
7,Research On Chinese Medicinal Treatment For Anxiety?,"I have been searching for analysis &amp; preferable scientific review of Chinese medicinal treatment of psychological disorders... in particular anxiety.  Detail: Passing by, I walked into a Chinese Medicine shop yesterday for the first time in my life &amp; enquired about chinese treatment for anxiety. The Dr.Wang behind the counter asked me to show her my tongue, which I did. All it took was a second for the spectacled doctor to inspect from a distance of about 5 feet &amp; diagnose that I had poor liver function &amp; blood circulation, particularly to the head. Curious, I asked her for the treatment &amp; she prescribed two medications. I do not have the name of the medicines (everything was in Chinese), however, the dosage was interesting, one to be taken three times a day, eight tablets at a time. The other one is 10 tablets, twice daily. The first prescription is suppose to last 9 days at a cost of Â£25 &amp; I presume it needs to be carried on for a few weeks atleast.  This has been on my mind since &amp; to be clear, while I am very intrigued to the point of going for it, if only to see the results after a few weeks, however, I am conscious that this is not a cheap treatment &amp; coming from a family of doctors, I have been quite sceptical of Chinese, Arabian, Ayurvedic, Eastern etc treatments. However, reading online, there appears to be some posts on people finding relief through this treatment where Western treatments have failed.  So, is there any study / research / literature on these Chinese treatments, relating to psychological / psychiatric treatments? Has any proof ever been found for the body energy they call Chakra / Qi energies? "
8,Will flying potentially damage my ears further?,"Some Context...  A couple years ago my friend shouted into my ear very loud at a concert (stupid move, but I guess he just wasn't thinking), and ever since, it has been prone to getting blocked and is more sensitive to loud noises.  I have a number of flights in a row to complete tomorrow. I am flying from Australia to Brazil. I had a short flight, about 50 minutes across states today (Melbourne to Adelaide)   Tomorrow I'll be going from:  1. Adelaide to Dubai   then  2. Dubai to Rio De Janeiro  over 23 hours or so.  The Problem  While coming down to land on my flight today I started feeling quite a lot of pain and swelling in my ear canals. When I massaged between the behinds my ears to just underneath the joint of my jaw, I felt that the tube was so swollen that it had become rock hard.   Ever since the flight - about 3 hours from writing this, my ear on the right side (the one that was shouted into) is completely blocked, and there is a tight sensation in my sinuses, on that side of my face and I am experiencing mild nausea.  I will be trying to book an emergency appointment to see a GP today, but if they can't book me in, I'll have to take the advice of medical stack exchange and make a decision whether or not to fly further, for risk of damaging my ears.   My Question  Is it safe for me to fly today? Is there any chance that flying will injure me further? "
9,What does fluoride toothpaste do to the dentin on the teeth?,"I've read articles about how fluoride toothpaste is essential to maintaining a healthy mouth, and how it is beneficial to the enamel. However, I could not find articles/papers regarding the effect of fluoride on the layer beneath the enamel, also known as the dentin.  Let's assume a guy who has his enamel completely eroded away (tooth decay), and is only left with his dentin. (Side Question: How likely is this?)   If he starts brushing his teeth with fluoride toothpaste, will the toothpaste help in slowing down his tooth decay, and/or have other positive and negative side effects?  "
10,Can Charcoal Toothpaste/Powder Whiten a Slight Fracture-Line on a Tooth?,"Seemingly overnight, this charcoal tooth-whitening technique has become a craze. I've read many ""testimonials"" and reviews that claim that it indeed whitens teeth, but I have also read articles wherein Dentist warns against long-term effects, etc.   Here's the thing.... I do not plan to use charcoal toothpaste/powder long term, I just want to do a quick whitening of my teeth prior to my engagement photos (and later on before my wedding photos). So I'm not worried about the long-term effects.   However, I have a slight fractured tooth due to a chip, it looks kind of like this: And, I'm wondering:   would the charcoal product whiten this line?? or would it essentially do nothing to it?? Or worse, would it stain the line black?   How to whiten the fractured line? (I don't have dental insurance and my engagement photo shoots are soonish). "
11,Does research show that Metformin alleviates/mitigates Adult Acne in PCOS women?,"I'm an adult woman in her 30's, who suffers from Poly-Cystic-Ovarian-Syndrome (PCOS). My doctor has proscribed me Metformin to treat/manage my PCOS. Since PCOS can be one of the several causes for Adult Acne, does research show that Metformin alleviates/mitigates Adult Acne in PCOS women?   I'm having my engagement photos done soon, and my Adult Acne is still going strong. I was wondering if Metformin is not meant to help with Acne... or if... my Acne would just be worse without it?! "
12,How much is green tea really good against tooth decay?,"I heard that many times:     Green tea is good for cavity protection.   For example, it is written on this site (the first one googled):        Cavity prevention         Because green tea controls bacteria and lowers the acidity of saliva and dental plaque, it may be a useful tool in preventing cavities. A recent Egypt-based study tested people before and after they gave their mouths a five-minute rinse with green tea. The test subjects had less bacteria and acid in their mouths, as well as reduced gum bleeding. Other research has found that drinking green tea shows promise when it comes to preventing tooth decay.   But I never heard such a thing from some reliable source (my dentist doesn't know anything about that). The question has three parts really, they are:   Is green tea really good against cavity? How much? Is it even worth mentioning? Do you have some reliable source? (big medical research, world respected dentist, or something like these)  "
13,How should I account for a blood donation while couting calories/trying to lose weight?,"I am tracking my calories and other nutrients as part of an effort to lose a few pounds.  I also have a whole blood donation scheduled today. If you aren't familiar with the process, afterward, they give you sugary and other kinds of food (like cookies or crackers) to help get your blood sugar up, since you just lost a big chunk of it.   Personally, I need a few of these snacks to feel better.   How should I account for these extra calories in my day? Should I ignore them and not record them? Should I record them and just accept I will eat more than usual? I can apply a calorie penalty to  my tracking if that seems more reasonable.  I can't exercise them off, you generally aren't supposed to workout after a donation for about 12 hours, no weight lifting for 24. "
14,Effects and side effects of artifical oxytocin,"I have heard that oxytocin    improves mood drastically,  is secreted in the body during certain activities,  can be synthesized artificially,  and the artificially synthesized oxytocin can be consumed   Does consumption of artificially synthesized oxytocin cause any side effects? Does the artificially synthesized oxytocin cause the same effects on the body as the hormone which is naturally secreted?   "
15,Which nuts are best to snack on for a high-fibre diet?,"I'm trying to maintain a high-fibre diet, and I understand that snacking on nuts regularly is a good way to do this.  At the moment, I tend to snack on Brazil nuts, cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, and pecan nuts.  Do some nuts have a higher fibre percentage than others?  Which are the best for a high-fibre diet? "
16,What's the rush in the case of sudden hearing loss?,"I've heard from both an ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctor) and an audiologist (hearing specialist) that in the case of sudden hearing loss, time is of the essence, and the patient should be seen as soon as possible. The audiologist I was speaking with related that her audiology teacher experienced sudden hearing loss herself, and missed class to drive as fast as possible to the doctor to be seen.  Unfortunately, neither of these professionals explained why this was the case. Why the urgency to take care of sudden hearing loss? Is it due to a concern that it will worsen to the point that it will not be curable? Is there a particular treatment that won't work (as well?) after an amount of time? Or is it just due to the discomfort of being unable to hear for an amount of time? "
17,What do the European reference intake values used for food labels actually mean?,"In the European Union, food labeling is currently harmonized by Regulation 1169/2011. In it, the Reference Intakes or RI (previously Guideline Daily Amount or GDA) are defined as follows:   Energy or nutrient   Reference intake ---------------------------------------- Energy               8400 kJ / 2000 kcal Total fat              70 g  Saturates             20 g Carbohydrates         260 g  Sugars                90 g Protein                50 g Salt                    6 g   The energy and nutrients contained in a given product are then stated on the label in absolute values as well as percentages of these reference values.  But what do these values actually mean? Are all of them maximum amounts? What about minimum amounts? How do I know which values I should aim for? "
18,Reversal of excess fat in men by increase in testosterone,An increase in testosterone can reverse the excess fat. As the men age I believe that decrease in testosterone causes fat gain.  If we increase testosterone can we reverse the extra fat storage in the body?  If yes how can we increase testosterone? 
19,Cleaning to rid house of cat allergen after cat is gone,"We discovered through a blood test that our 3yo is severely allergic to cats. We have two cats who are 7 and 8 respectively and we're adopted as kittens. So their hair and dander is all over everything in our house. We are finding new homes for that cats, but I have the painstaking chore of cleaning their hair and dander off/out of everything in the house. I know it will take a while to really clean the house and it will never be entirely free of all hair.  Forgive me if this isn't the right place to ask (maybe the biology SE?), but I am trying to figure out the best way to clean so the allergen is dead or denatured so it does not affect my daughter. Will washing clothes and other linens in very hot water kill whatever it is in the hair and dander that causes a reaction? So that even if the hair is present, it won't affect her? Is there a kind of soap or other agent I can use?   Fortunately, we have no carpeting in the house, but we do have rugs. And since we live in a cold climate, we also have lots of thick, heavy blankets of various textiles and materials.  "
20,"What causes acne, and how do I get rid of it?","I'm a 21 year-old male. I've had mild acne since my early teens, and currently it translates to a few raised red spots on my face and many more on my back and shoulders in an average week. The more stressed I am in a week, the more spots I tend to get.   I've never really done anything about my acne due to an initial lack of knowledge about skin hygiene, and feeling too overwhelmed about all the information that was out there to start anywhere. As a result, the last few years of damage have also left me with a pockmarked forehead. I'm now determined to improve my skin to make it smooth and healthy again, but need to know how to go about doing this.  a) What are the root cause(s) of acne?  b) What are the most effective, scientifically-proven ways to clear it up?  c) Is it possible to undo the damage of the last few years on my pockmarked forehead in order to make it smooth again?  Thanks in advance to anyone that can provide me with a sourced, definitive answer - I'd really appreciate the help. "
21,"Why are medial epicondylopathies more effectively treated with open, traditional surgical procedures than with arthroscopies?","I read on [website]  Common arthroscopic procedures include: Treatment of tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis)      There are several elbow surgical treatments that are currently most effective when done as an open, traditional procedure. These include surgeries to: Treat golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis)   Why are medial epicondylopathies more effectively treated with  open, traditional surgical procedures than with arthroscopies, whereas it isn't the case for lateral epicondylopathies? "
22,Why is such a low carb intake mandated for keto-adaptation?,"I see a lot of articles that suggest 10-50g carbs / day to get into ketosis.  Why so low?  I need at least 2500+ calories / day. Even if I consumed half of my calories from carbs and glycolysis supplied half of my requirements, the other half would have to come from ketosis, no? And if I spend half of every day in ketosis, won't I (slowly) become keto-adapted? "
23,Why does a yeast infection burn?,"I am new to this site and not entirely sure how much background knowledge I should posses in order to ask questions.  However, I am curious as to why a yeast infection burns and itches? What is the bacteria doing to my body that causes such a reaction?  "
24,Is there any cure for keloids?,"A keloidal scar is a fibrous tissue that occurs when skin is injured and forms over the wound to repair and protect the injury. Till now, there is no complete cure except for plastic surgery. But dermatologists say that a plastic surgery of keloids could only exacerbate the scar than diminishing completely.  Apart from surgery, is there any medication like herbal treatment that could reduce the scar? In general, is there any traditional medicine to treat keloids?  I have realised there are so-called ""peptide gels"". Do they work on keloids too? "
25,Is their a way to train my body out of being allergic (to pollen)?,"Disclaimer: if this is off-topic here, just let me know. This seemed like the right SE to ask it on.   I get pretty bad hay fever in the spring/summer. Running nose, itching eyes, the whole thing. I know there are methods to limit your pollen exposure/symptoms, and there are of course drugs that can help, but I'm wondering if it's possible to train your body out of being allergic to pollen completely. Or to anything, for that matter.   I did some research, but was only able to find tips on reducing exposure. The closest I came was an experiment, but it doesn't tell me how to get used to pollen in a home environment, where it's everywhere (it's also talking about severe allergies, which I do not have - don't worry, there is no risk of death here).   Can I somehow get my body 'used' to pollen? How?  "
26,Is immunotherapy effective against allergies?,"I have been suffering from allergies for years and I have recently seen an allergist. I was told that I would be a good candidate for immunotherapy. However, it is not an inexpensive process and a pretty hefty time commitment too. Are there studies that show that immunotherapy is effective? Is it more effective for some allergies rather than others? Note that I mostly suffer from environmental allergies and not food allergies. "
27,Are babies under 5th percentile mean they will be small forever?,I noticed that there are babies that are under 5th percentile. The baby is about a year old and the height and weight under 5th percentile. What does this mean? Does this mean the baby will be small forever? 
28,I'm afraid of going to dentist,"I've a cavity in a tooth. It's very small but it seems that it's deep because I feel pain when I eat sugar on this tooth or when I do much stress for chewing.  I've heard that refilling a cavity is a painful process. That's why I don't wanna go to a doctor. I'll brush my teeth regularly and increase calcium intake trying to prevent more damage.. Will this work?   For me, it's better to remove the entire tooth (if it becomes too bad) than refilling it because that's less painful. Am I making the right decision?  Thanks a lot, "
29,Normal life with heavy weights?,On an animated TV show (dragon ball Z) characters would have clothes which seamed 3 times their own weight. Gradually building up could one be able to carry evenly across there body 3 times there weight and feel normal? What would be the upside and downsides? 
30,Aphthous ulcer in pancreatic cancer,"My father is 70 years old and is almost seven months struggling with Pancreatic Cancer stage IV.Recently there are a dozens of aphthous ulcer in his mouth and he can't eat anything for a week. Have anyone else face this issue before? any useful treatment for this? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanx.  Update:  Before this time, these ulcers were cured by a herbal treatment(of course the doctor agreed to use) There was a gel made with licorice root and was effective that time. But know it's not sufficient and by doctor prescription we are using chlorhexidine 0.2% and nystatin powder for oral suspension and for soothing his mouth, ice cream is great but mostly we give him carrot juice with ice cream.  Now that he doesn't eat anything doctor diagnosed it is more than ulcers and is an oral thrush. We now use lidocaine and then give him food or medicine.  "
31,Do toilet bleach tablets prevent the spread of enteric diseases?,"I am not a huge fan of adding bleach tablets to toilets, but my wife and I have experienced an unfortunate increase in stomach-related problems since we had children. Despite our attempts to regularly manually clean our toilets, I've begun to think about bleach tablets more often.  Flushing a toilet may spray a mist into the air. I have read that that mist can spread disease. Can adding bleach tablets to my toilets at home reduce the chance that that mist can effectively spread disease? If so are there specific health risks to using bleach tablets that offset this benefit? "
32,How does immunosuppressant affect immune system?,I'm talking Immuran (azathioprine) and I would like to know what it does to immune system exactly. I'm not a doctor but I'm asking here just to learn. Does it kill all white cells? Does it reduce the number of white blood cells? Or does it just prevent them from doing their function? What if a virus entered my body? 
33,Heart Attack Risk Score calculation,Someone recently mentionned to me a score to calculate my risk of having a heart attack in the next years.   Unfortunately he was not able to tell me where I could access this tool (or is this just for medical professionals?)  Could you help me on this? Thank you. 
34,Is diarrhea acidic?,What causes the burning sensation when you have diarrhea? Can farts be acidic too? Both seem diarrhea and flatulence cause a burning sensation on my bottom if I have either for too long. 
35,Normal resting heart rate and how to measure it,"There is somewhat conflicting information on what the ""normal"" resting heart rate should be. Some sites cite rates between 60 and 100 as being normal, with rates below 60 being defined as bradycardia, i.e. a ""condition"". However, most sites also mention that it's normal for athletic people to have heart rates as low as 40, and that people should try to keep it below 70:     Myth: A normal heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute?      That's the old standard. Many doctors think it should be lower. About 50-70 beats per minute is ideal, says Suzanne Steinbaum, MD, director of women's heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital.      Recent studies suggest a heart rate higher than 76 beats per minute when you're resting may be linked to a higher risk of heart attack.   This is rather conflicting, since 76 is at around 40% of the 60-100 range, implying it even gravitates to the ""fitter"" range? Is the ""new standard"" correct?  Furthermore, regarding RHR calculation, my fitness tracker calculates the RHR as the first heart rate after waking up, while still lying in bed (it tends to be slightly below 60 on average). But this is really my lowest rate during the day (sleeping excluded), and while sitting at my desk during the day (I am a programmer), it will stick around 70 bpm - I am obviously not as fit as I would want to be. Is the in-bed resting heart rate really the ""correct"" indicator of fitness? "
36,How do sterile bandages stay sterile if the packaging can absorb and release air?,"I was at a store that had large hospital- and field grade medical bandages. Think stuff EMTs and field medics would work on somebody with: 5x12ish and quickclot and other stuff. They had several large types of gauze bandages where the packaging would let air in and out, albeit slowly. I don't understand how such a bandage can maintain its sterility while the packaging does that. Both different types appeared to have that semipermeable paper stuff. Does that semipermeable paper stuff allow molecules but not organisms?  By the way, if it's not obvious, I'm not a medical professional, nor do I have much expertise in this field, hence the mutulated jargon.  Edit:  This is the manufacturer's product page, and I'm referring to #512 and #5161  I called the manufacturer, and he said his manufacturer (isn't it great how that works today? lol) said they are supposed to do that, and the air is actually going into the gauze and that's why it appears to be deflating and re-inflating.  He did not have a name for the phenomenon, nor the waxy paper coating.  If this is correctly, this is a valuable feature for something like this, that's meant to go in a bag, but I have a hard time believing that explanation. "
37,Insulin and cellular glucose capture,"Insulin is said to be the ""unlock"" key to let glucose enter body cells.    Then why do stable Type 1 Diabetes patients have to inject less insulin in case of scheduled sport activities?    Don't muscles cells need insulin as well to tap glucose? "
38,Effectiveness of Plant Based Diet to losing weight,"Movies such as ""Sick Fat Nearly Dead"" and ""Forks over Knives"" and ""Engine 2"" tout the ""Plant Based Diet"".  Are these plant based diets beneficial/required for losing weight? If so what resources exist for creating and planning meals using those diets as a guide?  "
39,What are the long-term side effects of intramuscular oil injection?,"Intramuscular injections of oils such as synthol is sometimes used in amateur and professional body-builders to enlarge their muscle volume. What are the long-term side effects of intramuscular oil injection?  What I found so far is limited:   (1) gives some ideas but isn't written in English, and I can only access the abstract, so I cannot verify how serious the study is. (2), (3) and (4) are just case report.     References:   (1) Pupka, Artur, Julita Sikora, Jakub Mauricz, Dariusz Cios, and Tomasz PÅonek. ""[The usage of synthol in the body building]."" Polimery w medycynie 39, no. 1 (2008): 63-65. [website]  Synthol consists usually of oil, benzyl alcohol and lidocain. It consists of 85% of oil (normally it is oil built by medium-length MTC chains because it gives the best effects), 7,5% of lidocain (painkiller), 7,5% of alcohol (to sterilize the mixture). Synthol is a substance used by body builders as a temporary implant which is injected deeply into the muscle. The enlargement effects are immediate. Synthol is used in small groups of muscles to enlarge their volume (for example triceps, biceps, deltoids, muscles of the calf). Some serious drawbacks can be visible while using synthol. The muscles deform and become unnaturally shaped. The side effects of synthol are manifold and they can also cause a damage of nerves, oil embolic of the pulmonary, occlusion of the pulmonary artery, myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke and infectious complications.

[website]  This case report describes a 26-year-old body builder who had practiced several months of intramuscular self-injection of walnut oil. Apparently this is a normal procedure amongst body-builders. Our patient complained of swelling and tenderness overlying an injection site. Injections of oil may cause foreign body reactions, leading to tumours named according to the injected material; e.g. paraffinoma, oleoma. Systemic distribution has been reported to result in pulmonary complications.    (3) Ghandourah, Suleiman, Markus J. Hofer, Andreas KieÃling, Bilal El-Zayat, and Markus Dietmar Schofer. ""Painful muscle fibrosis following synthol injections in a bodybuilder: a case report."" Journal of medical case reports 6, no. 1 (2012): 1. [website]  Introduction: Synthol is a site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders to   boost the cosmetic appearance of muscles. Here, we describe the case   of a patient with severe side effects following repeated intramuscular   injections of synthol in his right biceps muscle.      Case presentation: A 29-year-old Middle Eastern male bodybuilder,   following intramuscular injections of synthol five years ago,   presented with painful pressure in his right upper arm. On   presentation to our clinic, his muscle appeared disfigured. Magnetic   resonance imaging revealed scattered cystic fatty lesions in the   muscle. The affected part was surgically removed and histopathology   showed inflammatory changes with fibrosis and a so-called Swiss cheese   pattern.      Conclusion: Synthol injections that are used for the short-term   enhancement of muscle appearance by bodybuilders bear the danger of   long-term painful muscle fibrosis and disfigurement.

International journal of sports medicine 33, no. 10 (2012): 829-834. [website]  Intramuscular oil injections generating slowly degrading oil-based depots represent a controversial subject in bodybuilding and fitness. However they seem to be commonly reported in a large number of non-medical reports, movies and application protocols for 'site-injections'. Surprisingly the impact of long-term (ab)use on the musculature as well as potential side-effects compromising health and sports ability are lacking in the medical literature. We present the case of a 40 year old male semi-professional bodybuilder with systemic infection and painful reddened swellings of the right upper arm forcing him to discontinue weightlifting. Over the last 8 years he daily self-injected sterilized sesame seed oil at numerous intramuscular locations for the purpose of massive muscle building. Whole body MRI showed more than 100 intramuscular rather than subcutaneous oil cysts and loss of normal muscle anatomy. 2-step septic surgery of the right upper arm revealed pus-filled cystic scar tissue with the near-complete absence of normal muscle. MRI 1 year later revealed the absence of relevant muscle regeneration. Persistent pain and inability to perform normal weight training were evident for at least 3 years post-surgery. This alarming finding indicating irreversible muscle mutilation may hopefully discourage people interested in bodybuilding and fitness from oil-injections. The impact of such chronic tissue stress on other diseases like malignancy remains to be determined.  "
40,Does tightening abdominal muscles reduce abdominal fat?,"I have heard someone said that always conscious tighten abdominal muscles would help me reduce abdominal fat.    Is that true? Does tightening abdominal muscles all the time not harm my body? If 2 is false , when and what situation I can tighten my abdominal muscles?      Because I don't like spend time to do real exercise, the situations when I would do this activity are when I:   Sit in front of computer Walk or ride bike (Does walking conflict with Tightening abdominal muscles?) Riding motorbike Eating? (I don't think it is safe while eating, or it force me eat less? I also see some articles say Tighten abdominal muscles would improve the digestive function)   Are above situations fine to do such exercise? "
41,TReatment for open blisters,"TL, DR: I have a nopen blister. What to do?  So this happened: I steped on a bee and got stung on the underside of my large toe. During the day after the sting, my foot swelled and formed blisters on the upper side, near the sting. I opened the blisters and applied Octenisept (disinfectant) and Dermatol (poweder of talcum and Bismutum Subgallicum) to dry and protect the wound - this is a treatment I remember from my childhood for wounds like this. Since then I kept the area in the open as far as possible (figuring that it heals faster that way) and apply Dermatol occasionally.  The fluid in the blister was clear, yellowish so I figure lymph fluid. No thick yellow fluid, affected foot isnt warmer than the other one and I'm generally fine. Else I'd have seen a doctor allready.  With googling i found out that Dermatol may not be sold in Germany anymore (since 2003 actually) because there's no proof of any effect.   From looking at this answer, the treatment seems to be ""... get the sterile dressing on, then clean and redress (with a light application of an antibacterial cream)"". My problem is with the dressing: Blister-bandaids with a gel inside would seem a good idea, but don't fit the area. A packing of light gauze or something would be doable for now, but I will need to wear shoes or boots soon. Any alternatives? I assume leaving the foot in the open or at least ouside a shoe is god for the healing process. Is this assumption correct? "
42,Preventing thrombosis during long distance travels,"For my long distance travels, to avoid thrombosis, I used to frequently move during the flights and try to book a seat in an aisle which helps stretching my legs.  Are there any other preventive measures known to reduce the risk of thrombosis during long haul flights? Is it worth taking one of those antithrombotic drugs (such as Fragmin), which are given in the hospital for people, who can't move? "
43,"How is it determined that someone died from ""air polution""?","I saw this question on another Stack Exchange site, and wondered, how do they even know that one person in China died from ""air pollution""?  How do these studies that lump millions of people into categories know how to classify the deaths?  Do they categorically assume that everyone with asthma that died was killed by air pollution?  If so, wouldn't all such statistics be overstated from the start? "
44,Modern treatment of bronchitis,On the internet there are dozens or even hundreds of medicines claiming to help if you have bronchitis. But is there a modern and tested approach to treating this illness? Or has nothing really changed here during last 30-40 years? 
45,Do local applications or ingestion of Gaultheria help treating a tendinitis?,"I have read some claims that local applications or ingestions of Gaultheria help treating a tendinitis.  Mercola:     Pain relief - The most popular health benefit of wintergreen oil is its pain-relieving effects, which can help alleviate headache, muscle cramps, joint pain, tendonitis, and bone pain. Wintergreen oil also helps drive out stress and tension.      sports-sante:     [L'huile essentielle de GaulthÃ©rie odorante (GaulthÃ©ria fragrantissima)] sera utilisÃ©e en massage pour toutes les douleurs musculaires ou articulaires (tendinites, entorse, claquage musculaire, lumbago, arthrose). Elle est trÃ¨s apprÃ©ciÃ©e des sportifs.    Amazon:     The main chemical component in Wintergreen, methyl salicylate, is used in topical joint creams to soothe sore muscles and joints.   Is there any scientific evidence supporting or infirming the usefulness of local applications or ingestions of Gaultheria to treat a tendinitis? I am mostly interested in the lateral epicondylitis of the humerus.  If so, what is the recommended use? (number of applications per day, quantity to use, before/after physical effort, morning/evening, etc.) "
46,Smoking just after a workout,"I smoke a cigarette just after workout at gym. Can that be more dangerous than smoking at a more ordinary time? For example, can it cause sudden cardiac arrest? "
47,Safely removing a foreign object from the human body without bleeding to death?,"In movies you often see people advising others not to remove a foreign object (let's say a long stud) because its removal can cause a too high loss of blood. I can totally understand that and would follow this advice.  But what do doctors do about this in a hospital? They won't simply keep it there, I guess. Do they somehow stop the blood flow in the particular area of penetration?  Also, how can I help myself in that situation? Binding some cloth around my arm to slow down the blood flow would be simple but what if something sticks into my stomach? "
48,How is pain measured?,"Patients are often asked to rate their level of pain. Usually, I have found that these questions come without instructions as to what constitutes the maximum on this scale (maximum pain you can imagine? maximum pain you ever felt?).   What are ways pain can be quantified in these situations? Are there any ""objective"" (as objective as this can be) measures to help patients with this?  "
49,Are there permanent health effects from working the night shift for 6 days?,Could there be any permanent health effects form working 12 hour night shifts for 6 days in a row (10 pm to 10 am)? Especially on the brain?  
50,How much weight fluctuation is normal?,"How much weight fluctuation is considered normal? I'm told there is such a thing as ""water weight"" which can explain small fluctuations -- though all mention of ""water weight"" I've found has been on dieting websites so I'm not sure what the scientific status of the notion is (I've asked a related question about that here).   How much weight fluctuation (in either direction) over what period of time is normal for an otherwise healthy individual? "
51,How do corticosteroids cause high blood pressure?,"Taking corticosteroids can result in high blood pressure.  Is anything known about the physiological mechanism behind this? Why do corticosteroids have this side effect?   Since it's been mentioned in the comments, the Wikipedia article includes a section reading      Corticosteroids can cause sodium retention through a direct action on the kidney, in a manner analogous to the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. This can result in fluid retention and hypertension   But does not cite any sources for that section at all. Neither does the article on aldosterone.  "
52,Postpartum haemorrhages due to partial placenta detachment or tear,"If only part of the placenta is delivered after the baby is born and the rest is still attached to the womb, the mother can lose a large amount of blood via postpartum haemorrhage.  There is no haemorrhage from the blood vessels in the womb if the placenta has detached.  Interestingly whilst searching for answers, placental abruption occurs when the placenta partially or completely separates from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery. This can decrease or block the baby's supply of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother.  What is the difference after childbirth?  Maybe it is hormonal but I cannot confirm it and anyhow, I cannot see how hormones can help the blood clotting when the flow is so high.  At term, maternal blood flow to the placenta is approximately 600â700 ml/minute (Wang, 2010) so what I am wondering is:  What is the mechanism involved to close off the blood vessels after placenta detachment after childbirth?  References  Wang, Y. (2010). Vascular biology of the placenta. InÂ Colloquium Series on Integrated Systems Physiology: From Molecule to FunctionÂ (Vol. 2, No. 1). Morgan &amp; Claypool Life Sciences.

53,How are drugs distinguished between approval for pediatric use and not?,"I had always assumed pediatric drugs are well safer.  After reading which drugs as an example antipsychotics, I am beginning to think my assumption is flawed.  How are drugs distinguished between approval for pediatric use and not? Is there some overarching side effects that decide if they are safe or not?  If you must you can use antipsychotics as an example. "
54,"Why after 140 years, is the primary surgical treatment for gallstones to still just chop out the gallbladder?","The practice of completely cutting out the gallbladder to ""cure"" gallstones goes back to 1878 when it was first successfully performed, and which is nearly prehistoric times in medical history and technology.   Indian Journal of Surgery, Vol. 66, No. 2, Mar-Apr, 2004, pp. 97-100 Surgical history Evolution of cholecystectomy: A tribute to Carl August Langenbuch [website]Due to the rise of modern minimally invasive abdominal surgical procedures and use of robots like the Davinci for heart surgery, why hasn't this surgical practice been applied to remove gallstones and simply suture/glue the gallbladder closed again, so that the body can still use the organ?  The gallbladder is far simpler in function by comparison to the heart, yet the primary surgical choice is still the barbaric 1878 excise procedure.  &nbsp;  Complete removal of the gallbladder leaves a person with a seriously dysfunctional digestive system that can no longer digest fats effectively. Too much fat (ingested as part of a normal meal for someone with a functioning gallbladder) will instead result in diarrhea as the undigested oils race through the gut, and potentially resulting in uncontrolled and embarrassing anal leakage, loose stools, and fecal odor.  Additionally for some patients, even after complete removal, abdominal pain never goes away but continues after the procedure for the rest of the life of the patient.  Is there really still no better surgical option available, to remove gallstones and leave the repaired, emptied gallbladder in place? "
55,How do the symptoms of viral tonsillitis differ from bacterial tonsillitis,"How would a doctor distinguish between viral and bacterial tonsillitis?   From what I can tell they have the same symptoms   tender throat swollen tonsils painful swallowing fever    So how exactly do they differ, and what would be the diagnostic process a doctor would employ to confirm which form of tonsillitis a patient has? "
56,Is ShockWave Therapy Useful For ED or not?,"I read the following in an article from a Facebook page for a clinic in the Lebanon region, and I am trying to know if this choice is good or not?:     Extracorporeal ShockWave Therapy, or ESWT, is a relatively new treatment for erectile dysfunction that is non-drug, non-surgical and without adverse side effects. It is the same therapy as used in orthopedics, urology and cardiology and which at higher energies is used to break up kidney stones, known as Lithotripsy. The indication for erectile dysfunction has been approved for use in Europe, most countries in the Middle East and South America as well as in Canada.   Is That Correct?  Is ShockWave Useful for ED or not? "
57,Has any recent research been done on using fevers as a cure?,"I was just reading about fevers and the work of Julius Wagner-Jauregg, which was instrumental in establishing the usefulness of fevers in fighting off infections (as opposed to just an unpleasant symptom).   I'm curious if any more modern research has been done with deliberately causing fevers? I'm sure we could do so in a much more controlled fashion now (i.e. using drugs rather than malaria). And there are still plenty of diseases we have no cure for other than the body's natural immune system.  I imagine, for example, taking a drug to deliberately elevate a fever on the first day of a cold, in order to fight it off in a few days instead of weeks.  Has any more research been done on this? "
58,Medical conditions that cause extremely youthful appearance into middle age and beyond?,"One famous person was the inventor Charles Martin Hall who appeared to be in his 20s while almost 50 -- interestingly, he died at only 51 so his appearance may have not been indicative of overall health. I can't find any information about this fairly trivial aspect of his life online although I vaguely a recall a biography mentioning his appearance; not sure if it also mentioned any reason for it. I would guess that some hormonal or developmental disorders could indeed cause someone to appear child-like throughout their lives although such lives would not tend to be long. But is there any condition wherein a person develops normally but simply looks much, much younger than their chronological age in later adulthood?  EDIT: I recall that a semi-serious article about the character Tin Tin who (like many comic characters) remained youthful forever written by a doctor suggested that Tin Tin's appearance might have been due to a head injury. If so, not sure why that would affect ageing except I guess a serious injury could affect the pituitary? "
59,Are auditory hallucinations a side effect of Oxycodone? How long does Oxycodone stay in the body?,"Are auditory hallucinations a side effect of Oxycodone (when used for a short period following a surgery)?   To give this question context, the following situation has been provided (not to be interpreted for diagnostic reasons specific to the individual):   A person in their 30's had and was prescribed some medicine to manage pain. Oxycodone was taken several times the day of and after surgery. On the fourth day of recovery, while alone in residence, a deep man's voice is clearly and directly heard, saying, ""Get Out!""   So basically... Could Oxycodone taken 2 days prior cause an auditory hallucination?   (Again, not asking for a diagnosis -- just wondering, in general, about how long Oxycodone could be in a person's system to cause auditory hallucinations?)  "
60,How is hereditary cancer risk estimated?,Consider the following example:     Suppose X is a person whose mother Y died of cancer (breast) after undergoing treatment for 13 years.   The doctors had said that Y could have lived 15 years but unfortunately she had died in 13 years.   X is 35 years old and his mother was 65â70 years between.   I want to know the answer of the following two questions which the Internet failed to give a nice answer to.   What is the possibility of X to also be attacked by cancer in his later stages of life? If suppose Z marries X will Z also develop any type of cancer because of sexual interaction with X?  
61,When does the use of headphones become harmful?,"Generally, it is known if you listen to music through headphones a lot of time, you damage your ears.  But how long should I use the headphones? And how loud can they be so as not to affect my hearing? "
62,How are ratios for one person CPR arrived at?,"I have not had a CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) class in 10 or more years, but I used to take them all the time (like yearly).  For one person CPR the ratio of compression to breaths was always changing.  In the US there were two major providers of approved CPR training, It was not unusual for both to have different ratios as ""the correct value"" at the same time, and the following year, one or both would be different.   How are the ratios determined? What impact if any do minor changes in the ratio have?  "
63,Does decaffeinated coffee inhibit iron intake as much as normal coffee does?,"Apparently, coffee consumption can inhibit iron intake and in some cases is even linked to iron deficiency anemia, as Wikipedia says. It is unclear to me, however, how this happens. On the page about health effects of caffeine, I can't find anything about iron deficiency anemia. Some health blogs claim that both caffeine and other substances inhibit iron intake, but I couldn't find reliable sources (e.g. other than forum discussions and fact sheets like this which were compiled by a company selling coffee substitute) yet.  What substances in coffee inhibit the iron intake to which amount, and is decaffeinated coffee more beneficial in that respect than regular coffee? "
64,"Rheumatism as ""Wind-wetness""","In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), rheumatism is known as ""wind-wetness"".   Adherents to TCM:   Believe that being wet and exposed to wind greatly increases the chances that one will suffer from rheumatism in old age.  Go to great lengths to stay dry. Have such horror stories as people becoming permanently disabled after going to bed one night with the body still wet.   What merit is there in the theory that 'wind' and 'wetness' aggravates rheumatism? Are such horror stories (such as the one mentioned above) even possible?  "
65,What effects does alcohol have on underage children?,"In most countries, there is a legal drinking age: 21 in the U.S., 18 in most European countries. I've always been told that legal drinking age is in place because alcohol has harmful effects on underage people. I've never been told what these harmful effects are, though. I've also questioned sometimes if this is true or not.  Does alcohol have harmful effects on underage (say under 18) children? If so, what are the effects? "
66,Do vaccines cause autism?,"It seems the question of vaccine harm has been around at least as long as vaccines1. Specifically, the claim that vaccines can cause or contribute to autism has been hotly debated in the last decade. Many claim that there is a dangerous (possibly hidden) link.  What is the current state of medical research on this topic? Could there be a conspiracy in the pharmaceutical industry to cover up a link? "
67,How far should I go to avoid antiboitics?,"We know (or should know) that the overuse of antibiotics is causing a rise in ""superbugs"" that are resistant to them. This means that we should avoid using them when we don't need to, for example, in soaps and similar products.  How far should we be going to avoid using them? For example, are there occasions when even prescribed antibiotics should be avoided? "
68,Alcohol consumption during pregnancy,In what ways does consuming alcohol affect a mother and her child during pregnancy? Can it cause serious effects on the baby that is yet to be born? Can it cause any consequences to the mother and child during the delivery of the child? 
69,Is smoking during pregnancy harmful to child and mother?,In what way does smoking cigarettes by the mother affect the child and the mother during the pregnancy? What are further consequences it might have during the pregnancy and delivery of the baby? 
70,What is the formula for calculating Body Water Percentage?,Given the available inputs of   Gender Age Height (cm) Weight (kg) Fat (%) Muscle Mass (%)   I know the Watson Formula calculates Total Body Water (in Litres) as   TBW(Male) = 2.447 - 0.09156 X age + 0.1074 X height + 0.3362 X weight TBW(Female) = -2.097 + 0.1069 X height + 0.2466 X weight   But how do you calculate Body Water Percentage?   Are the additional input of Fat and Muscle enough to make the calculation possible?  Update 22/12/2017:  Bill Oertell Makes a very good ( and on hindsight obvious :-) ) point. I did a little more digging and most references to healthy water percentage ranges are referring to percentage of body water by mass. So given that the Watson Formula is returning water in Litres and 1L = 1Kg we simply need     (Simplistic) Body Water Percent by Mass = TBW/Weight * 100%   However this does give us a very simplistic view on water percentage. The original formula I found is not taking into account variances caused by Body Fat and Muscle Mass that the modern electronic fitness scales record using bioelectrical impedance. When I run the data from one such device ( Salter MiBody ) through the given formulas I get results that are close ( +/- 1.5% ) but there is clearly a variance caused by other factors. I think what I need is a more modern Total Body Water formula taking into account Fat and Muscle numbers. 
71,Hard water and cardiovascular problems,"Wikipedia cites one 1970 study by Voors claiming that drinking hard water lessens the odds of dying from atherosclerosis. The stud itself even makes some bolder claims stratified by race, namely that lithium was protective for whites and vanadium for non-whites.  A much more recent (2008) article by Burton makes no mention of either lithium or vanadium, but says:     The idea that hard waterâparticularly that with higher magnesium concentrationsâhelps ward off cardiovascular problems has been around for 50 years. However, due to the ecologic nature of most studies, uncontrolled confounding factors, and the different variables and outcomes measured, no firm conclusions have ever been drawn. The WHO is therefore coordinating worldwide efforts to compare cardiovascular morbidity before and after changes in the calcium/magnesium content of water supplies.   Approximately 10 years later, has anything conclusive come out this? Is hard water in general protective of cardiovascular problems? Is any mineral in particular important? "
72,Can you get infections by washing your body with someone else's water?,"I was in a debate with someone about some religious topics. And one of them was a religious treatment ritual that included taking someone else's saliva and throwing water on his back then mixing both (the washing water and the saliva), then the person to treat should bathe using this water.     I insisted that this is wrong and it can transfer diseases, but my friend was not convinced.     Am I right? Are there any bacteria or viruses that can be transferred through washing water or saliva? Note that the treated person doesn't drink that. He just uses it to wash his body.  "
73,Can drinking alcohol release stored caffeine?,"Several people in my family are sensitive to caffeine. I can't sleep if I have coffee in the afternoon, and dad won't even each chocolate.  A few times recently I've noticed I can't sleep well at night, and I think it's related to times I have wine in the evening in addition to coffee in the morning. It's like I drank a strong coffee at dinner time, except I didn't.  I was thinking that the liver processes many chemicals, and if it filtered caffeine out of my bloodstream but processed it slowly, then maybe there'd be some left at dinner. Then maybe all of it would be released in the evening back into the bloodstream because a more important toxin (alcohol) needed processing. And so then I'd experience the effects of drinking coffee at an odd time hours later.  Is this even possible? I.e. is it possible for:   Caffeine to be stored in the body (in the liver?) after drinking it It to take a long time (6-12 hrs) for the caffeine to be processed For that caffeine to be released into the bloodstream and start having effects, with the release triggered by a glass or two of wine  "
74,Do's and dont's for rabies by dog bites,"I play with stray dogs in India. None of them are vaccinated or anything. Yesterday a puppy was chewing my finger as usual but his teeth have grown and it caused a wound. I got my first injection today. So can I play with them during the rabies course? If they bite me again during the course or after it, will I need another vaccination? Please tell, thank you. "
75,Dangers of smoking hookah,"In my country, hookah just became insanely popular. Government agencies alongside health organizations mobilized and started to forbid smoking under the pretense that it is as unhealthy as cigarettes, or maybe even more unhealthy.  But that's gonna be a lie right? No one died from hookah. So my question is smoking hookah really unhealthy and if so, how unhealthy it is? "
76,Why not use epinephrine?,"In a situation where a patient's heart isn't strong enough for surgery, why isn't it common for a doctor to give the patient epinephrine before the surgery? Do the effects of epinephrine not last long enough, or have potentially harmful effects in larger quantities?   Edit: Is it that the patient's blood flow is also increased when using epinephrine, making blood loss more significant? "
77,could catalepsy be caused by being beaten in the street?,"I am writing a story of a character named Eric who lives in D.C., and got jumped by 3 tough Mancunian visitors and beaten to the point of being left in a condition of falling in and out of trance-like states. Would this be catalepsy, or could a beating cause catalepsy?  If not, what is that condition in which Eric would fall in and out of trances starting right after and because of this heavy beating he received? Remember, I'm going for accuracy in this story, hence why I am asking if it would be catalepsy that was caused by this beating he received. thanks "
78,Will donating bone marrow weaken a person's health?,"When a person donates bone marrow, does it weaken the body, affect health and/or shorten life span? Does it adversely weaken the body permanently? What are some risks to bear in mind before one agrees to donate bone marrow? "
79,Are any 3D printed materials biocompatible (safe for implantation in the human body)?,"Are any typical 3D printed (extrusion based 3D printer) materials, such as ABS or PLA (or slightly more exotic ones, such as kevlar, fibreglass, or carbon fiber), safe for implantation in the human body? Or in medical terms, are they biocompatible (biofunctionality is not topical for this question)? If not, why not? If most of them are safe, then please explain which ones are NOT safe.  Highly relevant, and perhaps even more interesting is: Are there any peer reviewed medical papers that have investigated what materials are safe for implantation in the human body? A paper which answers this unambiguously would be the ideal answer to this question. Another concern is if the process of 3D printing itself adversely influences the properties of the material in the context of implantation applications.  I've tried to determine the answer to this question myself, but I cannot find any papers or studies which answer it. I can easily find that ABS plastic is ""non-biodegradable"", but I suppose the issue of adverse host responses is more crucial, e.g. causing inflammation or it being a bacterial growth substrate to promote infections seems like plausible concerns. I'm sure there might be other dangerous complications too, which I'm not aware of.  I found a paper dealing with corrosion issues for implantable metals: DOI: 10.1089/end.1997.11.383  I found a paper dealing with silicone-urethane being prone to breakdown: DOI: 10.1021/ma301965y  I found a paper describing the properties and history of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which appears to be commonly used as implants:  DOI: 10.1109/EEIC.2005.1566331  By extension, a 3D printer using UHMWPE might be safe, barring any adverse chemical or mechanical issues as a result of the 3D printing process itself. However, it is not clear to me if any 3D printers can actually reliably print UHMWPE. Furthermore, it is unclear if UHMWPE is a sane choice, as it appears to be useful in applications where strength is required, such as for joints. What about other applications where load bearing properties are not required (e.g. a simple enclosure for implantable electronics)?  I'm aware that titanium appears to be frequently used for implants, and while titanium 3D printers do exist, they are beyond the scope of this question. The valid context is extrusion based 3D printers in the sub $10,000 range (arbitrarily chosen to make the question avoid being tagged as ""too broad""). "
80,Too low level of HIV virus to be infectious?,"I just read about a court case where someone was acquitted for ""being dangerous to the surrounding"" by having unprotected sex when diagnosed with HIV.  The reasoning was that since this person was medicated, (s)he had too low levels of viruses to be infectious. How can that be? 1 virus should be enough to infect someone, shouldn't it?  I understand/guess that the risk of infection ""per virus"" might be very low and that, if you ""want"" the risk for infection to be higher than, say, 1 %, you need to be exposed to millions (or something like that) of viruses. But still, as long as you can transmit more than zero viruses to your surroundings, you must be infectious, mustn't you? "
81,Truth or fiction: Testing vitamins to take by holding them and assessing strength,"I'm a Ph.D. candidate in molecular biology and cannot convince my indoctrinated mother and grandmother that you cannot determine whether or not you need to take a vitamin by simply holding it and assessing whether it increases or decreases the strength of your grasping arm.  The story is this: my grandmother became genuinely allergic to most foods and suffered massive immunosuppression, which led her to seek advice from Mayo Clinic, and after extensive testing finding nothing, she was sent home in critical condition eating potatoes and gluten-free flours. She tried 500 ""alternative"" things, and eventually claims that holding cans of vitamins or foods in her hand will strengthen her grasp if she needs to take them or weaken her grasp if she doesn't need them. She has recovered amazingly over the past few years, and now has convinced half of the extended family that this technique is true, which puts a lot of pressure on the three unbelieving M.D's or Ph.Ds in the family (myself included) to explain why this doesn't work. Their theory is that ""frequency"" in the vitamin or food translates to your body, which responds in kind with strength or no strength. I have never tried blinding her to what food or vitamin she was holding, as she is resistant to testing that because she might take something she doesn't need or is allergic to.  Where are they even getting this idea? I can't find any information online, and how do I explain to them? .... Or am I wrong? "
82,Why are dentists special compared to other doctors?,"On one level, dentists are not different from ""normal"" specialists - they just specialize in treating teeth. On another level, they're different:   Many universities have separate faculties of dentistry and of medicine Dentists get their own special degrees, e.g. MDS, MDent   Question: why are dentists so special? As far as I'm aware, the other specialists (anesthesiologist, neurologist, urologist ...) all start out the same. They take the same classes at university, graduate as GPs, do some years of housemanship, and eventually specialize. Why doesn't the same apply to dentists? Is there something special about teeth that makes it impractical or unnecessary to start as a GP before specializing in dentistry? "
83,Do beets dye your blood purple?,"I was warned recently that eating beets can cause reddish-purple urine, which got me thinking.  Blood is filtered by the kidneys to produce urine, high school biology. So if a meal of beets can dye urine reddish-purple, due to betalain pigments from the beets making it into the urine, would that mean that the same betalain pigments also dye the blood itself reddish-purple?  I tried to find an answer online, but all the results for any search containing the most relevant words, 'dye', 'beets', 'urine', and 'blood', only seem to turn up results about beets changing the color of urine, not about beets changing the color of blood. Is this indeed the case? Is the effect of a large meal of beets noticeable upon, say, a blood draw? "
84,How to REALLY treat fungal infection?,"Problem:   I'm a runner. My immune system became weak due to some virus and I got a fungal infection about 9 months ago.   Treatment:   I didn't know that I have a fungal infection because it wasn't visible at first and I noticed this only after my skin started to peel off (which is about 2-3 months into the infection). I did all steps recommended by a local dermatologist and the internet:   Terbinafini hydrochloridum 10 mg/g - I was using this for 3 months without any improvement Miconazole nitrate 20 mg/g - I was using this for 4 weeks without any improvement Clotrimazolum 10 mg/g - I was using this for 4 weeks without any improvement Tannic acid 40% 1 spoon per 1 liter - For 3 months I was soaking my feet in this 1 times a day for 30 minutes without any improvement Betamethasonum 0.5 mg/g + Gentamicinum 1 mg/g - I'm using this in addition to the above creams all the time I got rid of all my previous shoes and bought new ones I got rid of my previous socks and bought new ones I was making sure all that time to keep my feet dry and cold whenever possible    I spent 6 months of inconvenience, [tex]200+ on medicines and I can say today that THERE IS NO IMPROVEMENT WHATSOEVER (it's even worse than it was)!!!  This is how terribly far it has advanced despite using all of the remedies above: [website]Please help me save my life, it's eating me! Does my fungal infection became the ""deep tissue"" version already? Why it's not going away? I see this is frequently asked on the internet but I assure you all I did a very thorough research and did not find any actual solution that works. "
85,Is water flossing more efficient than string flossing to remove plaques from tooth surfaces?,"Is water flossing more efficient than string flossing to remove plaques from tooth surfaces?    I present below what I have found so far. In the following:   Waterpik is a manufacturer of water flossing devices. By extension, Waterpik = a type of water flossing device. oral irrigator =   water flossing device   {1} (published in 2013) says:     RESULTS: The WF group had a 74.4% reduction in whole mouth plaque and 81.6% for approximal plaque compared to 57.7% and 63.4% for the SF group, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The differences between the groups showed the water flosser was 29% more effective than string floss for overall plaque removal and approximal surfaces specifically (p &lt; 0.001). The WF group was more effective in removing plaque from the marginal, lingual, and facial regions; 33%, 39%, and 24%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001).      CONCLUSION:   The Waterpik Water Flosser and manual toothbrush is significantly more effective than a manual brush and string floss in removing plaque from tooth surfaces.   and {3} (published in 2009) says:     RESULTS:   The standard jet tip removed 99.99% of the salivary (ex vivo) biofilm, and the orthodontic jet tip removed 99.84% of the salivary biofilm. Observation of the remaining four teeth by the naked eye indicated that the orthodontic jet tip removed significant amounts of calcified (in vivo) plaque biofilm. This was confirmed by SEM evaluations.      CONCLUSION:   The Waterpik dental water jet (Water Pik, Inc, Fort Collins, CO) can remove both ex vivo and in vivo plaque biofilm significantly.   whereas [website]  The downside: A Waterpik doesnât remove plaque from teeth as well as floss. âFlossing scrapes off the sticky film of bacteria, while a Waterpic just rinses it,â Hayes explains. MayoClinic.com says (mirror) using a Waterpik isn't a substitute for flossing.   and {2} (published in 2008) says:     As an adjunct to brushing, the oral irrigator does not have a beneficial effect in reducing visible plaque. However, there is a positive trend in favour of oral irrigation improving gingival health over regular oral hygiene or toothbrushing only.   I wonder if there now exists a scientific consensus on the efficiency of water flossing compared to string flossing for removing plaques from tooth surfaces.

86,"What is the process called, when a doctor tries to figure out what is wrong with you?","I know that anamnesis is the process of asking potentially relevant questions for building a medical history of a patient. I think this involves:   Getting to know past illnesses of the patient Getting to know which illnesses are in the patient's family Asking for previous medication   But once the doctor has the history, is there a word for the process of figuring out the symptoms why a patient visited the doctor in the first place?  I imagine that doctors check the following in this process:   Does the patient have any pain? If so, at which location and how severe is it? Are there other inconveniences, such as:   coughing not getting enough air running nose pressure on the ear feeling dizzy feeling confused ...    (Reason for this question: I wanted to have a look if there are books on Amazon which help in this process for people from foreign countries. So people needing a doctor, but being unable to describe properly with words what is going on) "

89,Potential for sodium aluminosilicate to cause aluminium toxicity,"Being an aluminium-based compound, is it conceivable that anticaking agent (554) could cause acute aluminium toxicity in excessive quantities?  Apparently 0.3% of aluminium is absorbed by the GI tract (perhaps this is different for aluminium based compounds?), 95% of which becomes bound to transport proteins and eliminated renally. If the amount exceeds what the body can excrete, the excess is deposited in tissues such as bone, brain, liver, heart, muscle, and spleen. The symptoms of aluminium toxicity include altered mental status, muscle weakness, and bone pain.  What amount of sodium aluminosilicate in an acute ingestion would be required to cause a toxic effect in a healthy individual with normal renal function? Is there any data on the bioavailability of Al from the compound? "

Is haemorrhage a technical term for bleeding (even simple ones)? "

102,Anorgasmia with SSRI and SNRI prescriptions,"I am adding to the beginning of this question the caveat that I am npt asking this for me or anyone in particular.  I am studying counselling and have come across this issue whilst researching and it lead me to try and work out what options are available when helping those who come to me with sexual dysfunctions.  Whilst Higgins, et al. (2010) highlights the problem with sexual dysfunctions whilst prescribed Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), I am going to split my question in parts for easier answering. This question will be concerning anorgasmia.  Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants and can have significant impact on the personâs quality of life, relationships, mental health, and recovery.  Higgins et al points out that     The sexual problems reported range from decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, to erection or delayed ejaculation problems. There are a number of case reports of sexual side effects, such as priapism, painful ejaculation, penile anesthesia, loss of sensation in the vagina and nipples, persistent genital arousal and nonpuerperal lactation in women.  The addition of sildenafil (Viagra) will improve erectile dysfunction in men (Rudkin, et al., 2004)   but what about anorgasmia?  The side effects don't seem to be rare from my research online and many patients are not even told to look for it. If a man has premature ejaculations, the side effect of anorgasmia usually helps that nicely, but if it already takes long enough, it might take even longer.  Higgins et al. also points out that with adjunct treatment (introducing another drug to counteract side-effects), clients treated with bupropion SR showed a significantly greater improvement in desire and frequency of engaging in sexual activity; and in a systematic review of medication switching strategies for managing sexual dysfunction, switching from SSRI to non-SSRI antidepressants may produce varying individual responses, and although the sexual dysfunction may recede, the depressive illness may reassert itself.  So has there been any studies which anyone knows of which definitively help with the problem of anorgasmia whilst taking SSRI or SNRI medication?    References  Higgins, A., Nash, M., and Lynch, A.

In order to make my story as realistic as possible I need to know a couple of things:  1) Does this type of drug actually exist? I think that amphetamines or modafinil can keep you awake but,  2) Can these drugs keep the effect for a long time (days)? I mean, the organism would start at a certain point and try to sleep, right?  3) If there's such a drug then after a long period of sleep deprivation the person would start to have certain symptoms. Could be hallucinations one of these symptoms?  4) And now even more complicated: is there any possibility that if the person dies could be no trace of the drug in an autopsy's toxicological analysis?

105,What are ibuprofen alternatives without the side effects,"Came across an article saying that Ibuprofen blocking COX-1 and COX-2 has side effects:      They work by inhibiting enzymes called cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and 2   (COX-2). These are involved in a number of internal pathways that   result in production of hormone-like substances called prostaglandins,   which promote inflammation and increase pain perception.      Animal studies have shown blocking COX-2 and the subsequent pathway of   prostaglandin production may have the unwanted effects of increasing   the tendency of blood to clot inside arteries, and a reduced ability   of the heart to heal after a heart attack. In the early 2000s, a   number of large studies found a significant association of negative   heart events, such as heart attack and stroke, with the use of   selective COX-2 inhibitors. This resulted in two of these drugs,   Valdecoxib and Rofecoxib or Vioxx, being withdrawn from the market.   They talk about a lot of products doing the same and taken off the shelves.  However they don't propose any alternatives with same benefits and no side effects.   I'm no expert and no doctor, so I'm coming here to ask about what soft pain killer should I use instead to avoid those side effects and have the same pain killing effect, even if it's less strong? Tylenol ?  "

109,Is sleeping 6 hours (or less) a day harmful for health?,Currently I am sleeping about 6 hours a day (or a bit less than that): from midnight to around 6 AM. I usually not feel sleepy after I wake up (and the neighborhood of where I just moved into is quite noisy every morning so that it is rather difficult for me to go back to sleep) so I usually get up right away.  I am afraid that I might not have had enough sleep each night (although I do not feel that much tired during the day) and that it might be harmful to me (in the long term) to sleep only around 6 hours a day. (Not sure if this is a relevant information: my age is 26.)  So is it really harmful for health (in any way) to sleep just around 6 hours (or less) a day? Is there any indication to tell if an individual gets enough sleep each day? 
110,Need help interpreting histology results (punch skin biopsy),"Good day.  About a month ago I've removed a mole (nevus) which accrued on ""clean"" skin (de novo) about 4-5 months ago. It has always been charcoal black and 1,5 mm in diameter.  So the dermatologist did a punch biopsy on it. Results are the following:  *Multiple sections have been examined from specimen submitted. There is a small central area of melanocytic proliferation seen within biopsy which is subtended by chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in the upper dermis with incontinent melanin pigment. Trans epidermal elimination of melanin pigment is seen with some melanin present in cornified layers of epidermis.  There is an atypical melanocytic proliferation noted with some extension into the overlying spinous layers of epidermis.  Conclusion: Atypical Junctional Melanocytic Prolifiration - further wider excision of this area is requested.*  Now, I went to the surgeon and he said it is a melanoma and did the excision with 2cm margins on each side.  What confuses me is the pathologist said it's not malignant while sergion says it is.   What it really is? Is it possible not to have a concrete answer looking at the above histology report? And if not what could possibly clarify it?  Any help is highly appreciated.   UPDATE  I have contacted the pathologist on the phone asking for clarification, and than he mentioned that he does not think it's malignant, but cannot state that on the report as he is not 100% sure.  In any case second excision is sent for a test as well - hopefully it will put some light on this diagnosis.  "

I eat a ton of fish (mostly salmon in the past but have been eating a lot of tuna lately) and have been feeling progressively worse lately with what seem to be typical symptoms of mercury poisoning. Obviously health problem symptoms are a bit like astrology, where any list can be believed to fit one's current situation, but the likelihood is high enough given my diet that I want to get it checked out.  What would be the best way to test for organic (specifically) mercury levels? Do I need to see a family doctor, a certain kind of specialist? Do I go directly to a lab? I've read that organic mercury testing still not being a common thing to do, many doctors don't know what kind of testing to do and recommend the ""wrong"" kind (inorganic testing for organic testing, etc...).

115,Correlation between carbonated drinks and IQ,"I was searching the correlation between drinking soft drinks and IQ, because I wanted to verify if countries that drank a lot of coke/soft drinks were more likely to have more intelligent populations (e.g. the basic rationale was that sugar in carbonated drinks would speedup brain faculties, thus having more synapses, and overall better brain performance)  I found in that 2012 NCBI article citing the following:      A total of 529 children participated in this study, (77.7%) of the   children have high IQ level. Almost (60%) of the children drink   carbonated drink daily, while (74%) eat chips every day. The   association between drinking carbonated drinks, eating chips and   intelligence level was significant (P= 0.043, 0.001) and prevalence   odds ratio of 1.5 and 2.4 respectively.   And the study concludes with:     There were significant associations between carbonated drinks, chips   intake and IQ score. More regulations on what to sell inside the   schools canteen are needed. Increasing nutritional knowledge of the   parents, especially the mothers is very important and more health   promotions should be given regarding children nutrition in the early   years of school.   Am I reading this right, that junk food and drinking soft drinks is correlated with higher intelligence quotient ? Does all that sugar beside its negative side effects (tooth decay, insulin highs) have this positive effect on intelligence ? "

118,Is Alien Hand Syndrome MORE common among those born with extra limbs and dactyls (fingers and toes)? Or not studied?,"As stated in a previous post, Alien-Hand-Syndrome is: ""A disorder in which a personâs hand or limb acts as if it has autonomous, voluntary activity independent of the individual."" -- Medical Dictionary  While the cause of Alien-Hand-Syndrome is not quite understood, scientists have agreed, more or less, that it is rooted in a neurological disorder or trauma. And while I certainly understand that it is a neurological phenomenon and not the limbs themselves, I am wondering if there have been any studies on alien-hand-syndrome and individuals born with extra limbs and phalanges? I know that it's not the number of limbs that causes alien-hand-syndrome, but brain trauma or neuro-degenerative disease such as a stroke, but is it more likely to occur in those with more limbs and dactyls (when these head traumas and diseases strikes)? -- or is to rare and specific that research hasn't been conducted?  In cases of ""parasitic twins,"" the individual is born with the set of limbs (sometimes complete set of limbs!) of the ""parasitic"" twin that wasn't viable. See: CNN: Risky surgery separates 10-month-old from parasitic twin. However, it seems that the extra limbs in these cases are removed because it is too much for a tiny heart to sustain all the limbs. Nevertheless, in polymelia and dysmelia, birth-defects born with an extra or partial extra limbs (whether functioning or malformed), where the limbs are not surgically removed -- has there been studies on alien-hand-syndrome and their limbs?   While I certainly know that Alien Hand Syndrome is related to movement in the limbs (and not the phalanges/dactyls) -- Can alien hand syndrome include ""involuntary movement of the phalanges or dactyls?"" What is this called? How frequent is it among polydactyls?  "
119,How do I realistically assess the risk of side effects with a drug?,"A consultant I saw this week prescribed an additional medication (Gabapentin Milpharm 100mg).

However, there is a scary long list of symptoms which says ""fewer than 1 in 10 experienced these"". They range from funny (flatulence) to redundant (Back Pain) to weird (Sudden Anger at others) and worse (impotence, vertigo, etc.)  How do I get an accurate picture of my actual risk, here?  Is that less than 10% of the population a total for all symptoms, for ""at least one"" or for each of them?  How do I assess the information I have at hand? "
120,Why does the WHO give sugar recommendations in terms of percentage of energy intake?,"The WHO recommends that less than 10% of our ""total energy intake"" be due to free sugar. From the cited report:     Total energy intake is the sum of all daily calories/kilojoules consumed from food and drink. Energy comes from   macronutrients, such as fat (9 kcal/37.7 kJ per gram), carbohydrate (4 kcal/16.7 kJ per gram) including total sugars   (free sugars + intrinsic sugars + milk sugars) and dietary fibre, protein (4 kcal/16.7 kJ per gram) and ethanol (i.e.   alcohol) (7 kcal/29.3 kJ per gram). Total energy intake is calculated by multiplying these energy factors by the number   of grams of each type of food and drink consumed and then adding all values together.   Doesn't this technically mean that it's okay for me to eat huge amounts of sugar as long as I also eat a ten plates of pasta a day, or something? What is the rationale for using this metric, and how do I know that I'm eating a healthy amount of sugar because I'm eating low sugar, and not because I'm just eating more non-sugar calories than I should be?

That said, I spend anywhere from eight to sixteen hours a day at my desk sitting.  Recently I purchased an adjustable smart desk that I will configure a plist to fire on my Mac that will tell the adjustable desk to move in X position at a set time interval.    That said, I've been looking for any evidence that states when is the appropriate time to stand or sit in the morning?  As in, after I first wake-up from my slumber would it be healthier on the body to start the day in a standing position?  Several years ago I experienced a very bad back accident and I've been looking for any documentation or writings on how to properly span the amount of standing and sitting intervals.  When I refer to intervals I mean is there a healthier benefit when scripting the desk adjustment to hourly or in two hour intervals? "
124,Thrombotic events and antiphospholipid syndrome,"If my understanding is correct, patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk for thrombotic events 1 but in the same time, it is possible for these patients to have a thrombocytopenia and therefore increased bleeding risk.  So my current interrogation is: those person should receive an anticoagulation in the case of a thrombotic event. But what happens if in the same time they have also low platelets? Is anticoagulation still given although this might increase their risk of bleeding? "
125,Why does the use of quinolones increase the risk of tendinopathies?,"Why does the use of quinolones increase the risk of tendinopathies?  I have read the claim in different places, but I didn't read the reason.  [website]  Quinolones are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all age groups. This side effect is most common in but not limited to the Achilles tendon. Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy symptoms have occurred as early as 2 hours after the initial fluoroquinolone exposure and as late as 6 months after the medication was discontinued. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients. The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments (three times the rate in people without fluoroquinolone exposure). Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Other risk factors include patients with kidney, heart and lung transplants, strenuous physical activity during or immediately after treatment, renal failure or previous tendon disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Some experts have advised avoidance of fluoroquinolones in athletes.   [website]  The use of fluoroquinolone may predispose individuals to tendinopathies.[2]   (1) gives some ideas but is inconclusive, and was published six years ago, so I wonder whether the understanding on that matter has improved since then:     The exact pathophysiology of FQ-induced tendinopathy remains elusive; however, some concepts have been suggested. FQs are synthetic antibiotics that act by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II).27 DNA gyrase is directly involved in DNA replication and cell division.10 Theoretically, FQs should not exert a negative effect on human cell lines because the affected bacterial enzymes have little homology with mammalian DNA gyrase.10 However, it is possible that FQs have a direct cytotoxic effect on enzymes found in mammalian musculoskeletal tissue.10 Because animal studies have shown that FQs may damage juvenile weight-bearing joints, most FQs are contraindicated in children and during pregnancy and lactation.39â40 FQs have chelating properties against several metal ions (e.g., calcium, magnesium, aluminum), and have been known to cause direct toxicity to type 1 collagen synthesis and promote collagen degradation.33,35 Experiments on immature laboratory animals (dogs, rabbits, and rats) have shown that FQs cause cartilage damage by inducing necrosis of chondrocytes (36 hours after treatment), disruption of the extracellular matrix, and formation of vesicles and fissures at the articular surface.41 In-vitro studies in cultured tendon cells have confirmed the clinical observation that FQs can increase the risk of tendon rupture.42 Under normal circumstances, the rate of matrix turn-over and tendon fibroblast is low.10 Other precipitating factors, such as age and corticosteroid use, do not allow the tendon to repair adequately, resulting in irreversible matrix alteration.43 It has been theorized that FQs disproportionately affect human tendons that have a limited capacity for repair, such as in older patients or structural compromise (i.e., pre-existing tendinopathy or trauma).10      (1) Kim, Grace K., and James Q.

126,Does being tall increase the risk of tendinopathies?,"I heard that being tall makes joint issues more likely. Does being tall increase the risk of tendinopathies? If so, why? "
127,what does this abnormality (arachnoid cyst) mean in a brain MRI?,"In a Brain MRI (axial T1, T2, sagittal T1, axial T1 and FLAIR images) is written:  CSF signal intensity lesion with 40x24x38mm diameter is seen in the anterior portion of left middle cranial fossa in favor of arachnoid cyst. Retentional cyst is seen in the right maxillary sinus.    The physician who is a neurologist have told us to do another MRI imagery 6 months later.    I want to generally know (in simple language as much as possible) what the cause of such abnormality could be? (is it hereditary or may be caused by some kind of diseases or events during the life)    What are the signs and symptoms of such abnormality? (With which symptoms a patient or their relatives should be concerned and refer a neurologist?, for example headache, sinusitis, etc)    What can be the risk (at worst)?   "
128,Does it help to add fiber to sugary foods?,"One of the problems with fruit juice is that it provides all the sugar with almost none of the fiber to help slow the absorption of sugar in the body.  If fiber is added back to the fruit juice before drinking, for example with ground flaxseed, does this help prevent the body from absorbing too much sugar?  (Keeping in mind that we are now learning that juicing is not actually so healthy.)  What about more generally eating fiber alongside sugary foods?  For example, eating raspberries or figs or almonds alongside a slice of cake?  Does this help slow the absorption of sugar from the cake to any noticeable degree?  (Not making the cake healthy per se, but does it help make it somewhat ""less bad""?)   If this does help, why doesn't the food industry add more fiber to processed foods? "
129,"Are there objective criteria to define if a diet is ""healthy""?","Recently in Italy there is quite some discussion around a proposed law that concerns the vegan diet.  I am not here to discuss the merits or the demerits neither of the law nor of the vegan diet.  I am here because among the arguments that I have seen thrown around there is one that states (with links to the American Dietetic Association position on vegetarian/vegan diets and a few scientific studies)     The vegan diet is proven healthy, provided that it is integrated with vitamin supplements, in particular B12   This made me wonder, doesn't the requirement for supplements indicate that the diet is deficient in nutrients? What are (if there are any) the requirements for a diet to be defined ""healthy""? "
130,Is it dangerous to eat bananas and eggs together?,"I read that the combination of bananas and eggs is poisonous. I searched on the internet and found out that certain food (fruits and eggs, fruits and milk) shouldn't be eaten together but I couldn't understand why. Is this true? and what happens to my body if I eat them together?  "
131,Does the digestive disorders affect the location of aorta beat around navel?,"You might have experienced this. If you lie on your back on a flat surface and place your finger or thumb right over navel (men or women), and press softly down, you'd feel the beating just like heartbeats. I checked it with around 10 people and mostly it was right at the place of navel (i.e. vertically down to navel) or varied around 1 inch horizontally.  Now the question is here: If we suffer from any digestion related disease especially constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, does the location of of the beat we feel is affected? I'm asking this because many Indians and Indian blogs say this. They also say that the location should be almost vertically down to navel if you don't want to suffer from the diseases mentioned above. How much true it is? "
132,Can HEPA air purifiers release allergens when particles inside the filter decompose / break apart?,"The smallest of pollen grains (~0.6 microns) and other allergens should be trapped by a HEPA filter, however what happens when these decay / break apart? Is the allergen the whole pollen grain or are the allergens really the proteins that make up the grain (which by themselves would be too small for the filter to hold)?  Just wondering because the measures I implemented a couple of months ago (air purifier + a window screen made of polypropylene) seem to have been effective at first, but now it seems to be worse in the ""controlled environment"" than elsewhere. It's difficult to say for sure, but I was wondering if this theory holds any weight. Could it be that the various allergens trapped in the screen and air purifier are now breaking down and passing through the filtration?  The closest thing to an answer I could find is this:  [website]"
133,Why is magnesium citrate the laxative a liquid and the supplement is a pill or powder?,"If you buy magnesium citrate as a laxative, it is a clear liquid in a bottle. It often comes with crap in it like saccharin and alcohol.  If you buy magnesium citrate as a health supplement it is usually a powder or tablet.  Is there any difference between these two things? Can you take the powder and mix it into water to make the same as the laxative? "
134,Were earwigs historically used as a medication?,I have read that people used to use powdered earwig as a cure for ear infections. Is this claim true? What are the details of this practice? 
135,Why is saliva smelly?,"Why does saliva smell only out of the mouth, and not as long it is still inside? What role do oral bacteria play, and which ones? "
136,Delayed vaccination: effect on the immune system,"While researching child vaccinations, I found (and will presume was sufficiently verified by the WSJ) that the typical 5-6 vaccines given to a child contain only 150 antigens, while the child's body is exposed to a number of antigens on the order of 2,000 for every single bacteria they come in contact with.  This is given as a rationale for why vaccines do not create a strain on the child's immune system.  However, a common side effect of vaccinations is a fever.  This seems to create a contradiction with the argument that vaccines do not strain the immune system.   Can anyone describe how these features of the immune system are sufficiently independent that one can have a fever while not straining the immune system? Is the measure of a number of antigens exposed to really a good metric to use?  I am particularly interested in long term hypersensitivity effects on the immune system, such as allergies.  "
137,Why is medicine used to treat symptoms which are our body's way of telling us something is wrong?,"If symptoms are our bodies way of saying that something is wrong and needs to be attacked/fixed, why do we take medicines to suppress our symptoms? Doesn't that negate the point of having the symptoms?   This questions is geared towards more mild symptoms like the cold, not life threatening symptoms which must be addressed for a persons livelihood or basic life. "
138,Do local applications or ingestion of lemon eucalyptus oil help treating a tendinitis?,"I have read some claims that local applications or ingestions of lemon eucalyptus oil help treating a tendinitis.  Example from Worwood, Valerie Ann. The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy: Over 600 Natural, Non-toxic &amp; Fragrant Recipes to Create Healthâ¢ Beautyâ¢ A Safe Home Environment. New world library, 2012:    Is there any scientific evidence supporting or infirming the usefulness of local applications or ingestions of lemon eucalyptus oil to treat a tendinitis? I am mostly interested in lateral epicondylopathies of the humerus.  If so, what is the recommended use? (number of applications per day, quantity to use, before/after physical effort, morning/evening, etc.) "
139,Is setting your alarm for a long duration at a lower volume a good way to ensure you wake up in light sleep?,"I usually set my alarm really loud so that I will definitely wake up. Usually that is accompanied by disorientation, headaches, etc. However, I read about 'completing the sleep cycle' and that it allows for more fulfilling sleep, along with easier waking up, so I started finding ways to implement that.  One way that occurred to me: what if I set my alarm to 'endless mode' but lower the volume to around 30%? I read that it is very difficult to wake a person in deep sleep, but it becomes easier in light sleep. In this way, when I am in deep sleep I won't wake up, but when I transition into light sleep, then the lower volume will be enough to wake me up.  Is this a good technique? "
140,Multidrug treatment to prevent evolution of resistance,"I was just reading an article in PLOS Medicine on the treatment of multidrug resistant TB.  They suggest that treatments are more effective if a large number (more than 5) treatments are used simultaneously.    I know also that many infectious diseases are currently treated with combination therapies (eg ACT for malaria, atripla for HIV) to slow the evolution of drug resistance.  I was curious if there was a down side to using every (or almost every) available treatment for a given infectious disease, instead of one or a few?    Certainly some treatments come with side effects which are unpleasant enough to avoid them from the start, and there may be instances where different drugs interact to be less effective (or in combination tolerated only in lower, less effective doses).  But in general, is there a downside to hitting infectious agents with every potentially effective treatment as a matter of course? "
141,Can spinal cord's C3 disc apply pressure on C7?,"Part of a medical exam result reads:        C3 to C7 mild posterior disc bulging with mild impression on dural sac is seen.       (Image Credit: Wikipedia) Given the fact that C3 is followed by C4 in the cervical cord, can C3 apply any pressure  on C7 which is located much below it? Is there any possiblity of typo in the exam?    "
142,What are the health benefits of consuming smaller meals more often throughout the day?,"My friend is on this diet where he has 6 small healthy meals rather than 3 big healthy meals. He says it is healthier to eat the same meals spread apart throughout the day. Now to avoid comparing Apples to Ice Cream, let's say the 3 meal diet and the 6 meal diet contains the same food in the same quantity. Will the 6 meals really be healthier than the 3? And what are the actual health benefits of the 6 meal diet oppose to eating the same food in 3 meals? "
143,Does tolerance develop to medicinal use of dextroamphetamine?,Dextromphetamine is used long-term to treat ADHD. Does the agent's effectiveness in treating the disorder decrease with time? Do the mood elevating properities of the drug attenuate? 
144,Is there a pressure differential between your skin and any internal part of the human body?,"Since most of the human body is never directly exposed to the atmosphere, is there a meaningful difference in pressure between any internal organs and the skin?   If so, how do open wounds which expose the internal organs affect the body from a pressure point of view? If not - why not?  Not sure as to what tags would better suit the question, feel free to add any that may fit. "

148,How can I create a healthy and balanced vegetarian diet?,"When going vegetarian, there is a problem; where can one get the protein he/she used to get from meat?  How can one create a healthy and balanced vegetarian diet, so as to get the proper nutrition people get when they eat meat, which eating it? "
149,Is it OK to snack on salted nuts for a high-fibre diet?,"I like to snack on nuts as part of ensuring a high-fibre diet, but I prefer the taste of salted nuts over non-salted.  Will eating salted nuts cause me significant dehydration or other health issues?  Is it likely to cause me to have too high a daily salt intake?  Or is it basically OK? "
150,Is there a proven way to test if I'm susceptible to the placebo effect?,"I know there are tests to check if a single drug is useful or useless by arranging groups of people where half receive the actual drug and half receive the placebo, but those are testing the drug, not the patient.  My question is regarding a test for the opposite (a single patient with a group of pills, from which half would be the actual drug and half would be placebos) It sounds like I just answered my own question, or at least I designed the base experiment, but my question is not on the logic of such experiment, the real question is, are there any serious studies like the one I just described?  I'm aware that knowing I'm testing myself may spoil the whole point. So if you can't be unaware of the fact that you are being tested, you can introduce some entropy to the timing of real dosage vs placebo. So maybe a machine-assisted test? A machine would give me pills, some days it would be the real formula, some other days it would be a placebo. Every day I'd have to measure the effects, so it would have to be a pill with immediate but temporal effects, something not crucial for my well being, a drug I don't really need, like a muscle relaxant (e.g. Carisoprodol, maybe?) and I would have to measure the results, maybe with electrodes or anything that register actual measurement and not just my biased perception; ""I feel relaxed"" is not very scientific.   I find it funny, but also interesting. Has science found a proven way to self-test on placebo effect? "

152,Do zinc lozenges really help the common cold?,"For years I've been seeing advertisements for zinc supplements for the common cold, and I've heard recommendations from people who swear that they work, either wiping out a cold completely or shortening its duration.   The studies I have seen were for zinc gluconate specifically. Apparently, once they had a nasal spray that was even more effective, but was pulled off the market for causing permanent anosmia.  Is it a placebo effect, or is there actually evidence that zinc helps? If so, does it depend on the formulation (zinc gluconate, zinc acetate or zinc citrate?) Are there any risks? "
153,Is pneumonia contagious?,"If a healthy person is near a person that has pneumonia, is there any risk of infection for the former?  If so, how is it passed on? Is it via coughing / sneezing or skin contact? "
154,"In which order to put on a mask, a gown and to disinfect when visiting a hospital patient?","Iâm daily visiting a patient in a hospital who has a high risk of infection. Before entering her room, Iâm required to put on a gown and a face mask, and to disinfect my hands.  The gowns and masks are available in the corridor in front of the room; hand disinfection is available in the corridor in front of the room as well as inside of the room.  Iâm coming from outside, carrying a jacket and a backpack.  In which order should I perform the involved steps?  Iâm a medical layman, so maybe none of this matters, but I always wonder if Iâm not undermining certain safety measures.   Especially regarding touching my jacket and backpack as well as the door handle after disinfecting my hands. My assumption is that it would make more sense to disinfect my hands after entering the room and putting away my stuff, but maybe this increases the risk? However, would putting on the mask and gown with non-disinfected hands be risky? So should I disinfect before and after entering the room? "
155,Side effects of genetically modified food products,"We are genetically modifying crops to change the way they look, to produce more out of less, or to make them resistant to certain diseases; they are subsequently being consumed by humans and animals.  What, if any, are the side effects or harmful effects on the human body caused by consuming these products? Does this include any long term health effects? "

158,Can strenuous or exhaustive exercises in old age weaken muscles like in post-polio syndrome?,"Can strenuous or exhaustive exercises in old age damage motor neurons like in post-polio syndrome?  Those with post-polio syndrome are advised to do moderate but not strenuous or exhaustive exercises. The concern is that it can damage the nerves. The theory is that when motor neurons enlarge too much, they can be overstressed and even killed. [website]Since aging leads to a loss of motor neurons and the enlargement of the surviving ones to reinnervate the orphaned muscle fibres, wouldn't improper exercises damage the neurons and increase weaknesses like in post-polio syndrome?

159,What is the name of term for series of studies for the same patient?,"If we have a series of assessment of lesion for some patient, how is it called in English? Looks like the study term is used for every single assessment(visit). How the whole series is called? "
160,breathing in versus injecting mercury (the gas),"Breathing in mercury is extremely bad and can have consequences for your whole remaining life.   It's the property of mercury to evaporate at room temperature, which is why it can get harmful so easily. Evaporated mercury gets breathed in, which then gets into the blood which then gets into the brain and can result in sleep dissorders, paralysis and so on.  But when it gets injected directly into the body - it gets directly into the blood and into the brain - what can be the causes of that? Or how harmful can it be when mercury gets injected (even in very small dosis)? "
161,What is the blood pressure within the right ventricle?,"The circulatory system can be divided into two cycles, a pulmonary circulation and a systemic circulation. As the right ventricle only needs to supply the lungs with deoxygenated blood, the muscle is much weaker.   Furthermore, because 10% of the blood serum gets absorbed into the lymphatic system in the capillaries and is only reabsorbed at the venous angle, the right ventricle effectively only needs to pump 90% of the blood through it.    The volumetric flow rate is proportional to the blood pressure, hence I would expect the blood pressure in the right ventricle to be lower than in the left ventricle (where it is standardly 120mmHg).   But how high is the blood pressure in the right ventricle effectively? Is it at 90% and thus 108mmHg?  "
162,Should ideal dietary fibre quantities relate to the amount of food one consumes?,"Typically advice seems (for the non-medical professional) to state recommended dietary fibre in absolute mass.  I wonder if it is more accurate to state recommended dietary fibre in terms of the quantity of food being eaten? Perhaps as a percentage of the mass?  The reasoning behind this is simply that dietary fibre seems less to do with obtaining nutrients, but more to do with the physical consistency of food / bolus / chyme. "
163,Fever and severe headache without inflammation markers,"What mechanisms can create fever and severe headaches lasting for a week and NOT be accompanied by any indication of inflammation in blood tests?  What diagnostic tests would be used to make a diagnosis, apart from a CT of the head and lumbar puncture? "
164,Energy value from food: is it the maximum avail?,"Long story short, is the energy value listed on the foods nutritional label a fixed value?    Food labels indicate macro-nutrients (carbs, proteins and fats). These values, in combination with the 4-4-9 system energy calculation, provides the total energy that 100g of that food can provide. This submit the assumption that all of those macro-nutrients will be burnt.  Talking about proteins: this kind of nutrients can be used as energy or building block for our bodies.    Does this mean energy value listed on the nutritional food label is only the maximum energy intake? that is, energy calculation should undergo taking into account proteins burning.    Or it is inconsequential? that is, whatever proteins destiny, our body extracts exactly that amount of energy. "
165,What to do if someone mistakenly ingests food contraindicated by medication requirements?,"In the past I have read a couple of times that one should not consume milk-based-products when taking certain medication for a certain amount of time before and after taking the product. To be a little bit more concrete, for certain types of Antibiotica this seems to be the case (Doxycyclin, etc.).   I'm of course completely fine with obeying that rule but as we're all humans and sometimes forget things, I wonder what I'm supposed to do if I accidentally drink a glass of milk and should take, let's say the Antibiotica, in the next hour. Should I run to my doctor? Or am I supposed to wait two/three hours and then take the medicine? Or should I just take it normally and hope that it works out?  I tried to look up the answer but besides some forum-posts there doesn't seem to be any kind of ""official"" statement (from a pharma company or something equivalent) about how to handle such a situation (or at least I wasn't able to find it).   Can someone maybe explain what the right reaction in such a case would be? "
166,Do medical laboratories determine accuracies for their blood tests?,"Do medical laboratories determine accuracies for their blood tests that have numerical results (as opposed to specificities and sensitivities for tests with binary results)?  If so, where can I find these accuracies?  If not, why not? "
167,What is the significance of 1 second in calculations of PFTs,"During PFTs (Pulmonary Function Testing), we take FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) and the divide it by FVC (Forced Vital Capacity).   What is so special about FEV in one second, as opposed to a different quantity of time? Why donât we measure FEV0.5 or FEV1.5? "
168,Ultrasound sniff test: why does lowering intrathoracic pressure collapse the subclavian vein?,"Because the subclavian is guarded by the clavicle, you can't compress it with the transducer, and to see the vessel walls come together it is common practice to tell the patient to ""sniff"" or inhale quickly. This rapid inhalation obviously reduces intrathoracic pressure. But why would reducing intrathoracic pressure cause the subclavian vein to collapse? Shouldn't it dilate when this happens? "
169,Is fibre an essential nutrient?,"Inuits' diet consists almost entirely of meat. As per my understanding, meat does not provide us with fibre and fibre is obtained from plant products only. Do the Inuits suffer from any malnutrition or digestion issues because of a lack of fibre in their diet? Have their digestive systems adapted to their diet or does the climate they live in have a role to play? If so, what would happen if an Inuit person changes to a ""mainstream"" diet that includes cereals and vegetables? What if a ""mainstream"" person goes vice versa? "
170,Are allergies due to memory T cells for benign antigens?,"If I understand correctly, the immune system reacts to infections by priming virgin helper T cells for the particular antigens exposed on the surface of the invader, leaving some memory T cells trained to trigger an attack on that antigen.  Am I correct in assuming that this same process can occur with benign allergens like fur, tree nuts and so on, to create memory T cells for these benign antigens, triggering an immune response on re-exposure? For example, exposure to soy at some point early in life resulting in creation of soy-adapted memory T cells, which trigger an immune reaction to soy upon re-exposure by eating it? "
171,What is the most potent method of scar resurfacing?,"For now, there are different methods of scar resurfacing:    Laser Fraxel Radio Frequency therapy CO2-Laser Microneedling with/without PRP Nd:YAG laser Dermabrasion/Microdermabrasion     Maybe some others? Which method of invasive scar treatments is more effective in minimizing scars and has fewer side effects? "

I tried looking for it using but couldn't see it. I tried eating bread with peanut butter, honey, salt water, dry rice, banana but nothing helped. The other stressful thing is that, i dont specifically know where its stuck, i cant feel the right place. I slept at night thinking I'd probably go away which was foolish of me. This morning, well i kinda feel like its in my ear like close to my ear. Is that possible? What should i do, any recommendations? Oh and someone said to try homeopathic medicine, does that work or sth?  "
175,How credible is negative result of allergic skin tests?,"Allergic tests performed a year ago confirmed I am not allergic to a cat. However, there a few signals that make me doubt in credibility of the test results:   I felt much better (less sneezing, less pain in sinuses) when I left my apartment, where I keep my cat, for two weeks vacations by the sea.  I also remember that a few days before allergic tests I had stopped taking calcium.  I have also read and heard from a colleague who had two cats that you might be allergic to one cat but not to the other, so my guess is that test results might really depend what allergen is used.   Hence, my question how credible is negative result of allergic skin tests?  Would it make sense to repeat the tests again? "
176,How to accurately monitor hair loss?,"I've been using Minoxidil for a while, and I just stopped recently. I couldn't see a difference in hair loss while taking a shower. But how can I be more certain about the change in hair loss? Pulling hair to see how strong they are? "
177,When is vitamin D released from fat?,"I understand that vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin, and that being overweight can adversely affect the availability of vitamin D in the body. It seems that having more fat on the body results in more removal of vitamin D from the bloodstream. If that vitamin is being stored in fat, when is it released, and is it equally effective when released? Can burning fat in the winter release vitamin D, and thus work to offset the vitamin D deficiency resulting from lack of available sunlight? "
178,How is it possible for someone to suffer repeated bouts of flu?,"About a month and a half ago I caught flu... recovered fairly quickly (2 days), and then 1 week later I caught another one, again, recovered even faster (just 1 day, a good night sleep) and a week ago I caught another one, this time it took me 2 days to combat it off.   I have read about it that there are only 2 strands of influenza, it is possible to get both strands, within relatively short time, but it is impossible to get the same strand within a limited time frame.  Yet here I was, catching flu again and again. What was going on? Did I catch flu of the same strand, only mutated?  "
179,Is nutritional values difference between uncooked and cooked (in water) food only due to the additional water absorbed?,"I noticed that there is a substantial difference between the nutritional values of some uncooked and cooked food.  For example, 100g of uncooked quinoa has:   368 kcal Carbohydrates 64g Fat 6g Protein 14g   while 100g of cooked quinoa has:   120 kcal Carbohydrates 21g Fat 2g Protein 4g   If I cook 100g of quinoa, the final weight will be maybe 300g because of the water absorption. But what about the nutrional values ? Will they decrease after the cooking ?  In other words, is the difference in nutrient content shown above due to a loss of nutrients or simply the weight change due to water absorption?  "
180,Location of olecranon,"I've read that your olecranon is the tip of your elbow.  But what about the point that I've marked with the green X on the below image?  If you were getting pain there, would it still be classed as olecranon pain? As to me it feels like my elbow, but it isn't quite the very tip of it.   "
181,Relationship between biological half-life and duration of action of a drug,"Wikipedia: Half-life describes the time it takes for the blood plasma concentration of a substance to halve its steady-state.   First, does this imply that the blood plasma concentration of a drug decrease exponentially? Secondly, what can be said about the change in activity/effectiveness of the drug by time? (I know SSRIs may work long after the drug is off the body) "
182,Would showering with germicidal water be beneficial or harmful?,"Suppose a device was able to make water remove 99.99 % of bacteria on the incident surface (assuming that the water is germicidal by itself, whatever the reason â e.g. by means of an additive which would have no other consequence).  Would it be beneficial or harmful to regularly shower with such waterÂ ?  The question is specifically about the whole body, as opposed to mere hand-washing, for which I think the benefits in terms of infection reduction are not disputable and would overcome any potential harmful effects on the skin microbiota.  NB : This is not a rhetorical question, some people actually claim their device is able to do so (I don't want to go into details in this particular question, but this cross-SE related question may help its understandingÂ : how much does sprayed water remove bacteriaÂ ?).

184,Possible side effects of deer antler velvet,My doctor suggested I try deer antler velvet. But I am not sure about it.  Does deer antler velvet have any side effects? Does it help growth? Are there any scientific studies about it? 
185,Food safety and implications of cooked food left un-refridgerated,"Expanding on the question here:  What are the health implications and safety hazards when one leaves food outside the fridge for longer periods (12-24hours for example) and how likely are those to happen? In essence, what are the risks short term or long term and how likely are those to occur approximately?  What is included in the high-risk food category described here at bulletin 2?  Assume a mainly pasta/legumes/vegetables cooked in oil-based diet(Mediterranean diet) primarily, well cooked and well heated prior to consumption again, with food being left outside of sun radiation and room temperatures of 5-20 Â°C (winter-summer) for the aforementioned time period. "
186,What is the bioavailability of collagen?,I am asking with respect to collagen ingested from your grocery store that comes in dried packets or containers.    Is the collagen completely destroyed and denatured in the stomach with the acidic PH? If the collagen passes through the lining of the stomach into the blood stream or what percent of collagen moves into the small intestine? From there what percentage of collagen moves across the small intestine lining into the blood stream (still intact/ not denatured) What percentage then of gelatin/collagen crosses the cellular membrane (if any?).  What percentage of collagen within the cells is then used building blocks for supporting a collagen matrix in each part of the body.  What percentage of collagen matrix survives and receives long lasting ingrown vasculature to support the tissue for the long run?  
187,Is the appearance of food (as fresh or spoiled) a good guide to its actual condition?,"I assume that whenever the foods that we like to eat are close to room temperature, microbes are always growing in them. At some point in this continuum, the food looks, tastes or smells spoiled; and some point in the continuum, the food becomes unhealthful.  How is it that these moments coincide? Why doesn't one milestone arrive first, producing good food that looks bad or bad food that looks good? "
188,How low can you go on a low salt diet?,"I'm sensitive to salt and am considering doing a salt-free diet. Is it ok if I remove salt and seasonings from my diet and cooking altogether? Will the sodium content of natural foods like oats, milk, fruits and chicken be enough to sustain long-term health? "
189,ABO blood type mismatch,"  I have a question about blood types and seeming hereditary contradictions.  The above image of an Eldoncard blood test, which shows quite clearly that the testee has AB- type blood. (see image!). The sample comes from a person that has a father with blood type A (known from military), and a mother that has blood type O- (known from being a blood donor).   So the question is: how can a person have AB- in this situation (Mother with O-)?  There are a couple of possible scenarios:   The Eldoncard ABO Rhesus D-test could be wrong, and the testee could have another blood type. The mother could have a weak manifestation of the B subtype, something which would show her as being O- while in fact being bO-, thus having been misdiagnosed as O- The father could actually have AB blood type, and in some rare circumstances, there have been examples of inheritance of blood type coming from only one parent.    Secondary question, though: If the mother has a weak manifestation of the B subtype, and this is how the testee got one B from her, wouldn't also they also have a weak manifestation of the B subtype - example Ab?  For the purposes of the question, assume that both parents are in fact the genetic parents of the testee. "
190,Why does anybody still prescribe Citalopram with Escitalopram available (apart from price)?,"As far as I could find Escitalopram is superior in every way, except for the US price (which might no longer even be the case).

191,Are toxins being released when one sweats during sickness?,"I am getting over the flu that is prevalent in California right now.  The last two nights, I have awakened with my t-shirt quite wet. It seems as if I'm sweating rather profusely from my chest to my stomach. This did not happen the worst days of my illness, just these last two when I am close to being recovered.  My assumption (I am no expert in medical things, by any means, though) is that this is from toxins which are being eliminated from my system.  Is my assumption correct? If so, exactly which organs are the ones doing the toxin eviction?  Note: I have noticed this in the past during bouts of illness, too, but this time I am moved to ask about it. "
192,Allergy to Vicryl Sutures,"strong text Can a person be allergic to Vicryl sutures used internally as part of surgery?  I had carpal tunnel surgery and the surgeon used Vicryl sutures inside my hand. After the surgeon removed the exterior sutures, I was still having problems with the wound healing. After another week or so, I noticed something on my palm at the incision site. I picked at the spots and something poked out of the tissue that looked black. I used a pair of tweezers to remove the black thing, which turned out to actually be a purple string. Then I pulled out 3 or 4 more purple threads from the wound area. At this point in time, the area of the incision did not appear to be healing. It looked like the end of a sausage casing that had been over-stuffed with sausage. After removal of the purple threads, the wound continued to heal normally. Was this an allergic reaction? How can I avoid this happening in future surgeries? "

194,Is the interaction between alcohol and benzodiazepines additive or multiplicative?,"There is a common saying that alcohol and benzodiazepines shouldn't be consumed together. Is it because alcohol and benzo have a synergistic effect? Or is it simply because alcohol and benzo are similar, and taking alcohol and benzo together is like taking a large quantity of benzo? "

196,Antihypertensive as a treatment for Tourette's. (And Antihypotensive to make blood pressure normal?),"So...I'm 30 years old and have Tourette's syndrome since 9. I never took any medication because most of then are antipsychotics and have very scary side-effects.  Now, apparentely some antihypertensive can help too. Not as much as the anti-psychotics but they can help. And with much less side effects too.  However, they obviously lower your blood pressure, (that's what they are made for after all) so if your pressure is average it will drop.  My question is: Is it Possible/Safe/Reasonable to take some medication to increase your blood pressure, so it returns to normal? If not, and one just have to deal with low blood-pressure...How to deal with low blood-pressure?  "

198,Can the blood accumulated after stroke be cured?,"Recently my uncle had a stroke. He is now in rest and taking medicine.  He has his right leg paralyzed, although the condition is improving.   The doctor said that ""blood is accumulated in the brain"".  Someone told me that the accumulated blood will not cure totally. But I thought, taking proper medicine can remove the blood.   What does having a stroke mean? What are the outcomes of strokes? Are there any medications to take in case of a stroke?   EDIT: Here the findings from the CT Scan ""Subacute infarction in left middle cerebral artery territory"" "

Now, I don't consume a lot of caffeine (I don't drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks), but I do have like a Mountain Dew every other day. Is this a safe thing to do since I take Dexadrine? Or do they not mix well together? What are the dangers? "
202,Is there an objective answer to whether or not taking a multi-vitamin dietary supplement is beneficial to health?,"I understand that diet, habits and lifestyles differ preposterously across different countries and different people. Of late, there has been an increasing trend among people to take multi-vitamin tablets as a daily dietary supplement.  Is there any actual benefit of taking it? Assuming that people normally eat a balanced vegetarian diet, I think the only justification for taking these could be that they aren't deriving all the essential nutrients from fruits and vegetables alone. Could the gradual degradation of environment over time be a reason for that?  Edit  The answers so far suggest that the evidence in this direction gathered by most studies is inconclusive at best. However, I am still interested to know about any more studies and data, be it for efficacy of supplements or degradation of nutrients in plants, just for the sake of completion. "
203,Puncturing a vein vs. an artery,"I was recently with my grandmother at the Emergency Department because she had difficulty breathing.  After the clinical examination by a doctor, she received both an artery and a vein puncture.  Why is it necessary to take blood from a vein and an artery? The puncture in the artery looked pretty painful so why isn't the vein puncture sufficient?  "
204,is saltwater bad or good for your skin?,"After swimming into the sea, is it better take shower immediately or wait several hours?  I found this on yahoo.anwers:     Best Answer:  Salt water can dry up the natural oils in your skin, and   this in turn can lead to boils and pimples. When you have been in the   sea, you need to wash off the salt as soon as you can, and as you so   rightly say, not showering fo a week is gross.   But livestrong says:     The magnesium in seawater may also help hydrate and improve the   appearance of your skin. According to a study in the February 2005   edition of the âInternational Journal of Dermatology,â bathing in a   magnesium-rich Dead Sea salt solution helps promote skin moisture.   People with atopic dry skin, or dryness on the skinâs surface,   submerged one forearm for 15 minutes in a bath solution containing 5   percent Dead Sea salt and the other forearm in regular tap water.   Researchers discovered that the salt solution improved skin hydration   and significantly reduced skin inflammation symptoms such as redness   and roughness when compared to tap water. Observed skin benefits were   attributed to the high magnesium content of the Dead Sea salt.   I think that latter is correct, but just need confirmation. "
205,Is one nit enough to produce a new generation of head lice?,"The website below claims that one nit is sufficient to produce a new generation of head lice.  Liceguard Link     Regardless of which treatment you apply, it is recommendable to remove all (or as many as possible) nits from the scalp, since even one nit is enough to produce a new generation of parasites, and the process itself is faster and more secure if you are get rid of lice and nits at the same time.   I wanted to ask if this is really true? Surely either a pregnant female louse or BOTH a male and female must be present in order for a new generation of head lice to occur? "
206,"Are low amounts of caffeine, e.g. Coke, bad for IBS? If so, advice on how IBS sufferers can get a burst of energy?","I unfortunately, am one of the many that suffer from IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). I also have the luck of suffering from fibromyalgia (so I have chronic fatigue), but I have a very demanding job and life so sometimes I a get a little help from my friend, aka Coca Cola. However, I heard rumors that caffeine consumption can irritate the bowels and make IBS symptoms all the more worse. AH! I think I have noticed this personally. (But wasn't sure if it's all in my head because I heard the rumor). Any way, what is a person with low-energy and IBS suppose to do?   Any suggestions?  "
207,Are PCOS & endometriosis linked? How to know if menstrual pain is atypical to warrant testing?,"I was diagnosed with PCOS about 5 years ago and take Metformin for it (although the symptoms are still at large). But lately, despite taking birth control, my period causes me an immense amount of fatigue both the week before and during, causes an extreme amount of heavy bleeding that last for about 7 days, and of course comes with abdominal pains (cramping, bloating, diarrhea), but the worst is the vicious nausea and vomiting. Occassionally, I get two periods a month, which means I'm sick the entire month. Are these symptoms of PCOS or could it also be related to endometriosis?   If you have PCOS are you more likely to have endometriosis?   How do you know if your pain is atypical? Because all women suffer from their periods, and it's a pain for everyone so I don't want to appear like a hypochondriac if I approach my doctor about this (because I do have a lot of other conditions).  While doing an ultrasound for something else, they did note that I had an anteverted uterus (but I don't think that's worrisome), but also that I had a 2.2 x 2 cm cyst on my right ovary. The report said it was benign, but that seems awfully large and could be causing me a lot of pain? Is that normal? And how do they know it's benign? Is this all PCOS stuff or is it endometriosis too?  "

What are the typical, common, top medications used to treat the symptoms of Lupus? Thanks!  "
209,Dataset for Tele-medicine Vital Signs,"I'm a newbie to medical and healthcare informatics. I need to access some raw telemedicine dataset including vital signs for a single person over a specific period of time. Basically my questions are:   How many possible vital signs can be measured, say in an emergency ambulance transfer? E.g. Heart Rate, SpO2, Co2, RR, etc. What are the possible size and bitrate requirement for each? For this, if we have the dataset, we can calculate the size/time_period to get the bitrate.   Any advise on how to get these information? "

211,Why does my nose run like a faucet when I'm outside in blustery wet weather?,"What about cold blustery wet weather makes my nose run like crazy? I've read online that it's because the air is dry... but I live in Vancouver and it's super damp here so I'm not sure that's why my nose runs like crazy when I'm outside walking in the wet and windy weather. Is it because of seasonal allergies?   When I'm inside it's not running at all... but outside, it's like flipping an ""on"" switch.  How does blustery wet weather make one's nose runny?  "
212,What is the recommended dosage of 5000 mcg Vitamin B-12,"I brought these vitamin B12 capsules from Costco    The supplements panel says its okay to take one tablet daily    but I am worried since 1 tablet has a whooping 83333% or as much as 833 times the daily value.

214,Wrist pain when bent back,"I get quite a strong pain in my wrist when I bend it back, or play a wrist-intensive sport like squash, but the rest of the time my wrist is OK and my fingers don't feel any different either.  The pain is most severe when my wrist is in this position, with the painful area circled in red:    ... so it is bent back and something is having to support it from moving any further.  For example, leaning against a wall with that hand is quite painful.  The pain is along the top of the wrist, somewhat on the ulnar side although radiating out to the whole wrist to some extent.  Is this likely to be damage to the triangular fibrocartilage?  From looking online that seems the most likely explanation.  If so what is best to heal it?  It has been this way for a few weeks now. "
215,Wearing an underware or not - which makes the hypersensitivity on your glans gone faster?,"For an adult male who got an operation on a phimotic penis, the hypersensitivity on the glans would keep tormenting him for a while.  But after you finish the period of putting a bandage on your penis, will having your penis outside to expose it to the air make it faster to have your penis less sensitive to an stimulation, than keeping wearing an underware? If you want to get accustomed to the hypersensitivity on your glans faster, which is the better way? "
216,Seeing through objects,"Recently I found out that my eyesight is slightly different than most people I know. It's rather hard to explain, so I hope it makes sense.  I see through all objects. All day. All the time. When I put my finger about 30cm away from my face and I focus on a point behind my finger, I see my finger twice, without having to concentrate on it. It is not possible for me in any way other than closing one eye to see my finger 'blurry' and 'centered' like how it would be considered normal I guess? The problem is that this happens all day. Everything I do all day is focussing on stuff which makes everything between me and that object 'transparent' and makes me see it twice.  A good example is playing pool. When I look at the ball I am going to want to pot, I see my cue and the white ball 'double' and am unable to make the shot. When I focus on the white ball, the ball I want to pot is 'double' and I can not get a clear 'line' of where the ball will go.  I only found out recently that this is not a normal way of seeing things, and I can not seem to find anything related to this topic on the internet. My questions are:   'Is this normal?' 'Is this dangerous?' 'Should I do anything about it?'  "
217,Can some adoptive mothers induce lactation to breastfeed their adoptive infants?,"I had always thought that the options for breastfeeding an adoptive infant were to hire wet nurses or retrieve breast milk from milk banks (otherwise adoptive infants were fed by baby formula). It hadn't even crossed my mind that in some circumstances, adoptive mothers were capable of inducing lactation by breast-pumping.    Obviously, emphasis on the ""some"" as I know not all women are not capable of inducing lactation in order to produce breast milk. However, must a woman had previously given birth to a child in order to induce lactation?     Also, when an adoptive mother is able to induce lactation for their adoptive infant, are they able to produce colostrum, the first most nutritious (full of antibodies) secretion from the breast? Or is this only produced when the body is actually preparing to give birth to a baby?   How are they able to induce lactation? "
218,Can I get chickenpox from meeting someone who lives with someone else with chickenpox?,"Title mostly says it all. I've never had chickenpox. I was given chickenpox vaccine shots twice, once as an infant, and once at around 12-13 years old. I am now 23 years old. Am I safe? Or should I not meet this person until the other person (a 5 year old child, being cared for NOT by the person I might meet) has recovered? I'm not pregnant or otherwise in a category that should NOT risk chickenpox even a tiny bit, but obviously I'd rather avoid getting it.  I am asking both, the contagiousness of a housemate of a sick person, and whether my vaccinations are still effective (I understand it can't be 100% guaranteed). "
219,hip replacement - above titanium?,"Hey everybody I got back from a visit with an orthopedic this morning and we're talking about a getting a hip replacement and he mentioned some a hip replacement material that is up one level above Titanium on the periodic table.  he mention the name a couple times and I can't remember what it is does anyone know?  Update:  I stopped by the Surgeons office again and left him a message.  He called back saying it's above the Periodic scale than Titanium - so I believe it's what Bill Oertel had thought on the atomic number.  It's called     Trabecular Metal   made out of Tantalum.  I recall him saying it was fairly new and I remember it wasn't an option when I looked to have the hip replaced almost 7 years ago.  I did see this quote.     Although the high biocompatibility and passive characteristics of   tantalum have been documented long ago, its cost and methods of   production have limited its use until recently   So maybe that's what he meant, I don't know.  At any rate, looks like it's good I waited the 7 years. "

I would like to mount a filter on the objective of my microscope to reduce the risk of injuries, but there are different kind of filters depending on the spectrum. I could not find any trivial information telling if one should filter the blue in the visible spectrum, UVA, UVB or UVC?  So, for which kind of UV should the filter be, and if for all three, does this imply a multi-coated filter? "
226,Incidence of anisakidosis in Japan,"In Japan where raw fish are frequently eaten with no anti-parasite processing the infection of the nematode Anisakiasis became a required reportable diagnosis in 2012. Nevertheless, only 89 cases were reported in 2013. According to a study on the subject they claimed that health insurance records suggested over 7000 cases ([website]This seems to be a huge divergence in numbers.  I guess there are two things I don't understand. If it is required to report it, how could they have only 89 reported cases but 7000+ ""insurance"" cases? The other thing I don't understand is that another study I read found Anisakiasis infection in 20% of the mackerels that they examined. If the nematode is so prevalent, shouldn't people in Japan be getting sick on a much larger scale? I mean there are millions of people in Japan eating raw mackerel. If 20% of that mackerel has Anisakiasis larva, then shouldn't we be seeing hundreds of thousands of cases of human infection, not just 7000 or 89? "

229,Why do my hair and scalp feel greasy and itchy until I shower?,"I've recently noticed that I have dry, itchy skin - particularly on my shins and ankles - and I think this may be caused by the warm-to-hot 10 minute showers I have every morning. The problem is that if I don't have these showers, my hair will feel greasy as soon as I wake up until I've had a shower. It's a hard sensation to describe, but it also feels like I'm very acutely aware of the hairs on my scalp, as well as the skin on my face. This is such an uncomfortable position to be in that it prevents me from getting anything done.  Is this normal to feel after a shower? If not, what could be the cause of it, and how can I be free of it? "
230,Hot water burn management,"Background: In an attempt to relieve hemorroids I hurt myself with hot water on the buttocks near crack area, this started only two days ago. The burn area is not exceeding width of two fingers on each cheek, mostly inside the folded cheeks area and not on the exposed cheeks. Burn is red and painful but no blisters, with painful tingling, yet pain is relatively controlled with non-steroidal analgesics. When I clean the burn in the morning it sheds very little blood on the cleaning tissue but bloods stops after I gently swap the burn 2-3 times. I am avoiding sitting down or laying on my back as it worsen the pain.  Question 1: is this a second degree burn? I clean with saline and apply antibiotic cream three times daily, is this enough?  Should I also apply an antibiotic spray and or any steroidal cream? Question 2: I can't cover the burn given difficulty of making the dressing stable with every movement, is this ok? "
231,What is a Lymph Node Collection,"I'm looking at my results from a C/T I had a year ago, because my doctor wants to get another since my lymph node is still enlarged. When I looked at the results I saw     The right axillary region shows small bone lymph node collection measuring 2.1 cm x 1 cm collectively.    When these results came back, my doctor said everything looked fine. In the little research that I've done it looks like anything over 2 cm is cause for concern, but that was specifically about lymph nodes. So my question is, what is a lymph node collection, or even more specifically what is a bone lymph node collection. Is that different than a single lymph node? What is the normal size range? "
232,How common is it for women in their 20's to have a BRCA gene test conducted?,"If women in their 20's do have concerns or family history of having breast cancer, can they request to have the brca-gene-test done??   How rare is it for women that young to ask for that? Or is it only in special circumstances where doctors suspect it that doctors make the referral for the brca gene test?     I'm not worried about me as I'm fairly certain breast cancer doesn't run in my family -- I think it's just coincidental my grandmothers on either side of the family battled breast cancer late in their lives (my mother is currently in her 60's and doesn't have breast cancer).  I'm just curious who is tested for brca gene mutations and how medical practitioners make that decision. "
233,How to calculate nutrition fact?,"I'm not sure i'm posting on the right place and I don't really know what it is called.  I just wondering. How the cuurent food company calculated the nutrition information of they food?

It should not the same on the nutrition count. Right? Anyone can answer? Sorry for my English, hope you still can get what I mean. "
234,Swallowed very little and porous plastic parts. Might it be dangerous?,"I ate something with my headphones on, and after eating I noticed that the ear speaker lose their covering film. I noticed as after lunch I touched them and had little black particles of the cover in my hand (guess this is due to the aging of the plastic film). Then I noticed them also on my desk, so surely some of them might haven fallen on my lunch, or even I had some on my fingers before.  Now I am concerned that I have eaten some of these plastic parts. They are very thin and not hard, so they might get resolved in my stomach acid (and do not pass through as I had written elsewhere when plastic gets swallowed).  How harmful might that be? That my body might absorb little fragments and particles of plastic?? "
235,Eating ice-cream for breakfast may improve mental performance & alertness? Legit?,"First, before I get slammed by everyone for this seemingly ""outrageous"" question -- I have to say, I am highly doubtful and leery of this claim, which is why I'm asking. Actually, I am fairly certain this claim is wrong just based on all the recent studies done on sugar recently and the lack of data in this supposed study, but I would welcome being ""wrong"" in this case. haha. (like I need another excuse to eat ice cream?)  My friend is currently in a nutritionist course while at college (though it's a 100 level course), and she very briefly reiterated to me a lecture her prof gave wherein he talked about how eating ice cream could actually improve mental concentration if eaten in the morning? I pressed for more details, but she had finals and was in a hurry... but she very quickly dished out this ""study"": International Business Times: Eating Ice-Cream for Breakfast May Improve Mental Alertness...But, as you can see, there really isn't an explanation or much details.   So, let's say if this study were to be true, how does this ice cream improve mental performance? And what are alpha waves, and how do they relate to this discussion?  Also, does anyone have more details on this study? "
236,"What factors, beside blood-type, are considered a ""good match"" for organ transplants?","Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match; find me a find; catch me a catch!   I know there are probably a whole litany of factors that are considered to match organ donors with those needing organs so that the transplant is not rejected. What are these factors?   Blood type is obvious (as well as medical history to alcohol and substance abuse, etc). What else? Age plays a role depending on what is being donating, but not on everything, right? Does gender matter? What else?  Are organs transported on dry ice to keep them as viable as long as possible? What is the means by which they are transported? How long from death or extraction to transplant does it take? (I'm assuming the type of donation/transplant matters... but let's just throw kidney as an example).  "
237,Can using moisturiser make acne worse?,"Over the last few weeks, I've started breaking out with medium-to-severe acne, and in an attempt to clear it up in the short-term I've been using the T-Zone Skin Clearing Face Moisturiser. However, I'm not sure if it's making any difference, and it may even be making it worse.  Is it possible for a moisturiser to make acne worse?  Additionally, as a longer term solution, in the last few days I've started a 2-3 month course of antibiotics prescribed my doctor to clear the acne up. Should I be able to use this particular moisturiser and antibiotics simultaneously without any problems, or must I only use one? "
238,Reddened in the face / red skin in the face,"i have red skin in my face since a couple months. I thought it is coming from drinking because I spent like 3 weeks drinking every second day with a friend who visited me and afterwards I got problems with my skin, as well this reddening.  I have it for months now and the dermatologist told me to use something to heal tissue and to apply basically sun lotion. Well I did that for 10 days straight i applied a sun cream and the healing lotion, and I still look like this.  any wild ideas what else it could be?  yes yes, seek help from a professional yeah right, I have another appointment soon. But each doctor tends to say something else, and I wanted to see here if someone has advice /  a wild guess.  So: I lately got a bit of dermatitis / neurodermitis again, a disease I used to have a lot more when I was a baby. Now I barely ever get it.   it looks like sun burn to me, but I am almost never in the sun (I am a programmer, food delivers at noon to my place typically). If someone would tell me sun burn -> i would tell him that it might be the lack of sun, but not sun burn for sure.  i have a new notebook since a couple months. Can it be the light emitted by the screen? probably not because I read flatscreens do not emit UV.  Food?  "
239,What are some of the risks associated with Septoplasty?,"I was experiencing nasal blockage for years and I've basically tried everything imaginable. Nasal drainage, nasal sprays (both prescription strength and over the counter), pills, breath-rite etc...And those they do help somewhat relieve the blockage a little, after an hour, it's back to square one.   One of my nasal passages is ALWAYS blocked and it rotates between the two. I recently went to an ENT to have it checked and he informed me I had a deviated septum. He recommended have it corrected through surgery (in-office procedure)   So what are the risks associated with this surgery? What's the average recovery time? I've never had surgery before so this will be my first time under the knife so I would love to here from people who've had this procedure and give me their in site! "

242,Are marshmallows an effective remedy for sore throats?,"Over the weekend, I developed an intense sore throat, (it may well be strep throat -- results are pending). Anyway, I've been looking for any and all means to help ease the pain, and my boyfriend came across several articles indicating that marshmallows might help. One such articles is here: 14 Ways to Soothe a Sore Throat     Although there's no hard evidence that it works, sap from the   marshmallow plant has been used for hundreds of yearsâusually in tea   formâto treat coughs, colds, and sore throats. And while real   marshmallow bears little relation to the puffy campfire treats that   took its name, both may have sore throat-fighting properties.      According to anecdotal reports, modern-day marshmallows can help ease   sore throat pain, possibly because the gelatin coats and soothes.   ""It's not the wackiest thing in the world,"" Dr. Linder says. ""If your   throat is really swollen and it really hurts to swallow anything, I   can see how something slippery and sweet like marshmallows might   provide some relief.""   While it is clear that marshmallow roots would be much more effective than the sugary marshmallow puffs, I was wondering if gelatin properties or if any properties left of a marshmallow puff are still helpful nevertheless? Or is it all a placebo?   (I do not have marshmallows at my home and have not tested it personally).  "
243,Nootropics for epileptics,"Hello guys!  I'm epileptic and last months I have some problems with my attention and my memory. Another problem is, I'm from Russia and we don't have here good pills or really qualified doctors and medication service. I mean we have no chargeable insurance, you need to pay for all. And if you can't, there are free service, worse than which only service in Africa... Probably.  So, I wanna to start using nootropics. But almost every medication has notice, that it can gives side effects for my disease.  Actually, I would like to use ""Adderal"", 'cause of amphetamine inside 'cause it steals all your attention whatever you do. And this would really helpful for me. But we don't have it here free for sale (to be honest, there is absolutely no drug here as I think, only strange online pharmacies sells it).  So, I wanna combine some local nootropics with amphetamine if it would possible.  There are 4 questions:  Is it possible? Will it give the same effect as Adderall? What is the probability that nootropics give side effects on epilepsy? How will the probability increase if I mix nootropics with amphetamine?  P.S. I use ""Topiramate"" for now (the best medication for me).  Before I used ""Lamotrigine"" (worse) and before that I used ""Depakine chrono"" (""Valproic acid"" is active substance as I know, that was the worst and the most expensive), which didn't help me at all.

245,Derivation of 175 in MDRD Equation,"So the MDRD equation (The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) estimates glomerular filtration using the formula:   eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (SCr)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if African American)  Now I know the age, race, and sex parameters are based off of population data, but how is the 175 derived? Is it just a constant that makes the equation work, and if so, why not use different exponential values?  "
246,Bad Breath Problem,"I saw a similar question like this on here but I don't think there was a solid answer. I have a terrible problem where I have bad breath all day especially in the morning but I don't know how to stop it. I am 17. I already:   Have regularly brushed my teeth twice a day since I was 14 (before that too of course but not always regularly) Have never smoked anything I don't drink Just got my teeth cleaned at dentist (not surface clean but deep) and I was at the recommended plaque index level  My diet is very healthy, I almost never eat out or eat junk food   I may be a little dehydrated during the day because I sometimes only drink 4 or 5 cups of water in a day but I tried drinking more than 8 at even spaced intervals one day and it didn't help, I just had to use the bathroom more.  I am really desperate to get rid of this problem. Sometimes when I floss a little blood appears but not much. Could I have gum disease? Could anybody advise what there is left to do?  "

248,Longs Term Effects and Impact of Masturbation,"So, I'm bringing a kind of sensitive topic to here. Usually there are lots of articles on the web saying that masturbation is a good stress-relief mechanism and that it can avoid some kinds of prostate cancer and some other good things.  However  based on my own experience (and some friends too) long term masturbation doesn't seem to be that good at all. From my personal case I can say if I masturbate 2 or 3 times a day and keep it for more than a week I feel the following:   I'm always tired and lack energy; I work less efficiently;  I have a shorter temper, don't really have head to deal with anything;  Always bored;  It no longer gives me pleasure; Ruins my sexual life;  Lack of sexual desire; More passive than active behavior; No longer have self-discipline; Completely drained.   Why does this happen, is there any specific research on this subject?  Does this happen because I'm stimulating way too much the ""reward""-center of the brain or because in the process of the ejaculation I'm taking a lot of proteins and chemicals out of my body that need to be produced / acquired again?  Are there any long terms effects of this one might experience?   Note: I actually stopped masturbating on my freshman years when I had issues getting achieving an erection. After few weeks everything was normal again. "
249,How to cope with the pressure in an exam?,"I am willing to do Research in a particular subject. In order to pursue it I will have to qualify a competitive exam.  I have attempted it 2 times but failed. The reason for the failure is not that I don't study properly but the problem is whenever I see the problems in the exam, I feel as if I would not be able to do it or even if I do it the answers to most of them are wrong.  But the surprising fact is when I come back home and then try them I seem to be doing a different paper. All the problems are easily solved and they seem so easy that I can even see the answers verify that I have done them wrong in the exam.  The same happens during the interview. I fail to answer the easy questions.  The problem is that this phenomenon is repeated several times.  What shall I do? Is any advice available? I could not find a better place than this to ask this question.Is this site suitable for this? Please help. "
250,cigarette vs exhaust gas,"People always associate pollution to cars, but as a frequent biker, I don't really smell anything from exhaust pipes for all 'recent' cars.   When a car passes me, I can always know by the smell if the driver were smoking or not (and I systematically try to hold breath and anticipate that), I can also smell some other odors of the inside of the car, but I don't smell the exhaust pipe gases.   I'm wondering if I'm alone in that case, is it normal? I'm quite paranoiac when it comes to breathing cigarette smoke, so I don't know if it affects only me.  I've searched and posted other threads concerning tobacco smoke, and I'm convinced the amount of tobacco smoke on  a road is not insignificant compared to gas exhaust, of course it's less, but it represents more than 1% (at least here in France) and it's really concentrated when you're in. Smoking tends to generate a lot more particles than people think 1, 2, and possibly more toxic ones 3, 4, 5  So is my case 'normal'? Am I alone to smell the cigarette smoke trails in the traffic (on a bike I mean, for those of you that sometimes do bike, I don't think I'd smell them if I were in a car too)? Is it worse to smell those concentrated shot of toxic cigarette smoke or the more dilluted thin particle of exhaust gas? "
251,"Are ""Class 2"" prescription TENS units any better than OTC TENS units?","I have been prescribed a TENS unit for pain.  TENS stands for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation.  The medical equipment company is planning on selling me a Compass Health (aka Roscoe Medical) TENS DT-3002 unit.  The details of the unit can be seen here: [website]The description of that unit calls it a ""Class 2"" unit and states that a prescription is required (which I have).  For about the same amount of money, I can buy any number of OTC TENS units that look a lot nicer and have great reviews (although some of the reviews could be ""paid"" reviews).  For example, the #1 selling unit on Amazon is currently [website]Are there therapeutic advantages to the ""Class 2"" TENS units that require a prescription, when compared to OTC units like the example provided (or other OTC products)?

252,Will using fluoride-free toothpaste eventually lead to tooth decay?,"I've been using fluoride-free toothpaste for about a year now:  [website]While I'm not necessarily averse to fluoride - at least when used topically on the teeth - I'm skeptical of the safety of many chemicals used in typical brands of household products. This toothpaste seems to have safe ingredients, and it's pleasant to use and effective in keeping my mouth clean. I'd still use it if it contained fluoride, but I have yet to find a  ""healthy"" toothpaste that does.  Based on my research, it seems to be the consensus in dentistry that topical fluoride is a necessary part of maintaining tooth enamel. If I otherwise keep good dental habits, can I skip the fluoride and still maintain healthy enamel over the course of my lifetime? Or, should I look for a fluoride rinse, and would that be an effective replacement for toothpaste containing fluoride? "
253,Are homemade toothpastes as effective as industrial toothpastes?,"There are a lot of recipes in the internet of homemade toothpastes (see this link or this link as examples).  Most of the recipes remark the benefits of using these toothpastes to promote remineralization. I've just started trying on of these clay-based toothpastes and I was wondering two things.  First, are they as effective in terms of dental hygiene a industrial toothpastes?  Second, are there any health hazards regarding this toothpastes?  P.S. I don't know if I should post this as one or two different questions.  "
254,Can you cauterize a wound with gunpowder?,"This question is based off a scene in The Revenant.  In it, a character has a deep laceration across their throat which has been hastily stitched up.  Upon drinking some water, they find that it passes straight through the stitched-up wound.    The solution presented in the film is to rub some gunpowder (assuming period accuracy, this would be early 1800's black powder, not the modern stuff) into the wound and then ignite it.  Presumably to seal the wound more completely by cauterizing it.  Which leads to my question; are there any documented clinical examples of people cauterizing actual wounds using gunpowder, and if so what was the outcome?  Is gunpowder a plausible method of closing a wound if/when no other alternatives are readily available? "
255,Is E. coli contagious?,"I have a girl that I'm seeing. She was just in the hospital about 2 weeks ago with an internal E.coli infection in her kidney (she had the other kidney removed due to cancer). She has been given a ton of antibiotics because it was a very strong strain and it took her quite a bit of treatment to get over it.   Is E. coli contagious? Am I putting myself at any risk with dating activities like kissing, oral sex, sex, etc? I really didn't know you could get E. coli in your kidneys and I have no idea what that means for me as her partner.  "
256,Maximum safe dosage of zinc for 4-6 weeks,"After refractive surgery, the doctor suggested taking 1000mg of vitamin C daily to help minimize scarring.  When I went to pick up the vitamins, I also noticed that there was a supplement claiming to be designed to support eye health that also included vitamin C.  Specifically, it has:   250mg vitamin C 200 IU vitamin E 40mg zinc (as 50mg zinc oxide) 1mg copper   ...per tablet.  The recommended dosage is 1 tablet/day, and I'd have to take 4 times that amount to get 1000mg of vitamin C/day.    From what I can determine 800 IU of vitamin E and 4 mg copper are within safe/tolerable limits, however 160mg of elemental zinc is quite high.  There are only a few conditions I can find where dosages around that level are recommended for therapeutic purposes:   Acne (for up to 8 weeks) Wilson's disease (ongoing) Macular degeneration (ongoing)   So my question is, what's the safe maximum dosage of zinc over a course of 4-6 weeks?  From what I can find, it seems like the biggest risk is that high dosages of zinc lead to copper deficiency (hence why it's used to as a treatment for Wilson's disease).  Does it therefore follow that 160mg/day should be okay as long as it's supplemented with some extra copper and not continued on a long-term basis? "
257,Can eating chalk cause very low level haemoglobin level?,"My friend has a haemoglobin level of 6 g/dl. She eats a lot of chalk. The doctor said that the chalk accumulation is hindering the production of haemoglobin. Does that make sense, or there might be a deeper cause for the severely low Hb levels?   In particular, is it okay to trust the doctor's opinion about her chalk intake affecting the production of Hb? "
258,Can pathogens be transmitted from smelling something?,"Long story short, when visiting neighbors the other day, a young child playing outside in the lawn stepped in some fresh animal fecal matter,  and not knowing what it was, ended up taking off their shoe and put it within about 2 inches from their face to sniff it.  The mother panicked, and after two calls to both poison control and the pediatrician, was told by both that as long as the child hadnât swallowed any of the fecal matter, there was no need to worry about anything.  This made me curious.  By putting something as pathogen-laden as animal fecal matter (or vomit, etc) that close to your face smelling it, wouldnât you essentially be inhaling all kinds of bacteria, viruses, parasites, etc, assuming they were present?  Or is the vacuum created by smelling something at that distance not strong enough to do this?   "
259,100% Witch Hazel or 86% for face?,"I used 100% and I ran out. I just now went to Walmart and bought some and saw later it was 86% Witch Hazel with 14% alcohol, not the 100% like I had. The 100% bottle also said it contained 14% alcohol (I didn't throw it away yet).   Are these the same, just different marketing? If not, which should I use? "
260,What are the downsides of autologous tenocyte implantations?,"I have read a couple of research articles that seem to be quite laudative toward autologous tenocyte implantation (ATI):   (1) presents a successful recovery for partial-thickness rotator cuff tear and tendinopathy in an elite athlete using ATI. (2) lists a few upsides / positive findings:      The efficacy of tendon cell use for tendon repair has been verified in a number of in vitro and animal studies, (33-35). Animal studies have revealed   that implantation of in vitro-expanded autologous tenocytes improved the tendon structure and facilitated the healing process in both an acute   tendon tear model, (33) and a chronic degenerative tendon disease model, (35).    Clinical applications of Ortho-ATI injections have demonstrated reduced pain and inflammation, restoration of fibre structure, reduction in vascular   hyperplasia, and improved cellular morphology. This indicates that injection of in vitro-expanded autologous tenocytes alters the progression of   tendinopathy. (35)""  (3) also only contains positive results, though I have only be able to access the abstract so far (despite my university library paying millions of USD every year for journal subscriptions, and asking a colleague of mine working in one of the largest French medical university):      The mean final follow-up time for the remaining 15 patients was 4.51 years (range, 3.08-5.17 years). No complications were observed at the patellar tendon biopsy site for any patient. No adverse events, infection, or excessive fibroblastic reactions were observed in any patient at the injection site. Clinical evaluation revealed significant (P &lt; .001) improvement in mean VAS pain score from 5.73 at initial assessment to 1.21 (78% improvement) at final follow-up. Mean QuickDASH, UEFS, and grip strength scores also significantly (P &lt; .001) improved from initial assessment to final follow-up (from 45.88 to 6.61 [84%], from 31.73 to 9.20 [64%], and from 19.85 to 46.60 [208%], respectively). There was no difference in mean QuickDASH and UEFS scores at 1 year and final follow-up (P > .05); however, grip strength continued to improve (P &lt; .001). A validated MRI scoring system indicated that the mean grade of tendinopathy at the common extensor origin improved significantly (P &lt; .001) from initial assessment (4.31) to 1 year (2.88) and was maintained (P > .05) at final follow-up (2.87). At final follow-up, 93% of patients were either highly satisfied or satisfied with their ATI treatment.    What are the downsides / risks of autologous tenocyte implantations, if any, aside from:   the tendon biopsy (from a non-injured tendon in the patient), which is needed to obtain tendon samples to grow tenocytes from. (How long does it take to recover from a biopsy of a tendon?) the usual risk of the injection, when injecting the grown tenocytes in the injured tendon   ?

262,Health consequences of higher melanin production,"When I was on vacation down south last time, I wondered about the phenomenon of tanning.  I am a medical layman. But as far as I  understand, in case of a higher UV radiation, our body produces more melanin. So, our skin gets darker.  But why does our body not keep this higher melanin level? Is there any advantage of the skin getting brighter again?  A higher melanin level provides the advantage of less sunburn, etc., so I would have assumed that a high melanin level would be maintained consistently rather than being regulated by sun exposure.  Is there is any medical disadvantage of a high melanin level during periods of reduced sun exposure. "

269,Does intake of processed sugar lower the immune system?,"Growing up, my parents were very strict about sugar intake, because they had heard ""somewhere"" that eating refined sugar lowered your immune system function for 12-24 hours.  At the time, this seemed to be anecdotally true to me, because as a kid if I did actually eat something with a lot of sugar (candy, dessert) I would often have a sore throat or stuffy nose the next day.  This article from WebMD seems to support this, but doesn't cite any references:     Eating or drinking too much sugar curbs immune system cells that attack bacteria.

My grandmother uses the Crest Pro-Health Rinse which contains 'anti-microbial agent, cetylpyridinium chloride'. Yet USA Today in 2008 and  CTV News in 2012 reported complaints that the mouthwash browns and stains teeth, and also numbs taste. From the CTV article:     The parent company of Crest, Proctor and Gamble, told CTV News that the ingredient Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride is what causes some peopleâs teeth to turn brown.       Dentist Shaireen Lalani says the stains are not permanent and can be removed with professional cleaning.       In some cases, Crest has reimbursed consumers to have their teeth professionally cleaned.   What are the risks to using such mouthwashes? Most mouthwashes recommend two rinses daily, but is this advice safe and correct? How often should they really be used? "
273,Is there any proof that acupuncture is an effective pain remedy?,I have heard of acupuncture being used for pain management. Are there clear scientific proofs that indicate it is more effective than a placebo treatment for pain?  If so what types of pain has it been shown to effective for?  
274,Implications of repeated low level head impact?,"Given the recent highlighting of the long term health implications of head trauma and concussions in professional sports, has there been any research done on what level of impact is needed to produce these effects?  I have been a competitor in various sports for 40+ years, including almost 30 years in martial arts. During this time I have sustained one impact that produced a loss of consciousness, as well as several less severe head impacts during sparring competition. We wear 1"" thick foam helmets, face shields and hand/foot padding, but impacts can still rattle you a bit.  Is there any study evidence showing the effects of repeated low level (sub concussive) head impacts on long term health? "
275,Oxygen saturation value of smokers,"A person's O2 saturation, when measured in ambiant air at sea level with a pulse oxymeter (SpO2), is considered as normal between 95 and 100%.   I've read (non-sourced Wikipedia FR fragment, no mention of this in Wikipedia EN) and heard (informal discussions with medical and rescue staff) that this value decreases significantly if the subject is a smoker.  This raises the following questions:   Is this true, and why?  What are usual SpO2 values for smokers?    When I was a smoker, my own SpO2 was usually 100%. The saturation of my smoker colleagues who tried is also normal. This doesn't prove anything as this does not constitute a study - just a bunch of measure without methodolology -, this is just to say I never observed this phenomenon. "
276,How to avoid fatigue if I foresee irregular sleeping time?,"Let's say normally, I go to sleep at 00:00 and wake up at 08:00. I know that 3 days from now, I will have to work in another city for just that day and wake up at 05:00 to account for the travel time.  How should I plan my activities and rest, so that I will not feel sleepless the night before, or feel tired when I wake up at 05:00?   Should I exercise in the afternoon, so my body feels tired and I can go to sleep early? Should I eat more or eat less? Should I gradually adjust my sleeping time starting from 3 days before, then adjust it back? (3 days before + 3 days after = my sleeping is irregular for 7 days)   I am not interested in medicines like a sleeping pill, as I believe some can be harmful to health in the long term. "
277,Can getting the flu shot make you sicker next year?,"During college I faithfully got my flu vaccine every year. Shortly after I left college the US had a year with a bad flu vaccine shortage (2004).   When discussing the shortage with my coworkers at the time (who grew up in a different part of the country than I did), they replied that they didn't ever get the flu vaccine because they were told that if they ever had to skip a year (such as the year there were shortages) they would give much sicker than if they had never gotten the flu vaccine.  Is there any scientific truth to this belief? "
278,How safe are contact lenses?,"Are there any side effects to wearing contact lenses for a long time? Is there any way that wearing them can damage your eyes?  I'm referring to long-term use that is within or close to the manufacturer's recommendations (removing at night, cleaning, etc). "
279,Does blood donation reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"While answering this question about the possible detrimental effects of iron deficiency caused by frequent blood donation, I was reminded of a theory I heard long ago about a possible benefit of mild iron deficiency for reducing cardiovascular disease. The theory goes that the lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in pre-menopausal women (vs men of a similar age) is due to mild, chronic iron deficiency induced by menstruation.  I found some old observational literature suggesting that there might be an association between blood donation and decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Somewhat more recently, a large retrospective study seemed to support this. However, neither is a controlled study, and Iâve not heard this possible benefit promulgated by the Red Cross or anyone else collecting blood.   Are there strong randomized data in support of the idea that regular blood donation reduces cardiovascular risk? Has the âoptimalâ hemoglobin concentration been determined? "
280,Pulmonary diseases and oxygen therapy,"The team first aid guidelines in France say that for an adult victim, a saturation (SpO2) below 94 triggers the administration of 9L/min of oxygen using a non-rebreather mask. We first aid guys are not doctors, so we strictly apply this rule before reporting to the medical control.  However, I noticed that when the victim is known or suspected1 to have certain pulmonary diseases2, we are instructed to reduce the oxygen flow to 2L/minute or so, even if the SpO2 is still low3. This happens either when we contact the medical control or when a doctor arrives on the scene by request.   I find this interesting, so the following questions:    Is there a precise pulmonary diseases list that require oxygen therapy to be handled that way ?  Why could a high O2 flow be deleterious for these particular diseases and not others?   This is just curiosity. I mean by this that I won't try to anticipate should such a case occur again in the future: it's only up to the doctor to order an oxygen flow that doesn't appear in the first-aid guidelines.    Footnotes:  1 We don't determine that by ourselves, a doctor does.  2 Not completely sure of what kind. Thanks to @anongoodnurse's heads-up I could determine that some of them were diagnosed or suspected COPDs, and some of them unknown to us (we were just not told what was precisely diagnosed or suspected).  3 The doctor can instruct us to do this, even if not according to the first-aid guidelines, as he/she has a higher competence. "
281,How long should a person keep blood test results?,"If someone has no chronic health problems (but a family history of diabetes and high blood pressure), is there a good medical reason for them to keep their old blood test results that doctors have ordered? Or is it perfectly fine to just throw these out?  I expect any doctor interested in blood test results would just order a new test. Is there any real chance they would want to look at old results, too? "
282,How long can one safely take paracetamol for?,"I've heard that paracetamol is pretty bad for the liver - in fact, it relies so much on the human liver breaking it down that one pill of the stuff will kill a cat, whose liver can't deal with it!  With that in mind, and assuming no alcohol intake during the same period, how long can the average healthy adult continue to take paracetamol for if they take it at the generally recommended dose - 1000mg four times a day?  How long until there is a risk of serious liver damage? "
283,How many eggs can one eat per day?,"I've read conflicting information on how many eggs one can eat per day:  Daily Health Post - How Many Eggs a Day Can You Safely Eat?     How many eggs a day can you safely eat? Apparently, as many as you want, if you pay attention to your total calorie intake and are careful about carbohydrate intake. If you have diabetes, you can safely eat eggs too, but will need to be particularly attentive to carbohydrates and blood sugar control.   Men's Fitness - Am I Eating Too Many Eggs?     A 2008 report from the Physicians Health Study backs up Smithâs suggestion, finding that eating one egg per day is generally safeâbut that more than that can increase your heart disease risk later in life. (Note that weâre talking about yolks here. You can have unlimited whites.)     More details:   The individual is healthy, BMI of 20, has no major medical condition, and regarding sports activities walks 30 minutes per day. Eggs are large chicken eggs (50 grams) I am looking for an approximate upper bound on the number of eggs one can eat per day on average while staying healthy in the long run  "
284,Puberty Blockers for Transgender Youth,"There have recently been a lot of TV documentaries, dramas, etc. covering the transgender community.  For example, there has recently been a short drama here in the UK called Butterfly and there is I am Jazz which has so far followed Jazz Jennings' journey for 13 years.  When you look at the process that Jazz Jennings has had to go through (and still is going through) one part of the process was that she was provided puberty blockers at an early age to prevent the growth of facial hair along with other effects of male puberty.  Transgender youth of both binary sexes apply to the medical establishment to gain puberty blockers. The MedicalSciences.SE question What happens during puberty that causes the deepening &amp; squeaking/cracking (dysphonia) of a male&#39;s voice? talks about an increase in androgen during puberty and the Wikipedia page on puberty blockers I linked to discusses Gonadotropin-releasing hormoneÂ (GnRH) agonists (e.g., leuprorelin, histrelin) being used.  GnRH activity is very low duringÂ childhood, and is activated atÂ pubertyÂ orÂ adolescence. Are different blockers used for each binary sex or is the same blocker used for both sex?  How long are these blockers used for? Is it lifetime? "

Below is what I have read and heard:   [website]  Old folks who blast their perio pockets with a water pick on the highest settings, then wonder why their pockets are getting deeper. Please use a low setting on your water pick and don't sit with it in the same spot for a minute.  [website]  Start with the lowest pressure setting, lean over the sink, place tip in your mouth.  A dentist I visited some time ago was recommending using the highest settings. [website]  Our waterpik rep stated that it is most effective at a power level of 7.

Gradually   increase pressure over   time to the setting you prefer â or as instructed by   your dental professional.      I have crossposted the question at:   [website][website]"
289,Does consuming xylitol-containing products help prevent dental caries?,"Does consuming xylitol-containing products help prevent dental caries?  From the systematic review {1}, the effect is quite inconclusive:     We found some low quality evidence to suggest that fluoride toothpaste containing xylitol may be more effective than fluoride-only toothpaste for preventing caries in the permanent teeth of children, and that there are no associated adverse-effects from such toothpastes. The effect estimate should be interpreted with caution due to high risk of bias and the fact that it results from two studies that were carried out by the same authors in the same population. The remaining evidence we found is of low to very low quality and is insufficient to determine whether any other xylitol-containing products can prevent caries in infants, older children, or adults.   Have more recent studies shared a clearer light on to what extent, if any, consuming xylitol-containing products help prevent dental caries?

291,Why medicine modelling is distributed on regular person's computers?,"There are some distributed computing project on the Internet that tries to find cure for diseases, like World Community Grid. Could anyone say why there are such things and how useful those are? I mean, I believe that if you are serious researcher, I think you are able to use university's networks or supercomputers to do modelling. So what is the idea about spread the modelling to regular computers? Does the medicine modelling require so much computer power that computers in universities have not enough computing power? "
292,Does eating manuka honey help prevent acne?,"Does eating manuka honey help prevent acne?  What I have found so far is unsubstantiated or in vitro.  {1}:     The Internet is filled with patient testimonials that Manuka honey works marvelously for acne and eczema patients. At this time there are no clinical trials to support these claims, but this doesnât bother me at all.   {2}:     Manuka honey is   renowned for its prolific ameliorative effects on sore throat,   burns, infections, gum problem, acne, indigestion; and gastrooesophageal   reflux.       [...]      Manuka honey has been proven to be an effective agent in   healing diabetic wounds, venous ulcers, burns, acne, eczema,   psoriasis.    However they don't provide any reference.  {3}:     Quinine honey (Cinchona succirubra) from in plantations of quinine (Cinchona succirubra) and itâs in vitro antimicrobial activity against to some acne vulgaris bacteria was evaluated using the CLSI M07-A9 standar method.

293,Is it preferable to brush one's teeth before or 30-60 minutes after breakfast?,"Is it preferable to brush one's teeth before or 30-60 minutes after breakfast?  I found plenty of blog posts / testimonials but no actual scientific studies. I'm looking for the latter.    Waiting at least ~30 minutes before toothbrushing has been shown to be useful in a few studies, e.g. [website]  It is concluded that for protection of dentin surfaces at least 30 min should elapse before toothbrushing after an erosive attack.   Here is an example of some dentist advising to toothbrush before breakfast:  [website]  Brush and floss your teeth after you eat. This is the most logical answer .You do not want bacteria eating the left-overs in your mouth from breakfast . Remember to floss . Take responsibility for the food that can not be brushed or removed between your teeth.   Brushing teeth before or after breakfast look very similar but the options they considered were before vs. what after breakfast. They didn't consider comparing before vs. 30 minutes after breakfast. As a result, it isn't a duplicate.  [website]arguments for brushing before:   Bacteria  begin to metabolize sugars into acids almost instantly.  Salivary calcium levels are lowest in the morning putting your teeth are at a much higher risk of acidic damage from bacteria and dietary acids in the morning than at any other time Better to brush with fluoride toothpaste before so you have some fluoride left in your mouth when eating. That fluoride will immediately protect your teeth from the acidous attack of consumed carbohydrates and acidic foodstuff.   arguments for brushing after (waiting >~30 minutes):   gentle brushing can help neutralize the pH in the mouth after a meal. Obviously, if you eat something acidic which will temporarily demineralize your teeth, don't start scrubbing away.   "

299,What is the actual reason behind intestinal gas?,"I have some symptoms of IBS. And the most irritating problem I'm dealing with is intestinal gas. I'm taking medicines but they don't seem working. Neither it is curing IBS nor the gas problem.  I'm taking enough fiber (salad, vegetables, fruits etc.). I don't eat any fast food or something like that. I walk early in the morning, before dinner and light walk after dinner. I do some light exercises/Yoga. Yet, I'm suffering from intestinal gas. Bloating is okay but this gas causes pain in my lower part and I've to go to toilet 2-3 times daily to pass the gas only (most of the times). I can't evacuate at single time.  So I want to find the root cause of this gas problem and want to find solution for it.  I have three queries to ask in my case:   Does constipation cause intestinal gas? Do some food cause gas and then gas cause constipation? My stools are not like they should be (sometimes liquid, sometimes hard and color varies, and all with gas).  (a) What can be the reason of this? Bad digestion of food or the constipation   (caused by gas?)? (b) Is it possible that food is digested properly but gas causes the variations and bad stools?   Two more thing that can help you answer better is that 1st: I think a lot (I don't actually know if it's normal or a lot) about these problems, search many times on internet for solutions. I think like every half an hour about these problems. 2nd: I'm underweight. Everyone calls me skinny. I even think about it many times a day and feel little ashamed and bad. My weight is 57 Kg and I'm aged 24.  Is this thinking is causing all problems and even IBS?  NOTE: I take sufficient sleep. 7-8 hours per day. There are no sleeping disorders.  I hope you understand my problem and you can answer it. I shall be thankful to you. "

This doesn't make sense to me, I lost weight myself but all I did was look at the calorie content of foods, if it was carbs or anything else it didn't really matter. Although I do find that foods that are high in carbs are generally also high in calories but this doesn't mean that carbs are more fattening does it?  Is there any truth in what my friends are saying; that carbs are fattening?  But it's not just my friends that are saying this, I've heard that carbs are fattening from many different sources: A quick search on how to lose weight shows multiple results mentioning limiting of carbs in order to lose weight: 1 where  they say calorie restricted diets do not work, 2 low carb diet lost more weight than low fat group, because they replaced carbs with protein  "
303,When is swallowing fish bones dangerous,"According to a study (2013):     Ingestion of fish bones or coins by young children is a relatively common presentation in the PED, and it is associated with frequent medical interventions. Although the overall prognosis is good, and improving the health education of the population should be considered to reduce the frequency of these episodes.   Note: PED = Pediatric Emergency Department  Also, in some extremely rare cases the bone can penetrate the digestive tract and end up in other organs (2015).    Fish bones come in various sizes, hardness etc. Eating fish would inevitably result in swallowing them. Although I assume small fish like sardines shouldn't be much of a problem, bones from bigger fish can potentially be dangerous.  When would swallowing a fish-bone be a problem? (e.g. can cause injury in any part of the digestive system) Would the stomach dissolve partially or completely some fish-bones?   Also, are there any differences in whether a kid or an adult swallowed it?  Note: If it can be generalized for other bones as well, let me know. (or simply edit the question) "

308,"In a viral infection, which symptoms are caused by the virus itself, and which symptoms are caused by the body fighting the virus?","Most symptoms commonly associated with respiratory viral infections, like the common cold, are actually immune in nature. Fever is the body's attempt to overheat the virus, excess mucous is the body's attempt to catch virus before it enters the body, fatigue is the result of immune exertion in fighting the virus, chills are the result of fever, etc.  What types of symptoms of a respiratory viral infection tend to be directly caused by the virus, and what types tend to be caused by the body fighting a viral infection? A better way to ask this might be, what symptoms of a respiratory viral infection would an immunocompromised individual show? "
309,What is the best probability of recurrent stillbirth with the given data,"Summary: My son was stillborn and I don't know why. My wife and I would like to have another child, but would very much not like to try if the probability of this occurring again is above a certain threshold (of which we have already settled on one). All 3 doctors I have consulted were unable to give a definitive cause of death, nor were any willing to give a numerical estimate of the probability (whether for reasons of legal risk, or something else) that our next baby will be stillborn. I am likely too distraught to properly evaluate my situation and would very much appreciate an independent (from mine) probability estimate of what caused my son to die, and given that cause, how likely it is that our next child will die as well.  Background: V (L and my only biologically related living son) had no complications during birth, nor has he showed any signs of poor health whatsoever. L has a cousin who has had two miscarriages, and I have an aunt who had several stillbirths followed by 3 live births of healthy children. We know of no other family members that have had similar misfortunes.  J (my deceased son) was the product of a 31 week gestation. L (my wife and J's mother) is 28 years old, gravida 2, para 1. L presented to the physicians office for routine prenatal care and noted that she had not felt any fetal movement for the last five to six days. No fetal heart tones were identified. It was determined that there was an intrauterine fetal demise. L was admitted on 11/05/2015 for induction and was delivered of a nonviable, normal appearing, male fetus at approximately 1:30 on 11/06/2015.  Pro-Con Reasoning: According to a leading obstetrics textbook1, causes of stillbirth are commonly classified into 8 categories: obstetrical complications, placental abnormalities, fetal malformations, infection, umbilical cord abnormalities, hypertensive disorders, medical complications, and undetermined. Below, I'll list the percentage of stillbirths in each category (which may be used as prior probabilities) along with some reasons for or against.  Obstetrical complications (29%)     Against: No abruption detected. No multifetal gestation. No ruptured   preterm membranes at 20-24 weeks.   Placental abnormalities (24%)     For: Excessive fibrin deposition (as concluded in the surgical   pathology report). Early acute chorioamnionitis (as conclused in the   surgical pathology report, but Dr. M claimed this was caused by the   baby's death, not conversely). L has gene variants associated with   deep vein thrombosis (AG on rs2227589 per 23andme raw data).      Against: No factor V Leiden mutation (GG on rs6025 per 23andme raw   data and confirmed via independent lab test). No prothrombin gene   mutation (GG on l3002432 per 23andme raw data and confirmed via   independent lab test). L was negative for prothrombin G20210A mutation   (as determined by lab test). Anti-thrombin III activity results were   within normal reference ranges (as determined by lab test). Protein C   activity results were withing normal reference ranges (as determined   by lab test). Protein S activity results were within normal reference   ranges (as determined by lab test). Protein S antigen (free and total)   results were within normal references ranges (as determined by lab   test).   Infection (13%)     For: L visited a nurse's home during the last week of August that   works in a hospital we now know had frequent cases of CMV infection.   CMV antibody IgH, CMV IgG, and Parvovirus B-19 Antibody IgG values   were outside of normal reference ranges.       Against: Dr. M discounted the viral test results as the cause of   death, since the levels suggested the infection had occurred years   ago, and therefore could not have caused J's death. Dr. F confirmed   Dr. M's assessment.   Fetal malformations (14%)     Against: No major structural abnormalities. No genetic abnormalities   detected (CombiSNP Array for Pregnancy Loss results showed a normal   male micro array profile).   Umbilical cord abnormalities (10%)     Against: No prolapse. No stricture. No thrombosis.   Hypertensive disorder (9%)     Against: No preeclampsia. No chronic hypertension.   Medical complications (8%)     For: L experienced 2 nights of very painful abdominal pains that could   have been contractions on 10/28 and 10/29. L remembers waking up on   her back a few nights between 10/20 and 11/05 (it is unclear if this   belongs in this category or somewhere else).       Against: No antiphospholipid antibody syndrome detected (determined   via Beta-2 Glycoprotein I Antibodies [IgG, IgA, IgM] test). No   maternal diabetes detected (determined via glucose test on 10/20).   Undetermined (24%)  What is the most likely cause of death? How likely is that cause? Given that cause, if we choose to have another child, then how likely is it to survive its birth? Are there any other ways I could reduce uncertainty (additional tests, etc...) that I haven't listed here? Are there any other forums where these questions are more likely to get good answers? Why won't doctors give probabilities? Help with any of these questions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  If your advice to me is to consult another expert (in addition to the 2 obstetricians and 1 high-risk obstetrician I already have consulted), please also provide concrete tactics as to how to find such an expert and validate their expertise.

I've searched in google and couldn't find anything mentioned about it? "
311,Does hyperthyroidism affect serotonin levels?,I have read that hyperthyroidism can cause depression. Is this because of low serotonin levels or is there is another cause?  Does this kind of depression need to be checked by a psychiatrist?  Edit (if it is too broad I can remove this edit): Can depression lead to thyroid hormone fluctuation? 
312,Do we need to drink milk?,"There are many articles that point out how drinking milk is not necessary and it does no good to human health. These articles state that milk is only for babies (only mother's milk) and there is no need to drink any animal milk. One example is found at this link to a medical page, which says it is based on studies.   I want to know for a fact: if we don't include milk in our daily diet, will it matter? "
313,How does the amount of allergen in an allergy shot compare to a 6X homeopathic dilution,"I have a bottle of liquid that is meant to build my immunity to ""cedar fever,"" a common allergy in central Texas.  It is a homeopathic medicine which contains the cedar pollen at a 6X dilution, meaning 1 part pollen per 1 million parts water (or alcohol).  The directions say to take 3 drops of this under your tongue 3 times per day.  I'm skeptical that this is going to do anything, but I understand that immunotherapy (allergy shots) work essentially the same way: they expose your body to a small amount of allergen to stimulate the immune system... or something like that.  Anyway, that is a more standard approach that a traditional doctor would prescribe.  Are these treatments comparable?  Can anyone tell me how much allergen is present in an allergy shot, so I can compare to the quantity in this homeopathic solution?  Thanks! "
314,Can one go underweight then bulk afterwards safely?,"I am a male, 5'8'' and weight 127 pounds. I still have a little bit of belly fat, approximately 10 millimeters.   My goal is to get a flat stomach and I am not interested in building my body. I am build of a small frame and my BMI is still in the acceptable range.   I want to drop my weight further, towards 120, or even below that, to lose my belly fat. But I do not intend to stay at that weight class. I will then immediately bulk up afterwards, followed by a small cut of all fat that I gain during the bulk-up process.   Should I be worried if the BMI says I am ""underweight"" for a month or two? Because I am not malnutritioned, I carefully keep track of what I eat and let my weight drop. On top of it, ""underweight"" people are skeletons, I do not look like that, and have plenty of fat on my stomach to still drop. What are the health concerns?  "
315,Protocol for prior complications prior to a surgery,"Consider the following scenario:  A patient undergoes a surgical procedure (say, total knee arthroscopy). A few days later, the patient is readmitted for a complication, such as a pulmonary embolism or sepsis. The patient is treated for this complication and released. Maybe 20 days later, the patient goes in for another surgical procedure. The following concerns this second procedure, specifically the associated hospital claim form:  Question 1: What is the standard protocol for reporting recent prior complications? For example if the patient originally got sepsis, would it be reported during the second surgery claim as a diagnostic ""present on admission?"" Is there a cutoff (say, 30 days)?  Question 2: Assuming the doctor has access to the patients prior information, what is the standard protocol for deciding whether to proceed with the second surgery? Is there some kind of prior evaluation to determine if the last complication has been treated ""beyond a reasonable doubt?"" More generally, if a doctor proceeds with the surgery, and say, sepsis develops again, would this be considered a negative strike against the doctor (they should have checked the patient's medical history)? "
316,Is it possible to not have BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes?,"I had  DNA analysis from 23andMe, however in the results there was no information about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Does that mean that I do not have these genes?  Does every human have these genes, or is it a mutation to have them? "
317,Do you suggest HBOT (hyperbaric oxygen therapy) for Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis?,"I've been searching about HBOT treatment for a while. I found many sources &amp; researches but couldn't be sure %100. It is a real solution or it can replace with medicines?  For example: [website]The results show us all patients have positive progress. Unfortunately, the doctors don't suggest HBOT as a first option yet.  Do you know anything about this? "
318,Does vomiting while feeling nausea from stomach flu make it easier or harder for the body to recover?,"I was talking with somebody who believes that when having stomach flu (gastroenteritis) and feeling nausea, you should try to vomit. This person's theory is that the stomach flu virus makes some foods (the ones that cause nausea) toxic to the body. According to this person, the food that has become toxic by the virus is detected by the body as harmful and thus a person feels nausea so that they may vomit the now toxic food. Then, after the toxic food is vomited out, the body is relieved and can recover more easily from the stomach flu.  I thought this was an absurd theory and that you should try to avoid vomiting while having stomach flu to prevent the loss of nutrients. However, I don't know what the actual recommended course of action should be.  How exactly does stomach flu (gastroenteritis) cause nausea? Is the virus making the food we eat toxic? Or it is just making the stomach extra sensitive to anything? "
319,Recommended size of diclofenac patch,"When treating a lateral epicondylitis of the humerus with diclofenac patches, what is the recommended surface of the patch?    Let's assume that the entire patch (10x14cm) contains 140 mg of diclofenac (as in this one). I understand that reducing its size results in reducing the amount of diclofenac. However, I believe (and may be wrong) one should take into account the distance between the patch and the epicondyle. E.g. if the patch's size is reduced by half, the remaining 70 mg are ""closer"" to the epicondyle than the removed 70 mg (provided that the patch is always placed in such a way that the distance between the patch and the epicondyle is minimized).  So this question could be broken down into two main ones:   To what extent does the distance between the patch and the epicondyle matter for the treatment? To what extent does the diclofenac dose matter for the treatment?   I'm ok to post them as two separate question if needs be. I don't have any preference. "
320,Can a sunburn increase your resting heart rate?,"I've been using a Fitbit to track my resting heartrate (among other things).  The value has consistently been in the 55-60 range for several weeks (most typical value over the past week or two is 57).  Over the past few days, however, it jumped to around 62; a 10% increase.    The bulk of the increase occurred 2 days ago, and the only thing I can think of that happened within that timeframe is that I got a mild sunburn (from kiteboarding, so primarily on my face/forehead from looking up at the sky all afternoon).  But correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation.  So my question is, can a sunburn lead to an increase in the body's resting heartrate?  And if so, why?  Misc Notes  I know a Fitbit isn't a medically accurate device, and that there's pending litigation over whether they're accurate at all.  However my anecdotal experience with my particular device is that it's quite accurate when at rest (during strenuous exercise the instantaneous readings can indeed be a bit funky and it can temporarily lose count altogether; although the average values that get logged to the dashboard seem reasonable despite the transient outliers/glitches).  So I don't think device inaccuracy/margin of error is the explanation. "
321,Folic acid dose before conception,What is the normal folic acid dosage that should be taken while trying to conceive? The minimum dosage available in my region is 5 mg tablets. Is that an acceptable dose? I read somewhere that the normal dosage is 400 mcg. 
322,Is working on a computer for a long time everyday bad for health?,"Is looking continuously at a computer screen for a long time everyday bad for health? If yes, then what care should be taken while working on a computer? "
323,Is Ibuprofen Safe To Use As A Catch-All First Aid Solution,"I've heard it said that when in doubt use (or administer) Ibuprofen.  The idea being that it's a safe, general-purpose medical tool.  Assuming you follow the instructions on the bottle, is this a viable strategy?  Or are there situations or scenarios where it would be better to err on the side of doing nothing?  Are there situations or scenarios where you would definitely want to not use Ibuprofen, again assuming you at least follow the instructions. "
324,How much food is necessary to buffer the stomach when taking medicine?,"Very often, doctors or pharmacists will advise patients to take certain pills with food to ""act as a buffer"" so the patient is less likely to get a stomach ache from taking the pill.  How much food is necessary to act as a buffer to protect the stomach?  Some doctors claim that a couple of crackers are sufficient, whereas other doctors claim that you need to eat an entire meal.  So what's the truth?  And what are the best foods to eat (or drink) for this purpose?  In order to simplify your answer, feel free to answer for an ""average"" adult, meaning average weight, height, etc., and no specific illnesses that would complicate your answer.  (As a side note, not all pills should be taken with food; some pills are to be taken on an empty stomach.) "
325,Epidemic and outbreak of Disease,What are the differences between an epidemic and an outbreak? Both words mean unexpected or unusual occurrence of the disease. Can someone explain the difference between them? 
326,Can wearing retainers at night affect sleep quality?,"Besides being uncomfortable, does wearing retainers at night cause any effects like sleep apnea?   I'm wondering this because I've woken up with dry mouth multiple times after sleeping with my retainer, which is also a symptom of sleep apnea. Of course, having just one symptom doesn't mean much, but almost every time I use retainers, this happens, so I've begun to wonder.  What are the known side effects of sleeping with a retainer? "
327,Vegetable smoothies: are they good for you?,I have been recently making vegetable smoothies using carrots and spinach. But is this healthy for me as I know having fruit smoothies contain broken down sugars and are bad for you. So is it good for health having vegetable smoothies instead of fruit ones?   I only have one carrot and a handful of cooked spinach once a day or so - is this in any way bad for health in the same regard as consuming too much sugar from fruit smoothies could be?  
328,Light Sensitivity as a result of Caffeine Intake,Is it possible that caffeine as a psychoactive chemical could produce an effect of light sensitivity in an individual or worsen an already present condition of light sensitivity?  More specifically what would be the actual effects or physiological mechanism of the caffeine that could produce this result?  There appear to be two papers published on the subject but they are in Russian and outside of my understanding. link. 
329,Why have 2 bones in lower arm/leg and only 1 in upper?,"I just broke my lower leg while skiing (both the tibia and the fibula). It's recovering well, having rest as my most prominent medicine. While thinking about my fracture, it appeared to me that we only have one bone in our upper arm (the humerus) and upper leg (the femur) and two bones in the lower arm (radius and ulna) and lower leg (tibia and fibula). Why is this? Or maybe better: what is the function or use of a second bone in the lower arm/leg? "
330,How would oral medication be given to patient in ICU that can't swallow?,How would oral medication be given to patient in ICU that can't swallow? I was told that the tablets are grind and put in water then provided through a tube. Is this true? How would the nurse know the effect of interaction resulting from mixing those ground pills? Thanks. 
331,Healing progress of tibia fracture 8 weeks post surgery,"I suffered a closed, dislocated comminuted fracture of the extreme distal tibia just above the ankle joint on Feb 19th of this year with surgery the following day. I was treated with an IM nail for the tibia. The injury was caused by slipping on a hill with my foot stuck in the mud; I guess the angle and twisting motion was just right to cause the break. There was an associated fibula break at the same level as the tibia fracture and a second below my knee. The actual ankle joint was not involved at all.   I went for my 8 week xrays, and am slightly concerned at the progress, and was not really satisfied with the answers my OS provided, he seemed in a bit of a rush. On the xrays, the top fibula break showed good callus formation, but the bottom break and the tibia fracture showed no new bone growth. I was cleared to weight-bear as tolerated at week six, and have been doing so in a cam boot while using a walker. My OS did not seem too concerned about this, and did not reduce my weight bearing status. When asked the reason for the lack of bone growth he informed me that the tibia is one of the slowest healing bones in the body, and because of the break's extreme distal location, there is not much muscle and therefore not much blood supply. He said not to worry too much as it's not unusual to have no radiographic signs of bone growth at 8 weeks, sometimes it takes 10 or 12 to show. In addition, he pointed out that the lower fibula fracture showed no callus either, and since the top break was healing well that it was likely just the break's location slowing the healing progress. It is worth noting that the fracture alignment has remained good on all xrays since post op, and I do know that accepted wisdom is that the farther down the tibia you go, the longer it is likely to take to heal.   It just seems odd, as there is no pain on weight bearing, or palpation of the fracture site, and only mild soreness after stressing the leg. Movement is easy, and the leg has achieved a level of somewhat normal comfort, so it seems counter to the radiographic findings. Is it normal in very distal fractures to take longer than 8 weeks to show signs of callus? If it was not healing would there be pain and discomfort? I'd imagine there would be, and I experience none. "
332,MD-PhD vs DVM-PhD,"I am a high school senior planning to attend university this Fall and major in Biomedical Engineering.    I plan to perform biomedical research as a career after my PhD. My objective is to push the treatment and cure of diseases forward - I would like to see human suffering diminished and eliminated as much as possbile during my lifetime.     I have been advised that a practical doctorate would help me achieve my goals, so I am considering earning a DVM or an MD alongside a PhD.  My question is, which should I choose?   In other words, what sort of research and application will I perform with a DVM-PhD vs an MD-PhD, and how substantially will my work affect human health?  I ask because I have recieved mixed signals when questioning vets and doctors in the same manner.    They usually said that 'the DVM would be good for animal modeling of human diseases, while the MD would be good for direct application to humans.'  But in the professional world this seems much more convoluted - for instance, a DVM-PhD at my university of choice is the leading researcher for human regenerative medicine at that particular institution.    I need to make a decision within a year as to which 'track' I will pursue becuase each degree has slightly different undergraduate couse commitments, volunteering requirements, etc.    If anyone is knowledgeable on this subject, I would deeply appreciate all the help I can get!

337,Amaranth + Yogurt advisable in ayurveda?,"According to ayurveda, is it a right combination to have amaranth and yogurt together? Also with maybe some fruit thrown in?  EDIT: i.e. does the combination have any negative/harmful effect on the body? For reference here are a couple of links link1 link2 that mentions such combinations.   Excerpts:   ""Food combining theory recommends to avoid mixing carbohydrates with acids. Adding dairy to this already difficult combo turns it into a recipe for digestive problems and after-meal fatigue""  Above statement is just an example (not really saying that it implies for my question). Want to know if amaranth and yogurt combination falls in any such harmful category? "
338,Aloe Vera and Diabetes,I've read some research about it. Does Anybody know what substance in  Aloe Vera  can help in decreasing blood sugar in patients with diabetes?   And also is there any substance in Aloe Vera that is proven to decrease Insulin Resistance? 
339,Does consuming dairy make mucus thicker? Why?,I've been told to avoid eating dairy during a heavy cold or sinus infection because dairy makes mucus very thick. I've also read elsewhere that dairy doesn't impact thickness of mucus... But anecdotal evidence makes me think that consumption of dairy does impact the thickness of mucus.   So is it correct to avoid dairy if one is having nasal congestion issues?   If it indeed does cause thick mucus... why? 
340,Is it possible for the lungs and heart to work independently of one another?,"I understand that the lungs take in oxygen, pass it to the heart to send throughout the body, and receive CO2 from cellular respiration that the lungs then breathe out. (Oversimplified, I know, but let's run with it for a minute, if we can.)  Is it possible for the lungs to function without the heart functioning? That is, can the lungs take in oxygen, and, not having anywhere to put it, breathe it back out? Of course, breathing out wouldn't contain any excess CO2 because the heart doesn't collect it from the body.   In the event that the answer is yes, would CPR be performed differently, i.e. without the breaths between the 30 pushes?  What about the converse case: can the heart function without the lungs functioning? I suppose anaerobic respiration is one form of this, but can that be sustained long-term? Once again, if the answer is yes, would CPR be performed differently? "
341,How can a bone marrow transplant from a donor of a different blood type not get rejected?,"As discussed here, one can change their blood type by getting a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a different blood type.   Why would the bone marrow not be rejected, as the body's immune system is still ""used to"" the previous blood type? Wouldn't the immune system attack the marrow, or at least the red blood cells it produces, for containing foreign proteins? "
342,Does sleeping on one side affect cognitive development?,I have been sleeping mainly on my right side for as long as I can remember. I am wondering whether this could have had any effect on my cognitive development?  I can image that gravity pulling down the blood to the right side may lead to a minor difference in pressure and available oxygen between the left and right side of my brain. Does this mean that different parts of my brain take a more substantial part in processing the events of the day?  Could this difference accumulate to something noticeable and permanent over the course of a lifetime? 
343,Why are obgyns generally hesitant to do VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean sections) births? Do previous c-sections impose added risks?,"I've heard that if a woman/mother, for whatever reason, has a caesarean section (c-section), all the subsequent births thereafter most likely will be done via a c-section. Is this true? Why or why not? (Of course I know you can still deliver vaginally, but that many OBGYNs will opt for c-section).   I've heard that c-sections are on the rise because they tend to do c-sections just based on the fact that the mother had a previous c-section (even if this particular birth or pregnancy had no risks to the baby or mother)... But this has not always been the case. So what are the medical reasons for the uptick in c-sections?   (If we are to assume that hospitals are not in it for the money momentarily). Does having a c-section impose an added risk on following births? What are they?  Why are obgyn's hesitant to do VBAC births? "
344,Why sneezing occurs when suddenly exposed to bright lights?,"The photic sneeze is nothing to sneeze at! Even our beloved deep-thinker, Aristotle, pondered this phenomenon: ""Why does the heat of the sun provoke sneezing?"" And this, my friends, is the question that I present today. Do we know why a large number of people experience the photic sneeze, a sneeze reflex when someone is rapidly bathed in bright lights (esp. when emerging from the dark)?  Is something happening in our occipital lobe, such as the trigeminal nerve, in which the body's wires are essentially crossed? In other words, can visual stimulation really be a catalyst for a sneeze?   Or is something else going on here? Is it a nervous, startled reaction from primal times that had some sort of benefit?   Or are there typically more particles in sunlight that can trigger sneezes? "
345,"Can caffeine be absorbed through the skin? Specifically, do caffeinated soaps boost energy?","I had no idea that caffeinated soap existed! (You really do learn something new everyday)! So apparently these caffeinated soaps are on the market, but are they really all that effective in boosting energy?  How does the energy boost compare to consuming a caffeinated soda?  If so, does that mean that caffeine can be absorbed through the skin?    "
346,What is the minimum energy needed to stay alive?,"This is a bit of an odd question, but here goes.  Your body needs energy to function. Each organ (brain, heart, etc.) need different amounts of energy to function properly. So it stands to reason that your heart's minimum required energy is higher than that of your spleen (just an example). So here's my question:  ""Which organ requires the most minimum energy, and how much energy is the minimum?""  I'm asking this question because I'm trying to figure out ""if energy were removed from a body, such that all parts of the body had the exact same amount of energy, what would be the minimum energy needed to make sure no organs failed"" (this has to do with World Building, to an extent).  Furthermore, it'd be very helpful to know how much energy would be required for said organ not only for survival, but also to maintain a relatively normal, or even active, functionality. Would this equal the energy normally found in a person, or could it be lower?  If I need to clarify further, just let me know. Thank you in advance! "
347,Is it possible for a healthy person to drown in their sleep without waking up?,"In reading about the horrific Battle of Passchendaele during World War One, I came across an anecdotal account of a British officer sheltering in a shell hole in a rain storm. The narrator claims that this officer had no wounds, and had fallen asleep on the wall of the crater while the muddy water it contained was only a foot deep.  The next morning, when the narrator awoke, the officer was still not physically wounded, but the muddy liquid had risen considerably overnight, covering the officer's face and drowning him in his sleep.  I have a hard time believing that an uninjured, healthy person with no neurological or physiological problems would be able to sleep through something like this.  I'm sure many of you have experienced the acute physical discomfort and emotionally jarring panic of unintentionally inhaling water - failing to notice the sensations would be virtually  impossible.  If healthy people could sleep through drowning, the form of torture known as ""waterboarding"" would presumably be unremarkable rather than horrific.  And I know from experience that if you cover your big brother's mouth and nose while he's asleep, he wakes up very quickly (and punches you repeatedly).  Is the idea of a healthy person with no relevant medical issues  sleeping through their own drowning plausible?  Wouldn't your brain react in such a way as to wake you up so you could save yourself?

351,How to fight stiff neck after viral meningitis?,"My fiancee had suffered from viral meningitis last year. She was treated in hospital, spent there 10 days and was released to home. Since then she sometimes (once every 3-4 weeks) has episodes of head pain and neck pain/stiffness, which she usually helps with paracetamol + codeine (500mg + 30 mg does the trick).  When she catches a cold, these symptoms usually come back stronger.  My question is - is there any kind of treatment/therapy that would make these symptoms go away? Or will she be dependant on painkillers for the rest of her life? "
352,Does bed type have an effect on sleep quality?,"People naturally have varied preferences for bed firmness / angle / temperature, but is there any evidence that a soft bed improves sleep quality?  Spending ~8 hrs a day on a soft cushion (instead of some leaves or animal furs) is a recent development in human evolution, but this practice has been widely adopted, seemingly to no ill effect.  Of course, any sleeping arrangement that makes it difficult to get to sleep or to stay asleep is inferior. But supposing that I can easily acclimate myself to sleeping on the bare floor, or on a $10K mattress, is there any reason to choose one over the other? "
353,Does echinacea help prevent or treat a viral infection?,"I purposely generalise by writing 'a viral infection', instead of asking only about only colds or flus. I itemise the verbs in decreasing order of effect on the virus. Does echinacea (eg tea) help: prevent and/or mitigate, relieve a viral infection?     At least, does it allay or soothe the symptoms?  mayoclinic.org  by Brent A. Bauer, M.D. and [website]"

358,Are bread molds dangerous to ingest?,"I will occasionally notice minor molds developing on bread I've left for a few days at room temperature. Often, there will be some mold noticeable on a few pieces, while other pieces are fine.  I know next to nothing about molds in general. Aside from the ""ick"" factor, is consuming a piece of bread with a small amount of mold on it dangerous? What adverse health effects (if any) could result? "
359,Should everyone with trigeminal neuralgia get imaging studies?,"Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition characterized by intermittent pain, usually on one side of the face, somewhere along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve (ear to eye, nose and jaw). Sometimes there's a headache with it (same side), sometimes not.  If there are no other symptoms and it goes away for months at a time, and the pain can be largely controlled by avoiding triggers and taking ibuprophen, is it really necessary to have imaging studies done to rule out compression of the nerve or the small chance that it's the first sign of MS?  If such a condition has been occurring intermittently for years, if it was caused by a compression of the nerve, wouldn't there be definitive symptoms after such a period of time? If it were MS, would other signs have manifested themselves during a period of years? "
360,Does cooking food prevent the body from efficiently absorbing minerals?,"It is true that we absorb minerals from cooked food less efficiently, because the membranes of our cells are made up mostly of hydrogen ions, therefore cooking food lose its anionic charge and it become more cationic? So in other words, it makes the food less healthy?  This can be demonstrated by Kirlian photography of cooked food which capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges:    Image found at: The Tao of Dana  Which gives the impression of reduction of anionic charge. Therefore if alkalinity is altered due to cooking, it could influence the structural, functional and enzymatic aspects of the food making the nutritions less absorbable. "
361,AED on infants: risks of using adult pads,"Until a couple of years ago, in case of cardiac arrest, first-aid guidelines (in France at least) were instructing not to use an AED on infants (&lt; 1 yo), even with pediatric pads or with an energy dose reducer.   Nowadays, it is more and more recommended to use an AED on infants1. Preferably using pediatric pads, and even with adult pads should no pediatric pads or reducer be available:   What the French guidelines say:      Children and infants   Defibrillation should be performed using appropriate devices (pediatric pads, energy dose reducer...). Should no suitable AED be available, an ""adult"" AED may be used. The pads are in this case applied to the center of the chest for one, and to the center of the back for the other.    The above is a translation I made. The original text is:     Chez lâenfant ou le nourrisson   La dÃ©fibrillation doit Ãªtre rÃ©alisÃ©e avec des appareils adaptÃ©s (Ã©lectrodes enfants, rÃ©ducteur dâÃ©nergie...). En lâabsence dâun DAE adaptÃ©, un DAE Â«AdulteÂ» peut Ãªtre utilisÃ©. Les Ã©lectrodes adultes sont alors positionnÃ©es en avant au milieu du thorax pour lâune et au milieu du dos pour   lâautre.    Source: ""PRÃVENTION ET SECOURS CIVIQUES de niveau 1"", French Ministry of Interior   What the Fairview Health Services, Minneapolis, US, say:      Use the small pads meant for infants. If these are not available, use the adult pads. When applying the adult pads, make sure the pads donât touch each other. If it looks like the pads will touch, apply one pad to the center of the babyâs chest. Apply the other pad to the center of the babyâs upper back.    Source: ""CPR And Automated External Defibrillator (12 Months Or Younger)"", Fairview Health Services, Minneapolis  What is the precise drawback of using adult pads? Is the AED likely to harm the infant2, or is it likely to miss shockable rhythms (and therefore fail to deliver required shocks)3, or even both?    1- The Ministry of Interior of France, the Fairview Health Services (Minneapolis, US), The Life Saving Society (Toronto, CA) do. The Mayo Clinic doesn't.  2- As the recommended dose is 2-4 J/Kg (Defibrillation in children, Pubmed, 2010 Jul-Sep)   3- Found no reference, just wondering whether the nature of the pads would lead to a calibration problem impairing the rhythm detection process.

362,Can toxins accumulate in the liver?,"There are many articles and products that claim that toxins (pollutants from the environment, chemicals from pesticides, heavy metals from drinking water, etc.) can accumulate in the liver and cause adverse health effects. Many times, a ""liver detox"" is recommended to help the liver clear out these toxins.  Some examples:     If you inhale or ingest something toxic then the toxins enter your circulation and head directly to your liver. [...] If your liver cannot do its job well or has been inundated with too much work (toxic exposure, illness, etc), then toxic levels rise in your blood and this is considered a significant stress by your body as these toxins can irritate vital organs like your heart, brain, and kidneys as they remain in the circulation too long.   (from article Liver Detox: Get Rid of Toxins)     If âthe normâ for you is constant misery and dis-ease, it may be an indication that your body and liver are overloaded with function-impeding toxins. In such instances, the best course of action is to take inventory of your lifestyle to remove the sources of toxins and complement that lifestyle change with a liver cleanse using all-natural, organic methods.   (from blog post Symptoms of Liver Toxicity)  There seems to be some vagueness here. In at least in these two examples, the ""toxins"" aren't specified. My question is: Is there any validity to these claims? Can harmful compounds bioaccumulate in the liver? "
363,Where can I find statistics about micronutrients deficiencies in European countries?,"Data from the USDA show that many US residents fail to meet adequate intakes -based on average requirement- of several micronutrients.  For example only 8% of US citizens meet requirements for fiber, 7.6% for potassium, and 43% for magnesium, 51% for vitamin C and 13.6% for vitamin E.  Where can I find similar statistics for european countries? "
364,What is the difference between the AAO and the ABO?,"What is the difference between the American Association of Orthodontists, and the American Board of Orthodontics from the perspective of a patient?  When I am evaluating two orthodontists, one of whom is a member of the AAO, and one of whom is a member of the ABO, what do those affiliations tell me about the two orthodontists? "
365,How do blue light filtering lenses work? Is it possible that they could they negatively impact your vision?,"I have had some recent trouble with my vision and while trying to figure out what was going on one of the possible factors was a blue light reflective coating on my lenses.  While that has been mostly ruled out at this point I am still curious about how likely this is to be an issue at all.  So, how does this blue light coating work?  Is it possible that this filtering could have an impact on your vision? "
366,Electromagnetic Light and Radio Pulses in Combination against Skin Conditions,"Reading up on recent developments in the treatments for Hidradenitis suppurativa I came across a brand new option. Î¤hat option, if true, would by absolutely sensational on several fronts:  The so called lAight therapy (English version of page). ""Using a combination of intense light and radio wave pulses"". (Apparently no UV, no laser and not for hair removal?) After initial skepticism about this seemingly commercial quackery it was revealed that it was developed at or with Mainz University and apparently approved â officially as a medical device under EU law â but it is not yet widespread.   On their marketing page they say that the treatment has the following effects:   Antibacterial effect Reduction of sebum production Stimulation of blood circulation Stimulation of tissue regeneration Reduction of hair follicle blockage Anti inflammatory   Given the hideous state of sufferers and the medical knowledge of this disease as well I was looking for studies on this technique. Claims and praise for its effectiveness seem a bit over the top, indicating a very wide range of application, among them classical acne vulgaris and scars.  These studies seem to be non existent? Where is the NICE-study? (NonInvasive Combination therapy in acnE inversa, 2014-2016) [note that the names for this condition AE and HS seem interchangeable or a cultural matter](g). How could this method be approved, be on the market since 2017, if the studies supporting it are apparently ""one"" and still not ""in print""?  So the question is: I want to know how that is supposed to work. I presume in that study they explain some of that in theory and in their observed outcome. But I can not locate that study or other studies1 going into the same direction.    1: Apart from those studies list at the bottom of the product page.   A little background on the development and approval is published in Das unbekannte Leiden. Gist: two medical outsiders had an idea, presented their case to the university for conducting a proper trial and after still encouraging immediately founded a company to promote their product. Currently it seems that their is an astro turfing campaign or real general interest in the subject. Non-medical articles in German are numerous. Suspiciously so. By far not all of them quack. The procedure appears to gain traction with respectable dermatologists. "
367,Flickering/flashing in corner of eye and nausea when exposed to certain patterns,"Before I begin I'd like to say that I've already seen an ophthalmologist who has since referred me to a ophthalmic neurologist. I'm asking because this is freaking me out and I was hoping for some explanation. Preferably one I can take to my doctor and ask ``is this it?""  So the problem is that certain patterns will cause shimmering and flashing out of the corner of my left eye. It isn't an issue with my right eye. For what it's worth, I'm more near-sighted in my left eye, but I wear corrective lenses for that.  It kind of looks like this: [website]As for the nausea...it's nausea. It's not so bad that I'll vomit, but it's very unpleasant.  This doesn't happen unless triggered by the way, and the ophthalmologist said my eye is structurally sound.  To be clear, I'm not asking for advice. That's why I've seen one doctor already and he, in turn, has sent me to someone who specializes specifically in neurological conditions involving the eye/sight. I'm really just looking for some piece of mind as I wait. "
368,"Do we lose resistance to the common cold over time, or are we infected by a different cold each time?","In Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond it says our resistance to the flu and common cold is only ""temporary"".  However, I was under the impression that if we get a flu/cold we stay immune forever, but we can easily get a different flu/cold later.  Which one is correct?  Does our resistance go away, or is it a matter of getting a new flu/cold? "

370,Magnesium gel vs magnesium oil,What is more effective - magnesium gel or magnesium oil?  Some context - I'm applying it over almost the entire body to help with psychogenic muscle constrictions that are likely caused by my OCD.  A Bowen-technique therapist recommended that I go for oil rather than gel. Is there evidence that it is really superior? 
371,How does the abbreviation BID apply to medication dosing?,"In a prescription such as this:     omeprazole 20 mg BID   I know BID means two times per day.   However, does this mean to take half the dose of 20 mg (10 mg) in the morning plus 10 mg in the evening?  Or does it mean to take the full dose (20 mg) in the morning plus 20 mg in the evening? "
372,Is there evidence that humans should fast intermittently daily for 16 hours because it is healthy in general?,"There is a big fasting boom on the internet, but it is hard to sift through the claims of fitness and health bloggers and the real evidence.   I have spent hours reading studies on fasting - it is obvious many have concluded that various forms of fasting actually do induce several health benefits such as increased human growth hormone production, augmented metabolic regulation of Sirtuins (that may play a role in decreased carcinogenesis and slower ageing), increased neural autophagy, increased neural cell growth, increased lifespan and others.  While this sounds amazing and more human studies are needed, I wonder if anybody knows if we can already infer from the evidence we have an optimal feeding pattern for humans?  I feel (I am not sure exactly) that the 16:8 intermittent fasting pattern (16 hours fasting and 8 hours of feeing time daily) has had some research done on it, but yet again, mostly non-scientists propagate the idea. I am looking less for other/new evidence of fasting's health benefits, but rather for science-backed conclusions. I believe we should be able to gather the evidence and implement it correctly.  I wonder about this because who wouldn't want to know how to eat in a way that would prolong our lifespan and have other health benefits?  "
373,Does muscle really weigh more than fat?,"I recently dropped 30 lbs through diet adjustments. Nothing trendy, just cutting back on prepared and processed foods and most importantly: portion sizes.  5 weeks ago I started a strength training program. Progressive overloading using compound barbell exercises: back squat, press/bench press, and deadlifts. I've never felt stronger!  The thing that's confusing me is that the scale is no longer changing. I feel like I'm eating pretty well, lots of fibre, fruits, and proteins. A lot less carbs than I used to eat.  Is this adage of ""muscle weighs more than fat"" actually true? And is it keeping my body weight around the same mark because of it? I'm lifting some seriously heavy weights at 5 weeks for a novice -- I'm 5'9"" 202lbs and yesterday I squatted 195, benched 175, and deadlifted 215. Today is a rest day and tomorrow I'll be adding 5lbs to each (hence the progressive overloading).  I can't tell if I'm still eating too much since my target weight is definitely under 200 at my height and body type. But I've never done strength training so I don't know how much muscle mass will change my expectation of a target weight because my previous experience was as a lean, aerobically fit twenty-something. "
374,Heat loss from extremities,"I have a rather peculiar and random question about heat loss during cold weather.  The head, the hands and the feet all emanate a great quantity of heat and are important regulators in mantaing optimal body temperaure. In cold weather, vasoconstriction occurs in the extremities in order to save heat; also,  sometimes there appears the cold induced vasodilatation (CVID) effect.   My question is if the legs recieve more bloodflow than the hands when walking, shouldn't the toes also have a slightly higher temperature than the fingers from the hand? Or is the adrenal vasoconstriction preventing this from happening?   P.S: I couldn't find any study that measured this absurd effect.  ð "
375,Is there scientific evidence that spacing out vaccines have any positive effects?,There are parents and doctors that agree to spread out their kids' shots. Supposedly it's easier on the baby (some babies experience fever or other ill reactions to vaccination).   But I had a thought that maybe the fever after a certain shot might be the same regardless if it's taken together with another shot or not. Or maybe the ill effect even increases as the break between shots gets reduced and there is less time for body to recover for the next shots?  Is there any evidence that taking shots one by one reduces the ill effects? 
376,Abbreviations URTI and GE in a doctor's diagnosis,"What do the two abbreviations in ""Diagnosis: urti, ge"" mean?  URTI is presumably Upper Respiratory Tract Infaction, but what does GE stand for? Could it be related to Diarrhea? "
377,Outcomes after uterine rupture,"There are several sources that list the uterine rupture rate during attempted vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) as &lt;=1%.  But what happens after that?  Stated another way, in the case of a uterine rupture during labour, what are the expected outcomes for the 1. mother and 2. baby?  The answer does not need to be VBAC specific. "
378,"Is swallowing a tiny amount of toothpaste unhealthy? If so, isn't spitting but not rinsing wrong advice?","Government of South Australia and NHS recommend:     After brushing, spit out any excess toothpaste.      Don't rinse your mouth immediately after brushing, as it'll wash away the concentrated fluoride in the remaining toothpaste.      This dilutes it and reduces its preventative effects.    Even after spitting, wouldn't some toothpaste linger in the mouth?  After brushing, it's obviously impractical to keep returning to a sink to spit every time you have saliva. So wouldn't you swallow the residual toothpaste? If 2 is true, isn't swallowing any amount of toothpaste unhealthy?   "
379,Does tonsillectomy increase the incidence of bronchitis in asthmatics as compared to sufferers of chronic Tonsillitis,"Has having allergy induced asthma which can also be aggravated by intense exercise been shown to get worse after having tonsils removed in adult males?  A common treatment for repeatedly getting Angina Tonsillitis in a short space of time is to have the tonsils removed.  Has this been shown to increase the risk of catching Bronchitis in adult asthmatics?  Angina Tonsillitis severely affects an asthmatics ability to breath easily causing airways to remain aggravated restricted often resulting in the patient having to take increased medication for extended periods of time to regain normal quality of breathing.  Has Bronchitis which is often prevented by normal functioning tonsils been shown to be worse for asthmatics than tonsillitis and are they more susceptible to catching it after having their tonsils removed than before and more so than non-asthmatics?  The following source deals with and indicates there is an increased risk of COPD following tonsil and or adenoid removal but does not deal at all with the case which I am interested in, which is if the the risk increase of incidence in asthmatics is increased after a tonsillectomy as compared to subjects who already frequently get Angina Tonsillitis.  A more detailed review of the study described here breaks down the results further.  Again this does not address my question as the dataset does not sufficiently cover adult males who already suffer from asthma and are prone to getting Tonsillitis already.  I want to know if the risk of getting a COPD disease is increased after a Tonsillectomy for subjects who are already more prone than normal to getting Tonsillitis and if the increased risk of a COPD disease has been shown to have a greater negative impact on subjects measured quality of life than chronic Tonsillitis.  Even better will be any concrete results on the measure of how asthma is affected after having both diseases. "
380,"What's the difference between a fast heart rate during exercise, and a fast heart rate during an anxiety attack?","I'm curious to know what the difference is between having a fast heart rate during exercise and having a fast heart rate say at rest or during an anxiety attack.  It's known that exercise is good for you because your heart is a muscle and benefits from the increased heart rate that you get from exercise such as cardio. So what if someone is having an anxiety attack, and has an increased heart rate similar to if they were running on a treadmill? Do they get the same cardiovascular benefit as if they were exercising? What makes the fast heart rate during the anxiety attack so detrimental, and the fast heart rate during exercise healthy? "
381,What causes the urge to urinate at a physiological level?,"Can someone describe what causes a human the urge to urinate? I understand that it's highly correlated with bladder volume, but it is not causal as bladder spasm can occur even when very little urine is in the bladder. Furthermore, there are apparently foods that can irritate the bladder such that a spasm can occur at low volumes. Thus it appears there may be a mechanical (volume) as well as chemical trigger (irritants). How do both of these triggers occur in the body and how are they related? What causes the detrusor muscle to contract? How does the bladder know when it is full? etc... "
382,At what point would blood loss impede the ability to achieve an erection?,So first I feel I should clarify this isn't to support some vampire fetish. No this is actually to bring some scientific fact to my fictional work.  How many pints in a one month period could an average man lose before it is completely impossible for him to have an erection?   Are there drugs that can extend that range? If so what? And to what new maximum?

I have just been informed that a patient of mine, whom I discharged from the ED three days ago has just been diagnosed with a subarachnoidal hemorrhage and has been admitted to the ICU.  I am deeply affected by this news and I want to present my deepest apologies to the family members.  What would be the best way of communicating the medical error? How does one apologise? I was planning on explaining how and why the medical error occurred. Is there anything else I should pay special attention to?  (We learn a lot about medical errors during medical school but not a lot about how to communicate with family members when those medical errors have occurred. I hope this question is suitable for this site. Thanks in advance.) "

386,Lesion of the Nn. fibulares,"The N. fibularis communis splits at the Caput fibulae into two separate branches. While the N. fibularis superficialis innervates the muscles in the Compartimentum cruris fibularis, the N. fibularis profundus innervates the Compartimentum curries anterius (M. tibialis anterior, M. extensor digitorum longs and M. extensor hallucis longus).    The extensors are responsible for an extension of the upper ankle joint; the fibularis-group are the only pronators of the lower ankle joint.   Thus, I would expect a lesion of the N. fibularis superficialis to result in a club-foot defect (a constant supination of the foot). However, Schulte et al. note that an isolated lesion of the N. fibularis superficialis only affects the sensitive branch of N. superficialis, and there are no motory defects.  On the other hand, an isolated lesion of the N. profundus is affecting both motory and sensory parts and will result in a foot drop and the associated steppage gait.  I assume that the motory parts of the N. superficialis probably depart from the nerve very proximal right below the Caput fibulae, and that this results in the different clinical presentations. Am I correct? What is the reason for the motory parts of the N. profundus not departing such proximally?     Cited: SchÃ¼nke, Michael, et al. PROMETHEUS Allgemeine Anatomie Und Bewegungssystem. p.546 Georg Thieme Verlag, 2018. "
387,Do humidifiers help cure the flu?,"According to this report, absolute humidity affects transmission and survival of the influenza virus with 90% accuracy. Lower humidity at winter promotes both the influenza virus transmission and its survival.  Is there any evidence that increasing humidity levels positively affects the prognosis of someone who's already been infected with the virus (i.e, either shortens the duration or diminishes the severity of the illness, not including obvious symptoms such as easing congestion etc)?  The only reason to believe this might be true is that higher humidity levels might also increase moisture in the nasal cavity thus weakening the virus but this is just a theory.  Does anyone have concrete data on this subject? "
388,Immunity of indigenous tribe,"After reading about the American missionary killed on North Sentinel Island, I realized I'm not sure how to answer the following question. One of the reasons anthropologists advise avoiding the remote island is to spare the Sentinelese tribe from our germs because they don't have immunity. The same thing happened to native South American tribes when the Portuguese and Spanish arrived (over 90% of the population was decimated from disease). My question then is why is that the native tribes were more susceptible to European diseases and not the other way around? Why weren't the Spanish and Portuguese decimated by native diseases?  "
389,Can common cold really be lethal?,"In the news reports after the murderer of John Allen Chau on the Andaman Islands, I have several times read that common cold could kill this tribe, for example in this AFP-report:  Fears that 21st century diseases as mild as the common cold could kill off the tribe  Is this really true?  My understanding of common cold is that there is basically an infinite number of different diseases (that is, different versions of bacterias or viruses) that is called common cold and after each cold you have you become immune to that specific pathogen but remain non-immune to all others that you haven't contracted. Obviously, most occurrences of common cold is not deadly although, if my understanding is correct, you are as non-immune to them as this tribe. So, is this claim that common cold could kill these people really true?  (Yes, the news reports also mentions measles and flu, but for these diseases there are vaccins you could offer this tribe) "

393,Can a temporary change in carbohydrate intake change weight?,"I've been on a low carb diet for months now, and I have noticed various weight differences from day to day when I wake up. However, the last couple of times I decided to eat a lot of carbs, I gained weight that persisted for a couple of days (about 3 lbs). I always weigh myself in the morning after using the restroom and eating a light breakfast.  Is there a known health phenomenon associated with carbs and changes in weight? Or is it more related to my body having been overweight before? "
394,Washing hands after going to the washroom to prevent epidemy,"There is widespread agreement that one should wash its hands after going to the washroom. However, a large fraction of the population does not wash their hands. These types of signs became fairly common       I understand that lots of pathogens transmit through hands, whether it is through hand shacking or door knobs. However, it is unclear to me whether our hands carry significantly more pathogens after going to the washroom than before that.  Is the advice Wash you hands after going to the washroom useful because...   our hands are filthier after going to the washroom? it is just a good way for someone to not forget to wash its hands 5-8 times a day?  "
395,Why would the following nutritional scenario lead to hunger etc?,"Basically if someone had enough calories(but from mostly from carbohydrates and saturated fat only, with a little protein), why would they still feel hungry?  I know lacking adequate protein and fats can lead to health problems but my question is more about why the body would still by hungry despite this diet e.g. Does the body need an minimun amount of calories from protein?  As an example.  Lets say someone needs 1500 callories to maintain body weight/energy. They live only on some chocolate biscuits.  The nutrition for the chocolate biscuit is as follows and they eat 16 buscuits per day:  1 biscuit/16 per day calories 116 /(so*16)= 1856 calories per day. saturated fat 6.0g /(so*16)= 48g fat per day. Carbohydrate 14g/(so*16) = 224g of which sugars 9g/(so*16) = 114g protein  1.3g/(so *16) = 10.4  Note that the diet has no polyunsuturated fats or monosaturated fats.  As you can see it exceed the 1500 calories required, uses both carbohydrate and saturated fat and only has 10.4g protein.  I know this diet would cause helth problems however that is not my question.  My questions is: Why would the body still be hungry despite well exceeding the calories required? Is it because the body needs a minimum amount of protein(more than 10.4g), the body needs a minimum amount of polyunstaturaed/monosaturated fats etc?  What is the reason?  Thanks  "

397,Raspberry Ketone Dietary Supplement? Fat-burning? Legit?,"So I found (not expired or opened) a bottle of dietary supplements in my cabinet called ""Ketone Raspberry"" and it claims to ""promote body fat reduction"", ""support increased metabolism,"" and ""PROMOTE WEIGHT LOSS"" (that part is in much bigger font).    Now I don't believe in a magic pill that will make you fit again (I'm all for traditional methods and plan to stick to that), but I was wondering if there is some element of truth to this? Does it help increase the metabolism?   On the back it states:      Raspberry Ketone helps to Block Fat -- by encouraging the body to use   fat instead of storing it, which can help you lose weight. In order to   get enough ketone to urn excess fat, you would need to eat 90 lbs of   raspberries! Forget that! Taking just 1 tablet of Raspberry Ketone   with meals is enough to get your body burning fat the way you want it   to!   Really? Really? This sounds like a fad diet to me.

402,Acid-forming vs Acidic foods,"I have always noticed, on various lists containing the pH values of common foods, that dried loose-leaf black tea is slightly alkaline (~7.2), and one of the most alkaline drinks. At the same time, if a drink black tea I usually get acid reflux and this has always puzzled me.   I recently stumbled upon the definition of acid-forming foods, which are supposed to create an acidic environment in the stomach, even if they are not by themselves acidic.   Can someone explain to me the physiology/biochemistry of this, and how do I differentiate between acid-forming and acidic foods?  Also, does the fact that black tea has been through a process of oxidation play a role in its behaviour? "
403,"How long do people remain conscious, on average, after massive trauma causing catastrophic internal bleeding?","In movies, people who are shot or stabbed in the chest, especially  in or near the heart, generally lapse into unconsciousness and/or death instantly. This doesn't seem to be the case in real life, and I assume that most filmmakers don't want to show the reality of a person gurgling, moaning, and writhing around as they slowly die from internal hemorrhaging.   The death of Patroclus in the movie Troy follows this model:  [website]For the sake of comparison, here's a summary of a couple of accounts of the death of John Lennon, who famously suffered such a fate.  The two timelines varied slightly, so I included both sets of times.  The times from the first account are the first listed, and the times from the second account follow, separated by a slash.  ~10:50/10:45:Â  Shooting   ~10:53/10:51:Â  Cops arrive, Lennon alive   ?/10:53: Cops put Lennon in car and head for the hospital   ?/11:00Â  Arrives at hospital, unconscious, not breathing, no pulse.  11:15/11:10-11:15:Â  Lennon pronounced dead  And here are two descriptions of the damage caused by the gunshots:      Three of the four bullets that struck Lennon's back passed completely through his body and out of his chest, one of which hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart; nearly all of them would have been fatal by themselves as each bullet hit vital arteries around the heart. As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow-point bullets, Lennon's affected organs (particularly his left lung) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact.   -  Wikipedia:  The Death of John Lennon    And:     One round in particular struck the subclavian vein, a primary branch of the aorta and according to the ER team and autopsy the impact caused widespread damage to the major veins of the heart.    Quora       Two bullets had passed through his upper left upper arm and entered his chest; two more entered his chest just behind the arm. Travelling through his torso, they ripped through his lungs and arteries. Three of the bullets exited the front of his chest: one under his left clavicle and two on the left side of his sternum. The fourth remained lodged inside his body.       According to Veteran, the worst injury was to Lennon's subclavian artery, a major branch of the aorta, the heart's main artery: ""He was bleeding heavily."" For 20 minutes, Veteran and his associates worked to get Lennon's heart beating again.   -  Interview with attending physician, published in Guitar World magazine.    Is Lennon's experience typical?

Are there any differences in the quality of flu shots by producer? Is there a discernible difference between those flu shots? Which facilities historically or currently provide the highest quality flu shots for me and my family?  "
407,Infectious risk associated with cat bites,"I have a 3 year-old persian cat . She is very playful and like other pets. I make monthly checkups with the vet regarding her vaccines and health.   Sometimes while playing she bites and grasps with her nails which causes scratches on my skin with little amount of blood.  Is it harmful? If yes, are there any vaccines to reduce the infectious risk? "
408,Normal for menstruation blood to be brown/black at the start?,"Lately, in addition to the more intense abdominal pain than usual, my period is manifesting itself in dark brown/black (tarry-like) blood from the start and staying like that for almost 5 days until it finally turns the bright red.   Is this something to be concerned about? Does menstrual blood change in colour during menstruation?  "
409,What's the earliest possible ovulation day/ possibly pregnant,"Been trying to conceive for over 2 years. Had my and hubby's hormones and swimmers checked, both normal. I do have a short-ish cycle, 24-26 days. I track every month and usually ovulate between days 8-10, which seems really early. My period this cycle was 2 days late, (if it was my period!?) lighter than normal, just took an ovulation test on day 4 and it was positive?? I don't want to get my hopes up but read that lh level changes could be another sign of pregnancy. Been taking preg tests all week, one right after the POS ovulation test and it was negative. I know I need to see my Dr but just going to be so anxious over the weekend and wanted some opinions.  "
410,Why do people infected with rabies have a fear of water?,"Hydrophobia comes to mind when thinking of individuals infected by rabies... But is there a scientific/medical explanation as to why rabies, specifically, causes a fear to water, specifically?   Is it because swallowing is hard when one has rabies, and since water requires swallowing, they have hydrophobia?   Or does the fear of water also extend to fears of drowning?   What exactly are they fearing of water? And how does rabies cause a fear specific to water and not just... everything? "
411,How can I detect condom failure?,"I use condom to prevent the transmission of HIV in anal sex. How can I know if the condom is broken before or during the sex?    What's the feeling when the condom breaks during the sex? If there are tiny, invisible holes on the condom that will allow HIV to pass through (for example, the condom is damaged by a needle), will it remain complete during the sex or will it break apart ""in time"" so I can know? Can I test for those holes before the sex?  "
412,When is guilt in depression considered psychotic?,"Guilt is a feature of Major clinical Depression. My doubt is, can guilt be considered delusional for making a diagnosis of mood-congruent psychotic depression? Can there be a delusional guilt?

413,Rehydrate & avoiding dehydration without excessive urination?,"I spend most of my time in nice air conditioning, but there are a few times when I anticipate allot of excercise where I'm at risk of dehydrating to the point that I will develop a headache.  Usually when playing with toddlers outside that make me do all the heavy lifting ;)  I'm learning to be more cautious of this, but it still seems like it happens a bit too often.  My first question is what to do once I already have a headache from dehydration.  I've tried simply chugging allot of water, but this just seems to lead to excessive restroom breaks, and it still takes half a day for the headache to go away.  The water seems to go through me without being absorbed or doing anything to stop a headache once it's started.  Is there a way both to speed up the process so the headache goes away faster and to avoid excessive restroom breaks in the process?  Is there only so much water I can drink at once and beyond that it's not going to help hydrate faster?  Second is how do I avoid getting dehydrated so fast?  I feel like even when i go into a situation worried about getting dehydrated and drinking many bottles of water I still end up with a headache.  I may not be drinking enough because I'm worried about just needing lots of restroom breaks, but is there something else I should be doing when I'm expecting to sweat allot that will help avoid getting a headache?  Preferable something that doesn't take me away from my activities too often :) "
414,Is Adderall safe for someone who donated a kidney?,"I donated my kidney many years ago to some random two year old.  It was major surgery, but it did get me a month paid vacation on short term disability and was a great way to lose weight (stupid kidneys weight me down) so hey I figured it was worth it ;).  I've also been taking Adderall for ADHD, and currently am on Adderall XR.  My doctor just prescribed test to check on my kidney functionality, regular procedure for Adderall.  However, it reminded me that Adderall can affect a kidney which I thought may be a problem since I only have the one remaining.  My doctor doesn't seem to consider this an issue, and I'm inclined to trust her on this.  However, I'm also not overly committed to Adderall, I can easily take any other stimulant medication (though, I wouldn't be surprised if most of them have the same kidney risks?) or Straterra if they are safer.  Is there a risk, even a small one, sufficient to warrant at least considering an alternate medication if I have only one Kidney?  or is my doctor right in considering the risk low enough to not warrant worrying about changing to another stimulant if I have one that seems to work?

415,Physical sunscreen high SPF vs high active ingredient percentage,"I'm looking at two products:   Product A contains active ingredients Zinc Oxide at 9.0%, and Titanium Dioxide at 7.0% for 113g.  It has SPF 45. Product B contains an active ingredient Zinc Oxide at 20% for 100g. It has SPF 40.   Both products are mostly naturally derived and hardly contain any chemicals - paraben free, DEA free, non-nano, etc. However I read that zinc oxide is better at blocking UVA than titanium dioxide - and here is where my confusion lies:   Which product is healthier (i.e. no long-term harmful effects on skin, and better sun protection) to use? Product A with higher SPF, or Product B with higher amount of zinc oxide?  Thank you "
416,How does the heart rate change during REM and non-REM stages?,"I read different references and I understand that the average heart rate during sleep decreases by some beats per minute. The heart rate is slower in non-REM stage than REM but I found no measurements or ranges related to the heart rate variation during these two stages. If we consider a healthy group of people, does the heart rate during REM and non-REM change within a specific range?  Is it possible to detect the REM stage by only tracking the heart rate (by wearable watches)?  Thank you! "
417,Are there any non-injection methods of delivering long-acting insulin?,"Affreza is an inhaler that delivers rapid-acting insulin through inhaling rather than injection.  But my question is, are there any methods of delivering long-acting insulin that do not require an injection?  Insulin syringes (like the ones used with Toujeo and Triceba), insulin pumps (like Medtronic), patch pumps (like V-Go), insulin ports (like I-Port), and insulin jet injectors (like Insujet) all require an injection of some kind.  But does anyone know a way to deliver long-acting insulin, either inhalable like Affreza or some other method that doesn't involve injection in any way?  Note that this is about Type II diabetes, not Type I. "

423,Why does sexual abuse have a different mental effect than physical abuse?,"I was wondering why sexual abuse may be different than physical abuse in our culture?  Is it because there is a real physiological difference in the brain, or could it be from the way society taught us to address these kind of things?  Why is being raped different than being mugged by gunpoint to the victim, i.e. why would there be more severe mental trauma when sex is involved?  I tried to find objective data on this matter, but could not. "

I weigh about 62kg  I've read the prednisolone leaflet, just to be sensible. I found in it two things that disturb me :   (1) It can come up positive in doping control (2) It raises blood pressure   My questions, relative to each of these facts, are :   (1a) Does this mean that if I do sport my performance will be artificially enhanced (1b) Am I at risk of harming myself by overdoing it (heart or whatever) ? (1c) If I run say for one hour assuming the last twenty minutes were only achieved thanks to the drug, does it still contribute to keeping me fit as much as an ordinary one hour jog ? In other words is there any point in trying to keep fit during the treatment ? (2a) If I don't suffer from high blood pressure, can the treatment raise my blood pressure to an unhealthy level ? (2b) On short term, does it raise blood pressure like when you treat yourself to a salty takeaway or does it do it to a higher degree ?  "

I am considering instituting ""music breaks"" to reduce risks related to hearing loss.  A 10-20 minute review of websites haven't really given me anything better than ""breaks"". Before diving into papers I thought I'd ask here.  What sort of regime is optimal? Is there something that gives me a good 80/20 payoff?  Example regimens:   1 minute of complete silence via earplugs every 30 minutes 5 minutes of complete silence via every hour   Separately, is there a meaningful difference between music / talking / white noise in terms of risk of hearing loss? How much better is complete silence than mere quiet?  The lack of clearer advice from healthcare source makes me suspect that no one really knows.

440,Does eating a sugary multivitamin bring you into the fed state for intermittent fasting?,"Intermittent Fasting Overview  I'm doing intermittent fasting. This diet restricts eating to narrow time window to increase fat burn through an increase in the release of growth hormone. As suggested by Greg O'Gallagher (Kinobody) and what I also find most convenient, I will be restricting my eating to lunch at 12:00pm and dinner at 6:00pm.   Fasted VS Fed State  My dilemma is that I must eat an Airborne multivitamin/mineral and Vitafusion calcium gummy tablet at 8:00am before I leave for work. Both use real sugar. Will eating these sugary tablets bring me into the fed state, thereby shutting off all the hormonal benefits of the fasted state? I understand that eating a slice of cake will put me into the fed state, but I don't understand how a few grams of sugar affect the body's hormones. Does the body work like a light switch or more like a light dimmer in regards to intermittent fasting?  Minute Details:   I eat chewable tablets because I have trouble swallowing pills. All chewable tablets contain sugar probably because they're marketed to kids.  I eat the tablets at 8:00am because most people suggest taking them in the morning, although they've never stated any reasons. I prefer to store the tablets in the safety of my home rather than bring them to work. I don't people tampering with them.  "
441,Effect of antibiotics on breastfed infant,"My 9-month old son has been diagnosed with mild bronchiolitis and prescribed 5 days of Azithromycin (not so much to cure a virus-induced bronchiolitis, but in order to prevent possible pneumonia).  Taking aside an obvious concern on prescribing antibiotics for a mild disease (and i have already heard wildly conflicting opinions on this from fellow pediatricians, to the point of me being completely confused), my question is this:  How does breastfeeding impact the negative influence of antibiotics on the infant body, e.g. gut flora? Are there any studies made?  Thanks! "

From all the blogs and articles out there on Zika, it is obvious that this virus is a serious threat to pregnant mothers and even newborn babies.  What is not apparent in all this literature is: at what age is Zika no longer a threat for microcephaly in infants? What's the cutoff?  I have a 10-month old and a 3-year old - is there cause for concerns outside of the normal viral symptoms or are they both developed enough to be ""in the clear""?  If you can find literature to support your claims that's definitely even more reassuring! "
443,Is the use of antibiotics justified for respiratory viral infections?,"It is a widespread belief that antibiotics should not be used for treating viral infections, as they are effective against bacteria, not viruses (see e.g. [website]However, antibiotics continue to be prescribed, mostly due to patient demand, and also because of fear of complications (FoxNews article). In case of respiratory viral infections secondary bacterial pneumonia is often mentioned as a cause of concern and a reason for antibiotics prescription (2006 study).  Also, this article states that      Around one person in 20 with bronchitis may develop a secondary infection in the lungs leading to pneumonia. The infection is commonly bacterial although the initial infection that caused the bronchitis may be viral.   Some studies also say that certain classes of antibiotics (e.g. macrolides) have positive anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects (2012 study).  What I'm confused about is this: in case when there are no secondary bacterial infection symptoms, is antibiotics usage justified? Does the risk of secondary infection outweigh the negative effects of antibiotics?  P.S. I am reposting this question from Skeptics.SE, as it seems to be mostly opinion-based. "

448,I am 15 and 163 cm tall - will I grow taller?,"I am a 15 year old Indian. I currently stand at 163 cms but I weigh 75 kg, which is overweight I know. But is there any way I'll grow more? If yes, how much?  My dad's height is 172 cm and my mom is 157.  I've been measuring my height for some time now and I've grown about 5 cms in the last 6-7 months. However, I haven't had a huge growth spurt yet. But one of my grandads is just about 148 cms, I guess. So will I grow taller?  I don't think that this question is a duplicate. Here, I just asked if I could grow taller. But that is a purely scientific question, I believe.  Diet: I eat a mainly vegetarian diet with some chicken at least 2 days a week. I drink a glass of milk about 3 days a week. But I don't eat any other meat than chicken. I also eat some fruits 3 days in a week. However, I'm willing to change my diet if that would help me grow.  Exercise: I usually play sports. But these days I haven't been able to, because of my school work. But I have been thinking of working out to reduce fat. "
449,Does choice of drink affect severity of hangovers?,"I'm sure there are big effects from obvious things like amount of alcohol consumed, individual susceptibility, hydration, and so on.  But holding all that constant, I've also seen some unsupported claims that different drinks can cause varying severity of hangovers, due to different chemical composition - additives (e.g. sulfites) or other naturally produced organic compounds besides the ethanol.  Easily found mass-media articles (e.g. this one and this one) pretty much exclusively talk about congeners. It's unclear whether that's just because that's the one thing that's been established in studies or because it's the dominant factor, and it's unclear how strong the effects are.  Is there research to either suggest that congeners are the dominant factor (not just one of many), or that there are other factors? And how strong is the variation in severity, whatever the causes may be? "
450,Does stopping fever hinder the process of killing bacteria via fever?,"Since the body produces fever in order to kill bacteria, wouldn't decreasing the fever by taking anti fever medication decrease the body's ability to fight the bacteria?

451,How harmful is it to drink a mix of beverages?,"I remember a long time ago (perhaps 20 years ago) that an elementary school textbook on health said ""mixing alcohol beverages exacerbates the strength of the alcohol in the drink, thereby potentially being fatal to those who drink mixed beverages.""  Is this actually true? To my knowledge, basic chemistry dictates that you cannot have more concentration of an element than there was before you mixed the two beverages; for instance, if you mix 100ml of beer(4.5%) and 10ml of spirits(20%), you will only have a 110ml of mixed beverage with 6.5ml of alcohol(4.5%*100+20%*10). In other words, you will have a 110ml(5.9%) drink. Which can't be that much more dangerous than drinking 100ml of beer(4.5%).   So maybe I am remembering the textbook wrongly -- maybe it said that mixing drinks leads you to drink more alcohol? Or is it true that there is a third effect going on -- maybe mixing two different drinks leads to a new, more stronger substance that is greater than the mix of the two drinks? Perhaps because different drinks have different kinds of ethanol mixed into them such that when you combine the two there is a sort of alchemy that makes two seemingly harmless drinks into a sip of poison?  I wonder... "
452,Why do testosterone / anabolic steroid injection increase the risk of tendon rupture?,"In {1}, a physician mentions that testosterone injections increase the risk of tendon rupture. The controlled study {2}, based on  medical histories from 142 experienced male bodybuilders age 35â55, concluded:     AAS (Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid) abusers, as compared to otherwise similar bodybuilders, showed a markedly increased risk of tendon ruptures, particularly upper body tendon rupture.   In the discussion section, {2} hypothesized that  testosterone injection increase the risk of tendon rupture because ""causes massive hypertrophy of muscles without causing any corresponding strengthening of the associated tendons"":     The causes of AAS-associated tendon rupture are still incompletely understood. Two alternative (and not mutually exclusive) hypotheses should be considered. One possibility is that AAS use has little or no deleterious effect on tendons themselves, but merely causes massive hypertrophy of muscles without causing any corresponding strengthening of the associated tendons. Thus, the muscle may simply become too strong for its tendon, increasing the possibility of rupture in response to a sudden stress. Alternatively, it is possible that high doses of AAS, perhaps in conjunction with intense muscular exercise, may damage the structure of the tendons themselves, making them more vulnerable to rupture even in the absence of excessive stress. Evidence favoring the latter hypothesis comes from various animal studies, which have typically found that AAS exposure, usually in conjunction with exercise, led to collagen dysplasia, causing tendons to become stiffer and less flexible, with an increased crimp angle and earlier liability to failure.14, 21, 30â32, 34â39, 52 However, one human study using electron microscopy found no evidence of collagen fibril ultrastructural abnormalities in the ruptured tendons of two AAS users as compared to two non-AAS-using controls.9 Another recent study found no significant difference in maximal strain and toe limit strain in the patellar tendons of 8 long-term AAS users as compared to 8 experienced weightlifters reporting no AAS use, also arguing against the hypothesis of changes in collagen crimp pattern associated with AAS use.47 Thus the evidence for a direct toxic effect of AAS on human tendons remains somewhat inconclusive.      Although our study provides no direct evidence on the above issues, it is notable that we found a markedly increased risk of upper body tendon ruptures in AAS users versus non-using weightlifters, whereas the risk of lower body tendon ruptures was only modestly and non-significantly increased among AAS users. If indeed AAS use causes damage to human tendon architecture, one might predict that our AAS users, with histories of very extensive exposure to very high doses of AAS, would show a uniformly elevated prevalence of all types of tendon rupture throughout the body, rather than primarily an elevated risk of upper-body tendon ruptures. Therefore, our findings might be taken to weigh to at least some degree against a hypothesis of direct tendon damage, and might weigh more in favor of the simple theory that hypertrophied muscles can more easily break their tendons. In favor of the latter possibility, it is notable that AAS users are particularly prone to increase upper body musculature, leading to massively hypertrophied pectoralis, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii muscles, while often showing less of an effect on lower body musculature.43 Thus, it is conceivable that muscle hypertrophy alone might account for our findings without postulating an additional mechanism of AAS-induced tendon damage.   Since this study has been published, has there been any progress on the understanding of AAS-associated tendon ruptures?    References:   {1} [website]{2} Kanayama, Gen, James DeLuca, William P.

453,What really happens to the heart during cardiac arrest and why is an AED useful?,"I'm interested in studying medicine in the future and this question is really bothering me. So most sources would say that Cardiac Arrest occurs when the heart 'stops functioning normally' and hence cannot pump blood effectively to our organs, including the brain which causes us to lose consciousness and breathing. We also know that a defibrillator cannot be used to restart a heart that has no rhythm, only to reset a chaotic one. So why then, is an AED useful if cardiac arrest causes the heart to stop? (assuming that that's what happens during cardiac arrest...) Does the rapid CPR cause it to start having some sort of rhythm again? Or is it that cardiac arrest actually doesn't STOP the heart completely, but the slightest ventricular fibrillation could cause oxygen deficiency in the brain and cause us to lose consciousness?  "

456,Vaginal fluid to heal cuts,"yes this is a very weird question.   So i have noticed that when my girlfriend orgasms, and if im using my fingers and they happen to have a cut(we are both tested and clean), the cut heals super fast when covered in her orgasm fluid (im talking about hours, so its really fast).  My question is, why does this happen? What is the substance responsible for the healing? Can this property be used in the medical field somehow? "

460,Why can't Jane give blood?,"I have a friend, lets call her Jane. Jane is not allowed to give blood, this is because she has a medical condition whereby she is prone to having polyps in her digestive system. As I understand this means she has a higher risk of cancer.  Can this sort of cancer be passed through blood and if not why is this restriction in place? I.e what is this a precaution against? The situation may be more complicated than I realise, but this is my basic understanding.  If it's relevant Jane lives in the UK. "
461,Should I get my kids have pre-exposure rabies vaccination due to our cat,"I live in Texas, USA. There is plenty of wildlife around here, and thus considerable records of rabies incidents transmitted by them. We have a cat less than a year old, and had 1st rabies vaccination. He goes out almost daily and sometimes even spends the night out. He has an independent nature, and trying to restrict him indoors is likely to cause him abandon us. I have 3 kids ages ranging from 3 to 10. They all love to play with him. He is very playful. But he sometimes bites either as part of playing or to express displeasure, e.g., if my 3 year old held him against his will. It does not cause bleeding but it is likely to penetrate the skin. There are also rare incidences of scratching that cause bleeding. Should I have my kids have pre-exposure rabies vaccination as a preventive measure?  Based on what I am reading, even if the cat is exposed, rabies would not make its way to his saliva because he is vaccinated. But then, there is the chance of his rabies vaccination did not work. Even if it did work, I assume it could be possible to carry and transmit externally, e.g., nails and teeth.   Overall, if there is 1% chance over the course of say 10 years, I would take it as a considerable chance because it is a life and death matter and we may not notice our kids exposed before it is too late. In that case, would the cost and side-effects of vaccination for kids worth it? "

So far, I have the following:   Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) poisoning Methanol poisoning   Any other indications?  Looking at the FDA approved drugs page, it would seem that all alcohol-based preparations are now discontinued. Am I to take it that fomepizole has rendered alcohol as a pharmacotherapy obsolete? "

473,Long-term effects of lens removal as the vitreous ages?,"In a case of pediatric cataract surgery where the lens was not replaced, there is no lens to serve as a barrier between the aqueous and the vitreous.  I once asked an ophthalmologist what keeps them from mixing together in that case -- are they of different viscosities, like oil and water, for instance?  She said it's something like that, but that with aging the vitreous gradually thins (causing floaters, among things) and they end up blending together.  She said this isn't really a problem in practice, as each humour's main function is to deliver nutrients to the right parts of the eye and they can still do that.  I understand that the aqueous drains through a duct, so that part isn't a closed system.  But the vitreous usually is a closed system, as I understand it, which is why floaters don't go away.  A remedy for floaters that is sometimes brought up is vitrectomy, but that carries risk of retinal detachment (according to Wikipedia, and I think I remember hearing that from an ophthalmologist too).  Putting all of these together, it seems possible that with aging, as the vitreous becomes less distinct from the aqueous, some of the vitreous might end up draining through the same duct that the aqueous drains through, in an eye with no lens to serve as a barrier.  Is that the case?  And if it is, does it carry with it a higher risk of the things that can go wrong with vitrectomy (especially retinal detachment)?  Or does the risk that comes with that procedure not arise with a slow, gradual aging process?  Update: I've seen a reference to the hyaloid membrane, which, in addition to the lens, sits between the vitreous and aqueous.  I don't know if this membrane is also removed when a lens is removed or if it remains. "

480,What are the cures for gray hair?,"As we know hair turns gray or white hair due to a lack of pigmentation and melanin.  This article and study from 2009 and 2013 suggest that accumulation of H2O2 is due to oxidative stress which can affects human hair color leading to low serotonin and melatonin levels.  So it seems that elevated amounts of hydrogen peroxide can be the main cause of gray hair. Therefore removing/dissolving hydrogen peroxide from hair follicles (under the scalp) and hair shafts would help to reverse going gray from age. Is that correct?  I'm asking for interpretation of above studies. If so, does it mean we've already a cure for gray hair? What are these cures?  So far I've heard about depo-melanin containing some acid which could potentially dissolving hydrogen peroxide under the scalp to prevent gray hair and this is what they claim:     Depo-melanin is a 100% drug free hair serum that is formulated with the main ingredients of pseudocatalase and catalase, which is scientifically proven to prevent gray hair.   Is that true? Does it mean we've the cure for gray hair? Or there are any other cures? "
481,Why do I eat anything I like and yet not gain weight?,"I eat anything I like without regard to calorie-value. Pies, carbohydrates, cream, butter - everything that is generally considered fattening.  I do not get any exercise beyond regular commuting/housework. This means I do not go to the gym, or jog or explicitly work out in any way, though I do bike small distances to commute.  Iâve been to a few health talks, and they have always suggested that with my lifestyle, I should be gaining a lot of weight. However, I am not only not gaining weight, but actually losing weight at a slow pace over the last few years. My BMI is close to perfect.  I live a normal life, apart from the fact that I tire easily. This is the reason I donât exercise. I once attended a yoga class where the instructor claimed that after some light yoga in the morning, participants would feel energized all day. Whereas other participants reported that this was indeed the case with them, I would go home and need to sleep (presumably from exhaustion). From childhood, I have always been described by friends and family as having a âweak constitutionâ.  However, I stress that as long as I donât explicitly exercise, I function perfectly normally, and probably come across as a generally energetic individual, though I still seem to need more sleep than average (8.5 to 10 hours). I do not have any medical problems at all (assuming that âweak constitutionâ does not qualify as a disease or medical condition).  Why is it that I can eat fattening foods, not exercise, and yet not put on weight? I have been told that this is due to a âhigh metabolic rateâ. I have an intuitive idea of what this means, but what are its consequences? Is it a good or bad thing? If both, what are the positive and negative aspects of it? Should I try to exercise? How can I do so without exhausting myself?  Iâm 29 and male. "
482,Can consuming food that was cooked with olive oil have a negative impact on health?,"Olive oil is often presented as a healthy alternative to other oils for cooking. The problem is, depending who you ask, it sometimes is presented as something to avoid, toxic, dangerous.  For example, this article claims:     Many people believe that it is unsuitable for cooking because of the unsaturated fats. I used to believe in this myth, but after doing more research I realized that I was mistaken. Today, Iâd like explain why olive oil is an excellent choice for cooking, even for high heat methods like frying.   And this one claims:     With scientists advising against cooking with olive oil - it is claimed to produce toxic chemicals when heated - what should you use instead?   What's the actual scientific consensus? Does it really affects the health negatively? Should we be worried and avoiding it? "

Why are some pain medications OTC and others only available by a prescription? "
485,"Do NSAIDs ""Relieve Pain"" or is it a Byproduct?","   NSAIDs work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and/or COX-2). In cells, these enzymes are involved in the synthesis of key biological mediators, namely prostaglandins which are involved in inflammation, and thromboxanes which are involved in blood clotting.   [website]I am trying to understand what ibuprofen / aspirin / etc actually do. I know nothing about biology, so I don't really know what ""pain"" really is. With that said, do NSAIDs just reduce inflammation, thereby reducing pain as a ""side-effect"". Or do they reduce inflammation and have another, primary, effect of reducing pain somehow?  In short, let's say I burn my arm. Will ibuprofen reduce pain, or does it only reduce pain when an injury is aggrevated by inflammation, e.g. inflammed cartilage rubbing together? "
486,Can tumor size (T) and presence of cancer in the lymph nodes (N) in patients with lung cancer be identified on the first visit?,"I am a scientific researcher working on lung cancer. I am trying to develop a machine learning method able to process just few early detection features and then predict if a patient with lung cancer will develop metastasis (or not).  In my current statistical model, I am using the values of the following features as input:   T (tumor size) feature of the TNM staging system N (presence of cancer in the lymph nodes) feature of the TNM staging system age   From the values of these features related to a patient, my machine learning method should predict if he/she will have metastasis or not.  Before proceeding with this project, I need to know if my hypothesis is correct.  Two questions:  1) Can the T (tumor size) feature and the N (presence of cancer in the lymph node) feature be detected by doctors and their biomedical machines on the first visit?  2) My method would be useful in case the tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, and age of a patient were available, when metastasis has not been detected (yet). Is this scenario realistic?  Thank you! "
487,Did the emergence of H1N1 flu in 2009 significantly increase overall spread of influenza in humans for future years?,"According to the quick info on this search link:   [website]H1N1 (swine) flu started with pig, bird, and human flu viruses mixing DNA into a 2009 pandemic strain. Since then, H1N1 has been a fixture of annual flu reporting, and according to the link above, it's now considered a seasonal flu right next to  H3N2 influenza A.  Additional references: spread and mutation patterns  [website][website]According to the study in the link above, H3N2 flu strains are constantly being transmitted and mutated around in east and southeast Asia, quickly spreading to other nations (usually through plane travel) in their respective flu seasons. Each strain of H3N2 typically causes a wave of infections outside the east/southeast Asia region and then dies out (source: the Vox link above).  H1N1 behaves more like an influenza B strain in mutation and infection patterns (source: the Business Insider news link above). It doesn't mutate as quickly and tends to remain local, although it can persist for years in the same geographic neighborhood.  The metrics: Define the number of flu infections for a year in a country as the sum of the total number of times a person caught the flu in that country. For example, if you got the flu (different strains) 3 times in your home country over a season, you add 3 to this metric for your country. This number of points gets counted over every person in each country.   Overseas infection rule: If you are visiting another country and are infected with a flu virus, this counts against the country you are visiting for purposes of the above metric.  International travel rule: Flu infections received on a plane, international mass commercial transit, or a port used for such transit count against the country where the source originated. For example, if a visitor from Country 1 with an active flu infection travels via plane to Country 2 and infects a number of people there at an airport terminal, all of the people infected at the terminal are counted against Country 1.  Define the total number of global infections in a year as the above metric summed up across all countries for the given year.  The question: Does the existence of H1N1 as a seasonal strain significantly increase the total number of global flu infections each year according to the above metric? In particular, does H1N1 throw in additional misery (in terms of total number of global flu infections) each year, or would the slack have been made up through extra spread and dominance of traditional flu strains if H1N1 never existed? "
488,To what degree does tactile stimulation affect muscle tone?,"Hard to find the appropriate board for this, but I'm after an answer from a neuro-perspective.  A Naprapath once tested the tone of different muscles concluding that I was, quoting, (globally) ""hypertonic"". My question(s) specifically regards this test/assessment of tonicity that roughly went as follows:  Procedure:        Asking the patient to resist the practitioners force with some muscle, e.g. trying to force the patient's arm downwards while the patient is pushing it upwards.   Stimulating another muscle or part of the body (nociceptors/free nerve endings in the skin above/around some muscle or other part of the body) by gentle touch such as scratching; palming; flicking; and even snapping ones fingers above the skin (to ""create sonic waves affecting nociceptors over a larger area"");   Repeating step 1.      Example 1: Asking the patient to force the head forward (backward) into the practitioners hand, which pushes back to even out the force. Then gently flicking the patients nose upwards (downwards) and repeating the same task again. Possibly, the second time, the muscles would have a significantly (noticeable by this test) higher tone.  Example 2: Asking the patient to lie on her back, resist the practitioners force which pushes the right or left leg inwards (by pushing outwards); Then asking the patient to hold one hand (gently) on her chin, and then repeating the resisting of the same force. (If there had been some trauma to the chin, this had apparently shown in the muscle tone in a significant way.  The purpose is to see if the muscles can be made less tonic or relaxed (weaker) this way, by stimulation of nociceptors.   Loose explanation from the practitioner: ""Stiffness of muscles are almost always caused by some trauma or damage to the body; I am trying to find the surface of your body where this damage is located (by gently touching it while asking you to resist my force to see if the tone of the muscle changes)"". By 'tone' here, they seem to loosely mean that a high tone would imply that I can quickly ""lock"" my muscles and thus resist quickly, and my resisting is perceived as strong, while low would be the opposite. And in this part of the assessment it doesn't seem to matter what muscle they're testing the tone of, it would supposedly affect most muscles if I touched the right place.     Question(s):      Are there any neurological basis for a procedure like the one described above? i.e. How could such gentle touch of the skin affect muscle tone somewhere else in the body? (Perhaps if there's prior, healed, damage to the place of touch.) Would you refer to some explanations, and/or studies?   EDIT: No massaging or pressure point therapy is involved, the stimulations are mild (e.g. gently scraping a toothpick over the skin, or resting ones hand on the skin).  EDIT2 (Additional information): The methods of which this assessment/test is part of is apparently called P-DTR, and was founded by Jose Palomar Lever from Mexico. Not much seems to be publicly known about them however, and I cannot find anything published about these methods. I will post a separate question about this on a different forum and post links here. So, I want to stress, the main question here regards the neurological basis for such an assessment of muscle tone. "

491,Inhaling pills possible?,"A friend of mine told me some time ago that it actually can be dangerous to take pills (the process of taking it), which to me seemed like a pretty bold statement -- swallowing a pill doesn't seem to be that hard.  The idea was that if you are not careful enough and for example start coughing while taking the pill and then try to swallow it again, the pill could end up in your lungs and cause all kinds of nasty things. I don't really know a lot about medicine and therefore I was a bit surprised at first (this didn't seem to be that far fetched at all). Upon thinking a bit about it and googling I really couldn't find anything useful. A lot of articles talk about swallowing things you shouldn't (battery, etc.) and what to do then, but I really didn't find anything understandable about inhaling a pill.   So can this happen? Would you know that it happend? And is there an upper limit of how big the pill can be (I imagine that inhaling a pill of 2mm x 2mm x 2mm is a lot easier, if possible, than a 1cm x 5mm x 5mm or something the like). If it can happen, what are you supposed to do if it happens?  PS. Let's, for the sake of argument, assume that you are not a child or a extremely old person (or any other kind of group of people that could have problems with swallowing).

492,What are the benefits or drawbacks of my primary care physician having hospital admitting privileges?,"In the United States, what are the reasons for and against choosing a primary care physician who has hospital admitting privileges?  For example, if my primary care physician does not have hospital admitting privileges, and I need to check into a hospital as in inpatient, will my PCP be able to participate in my care while I'm in the hospital?  If not, will a doctor who works in/for the hospital will be 100% responsible for coordinating and/or administering my care?  Considering the time, expense, and rules involved in obtaining and maintaining admitting privileges, could it be that a PCP might tend to admit a patient to a hospital unnecessarily? "
493,Lymph node swelling,"I'm sure that most of us had, at some point in their life, swollen lymph nodes (be it because of a flu or some other kind of not-too-serious illness) and there is generally no reason to panic if one finds a swollen lymph node on their body. Now, even if the swelling is often associated with something harmless in certain cases it can be dangerous and needs further checking by doctors. If you  google when you should see your doctor, one often finds lists like these.     if your swollen lymph nodes:         Have appeared for no apparent reason    Continue to enlarge or have been present for two to four weeks   Feel hard or rubbery, or don't move when you push on them   Are accompanied by persistent fever, night sweats or unexplained    weight loss         (Source)   The first and last point seem quite intuitive to me, or at least, I as a non-medic can check that. But the two middle points are somewhat confusing to me.   For example, have been present for two to four weeks, so does this mean, that if it isn't something serious, they should disappear in two to four weeks, and if it is something serious than they wouldn't disappear at all? Or would it take them longer than that to disappear and therefore the doctor couldn't determine what the problem is? The third point is something that seems completely indefinable for a non-medic. I'm mean, what exactly is hard/rubbery (any reference, like f.e. a rock, or more like a eraser). The same goes for the comment don't move when you push on them. What exactly should I expect when I push them? How far should I be able to push them? Does pushing inwards, not to the side, also count? What to do if they don't really hurt?  Of course, all of these questions are simply answered by calling your doctor and going, if something like this arises. But nevertheless it would be nice if someone could maybe clarify a bit what the two middle points in the quote from above exactly mean. "
494,Race and bone marrow donor search,"I've heard the argument that race is not a real scientific entity several times. Despite what on the surface look like very different traits, humans share significantly more DNA with each other than there are differences between them. Furthermore, the genetic variation within the continent of Africa is greater than what the variation between a typical Nigerian or Norwegian could be. However, I recently heard of a campaign in Israel to find a bone marrow donor for a woman suffering from Cancer. The campaign asked for anyone of Yemeni descent to provide a saliva sample in order to find a match.   So my question is if race does not exist then why are people of Yemeni descent more likely to be better bone marrow matches? What do you call the fact that they are more likely to be a better match if not race? "
495,Consistency of fingerprint after an injury,"If the skin is completely abraised or otherwise removed, will the renewed skin have the same fingerprint?  About 8 years back, I was running an obstacle course and one of the obstacles was to climb up a vertical rope, reach the top and come back down. I climbed up no problem but I didn't know how to come down, so I slid down the rope at the expense of friction to break the velocity. The rope was made of jute. This resulted in the skin from my finger tips and parts of my palms to completely tear away. The tears were deep enough to reveal muscle.  It took about a month or two for the skin to completely come back. My question is, when such an injury occurs, is it plausible to assume that my fingerprints now are the same as they were before the injury? If yes, what mechanism goes into ensuring this?  "
496,Using farsighted glasses to counter nearsightedness?,"Edit:  I might not have worded my question well enough. A shorter and more direct version would be:   Can nearsightedness be just a result of eyes getting accustomed to working at very close distances most of the time? If so, can it be possible to revert that adjustment by wearing anti-corrective glasses to make those short distances seem longer? Can wearing anti-corrective glasses potentially cause any long lasting eyesight damage?   Original question:  I had pretty much perfect eyesight till about 13 years, at which point I started using computers a lot. Since then my eyesight seems to have been degrading slowly, which is probably related. By the age of 18 I had about 1.0 nearsightedness. However, after the following 7 years of university and a very computer-bound job, I think it hasn't even reached 1.5, even though I was using computers much more than before. It's like it degrades just enough to accommodate for regularly staring at a screen, not even half a meter away at times.  That made me wonder. Sitting further away from monitors just isn't practical most of the time, even though I can see everything fine from at least twice the usual distance, but what if I started wearing farsighted glasses in front of computer instead? The screen would look like it's further away, so logically my eyes should not have to get used to looking at such close objects.  Does it even make sense? Am I missing something? Can trying that hurt my eyesight somehow? It seems like it should work, but I could not find any related info. "

498,"Consistently high WBC, normal CRP in a post-cardiac arrest patient","A patient had an elective coronary angioplasty which showed 80% blocked LAD. A stent was placed. She was stable and sent home. The next day she felt unwell and collapsed with LOC for a few seconds. She was taken back to hospital and was admitted to CCU for observation. She had sinus bradycardia around 40. That night she was bradycardic and went into bradycardia-induced VT leading to VF and full arrest. Fortunately, she was resuscitated and a temporary pacemaker (TPM) was inserted. They planned to insert a permanent pacemaker (PPM) within the next few days; however, her WBC count was 20 000, predominantly neutrophils. CRP was 19. Her baseline before angioplasty was within normal range. It's been 3 weeks since then, multiple blood and urine cultures have been negative, no fever, she seems to be improving physically. She has been on a multitude of antibiotics including piptaz + amoxicillin and now vancomycin. Each antibiotic initially reduced WBC count to a few figures but back up the next day. At the moment its hovering at 16K.  The initial TPM was removed and replaced with another a week ago in hope that it was likely TPM lead infection.  Why would she have a raised WBC count with no other suggestion of infection? Do post arrest patients have a high WBC count due to reperfusion injury? Or could it be a reaction to foreign body? "
499,Low protein intake role in thyroid disorders,What is the role of low protein intake in the development of thyroid disorders? Can solely lack of protein in diet be a cause of thyroid disorders?  
500,Are there any issues with missing this hand tendon?,"If I pinch my thumb and little finger together with my hand facing up and then roll my hand towards me, palm side up, I see a tendon 'pop' out of the centre of my wrist.   It appears only some of my friends have this tendon 'pop' out, though none have had surgery. What is it for? Is it there in everyone? Is it healthy that mine 'pops' out and theirs doesn't? "
501,How are skills stored in the human brain?,"How are skills stored in the human brain? I understand the difference between STM and LTM (short/long term memory). However, remembering a fact is different than learning a skill.  Example: Let's take a 99% mental-only skill like Software Engineering. You understand that IF this, THEN that, ELSE something-else. That's how you define a really basic piece of decision logic. There are many more complex forms of that which can become very abstract. At some point, you understand all of them (maybe even for dozens of languages) and you understand it so well, you subconsciously take a requirement and translate it into possibly hundreds of lines of code within seconds. This seems similar to the way people learn to read/write and speak multiple languages.  Is this simply a function of LTM which translates bits of code into actions / results? If so, how does that LTM become more readily accessible than other areas of LTM where one has to think harder to remember something? Or when it comes to learned skills (vs just facts), is this a different kind of memory entirely? "
502,How long of a time period are medications tested for?,"Most medications are not tested for long-term side effects. And there is no clear definition of ""long-term"" in the literature.  So how long of a time period (median? average? range?) are medications tested for by the appropriate government institution? Where can the consumer go to look up this information for each drug? It would be really helpful to know how long one can be on a newer drug before experiencing a harmful long-term side effect. "
503,"OBGYN wants to insert IUD (Mirena) to treat my painful periods, but should I be worried by all the recent lawsuits?","My OBGYN could not officially diagnosis me with endometriosis without performing a laparoscopy (a surgery), and he wants to avoid that at all cost, and he says, even if I had endometriosis,  the treatment would still be the same. So he is  going to treat me as if I have endometriosis. Looking at my medical history (all the pain/vomiting/nausea/PCOS, but yet having a clear Colonoscopy and Endoscopic Ultrasound and no food allergies) in addition to pressing on trigger points on my abdomen and inside cervix, he believes I have endometriosis.  He believes that endometriosis may be contributing to my fatigue, extreme nausea, abdominal pain, migraines, digestive issues, etc. So to solve that he wants to insert an IUD into my uterus in two weeks. You can read about general IUDs here. Basically, it's a contraceptive that is inserted directly inside me. But it should help with all the symptoms associated with my period by getting rid of my period. It can last for up to 5 years. I can remove it (if I ever were to try and have kids). He thinks this is far superior to treating my pain than regular birth control.   The one he wants me on is called Mirena. You can read about it here. But it seems that a lot of the side-effects are the same as the symptoms that I'm trying to treat, so I'm wondering if it will be counter-productive. How common are the side effects of fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, etc?  Also, by doing research, I've seen that this medication/device (Mirena) has been subject to many lawsuits, which naturally has me a little on edge. Have they improved this drug since the lawsuits? Is there anything I should be concerned about because of the lawsuits?  "
504,What is the correct way to insert the end of the enema tube?,"I have been trying enema for a couple of days. When I insert the rectal strip, it goes about a inch in. But when I release the water, nothing happens. I don't see the water flowing into me.   My suspicion is that I may not be inserting the strip correctly. How can I make sure that the end of the tube has really reached into the colon?  How can the tube pass the anal sphincter and reach into the colon? "
505,Dr. prescribed Ondansetron/Zofran for migraines & says it'll help with weight loss too. How effective is it for either (migraines/weight loss)?,"I have suffered from migraines since my childhood, but I never grew out of it. For all my life, I've taken all sorts of blockers, but a new doctor recently suggested that I should take Ondansetron/Zofran at 16mg a day, and see if this improves how I feel.   He also mentioned that it might help me lose weight, which is something I've struggled with because I have hypothyroidism, PCOS, and have had over 15 surgeries on my ankles/feet (so despite earnest efforts, nothing really budges).    How effective is Ondansetron/Zofran for treating migraines? How effective is Ondansetron/Zofran for helping to lose weight?   How soon will I notice a difference, if any?  "
506,Musculoskeletal vs. muscular disorders,"A musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is one that is associated with a musculoskeletal system (locomotor system).    Is MSD a subset of muscular disorders or a separate pathological category altogether? If so, is there a distinction between MSD and muscular disorders that are not MSD? Could you kindly provide examples in each case?  "
507,What are the gait related involuntary muscular diseases?,"Pathology that affects gait (manner of walking) is largely associated with disorders that affect the voluntary muscles (skeletal muscle), e.g., fibromyalgia and Trendelenburg's sign.   Are there any involuntary muscular diseases that affect the gait of a person?  Also, does sarcopenia and Pompe disease (gait related muscular disorders) affect involuntary muscles? "
508,"Had Triple arthrodesis (reconstructive/bone fusions) surgeries 10 yrs ago, but now bad arthritis. Total Ankle Replacements the answer? Only 28. Help!","I was born with congenital bone fusions throughout my body (feet, back, and feet), and have had numerous surgeries on all of the above. However, my feet/ankles have been suffering the most from my bone abnormalities insomuch that it became necessary at the prime of my youth 18 and then again at 19 to have Triple Arthrodesis (fusions of my ankle/ft bones together) surgeries on each of my feet respectively. To read more about this procedure, you can read it here: [website]Now, being only 10 years later at the age of 28, X-rays show that arthritis has taken up residence in both of my ankles and the arthritis is continuously expanding because of the fusions due to the surgery; getting worse and worse. I have developed bone spurs on both ankles to compensate for all the stress put on my deteriorating ankles. But I didn't need an X-ray to reveal that. My joints swell like balloons and hurt to the extent that you can almost hear the bones rubbing against the other bones. This has severely limited my capacity to live a normal life.   When I was a bright-eyed 18 year old facing Triple Arthodesis there were vague warnings that sometime in the distant future (maybe when I was in my mid-fifties? Maybe older?) that I would have to address potential arthritis. And that I shouldn't expect to run marathons. None of that mattered to me -- that was too far in the future to concern me. But having to take a Tylennol 3 from just walking around Walmart at age 28 is not acceptable. How do I reverse the impacts of my Triple Arthodesis? Is a Total Ankle Replacement the answer for me?   I tried researching online, but all I can find was ""Triple Arthodesis vs. Total Ankle Replacements"" and how avoiding bone fusions (that decrease your range of motion is the last option), but unfortunately, Total Ankle Replacements weren't a thing when I was 18. But can someone who has had the Triple Arthodesis procedure done in the past benefit from a Total Ankle Replacement now? Or is it irreversible? Will the orthopedic specialist just write me off and tell to just wear a brace for the rest of my life and use a cane even though I'm so young. Is there anything that can be done?  I just want to live a normal life, and not have to use a cane everywhere before the age of 30. Help! "
509,What should be the position of feet while sleeping?,"I recently came across this post as I suffer from similar knee pain while hiking downhill or on a run.     Also be certain you aren't battling other imbalances of the hips and legs.    When you lay down, do your toes turn way out to the side or point straight up?    If they turn to the side(supination/external rotation of the knee),        your hip abductors are too tight while your adductors are too weak.   I never paid attention to the way my feet rests while sleeping. I sleep on my back with my feet turned out. My feet make a 180 degree angle i.e. the outside of my feet completely rests on the bed. Is this normal? What problems could this give?  Should the feet be pointing straight up while sleeping?  "
510,Benefits of low hemoglobin in high altitude populations,"   Tibetans living at high altitudes have red blood cell levels and   hemoglobin levels similar to those of lowlanders at sea level â and as   a consequence of the low oxygen levels at those altitudes, Tibetans   live with 10% less oxygen in their blood than most other people. Lower   oxygen levels might seem like a disadvantage, yet highland women have   fewer fertility problems than lowlanders living at high altitudes,   have better blood flow to the uterus during pregnancy, and deliver   heavier, healthier babies.   Can anyone explain how relatively lower oxygen levels can contribute to ""better blood flow"" etc. in higher altitude populations such as the Tibetans?  The article said it is unknown how exactly this may happen, but does anyone have an idea how it could be possible?  Read more here  Moore, L.G., D. Young, R.E. McCullough, T. Droma, and S.

511,Correlation between gallbladder disease and pancreatitis,"Currently studying basic diagnostic procedure and the topic of pancreatitis comes in. The scenario is that the patient has come in with severe nausea and vomiting. It's already been confirmed via blood panel (amalyse and lipase) and urinalysis that the pancreas pancreas is not working correctly and pancreatitis may be present. CT scan is ordered and it is clear via scan the area doesn't look as it should (Just trying to keep this short). In this situation, obviously IV fluids and other nutrients must be administered to dampen the mortality percentage. In this case however, would it be standard to remove the gallbladder without confirming that the gallbladder is the culprit? Just for safe measure? Or should there be more testing done to determine what caused the pancreatitis?  I was told that fifty percent of pancreatic issues are caused by gallbladder disease, although I cannot find any evidence to support this. Is this actually common practice for a GI doctor to do just because pancreatitis is present?  "
512,Potato and rice diet to prevent allergic reactions to calm down atopic eczema,"I've heard of a diet consisting only of boiled potatoes, rice (with salt) and cooked apples which shall help against skin problems possibly caused by allergies. The diet is supposed to be followed for at least a week, after that other food may be added back again step by step.  Are there any risks or downsides of this diet if performed strictly for about two weeks? What nutrients would be missing and what other food should be added first to it, keeping in mind that it may not potentially cause allergic reactions?  "
513,NIPT test results given results of combined test (in pregnancy screenings),"The NIPT test gives a probability of a baby having Down syndrome. Supposedly, this test is more accurate than the combined test. However, I haven't seen any statistics regarding the accuracy of the NIPT test given the results of the combined test.  More precisely:     Is there an available statistics of the probability for getting a high risk for Down syndrome in the NIPT test, given that the risk in the combined test was low?   Alternatively, is it known that these results are uncorrelated? "
514,Baking Soda & Hydrogen Peroxide washes effective home remedies for yeast infections? Safe?,"I have a low immune system so I'm prone to a lot of yeast infections. What are some some DIY/home remedies for treating yeast infections? I know that yogurt is pretty effective, and I've heard that garlic, basil leaves, and cranberries are as well -- in addition to keeping it try and cool (applying cool compressing and not wearing restrictive clothing).  But what about baking soda or hydrogen peroxide washes in the infected area, e.g. vagina? Are these effective? I've heard mixed reviews and am not sure whether or not it will irritate it and make it worse? Would the hydrogen peroxide sting?  "
515,"Are elevated platelet levels (yet, still anemic) a symptom of endometriosis? Connection?","for about two years now, my platelet levels have been consistently elevated; not off the charts or anything to be overly alarming, but consistently coming in at about 500.   And oddly enough, I'm still anemic, so I have to take iron supplements. I thought people with anemia had low platelet levels, yet mine are high so it doesn't make sense to me.    I have seen a hematologist, and she can't seem to identify anything abnormal to indicate why I have elevated platelets. Also, my WBC is high too, but only about 15.   My GP &amp; OBGYN think that I might have endometriosis. Would this explain why I have elevated platelets, WBC, but yet am still anemic? Is there any correlation between platelet levels and endometriosis or no?   Thanks.  "
516,How long a certain food takes for making intestinal gas?,"I've some symptoms of IBS. I want to know some stuff on the basis of my symptoms that I've observed. I know Apples, Melons or milk can cause gas.   For instance, before quitting milk, when I would drink milk after dinner and sit for half an hour Computer work, I would feel pain in my abdomen, most probably because of gas and then I would sleep to feel comfort.  On another occasion, I eat melon a few days ago and I felt gassy during next 24 hours. Also, recently I was eating vegetable made from Raw Melon (it's know in my area, don't know about others) and I felt slightly more gassy.  As my gastroenterologist doesn't know much and doesn't tell me much, I want to know the TIME after taking/eating them when we feel gas, just to make sure if Milk, and these fruits and vegetables are actually causing gas.  Wherever I asked the question about lactose/fructose intolerance, they suggested me to check myself by eliminating foods. So that's what I'm doing these days. I see improvement but not much.  Is it just after 1-2-3 hours of taking these products (this is related to my milk related issue)? If yes then how is it possible because things take at least 15-20 hours to reach large intestine? (I'm asking this because some sites say milk can cause gas after a few minutes of taking it!)  Or is it actually when it reaches large intestine, undigested after 15-20 hours?  I request you to further elaborate the time that my take especially milk, melon and apples in causing gas, so that I would properly know these are the real culprits.  Thank you. "

518,"Is the ""Clock Drawing Test"" for encephalitis assessed in the same way as screening for dementia?","The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is quite pervasive in the field of neuropsychology ""quickly assess[ing] visuospatial and praxis abilities, and may determine the presence of both attention and executive dysfunctions"" -- Canadian Partnership for Stroke Studies. It seems to be used the most for Dementia and Alzheimer's. (You can also watch many YouTube videos of the Clock Drawing Test being administered screening for Dementia).  Is the ""Clock Drawing Test"" for encephalitis assessed in the same way as screening for dementia?   I was reading Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness by Susannah Cahalan, about a woman who was diagnosed with encephalitis through this Clock Drawing Test. SPOILER ALERT:      Dr. Najjar diagnosed Cahalan using a test that involved her drawing a   clock, a test normally given to people suspected of having dementia or   Alzheimer's disease. Rather than drawing the clock face normally, the   disease caused Cahalan to draw all of the numbers 1 through 12 on the   right face of the clock, because the right side of her brain, which   regulates the left side of the body, was inflamed. Najjar used this to   help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery. -Wikipedia link above ^^   Is the way Cahalan drew the clock different than how a person with Dementia would draw the clock?   How is the doctor able to distinguish Dementia from Encephalitis on the Clock Drawing Test?  "
519,Can medicines which expired a month ago be consumed safely?,"I have few expensive nutritional supplements which expired in April (as in the label). Can I still consume it in May?  Of course, consuming expired medicines is not advised. However, can't they be consumed just a few weeks after they expire?  Are expiry dates really exact or they are an approximation? "
520,Can computers cause issues to retina?,"I know working with computers can cause eyestrain and red eyes (and also the Computer Vision Syndrome). But recently I got some messages saying computers and mobile phone displays could cause retinal disorders.   Is this true? What can be done to prevent retinal disorders?  I frequently do some eye exercises which takes the pain off the eyes. Would that be enough to keep the issues if caused by computers in balanced way?  (EDIT: I'm not talking about computer vision syndrome, because as i mentioned i'm already taking measures for it.) "
521,What CGM systems don't require fingerstick calibration?,"Most continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems require you to still do fingerstick blood testing on a daily basis in order to calibrate them.  But that defeats the purpose of why people want CGM systems in the first place, which is to minimize the number of shots you have to endure.  But one CGM system that doesn't require fingerstick calibration is the Freestyle Libre Pro.  The Freestyle Libre Pro was approved by the FDA for use by doctors to give to their patients in September 2016.  But unfortunately, it hasn't yet been approved for consumer use by the FDA yet.  So my question is, are there any other CGM systems which don't require fingerstick calibration?  And are any of them FDA approved for consumer use? "

If not - are there any that satisfy the third and either the first or second (but not both) constraints?  Some things that came to mind: - Alcohol (not completely effective, side effects, hard to conceal) - Lithium, antidepressants, etc.; do these need a prescription? - St John's Wort - purportedly a mood elevator, is there evidence it works? - Etc.  Disclaimer: I understand that getting doped up is not an emotionally healthy way to deal with one's problems. For the purposes of this question, please work under the purely theoretical assumption that this is the only available class of options. "
524,Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor Accuracy?,"I have both a wrist blood pressure monitor and an upper arm blood pressure monitor.  I generally enjoy using the wrist monitor more, as it's difficult for me to secure the cuff on the arm monitor, as I have somewhat bulky arms.  I'm currently very confused, though, as the wrist monitor I purchased recently is suddenly giving me readings that are about 20 points below the upper arm monitor's readings: 95 systolic and 55-60 diastolic.  The monitor I've had for my upper arm has given me a wide range of readings at times, with gaps between readings taken minutes apart.  Which should I trust is more accurate? The lower readings from the wrist monitor, or the ones from the arm monitor? I've tried both several times and they're coming in consistently at a range apart. "

526,How long does it take for iron supplements to start improving energy levels? Is it instant or gradual?,"I have a myriad of reasons for my fatigue, shortness of breath, lack of motivation, headaches, lack of concentration, feeling very cold in my feet/hands, etc. (I have hypothyroidism, PCOS, fibromyalgia, asthma, migraines, &amp; adult ADD -- I'm actually taking meds for each of these conditions too). However, I've been feeling a sharp  intensity in the above symptoms, which is why I went to my GP. Long story short, I have yet another reason contributing to the above symptoms: iron deficiency. My TSH (thyroid levels) were fine, but my ferritin levels are at 21 ug/L. How low is this? Would this explain the above symptoms?  Of course, as soon as I muster enough energy, I'll walk to the nearest pharmacy and get iron supplements. However, I'm wondering... How long does it take for iron supplements to impact my health at all? Will I notice improvements immediately? Or is it more of a gradual thing that takes weeks before noticing more energy and focused concentration, etc? (Don't worry, I'll be taking it long-term... I'm just wondering if I'll see improvements fairly quickly as I have my Oral Exams -Grad School- in 6 days, and want my brain to be in tip-top shape).  "

530,"Is dental floss really effective? According to studies, it is not","Recently I had to go through a lot of ultrasound teeth cleaning because my gums suffered inflammations in the past. I am doing the dental cleaning every 3 to 4 months and every time the dentist says that the gum is getting better and better because I am flossing thoroughly. Before the inflammation, I never flossed so this is kind of a novel procedure for me.   So I empirically assumed that flossing is really the thing that helps to heal, as also acknowledged by the dentist.   The thing is... there are actually no studies to prove this statement. I have looked for articles and I found for instance this and this and this. I understand from the articles that there is not sufficient proof to endorse the procedure. Despite this, the dentists still recommend flossing.  From one of the articles:     The evidence for flossing is âweak, very unreliable,â of âvery lowâ quality, and carries âa moderate to large potential for bias.â   What should one understand from this? Is there someone here that works in this field or did some research on this issue?   The reason why I ask this is that I want to eliminate using the floss and replace it with WaterPik, which I find more comfortable, fast and less abrasive. But I have also seen articles in which they write that floss is better than WaterPik. So then I come back to the same issue...  I would also like to know if the dental ultrasound cleaning is actually the one healing me or is the flossing? Can anyone help me with this? "
531,Glutamate substitute for ALS?,"I was just reading up on some ALS literature, and noted something on a newly diagnosed patient. The (current) assessment is that this particular patient's ALS symptoms are caused by a glutamate deficiency. What is interesting is that the patient is a Type 2 diabetic, which would hint at that as an original source for the deficiency, as glutamate is typically synthesized in cells from glucose. But glutamate can also be synthesized, in cells, from aspartate, as in aspartame. The patient claims to have stopped drinking sugar-free beverages about a year ago, for personal reasons, which roughly lines up with the onset of the symptoms. Could it be that the patient has been unknowingly substituting glucose-to-glutamate synthesis with aspartate-to-glutamate synthesis and the change in diet stopped that? And is it maybe possible to add aspartame products to the diet and get that work-around running again, to reduce glutamate deficiency symptoms?  I sadly lack access to ALS experts around here, so I thought this could be a place to ask. "
532,Do concussions affect children more profoundly than adults?,"Concussions are a serious matter no matter what age you are. Of course innumerable factors are at play, but in general, do concussions affect children more profoundly than they do adults?

534,Is eating too much cholesterol bad?,"I've been researching cholesterol a bit (my grandma is telling me off) and I've found some sites saying that eating cholesterol is not bad since you're body makes 75% of the cholesterol found in your body. That only 20-25% of the cholesterol in your body comes from food and that if you eat more, your body will cut down on its production of cholesterol.  However given that, would it be safe to say that that is only true if you don't eat more than 4 or 5 times the 'normal' amount of cholesterol? Since all the cholesterol is being provided for by food and your body is already not making any.  or if you eat over 100% does your body remove the additional cholesterol?  Basically my question is: is eating too much cholesterol bad for you? "

They are available nowadays, but I am talking about later.  "
536,What is the estimated monetary benefit (or cost) of annual checkups?,"I've been seen seeing the ""TV Doctors"" commercials recently from Cigna.  And it got me wondering.  Strictly from a financial sense, what is the estimated average benefit (or cost) of annual checkups.  Seeing these commercials run so heavily would make me think that they see this as beneficial to them financially.  Even if it is being done more to enhance their image than to directly make money, it would seem they've decided that the cost of annual checkups must be fairly reasonable for them.  So what is the estimated financial benefit of an average checkup?  Though I really have to imagine there has to be a wealth of data on this question out there SOMEWHERE, let's definitely try to simplify things in hopes of getting some kind of an answer by making the consideration of costs just strictly the net return for a patient paying all costs at approximate market value.  Obviously it probably changes by age, and seeing such fluctuations how would be absolutely brilliant, but an average value would be just fine.  And there's quite a lot of estimation and fluidity in such values, as costs and values change... so even old data would work great for me.  Just to get a rough idea with some support.  Is there not such a value out there? "
537,Why is acid reflux (allegedly) often confused with chest pain?,"I get irregular, sharp, short bursts of pain in my chest, on the left side, near my heart. Supposedly, heart and circulatory related pain is neither sharp nor short, so this pain may be muscle or lung-lining related. (I also haven't had any shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue).   I've had plenty of acid reflux over the years (stomach acid gets into my throat and burns like crazy until addressed), and I just don't understand why, whenever I try to look for information about my mystery chest pain, I'm forced to hear about something as seemingly irrelevant as acid reflux.  It's like calling tech support and they ask you if your computer's plugged in. Am I missing something here? Can acid reflux cause actual chest pain, and not just esophageal pain? If it can, then how? I'm under the impression that the digestive system is a closed system, and that a stomachache shouldn't cause, say, shoulder pain or a backache.  (edit: I found somewhat similar question, and it's answers mention esophageal spasms, but are such symptoms common enough to be relevant, and would they actually cause chest pain? would it not be obvious that the source of the pain is the esophagus?)

538,Any irreversible damage from not treating common cold right,"When I catch a cold, I usually just work through it, i.e. take no rest day and try to live by the same schedule as when I'm healthy.  I already read on WebMD that this behaviour can increase the duration of the cold and / or worsen the symptoms, but can I also experience any long-term damage, e.g. from the additional ~3 days of coughing?  And how about when the common cold symptoms mix with flu symptoms? "
539,Can I use take pills to prevent micronutrient deficiencies and not worry about my diet too much?,"There are several nutrients which I'm not getting enough of from food, in some cases hardly any, due to dietary restrictions. I can get the nutrients I need if I carefully structure my diet, but I don't want to. I'm really lazy. I'm still trying to eat a varied diet including plenty of fruits and veggies, I just know it's not enough. So I'm taking a multivitamin and a couple of other pills.  Pretty much all the information I can find suggests this is a bad idea, but none of it seems to directly answer why. The biggest apparent reason is that supplements are not absorbed as well as food. But I can't see any indication of how well supplements are absorbed. I know it depends on a lot of factors (including the dosage) and is probably hard to measure, but don't we have at least a rough idea in specific situations? If I take, say, 100% of the RDA of iron in a pill, is the amount my body absorbs probably more or less than 50%? How much do caffeine, vitamin C, calcium, etc. affect the absorption? The information always seems to be qualitative, not quantitative.  Furthermore, if a certain dosage won't be sufficiently absorbed to fulfill my requirements, why can't I just take more? I know that this leads to diminishing returns and high dosages can be problematic, but that doesn't quite explain it. The amounts found in supplements are generally on the order of 100% of the RDA, much less than the amounts which are considered risky which are more like 1000% (with the exception of calcium, where there are some concerns about supplementing around 100-200%). It's hard to believe that the cost of manufacturing the pills or the difficulty of swallowing them would significantly increase in many cases, especially when we're talking about adding a few milligrams or less.  Other than that, many of the fears seem irrelevant. Don't take certain dangerous supplements like the dirty dozen. Don't make certain combinations. Don't try to use supplements to treat diseases like cancer. And so on.  Is the problem uncertainty? Does it just seem safer to tell people to get their vitamins from food? Or perhaps do some people know what can and should be done but others are still catching up?  OK, that's a lot of rambling, let me try and make a coherent, SE style question:  Suppose I'm a healthy adult between the ages of 20 and 40. I don't know of any medical conditions that I have relevant to supplements. I am not currently deficient in anything. I can afford to buy as many supplements as I need, I remember to take them, and I don't mind doing so.   For which nutrients can I safely obtain X% from supplements (where X is ideally 100 but can be as low as 50 if necessary), and under what conditions (e.g. don't drink coffee)? How much of the supplement should I take to reach this amount? For which nutrients is it a really bad idea to lean on supplements, and why? Are there some supplements that just don't seem to work? Or are the risks too great?   EDIT: it looks like I need to clarify. I'm vegan. There are several nutrients that I can't easily get from food, particularly B12, calcium, and vitamin D. My diet is generally fairly good - plenty of fruits, veggies, nuts, and grains - but that doesn't help enough with those nutrients. Yes some vegetables have calcium but I don't want to eat, say, 600g of kale every day. It seems safe to say that I need calcium in my body, so I want to know if pills work for that. I'm not suggesting living on junk food and pills. "
540,I have a question regarding use of loop diuretics in hypertension,"I understand that loop diuretics decrease BP because they are inhibiting the NKCC2 co-transporter so that sodium would not get reabsorbed. But while you are inhibiting the co-transporter, it also causes less sodium passing through the macula densa and so leads to increase of renin secretion. While renin is causing increase of BP, then why are we using loop diuretics to lower the BP?? Aren't the effects contradicting?   "
541,our head supposedly perfectly centered?,is everyone's head supposedly perfectly centered between the shoulders? What if it seems the head is more to one side (left or right)? Does that mean something wrong with the spine? any other causes? Thanks. 
542,How much impact does the location of measurement of blood pressure have on the quality of the obtained blood pressure signal?,"Measuring blood pressure invasively can be performed from different locations, such as one of the radial arteries. How much impact does the location of an invasive measurement have on the quality of the obtained blood pressure signal? I am looking for a quantified answer.  [website]  What is an appropriate site [for a properly performed invasive measurement]? It has been shown by many investigators that invasive pressure is greatly influenced by the measurement site. Systole in particular changes as the site in moved from the aorta away from the heart towards the extremity. Usually it is a surprise to the newcomer to this field that systole increases as one moves down the arterial stream. This increase (systolic heightening) is caused by the reflection of the incidence waveform adding to the pressure. The amount of this increase depends on the transmission speed of the artery, which is affected by the arterial compliance. Hard arteries produce more heightening than compliant arteries.      The pressure in the aorta is not much influenced by reflections, and may be the best indication of ""true"" blood pressure. Unfortunately this is a very difficult place to measure blood pressure except when undergoing cardiac evaluation or surgery, and there are no population studies to indicate the cardiovascular risk factors.  "
543,Applying ice to tendinopathy: how long should the icing and non-icing periods last?,"When applying ice to a tendinopathy, how long should the icing and non-icing periods last? I am looking for scientific studies.  [website]  Leave the ice on for 15 to 20 minutes at a time then remove it for 15 to 20 minutes so the area can warm up to room temperature. You may repeat this on and off process for as long as you want. Ice should be used as often as possible during the first 1 to 2 days after an injury.   [website]  To maximize the benefits, ice five times a day, with at least 45   minutes in between applications. This keeps tissue temperature low to   minimize inflammation.   [website]  Put ice on the inside of your elbow 3 to 4 times a day for 15 to 20 minutes.   but they do not reference the claim. Some references regarding the recommended icing duration are given in this answer on how cold should it be, but there may be more recent references and I am also interested to know how frequently ice should be applied, i.e., how long non-icing periods should last.  I have mostly interested in tendinopathies.    Kowal, Michael Andrew. ""Review of physiological effects of cryotherapy."" Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy 5.2 (1983): 66-73. mentions:     The cuffs and ice pack were removed after 20 minutes and were reapplied 1   hour later for a further 20 minutes.   but the choice sounds arbitrary, and the reviews is over 4 decades old. "
544,Is it possible to get a cut from being elbowed in the head?,"So I was at a basketball game, and sometime mid-way through it, I got elbowed in the head. At the end of the game, I found that I got a small cut that was slightly bleeding and, at that point, the blood had sorta dried. So how is it that I got a cut (it resembles a cut from a knife; straight and no width) on my head from being elbowed? I felt a little bit of pain that felt like it was coming from the bone, as I've felt that pain before and could recognize it, right after being elbowed. After the game, I didn't feel any pain until I took a shower. Then there was a really sharp pain. So, yeah, how did I get a cut from being elbowed in the head? "
545,Does my face become oily due to pimples?,"I have pimples on my face since last month. They are neither bleeding nor painful when I touch them, but my fingers get oily when I rub them softly.  I'm not using any skin care soap or applying talcum powder to my face.  What could be the cause of this? What is the remedy? "
546,What are the benefits of high testosterone in men?,"It's common to hear about products that claim to be testosterone boosters for men and vitamins that boost testosterone, but what benefits does high testosterone actually entail? For example, are physical strength, libido, and mental capacity increased? Mental health discussion would be interesting too, if there's any association. "
547,Piercing ear for the second time,Are there any risks to re-piercing the ear on the same spot as a healed previous piercing?  What about on cartilage? 
548,Have candles been linked to cancer?,"I was told by a family member that burning candles can cause cancer. Is this true?   I did not think they do, but I decided to search around a bit. And I found a lot of mixed information. I have found some articles about a scientific link, but I found others that may or may not be scientific which claim some do not cause cancer. It seems there are a lot of anecdotes and opinions, but I can't find much scientific basis to figure out what the true danger is.   So my question is:     Is there a clear scientific link between common candles and cancer?  "
549,What is the correct brace position for car accidents?,"What is the correct brace position (a.k.a. crash position) for car accidents? The Wikipedia page on brace position focuses on airplane accidents.  [website]  The common misconception that leaning forward and placing your head against a stationary object is unsafe probably comes from motor vehicle travel. Sitting upright in an accident is approved behaviour in a motor vehicle, however it is unsuitable for air travel because of the lack of shoulder harnesses and airbags in aircraft.     Edited to answer a comment the question received (I am apparently not allowed to point to which one): one can sometimes see in advance that a car crash may happen, and the car may have passengers. I don't think knowing a crash is coming is hard-to-imagine circumstance: it happened to me, you can look around for Youtube videos, there are 123,000 head-on collisions per year in the US, and car accidents are much more common than airplane accidents. But it is up to you to decide not to be prepared (Darwinian selection). "

551,"Can a person with a heart transplant fly safely, or should they consider an alternative form of transportation?","Could a person who had received a heart transplant move to/travel to another country (for example: From France to the United States)?  The caveat being that they would have to set up another team of doctors to monitor the progress of the donor heart if they decided to become a permanent resident of their new country, possibly set up a medical translator to translate any records or conversations between the previous team of doctors to the new one, and that it would have been a few years since the surgery with no notable issues with the transplant.  Would it be safe for air travel, or would another conveyance be more desirable (which would be by ship at that point)? "
552,How can I quickly know whether a medical treatment is supported by evidence?,"Griffin, Robert, Yeonwoo Lebovitz, and Rebecca English. Transforming Clinical Research in the United States: Challenges and Opportunities: Workshop Summary. National Academies Press, 2010. Harvard (mirror):     Fewer than half of all the medical treatments delivered today are supported   by evidence (IOM, 2007), yet the United States lacks a clear prioritization   of the gaps in medical evidence and an allocation of clinical research   resources to efficiently and effectively fill these evidence gaps.   How can I quickly know whether a medical treatment is supported by evidence? I am aware could do a literature review, but is there any faster way, without having to ask a physician?    References:   (IOM, 2007) J. Michael McGinnis, LeighAnne Olsen, Katharine Bothner, Daniel O'Neill, and Dara Aisner. Learning What Works Best: The Nation's Need for Evidence on Comparative Effectiveness in Health Care.  IOM roundtable on evidence-based medicine. [website]  Estimates range widely concerning the proportion of medical care in the United States that is based on, or supported by, adequate evidence [9-14]. However, given concerns about the extent to which this information may be generalized and the quality of the evidence that is used, some place this figure at well below half. Regardless of the precise level, there is no question about the need for improvement. Part of the challenge is the appropriate delivery of what has already been proven effective. Medical care is becoming more complex with the increase in multifaceted chronic diseases, the development of new interventions, and the pressures to reduce the time of patient-provider interaction in the face of greater administrative burdens. New care management approaches, decision support systems, and incentives will be required to help providers and patients work together to ensure that the care delivered is the care that is known to be most effective.

553,What steps should a person take to heal one's body after pulling an all-nighter?,"Regardless of cause (crying baby, hospital emergency, procrastination, insomnia), what steps should be taken to return to their original sleep?  Maybe they should try to sleep as soon as possible or get exercise to help sleep earlier the next night? Or maybe there are things people should eat or avoid eating? "
554,"Can the human body switch to a ""starvation"" mode?","I've heard on multiple occasions from less than credible sources that dieting by eating less (usually implemented by skipping meals, not smaller meals) will cause the human body to enter some sort of ""starvation"" mode where it hoards calories because it thinks it might not get more calories in the future. Most people also mention it can cause an increase in weight. The people I hear it from say it like it's common sense and widely believed so they never have anything to support it. ""That's just the way it is"" they claim.  There's a lot of variables at play here and I'm no biologist or nutritionist but I'm interested in knowing if there's any research backing this claim. Is there a starvation mode that your body can fall in to? If so, what triggers it? Has there been any research into how the body reacts to fewer feeding times and overall less calories? What are the long term (6+ months?) affects of a diet like this if a person can still ensure proper nutrient intake aside from calories?  I'm not talking about extreme fasting or starvation diets. I'm thinking diets with 1000-1500 calories a day in a consistent fashion (taking in roughly the same amount of calories at roughly the same time of day). Although I would be interested in studies or knowledge outside of these limits.  Even if we ignore starvation as a dietary method, if a person stopped eating would there be a distinct difference in how their body processes fats or expends energy in the starvation process? "
555,Why does following a fiber-rich diet help reduce the odds of getting cancer?,"Following a fiber-rich diet seems to help reduce the odds of getting cancer, according to some scientific studies. Why would fibers help preventing cancers?    WebMD indicates an indirect effect: fiber-rich diet -> healthy weight -> lower risk for many kinds of cancer (1), but I'd expect fibers to help prevent cancers in other ways as well:     Almost 70 years later, scientists are still mulling the issue. Some studies have found a link between a fiber-rich diet and lower cancer risks. Others haven't.      Eating lots of fiber mayhelp stave off certain types of cancer -- it just hasn't been proven yet.      Research is clear that eating a high-fiber diet can help you stay at a healthy weight, which in turn, lowers your risk for many kinds of cancer.     (1) Does being underweight have an influence on cancer risk? "
556,How to increase my gut bacteria? Are there any drugs available?,I got this problem in my digestive system that foods that I eat don't digest properly. I searched the internet and found out that a lack of gut bacteria can cause that kind of problem.  How can gut bacteria be increased? Are there any medications for this? 
557,Wristbands and nausea,"Acupressure wristbands are widely sold as a remedy for nausea caused by motion sickness. I have no doubt that they work for some people, because I experience exactly the opposite effect: elasticized wristbands, such as those found on sweatshirts, often make me feel extremely nauseous. There are some kinds of garments I simply can't wear; for others, stretching the wristbands out until they are saggy is good enough.  My two part question is this: first, how widely is my problem experienced by others? And second, is there any scientific understanding of this (apparently very real) connection between wrist pressure and the feeling of nausea? "
558,Am I really sleeping if I wake up with lingering memory of my dream many times into the night?,"I suffer insomnia sometimes. When that happens, I would lie on my bed and find that my mind is active. As hours go on, I would seem like falling into dreams, only to wake up later. The process of falling into dreams and wake up with a lingering memory of the dream would repeat many times into the night.  When the next day comes, I would find that I am tired and my mind is not as sharp as the normal days.   So I wonder when that happens, do I really have enough rest for the night? Am I really sleeping? "

560,Is it helpful to a dentist to report pain during a procedure?,"Suppose that a dentist is doing a standard dental procedure, e.g. drilling out decay, on me, and I start feeling pain as he does it. Assuming that I can handle the pain silently, so I don't need to report it for my own sake, is it at all helpful to the dentist's work for me to report it? Is this feedback that the dentist can use to detect issues with the actual work as he goes along, or would the only purpose of reporting it be to try to get him to do something to mitigate it, for the sake of my immediate experience?  (Note: I'm using ""me"" as a stand-in for a typical patient.)  "
561,Can a young person with hemochromatosis have normal iron levels?,"Hemochromatosis is a genetic disease that results in the body absorbing too much iron, leading to excessive iron in the body which can lead to organ damage.  Symptoms of hemochromatosis tend to occur after age 40, however, early iron overload may have no symptoms even though organ damage is occurring.  My question relates to how iron levels change in a patient with hemochromatosis over time.  Specifically, if iron studies are done in a young patient under age 25 and return a normal result, can we conclude the young person doesn't have hemochromatosis, or is it possible that they still have the disease and if we test them again in 10 years their iron levels will have increased?  If it is possible for a patient with hemochromatosis to have normal iron levels at a young age, is it possible for organ damage resulting from the disease to occur before iron levels are outside normal range or only after this?

562,Bolt of electric shock on upper right chest,"Sometimes when I get excited about something or having a good laugh, suddenly in the middle of this excitement, I feel a moderate bolt of electric shock (usually lasts 2-4 seconds) on the upper right side of my chest, that interrupts my excitement. This happened quite a few number of times and so I was thinking I should consult a physician. But before I consult one, I thought I should research if this problem is really a serious one... Why do you think this happens? Is it something more serious? "
563,Facial hair hygiene recommendations,"What is the best way to stop beard dandruff?   I wash my face regularly with Detol anti-bacterial soap, and for my hair and beard, I use a wide range of Pantene Pro-V products for my hair and beard (such as Repair and Protect, Sleek and Smooth) and conditioner. However, after a day or so I get itchy skin and dandruff.  Am I possibly using the wrong conditioner/shampoo for my beard and is there an alternative? "
564,Can food make you put on more weight than it's own weight?,"We all know that about 3500 calories is equivalent to 1 pound (7500 cals for 1kg).  So can a piece of food weighing one pound have more than 3500 calories?  What are the highest and lowest energy dense foods? and will consuming the former make you less full while the latter make you feel fuller for less calories? or do the calories consumed cause you to feel full?  Is there a limit to how many calories can be in 1 pound of food (including artificially made ""foods"")? "
565,Does 3500 calories really equal a pound?,"If you are attempting to lose weight via dieting and/or exercise, you will see this number EVERYWHERE on the internet.  If you create a deficit of 3500 calories you will lose one pound, as simple as that.  But is that really true?  Surely there are many factors which will affect how true this is?.  That different energy sources have different energy densities, such as muscle and fat, for one.  And where does this number even come from, how is it derived? "
566,How do antihistamines work?,"We recently got some new kittens and my step son is allergic to them. He mostly suffers from a runny nose, but also had itchy eye last night after he    Left a robe in the kitten room all day  Put it on after getting home from school   Kept scratching his eye after playing with the kittens etc.   Anyway, so he's trying an antihistamine to see if this will combat the allergies. From sites like WebMD I've read that the cat allergy is an overreaction of his immune system.  Is the antihistamine doing something regarding his immune's system reaction or is it doing something about the symptoms? How does it work?  Will his immune system learn how to behave whilst taking antihistamines? Would the process of learning be better or worse for taking them? "
567,Is this study stating red algae reduces cold virus by 92% believable?,"I was using this spray meant to hasten recovery from the common cold. This study, sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that produces the spray, stated it reduced virus by 92%, and so shortens the duration of the common cold.  Meanwhile a doctor told me that these kinds of things don't work.  Does someone have some perspective on this? Is this a believable study? Was it well designed, and has it been duplicated?   If so, why wouldn't the pharmaceutical produced a certified and expensive drug instead of a no-prescription drug? "

In my limited understanding, the common cold is caused by a virus. How does being cold affect this?  Can being cold and/or wet be a significant influence in your chances of 'catching' the common cold? "
570,Why does my girlfriend have such smaller stools when we eat the same food?,"My girlfriend and I have a fairly well-rounded diet. We eat a lot of vegetables, beans, and grains, some dairy and a moderate amount of meat (maybe one serving per day). I would assume our diet to be at least as high in fiber as the average or recommended diet. We both eat at least 3 meals per day and often she eats a slightly larger meal than I do. I have a thin frame and hers is average.  But here's where we differ. I defecate generally once or sometimes twice per day, and my output is usually at least a foot long and floats. I think it looks pretty healthy. But she only defecates around once every other day and it is only a relatively small amount of hard deer pebbles.  Where does all her waste go? Does she have incredibly efficient enzymes that are making use of the roughage rather than tossing it out? Either way it doesn't seem very healthy for her stool to be so compact, but no amount of fruit or fiber bar eating seems to change the situation. "
571,How does removal of calculus/tartar above the gum line affect deposits below gum line?,"I have some dental calculus on the back of my mandibular incisors (bottom front teeth). Some of the calculus is beneath the gum line (I'm not sure how far), and the gums are starting to recede (very slightly).   I ordered a set of dental picks and I am going to remove the calculus that is above the gumline, and I am wondering if this will help break down the deposits that are below the gumline. What will be the long-term effects of me only removing the calculus above the gumline?  Also, is there any sort of mouthwash/rinse that I can use that will help break down thick deposits to make them easier to remove?  "

576,How to note symptoms before visiting a doctor,"Countless times I've been to the doctor and forgot mentioning specific details about my various health conditions. So, I decided to take detailed notes of symptoms (pain, dizziness, etc) long before visiting the doctor.   Medical apps are out of the question due to their lackluster security (sending data over http, storing unencrypted data in 3rd party servers, etc.)[1]:     Our three-stage study raises many concerns and shows some serious problems with Android mHealth apps. The major issue is unencrypted communication over the Internet and use of thirty party hosting and storage services. Our study shows that a significant number of the apps in the top health related apps from the Google Play market have these issues.   I'll be storing data in a LibreOffice Spreadsheet using something similar to the OPQRST mnemonic:     The small images were created using Inkscape (I move the semi-transparent circles on the relevant body-part, resize them and use shift + print screen)    The pain scale is based on this:    Questions  Is there anything else a doctor should know?   Bonus question: Is there a better way to describe symptoms? Obvious drawbacks which I'd love suggestions for:   I can't note symptoms on the run as I would with an app. It takes time to note them accurately enough. Any way to make the process faster?   Note: If I should be splitting the Q into a Q and self-answer, let me know. "
577,Replicated medicine by pharmacists,"There has been a discussion in the Netherlands about expensive medicine for rare illnesses. One solution mentioned in the discussion is to allow the pharmacy to replicate the drug in question.  I do not expect an in-dept explanation as my knowledge of chemistry and medicine is very basic.   The Drug in question is called ""Orkambi"" and costs about â¬170k a year for each patient.   I want to know more how you could replicate the drug. I'm familiar with electronics reverse engineering, do the same principals work for chemistry?  My question is: How hard is it to replicate a drug like Orkambi?

579,How is the total calculated for influenza vaccination coverage calculated?,"I found these data concerning influenza vaccination coverage in Italy. I don't understand how the total is calculated. It is not a simple media.  For example, for the season 2016-2017 the data are as follows:    If I sum up the values of the first line (in red) and average it, I get:  0.5+0.6+0.7+0.8+0.8+1.6+6.4+48.2=59.6/8=7.45 that is different from 14.6.  If instead I sum up the values of the column (in blue) I get:  0.5+0.5+0.6+0.7+2+1.2+0.3+0.9+1.3+5.2+0.3+0.9+0.5+0.6+0.8+2.4+4+0.2+0.6+1.3+1.1=25.9/21=1.23 that is different from 1.5.  So, what kind of calculations were made to get the Total values?  Can someone help me? "
580,Can your rectum atrophy after a long time of inactivity?,"A colectomy and subsequent ileostomy are surgeries that involve removing the large bowel (colon) and creating an opening in the abdomen for food waste to go through the small intestine and out of the body through this opening, into a stoma bag, bypassing the rectum and anus as methods of food excretion.  The patient may have the option of a stoma reversal, which would attach the small intestine to the rectum, giving rise to the reestablishment of the gastrointestinal tract.  My question: Given that the patient can go a long time before getting a reversal, i.e. a long time without making use of their rectum/anus, both of which involve muscles that will not have ""exercised"" for a long time, is it possible that the muscles involved in the rectum's or anus' function can atrophy in that time? And what kind of consequences would that entail for a patient? "

How are participants in a clinical study of a new medication selected and monitored? Do they make an announcement calling for volunteers? Do they pay the volunteers, or volunteers are desperate people who would try any new medication? After selecting the participants, how are they monitored, so that they wouldn't take other medications, recreational drugs, or get involved in stress inducing activities? Are they isolated? "
583,What are the changes of diamine oxidase (DAO)-activity with different sex hormones?,"Based on this question: What happens to a woman if she takes testosterone? i have another question and would like to know more - that's because i've stumbled over this:      DAO activity in tissues of female guinea pigs was determined after the   administration of estradiol or progesterone. Estradiol pretreatment   elicited significant fall in DAO activity in the liver and specific   increase in the uterus. The effect of progesterone was much less   pronounced.   [website]Let's say the test person is Alice, 20 years old, low DAO activity + histamine intolerance and estrogen dominance.   So, the special question is: If estradiol is involved in an significant fall in DAO activity then what would happen if alice would consume estrogen blockers and something like nebido.

Does testosterone have an impact on the dao activity or just the estrogen blockers? And what is with progesterone - how is that involved? "

585,Is there evidence of benefit from the syringe- or vacuum-based tonsil washing procedure in chronic tonsillitis?,"I have a friend who has chronic tonsillitis. She has been offered to undergo tonsil washing (Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð¼ÑÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ðµ Ð»Ð°ÐºÑÐ½ Ð¼Ð¸Ð½Ð´Ð°Ð»Ð¸Ð½ - Russian Wikipedia), a procedure apparently widely used in my country (Russia). The verbatim translation is ""washing of the tonsillar lacunae"" (is it ""tonsillar crypts"" in English?).  There are generally two approaches to this:   Using a syringe with a special curved needle adapter and a blunt needle: the doctor puts the needle inside tonsillar lumina and pumps in the solution, which forces all the accumulated matter out.  The accumulated detritus is sucked out under local anesthesia using vacuum suction.    The procedure is called to clear the bunged-up tonsillar lumina. However, my friend is unsure whether the benefits will outweigh the side effects. The doctor said it may leave minute scars on her tonsils.    I tried googling for ""tonsil washing"" in English and found only a couple of articles translated from Russian (example) and a mention of a ""Tonsil washing device"" on a German website. I also found a mention of a ""Roeder method"" in a 2014 review:     In his book âThe Natural Tonsil Treatmentâ of 1918, Roeder describes a method that is used more often today than earlier in many ENT practices. The detritus-filled tonsils are suctioned with a glass suction cup, thereby removing the debris and massaging the tonsils at the same time, which (according to the current viewpoint) promotes lymphatic drainage [140]. Then the tonsils are brushed or sprayed with disinfectant solutions. However, this method is more difficult to apply in children because the suction procedure is quite painful.      Is ""tonsil washing"" used at all in the West? Is it supported by any clinical studies?     P.S. I've made a search in my local (Yekaterinburg, Russia) web forums, and found out that it's a quite common procedure here. Numerous people write that they underwent it.   "

588,Healthy way to become numb,"What can I do to enter a numb state of being so that I don't feel constantly dragged down, fatigue, stress, and all the other downs people experience? For years I've tried exercising, eating healthy, etc. It works to some degree. I get plenty of sleep. I believe the issue is mental. For example, this morning I have a truck load of science experiments to build, but as I sat down to start building them I was swamped with horrible feelings, making it feel like I was carrying a mountain on my shoulders. At least one issue is that I get stressed due to fear of failure. I would much rather spend my entire day thinking. To leave my inner world of thought and actually do physical stuff feels like climbing a tall mountain. It's painful.   Is there anything I can do to numb such sensations? Sometimes I want to be a robot who feels no pain. Perhaps coffee is the answer. Or meditation. Or electric shock therapy lol. Or hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Or joggers high. Or some kind of psychological therapy or hypnosis.  The reason I ask about becoming numb is that twice when life became incredibly horrible I suddenly had the most wonderful blissful sensation of numbness sweep over me. There are no words to describe how wonderful this numbness felt. It didn't last long, about 10 minutes, but during those 10 minutes I could do anything without pain /stress / sadness / fatigue / fear / feeling down. It would be great and more productive to be able to feel like that during my work hours. Thank you so very much for any help! "
589,Foods/Drinks to avoid before and during a flight,"I am a (recent) frequent flyer with at least 4 transatlantic trips/month. I have noticed that depending on the food I take just before or during the flight, this can have significant consequences on some intestinal symptoms (like bloating, fullness sensation).  I have found some info on WebMD but it is very general. And as most of my flights are > 10 hours, I can't ""eat little"" as suggested on this website.  What are the foods which are associated with the least bloating issues during and after the flight? Also, should alcohol be avoided? "
590,Can I donate a kidney later and recieve one now?,"The kidney voucher allows one to donate a kidney now and get a kidney coupon which they give to a friend or family member, which they can redeem for a kidney later.

591,What Happened To All The Hiatal Hernia Centers?,"I have been doing much research for years on the esophageal hiatal hernia.  I found exactly one paper on-line (from the U.S. military, I believe, I cannot relocate it) that mentioned in passing that there were dedicated hiatal hernia treatment centers all across the country around the 1950s.  What happened to them?  If there were so many, they must have had some success.  And what was their treatment(s)?  The standard fundoplication surgery was brand new then, so I doubt they were just places for surgery, especially when a surgical hospital would do.    If I recall (very faintly), they at least treated by abdominal pressure changes via syringe.  Maybe someone here knows a person who was a doctor around that era who might even recall such centers. "
592,What causes smelly feet?,"I suffer from smelly feet, which is very annoying particularly because I am in a new relationship. I have tried many OTC/home remedies to prevent this, but this doesn't really help.  According to this website (NHS)  [website]  You're also more likely to have foot perspiration if you're on your   feet all day, if you're under a lot of stress or if you have a medical   condition called hyperhidrosis, which makes you sweat more than usual.   Fungal infections, such as athlete's foot, can also lead to bad foot   odour.   I don't have any of the conditions mentionned above (I am healthy and my GP told me I don't have hyperhidriosis or fungal infections). Also, I am not on my feet all the day. I did follow all the recommendations (changing socks and shoes every day, keeping my toenails short) without success.  What are the causes of smelly feet? Could it be genetic? Or are there any other reasons (for a healthy individual)? "
593,Umbrella terms for field of vision unawareness blindness spectrum conditions?,"I would like to know what the name is for the medical condition, whose severity could be categorized by a vision dexterity test possibly related to overall body / hand to object reaction time after hearing a sound, whereby someone may have a low degree of awareness about objects in front of them / in their surroundings. This may be even when the person has perfect vision or does not but wears glasses.  For instance, while in a car or other situation, someone could tell you ""look at that (sign or object)"", and you would be so slow locating it that it would pass by without you noticing.  I think this condition may be related to either genetics, Down syndrome, or brain damage due to a car accident, or some other factor related to sound and vision processing speed, or brain sensitivity to motion, or both.  I really don't know.  I see this as a form of blindness (because it feels like a (vision loss) blindness, with a lower degree of non-assisted imagination).  Is there an umbrella term for this, quantifiable (meaning that, like astigmatism, you could have a lot of it or a little bit of it)?  What are its subcategories?  Is there an index, to measure brain/eye strain after a ""driving exercise or driving video game""?  Thanks. "

Please reply according to scientific facts or true experience. "
596,Do adult humans need to drink milk,"To the best of my knowledge, most mammals cease to drink milk past infancy. Humans, on the other hand often substitute their mothers breast milk with that from other sources like cattle (or soy, forgive the joke).   Moreover, I have been taught that lactase persistence is a relatively recent phenomenon in many populations (evolutionarily speaking).  But is continued consumption of milk as an adult really necessary to stay healthy? I am guessing the nutrients that are found in say, cow's milk are not exclusive to it, and other dietary sources would exist for them.   Moreover, is it possible milk consumption can prove to be detrimental to adults in some form? (eg: [website]Also, I would appreciate it if you could support your answer with literature references.   EDIT I am not looking for a yes or no, answer. I want an explanation that is grounded in an understanding of human physiology.  "
597,Does male circumcision really damage sexual sensitivity for men?,"In my point of view, nowadays the male circumcision procedure is becoming unpopular. There may be substantial grounds for that.  There may be numerous subjective opinions about noticeable sensitivity reduction, but are there any objective medical studies that confirm the negative effect is really presented and sexual sensitivity is in fact damaged after male circumcision? For the moment, I am not interested in advantages of this procedure. Sensitivity reduction (provided that it really damages sexual health of men) is the one disadvantage that outweighs all the advantages of this controversial procedure.        Update:  Some information about the matter can also be found on Quora:      Does male circumcision really damage sexual sensitivity for   men?  "
598,Does excessive sugar intake cause diabetes?,"Assuming no weight gain, does a large amount of refined sugar intake increase the risk of diabetes?  To put it another way: In theory, if you took two identical subjects, and they each consumed the same amount of calories, but Subject A received 5% of their calories from refined sugar, while Subject B received 25% of their calories from refined sugar, would Subject B have an increased risk of diabetes?

599,Can I get infected again with the same cold?,"Both me and my mom got infected with cold from the same person apparently, since both of us fell ill a few days after meeting this ill at that time person.  However, mom got infected far more severely than me apparently, since Iâm recovering right now w/o any help from the Doctor, while mom lies with fever, two weeks of sick leave, antibiotics, and diagnosed bronchitis and tonsillitis.  Today I had to help her with a few things. This involved a few hours of sitting with her in her room, touching her things, etc. Now I wonder, can I get re-infected from her with the same cold? Is it possible that Iâm going to get as bad as she is now, or maybe since Iâm still not completely healthy yet and therefore the same germs are in my body as well at the moment it doesnât really matter, and if I were to get infected that badly, I already wouldâve?

600,How to read U.S. Dietary Guidelines Tables?,"The U.S. Government publishes the Dietary Guidelines for nutrition. I am unclear on how to interpret the tables for Healthy Eating Patterns. Can you clarify how I read the data?  Looking at Table A3-1. Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern: Recommended Amounts of Food From Each Food Group at 12 Calorie Levels, first column (1000 Cal), Vegetables Food Group, I do not understand why the Daily Amount of food from each group does match up to the weekly recommended amounts. How do the daily and weekly data correlate?   My thought was for 1000 calorie diet, it is recommended to eat 1 cup of vegetables. Limit the vegetables choices to the recommended values per week depending on what you eat. Does that sound right? So, it is recommended to eat up to 1/2 cup of Dark Green vegetables per week; or up to 2.5 cups per week of Red/Orange vegetables.    "

602,"Is there such a thing as ""histamine liberators"" and how do they work?","In the context of allergies, I keep reading the term ""histamine liberators"" with claims that certain foods release histamine. A random example from everydayhealth.com:     Some foods, while low in histamines themselves, are known as histamine liberators, meaning that they help to release histamine from other foods.      Foods with histamine-releasing properties include citrus, peanuts, fish, shellfish, and egg whites.   I'm interested in understanding the mechanism behind histamine liberators, i.e., where is the histamine stored, which processes lead to the release, and does a ""liberation"" lead to lower histamine levels?  I have no expertise in medical science, and my attempt to search for scientific publications on that topic wasn't successful. This makes me wonder where the notion of histamine liberators is coming from. Is it nonsense or simply not yet researched well enough? If there is preliminary evidence: Where is the list of food coming from? "
603,Do UV-B emitting lamps for reptile pets produce vitamin-D in human skin?,"There are those lamps like e.g. ""ReptiGlow"" for pet reptilians, to keep them healthy, the output being graded e.g. by habitat: jungle (trees somewhat reduce the UV that hits the animals), or desert (full sun exposure). Alas, I have found nothing about the exact wavelengths those kind of lamps produce, and the exact wavelengths human skin needs to produce vitamin-D.  The example used, ""ReptiGlow"", claims to mimic the UV mix of the sun, with the same kind of UV-A, UV-B mix.  Can such reptilian lamps actually be used to effectively produce vitamin-D in humans, e.g. countering European Winter, without harmful side effects? If generally so - how would one determine the needed exposure (lamp output, distance to skin, exposure time)? "
604,The relation of weight loss speed and loose skin,"For the past week I have been hunting for the answer to the following question:  Does the speed at which you lose weight have any relationship with loose skin? And the real question, why or why not?  I've reached out to every doctor friend I have, and requested they in turn reach out to dermatologists and plastic surgeons. I've sifted through a plethora of online resources, watched videos, used other question submission sites, and every time I either get a ""Yes speed matters"" or ""No, speed doesn't matter"", but nobody has even bothered to so much as guess why their stance is right while the opposite is wrong.   I have yet to find a single piece of non-anecdotal evidence for yes or no. If losing weight slowly allows ones epidermis to adjust to the weight loss than why would that function cease if the weight loss was quick?   If the epidermis can ""shrink"" then, to me, it stands to reason the only variable is time. But the reality that we have invasive, expensive surgical procedures to remove loose skin flies in the face of this.   If anyone can give me a ""Yes, the speed of weight loss matters because..."" or a ""No, the speed of weight loss is irrelevant because..."" I'd very much appreciate it. I'm starting to get the impression that every medical professional with an opinion on this is just regurgitating someone else's uneducated guess. Thanks! "

607,Should one avoid consuming durians when drinking alcohol?,"I read on {1} that one may want to avoid consuming durians when consuming alcohol, as durians were shown to inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in their in vitro study. Has this hypothesis been confirmed or rejected when tested in vivo?  Excerpt from {1}:     This study provides evidence that some component(s) of durian fruit inhibit(s) yALDH in vitro.   Inhibitory action of the non-polar sulfury constituents of the fruit like diethyl disulfide on yALDH, with further   investigation, offers a novel rationale to the etiology of the durian-alcohol anecdote. As such, work on this   theme is currently undertaken to confirm the bioactive component(s) in the durian fruit, and validate the   consistency of the findings hereby reported in mammalian models in vivo.

609,Are collagen supplements of any use to help prevent or treat a tendinopathy?,"Are collagen supplements been scientifically shown of any use to help prevent or treat a tendinopathy? If so, what kind of collagen supplements (e.g., type of collagen, source of collagen such as (mirror) piscine, bovine, porcine, or fowl)?   I read from {1}:     glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate, vitamin C, hydrolazed type 1 collagen, arginine alpha-keto-glutarate, bromelain, curcumin, boswellic acid, and methil-sulfonil-methane were considered [â¦]. preclinical results are very encouraging, however they are not fully confirmed by clinical studies. There are few clinical papers on the use of nutraceuticals in tendon disorders, and their methodological quality is poor. Furthermore, in most of the studies more than one supplement was administered at the same time. This may bias the results, and the effect of each single component cannot be determined. Furthermore, the interactions between nutraceuticals and drugs, or other dietary supplements (especially at high doses) has not been evaluated, neither their effects on chronic diseases. For these reasons, it is not possible to draw any definitive raccomendations on the use of nutraceutical supplementation in tendinopathies.   I wonder whether more conclusive studies have been published since then.

610,Does marijuana inhibit cognitive functioning?,"There's a lot of conflicting information regarding this question and people have different agendas. I'm not a doctor, but from what I've read marijuana has been shown to inhibit healthy brain development in adolescents and lead to lower IQ scores. And although it's not nearly as addictive as opiates, like all other psychoactive drugs that work on the dopamine system there is the potential for psychological dependence.   However, my question relates to adults that use it responsibly. If one is over 25 (brain stops developing), active, and only uses marijuana occasionally without smoking is it unhealthy? Does it cause cognitive decline in that population? I think smoking all day, every day is a horrible way to live. Those people have long forgotten what it means to ""feel their emotions."" However, I'm still not sure whether it is considered unhealthy when used sensibly like the occasional glass of wine.   "
611,Can adults get new gut bacteria from external exposure?,"I am not a student nor professional in medicine or physiology. I understand that newborns get their gut bacteria during childbirth from the contact with the mother (I am going to assume this happens from both ends of the digestive trait, but correct me if I'm wrong).  Does this process continue as adults, given the right circumstances? Can scarcely hygienic situations (e.g. a shared toilet room) affect one individual's gut microbiome? "

613,Reference request: Parkinson's disease book,"I am about start a project on computational modelling of basal ganglia in the context of Parkinson's disease. My background is mostly on computational side (and some neuroscience too) and I know relatively little about medicine. So I would like to extend my knowledge of the Parkinson-related medical science, so that I see not only separate puzzle pieces.  Could somebody suggest a recent book on Parkinsons's disease from medical perspective (and the more fundamental systems neuroscience it contains, the better)? I am more interested in motor symptoms and cognitive problems (as well as their treatment).  UPD: as was requested in the comments I have done a preliminary search. I don't know what is the best way of looking for such books, so I just looked at Amazon. Restricting my search to the books that have appeared within last 4 years (is it a reasonable window?), I found the following options:   Parkinson's Disease and other Movement Disorders (Oxford Specialist Handbooks in Neurology) 2nd Edition  Therapy of Movement Disorders: A Case-Based Approach (Current Clinical Neurology) 1st ed. 2019 Edition  The Comprehensive Guide to Parkinson's Disease  Therapeutics of Parkinson's Disease and Other Movement Disorders Oscillatory Activity in Basal Ganglia of Parkinson Disease &amp; Dystonia: Exploring the therapeutic mechanisms of deep brain stimulation treatments for movement disorders  Deep Brain Stimulation Programming: Mechanisms, Principles and Practice 2nd Edition  Deep Brain Stimulation (Dbs) Applications   Is it possible to choose one of them based on the context I gave? I guess I am asking more about choosing between one book within first 4 items and one book within second 3 items, since they are more specific. Or maybe the information in the last 3 form a subset of the information in the first four, I don't know. "

615,Can tuberculosis be treated with obesity?,"When I was a kid I was told something that keeps bothering me until now, mainly because how weird it seems.  Namely, I was told that before antibiotics were discovered, people with tuberculosis were being treated withâ¦ obesity. I don't remember the exact explanation, but from what I recall fatty lungs were supposed to be better able to resist tuberculosis bacteria. IIRC it was fatty tissue that was supposed to be helpful here.  IIRC people with active TB were first being fattened quite severely, to combat the disease, then they could loose some of the most excess weight but still had to remain obese in order to prevent relapse.  Again - now this seems weird to me. However: â¢ The person telling this to me (grandma) was not used to pranking kids by telling them false info; â¢ She said she personally knew one specific case of a person with TB treated that way; â¢ She was not opposed to contemporary medicine and acknowledged antibiotics to be a superior way.  Is there any truth to this? Or did my grandma fall victim to an urban legend? "
616,Does anaerobic exercise impair wound healing?,"Anaerobic exercise causes muscle breakdown, forcing the body to engage in protein synthesis. Wound repair consists mostly of protein synthesis. It would seem that these two processes would compete with each other for resources, resulting in slower muscle repair, slower wound healing or less complete wound healing (scarring), or some combination of the above.  Does evidence support this idea? Does heavy anaerobic exercise impair wound healing? "
617,How does the circulatory system know where to distribute oxygen and nutrients?,"There is lots of information online about the circulatory system, but it never seems to answer the question of ""targeting"".

620,how does the immune system identify allergens? application: varenicline and lobeline,"I'm wondering if we know how the immune system identifies allergens. My biochemistry knowledge is basic so I apologize if I use concepts incorrectly! Specifically, I want to know about the likelihood of having an allergic reaction to something, given an allergy to something else...   I'll clarify the situation with the following example:   Say a person develops an allergy to some molecule, A. Another molecule, B, has a different skeletal structure. A and B are both thought to have a similar mechanisms for the treatment of some medical problem. If a person is allergic to A, are they more likely to be allergic to B?  To make this even more concrete, let's say a person is allergic to varenicline, a synthetic molecule used to treat nicotine addiction. Is that person more likely to be allergic to Lobeline (indian tobacco)? They have different skeletal formulas, but varenicline is an agonist on nicotine acetlycholine receptors, while lobeline is a mixed agonist-antagonist on these receptors. (Maybe this is not relevant?).   Does the fact that both molecules have similar neurochemical mechanisms of action on dopamine receptors, have any implications as to whether the immune system would identify the new molecule as an allergen? What about an allergen, physical or chemical, is it that the immune system is actually ID'ing or remembering?  Disclaimer: I have an allergy to varenicline, and considered taking lobeline until i read they have similar neurochemical mechanisms. I'm not looking for advice, because I am not going to take lobeline. I'm just curious. Thanks in advance for any insight! "
621,Why do some medications have HCl?,"I have seen a lot of medications including a few that I take for certain situations. 1 of the medications that I occasionally take is Benadryl. The main component of this is Diphenhydramine HCl. I have always wondered why this and some other medications have HCl mixed with the main ingredient. I mean, HCl can dissolve pretty much anything given the time and is why people with Achlorhydria(total absence of HCl in their stomach) have iron deficiency anemia. HCl makes iron better absorbed.  But why do some medications have HCl in them if the HCl could potentially dissolve all the medication and make it useless(chemical burn to get medication useless)? Is it to increase the amount that is absorbed just like it does with iron?  "

623,Why do vitamin supplements often have quantities way in excess of RDAs?,"When I have a cold or otherwise feeling ill, I like to take vitamin C supplements. I've noticed that they almost invariably have amounts way above the recommended daily allowance.  For example, one that I'm looking at now contains 1000mg, where the RDA is 90mg. That is around 11x more than is needed. I've noticed similar things on other vitamin supplements.  What is the purpose in providing such large doses? This answer for example, suggests that 1000mg of vitamin C can actually be harmful. Why not just provide the RDA? "

Possible examples are relieving stress, increasing blood flow to brain, relaxation, boosting T-cells, triggering release of endorphins, etc.  I wondered whether laughing can cure diseases.  Is it true that laughing can cure diabetes and gastric pain as I've heard? Are there any other diseases that can be cured by laughing? "
625,Why does prosopagnosia (face blindness) only affect recognition of faces?,"I read a short story involving prosopagnosia (Wikipedia), which harms or fully removes a person's ability to remember and recognize faces, and I've since been doing reading to better understand the condition. The precise causes, as I understand it, are not well-known, although it is believed to be related to damage in the right fusiform gyrus:     Prosopagnosia is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus, a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems that control facial perception and memory.      NIH   As far as I'm aware, the fusiform gyrus has functions beyond facial recognition and analysis - although my knowledge of how facial recognition in the brain works is limited. Therefore, my naÃ¯ve logic is that damage to the region should also damage other (related) mental abilities, yet I can't find much information about other disabilities prosopagnosiacs may face, if any.  If prosopagnosia does arise from damage to the fusiform gynus, why are the effects merely limited to facial perception? If the effects are not this limited, are there any minor disabilities associated with the condition? "

At the same time, these same organizations acknowledge that carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient that the body needs to properly function and that about 50% of our caloric intake should come from them.  Now, aren't these two recommendations completely contradictory? All carbohydrates that the body can absorb eventually get turned into glucose, a simple sugar like any other.  Why is it bad to consume a bunch of table sugar (sucrose), for example, which is already half glucose and its other fructose half will also get converted into glucose anyway, but perfectly fine to consume other more complex carbohydrates that just like sucrose, will also end up being converted into glucose?  If both, simple sugars and all other carbohydrates end up as glucose in the body, then why does one get a bad rep and not the other? What's the difference? "
628,How often can we pull an all-nighter until the body is irreversible damaged?,"Many jobs in medicine, science, and economy require unsuitable commitment especially for early-career people. This can often lead to extension of the daily work far into the night.  Assume a 30-year-old works 8 hours a day and sleeps for 8 hours at night. Twice a week, s/he skips sleeping by pulling an all-nighter. One could try to recover from that long wake phase by sleeping a bit longer the next night. Assume the person follows this procedure for decades.    How often can this be safely done before the bodys suffers from serious damage? Should one stop at a certain age to prevent serious injury? What organs suffer the most?  "
629,What to eat when you are a skinny fat?,"I am 29 years old, I used to be fat, I was weighed more than 95 kg (I am 183 cm), And one day I decided to lose weight. I started to reduce food portions, no soda, no sugar on coffee and I lost 28 kg in 18 months, so I was 67kg (now I am 73 kg).  I do not do sport (just walking).  But something is still surprising me : I have super skin legs and shoulders and arms, but still have fat hips (not belly), it looks like my body is on a form of ""A"".  What can I do to lose those hips ? If I continue to reduce food, I think I'll be bonesy (especially on my face).  I am really lost and frustrated ! Is musculation and more food could be the solution ? "
630,"Data on ""perfect use"" vs ""typical use"" of contraceptives?","Different kinds of contraceptives have different yearly failure rates depending on whether the user of the contraceptive follows all the proper procedures for the contraceptive (""perfect use""), or uses the contraceptive as the typical person would (""typical use"").  [website]As part of a research project, I need to know what percentage of actual people use condoms (as well as other contraceptives) in such a way so as to fall into the ""typical use"" category or ""perfect use"" category.

At night, I put mustard seeds in a glass of water, and in the morning I crush them in a mixer grinder with that water and drink that.  Is it good for weight gain? Is there any another benefit if I drink this every morning?  When I searched on the internet, most website showed that mustard seeds reduce weight. "

634,Pain after root canal treatment,"Can there be pain in a tooth which has undergone root canal treatment about 3 years ago, due to breaking the crown of the tooth?   I would think that it should not, because the root nerve to the tooth is completely removed and has got nothing to do with crown breaking. Am I correct? "
635,Can I spread Shingles to other parts of my own body?,"I've got shingles. Yuck. It is possible for me to accidentally spread it to other parts of my own body? If the virus is on my fingers (from touching the blisters, I suppose) and I touch my eye, could it spread to my eye and make me go blind? If I touch my genitals, could I give myself genital herpes? These sound like really stupid questions written down but I don't want to take any chances. "
636,What are the dangers of breathing minerals that are dispersed into the air by a humidifier?,"The Mayo Clinic warns against the use of tap water in a humidifier:     Use distilled or demineralized water. Tap water contains minerals that can create deposits inside your humidifier that promote bacterial growth. And, when released into the air, these minerals often appear as white dust on your furniture. You may also breathe in some minerals that are dispersed into the air. Distilled or demineralized water has a much lower mineral content compared with tap water. In addition, use demineralization cartridges or filters if recommended by the manufacturer.   What are the dangers of breathing minerals that are dispersed into the air? "
637,Mechanisms that causes prominent veins during physical exercise,"I have just read this article about why veins become prominent while exercising: Why do veins pop out when exercising, and is that good or bad?   I have some questions about this:   The article mentions that the veins are pressed out to the skin by muscle contraction.   This makes sense. But how does one explain that athletes have often more bulging veins even when not exercising? Is this only due lower body fat percentages? Or is there also another mechanism acting? Consider the forehead or temple area. One sometimes notices also bulging veins while exercising. I don't see how this can be explained by muscle contraction since the muscles in the forehead and temple area are small and usually not (actively) contracted while exercising. So what is the relevant mechanism in this case? May it be indirectly caused by muscle contractions in the trapezius? But if so, how does it exactly work?  The article also mentions that the diastolic blood pressure raises while lifting weights. So contrary to the statement of the article that bulging veins are not due to higher blood pressure while exercising this effect is not ruled out in weightlifing since there the pressure is indeed raised. So how significant is this raise in blood pressure while lifting weights in explaining prominent veins (in comparison to the muscle contraction thesis)? This effect my be depend on the breathing technique (for example using valsalva maneauver or not).   If possible, please include references to books or peer reviewed articles into your answer.  "
638,Is this normal urinating?,"Is it normal for men to have to push, retrieve, push, retrieve at the end of urinating to get the last of it out? It's happens like 6 times or more, and it shoots out lines of pee, and I'm wondering if other guys just end peeing? "

640,What can cause reduced hearing range?,"Google tells me that the average human hearing range is 20-20000Hz, but I can only hear 30-14800. As I am below 30, this seems unlikely to be age-related hearing decline, so, what are the potential causes? And should I be concerned? "
641,I've always worn my clear nighttime retainers religiously. Can I get my permanent metal retainers taken out?,"I have a permanent metal retainer glued to the back of my top teeth. I have a second one glued to the back of my bottom teeth. They were put on immediately after my braces were taken off. Here's an example of what they look like:    It is too difficult to floss under the metal retainers, so unfortunately I don't. Even the dental hygienist has trouble.  I wear my clear nighttime retainers every night and always have (for several years now). These retainers fit over all of my teeth. I'm talking about these:    Assuming I maintain my habit of wearing the clear retainers every night, can I get my permanent metal retainers out? That is, if they are removed, will my teeth shift back to their pre-braces configuration?  In other words, is wearing clear nighttime retainers for 8 hours a day adequate to prevent teeth shift?    My reason for wanting my permanent metal retainers out is to be able to floss those teeth and improve my teeth and gum hygiene. Because, as it stands right now, I am only flossing about 50% of my teeth.     My understanding is that orthodontists insist on the permanent metal retainers because nearly everyone stops wearing the clear nighttime retainers eventually. I am in the minorityâpeople who make a concerted effort to wear the nighttime retainer until the day we die. But for those in this elite subset, is the metal retainer necessary? "
642,How does the process of receptor blocking impact the human cells in context of antihistamine drugs (irreversible antagonist)?,"I have problem in understanding what it really means that antagonist is irreversible.  I have an allergy and I stopped to take some drugs because of side effects. I tried to predict how long does it take to go to the same state as before taking drugs. I learned about biological half-life of medicines so I could predict how long it will take for drug to stop being active.  But then I read that my antihistamine drug is an irreversible antagonist. Iâve checked the definition, and if I understand it, this means that the receptors are permanently blocked through some reaction with this antagonist.  The question is: Does it mean that this cell which receptors are blocked is defective forever? And side effects will never go away because, in this case, cell needs histamine to work properly? Or we must wait for the cell to die and be replaced by new cell?  Sorry if my questions are not on appropriate level. "
643,Is decaffeinated coffee a diuretic?,"Caffeine is a known diuretic, stimulates urine production, and I have even seen ""potential dehydration"" as one of the arguments in the perennial ""is coffee good or bad"" debate. It also changes blood pressure, although I don't know if it is only through dehydration or if it has more direct effects on the cardiovascular system.   But coffee has many more active substances than just caffeine. What effect does the drinking of coffee have on fluid balance in the body? How does it influence urine excretion, the excretion of other fluid-influencing substances such as salt, is it related to blood pressure, does it change the levels of blood pressure regulating hormones (vasopressin, angiotensin, etc.)? Or are all such effects of coffee purely based on its caffeine content?   "
644,Fractured 2nd metatarsal near the toe - treatment options?,"I kicked a wall (don't ask!) and after some tooing and froing managed to get an x ray.   If clearly shows a clean fracture of the 2nd metatarsal near the toe, not displaced. I'll go through the NHS motions, but given it can take a while for the wheels to move I'd like to start to do the right thing.   Would this just require an air boot support generally? Or would it be cast? I can still walk on the heel and outside edge of my foot so I'm reasonably mobile still... Any initial advice and any tips to speed up healing would be great!  Here's the x ray, right foot, oblique angle - equally, does this look like it may require surgury to place and of the fractured bones?  [website]"
645,Can filling cavities affect Invisalign treatment?,"I am 5 months into an Invisalign treatment which is set to last one more year. During my annual checkup, my dentist found that I have two cavities and recommended that they be filled.

If so, should I try deferring the fillings until later or should I have the aligner adjusted? "

How effective is EECP compared to angioplasty and Bypass ?  Will it really be considered as an alternative to the other two methods ?  Why it is not that popular as other methods ? 
648,Is There a Way to Stimulate Taste Buds After Stroke?,"After a stroke late last year, my 87 year-old grandfather hasn't been doing so hot. After being discharged from the hospital's rehab center, he has been in our care for over two months. Keeping food down has been interesting lately, as he has developed a strong dislike for most foods over the last month and a half since what seemed like another stroke.  In accordance with our observations, credible resources confirm that strokes can cause ""altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision"".1,2 It seems that there is plenty of material confirming the degeneration of taste, but solutions seem harder to come by, and requiring of diagnosis by a physician, brain scans, etc. which wouldn't be viable right now.  Is there a way to stimulate taste buds, or help the brain recognize taste again?   Edited on Tuesday, March 8: After we heard that one of his somewhat recently prescribed medications might have been causing a bad taste (additional source) in his mouth, we discontinued use about two weeks ago. Now there might be more foods he will tolerate (it's hard to say for sure since we're trying foods we hadn't before), but he still hates others. I haven't found a significant number of sources that seem credible suggesting a correlation, and wonder if it's probably not related.  I know that Health.SE ""is not intended as a substitute for individualized diagnosis and treatment by a qualified healthcare provider."" He is on hospice, and therefore his insurance won't cover hospital visits, and his finances are quite minimal, so any reasonable advice I can get would be greatly appreciated, and won't really be substitution for professional advice. (Of course, unreasonable advice would also be welcome, given good references.)  "

652,Are There Reliable Sulfur-Based Blood-Clotting Products That Target Internal Bleeding,"In WWII, the military used a sulfur-based powder to promote blood clotting, especially in traumatic internal injuries.  The usefulness of such a product is obvious.  My question is whether there is anything like that available for the average consumer.  I have found very little online.  One product (Pac-Kit) is out there, but it's offered in very small amounts.  It's so small, I imagine it would only be useful for external injuries.  Has this technology been superseded by something even more effective?  Has this technology been debunked recently?  There are a million first-aid products out there.  It's surprising there's not much out there for this. "
653,Treatment of dorsal wrist ganglia,"I've been researching dorsal wrist ganglion cysts and trying to find more information on treatment outcomes, both in terms of recurrence and incidence of complications.  I found a good review article, but unfortunately I can only see the abstracts for most of its references.  My main question:  The rates for spontaneous resolution and recurrence after treatment with aspiration both appear to be near 50% (with a pretty wide variability of reported outcomes.)  This suggests that it may be difficult to tell the difference between a ganglion that would've resolved on its own vs. one that was was only resolved due to aspiration.  Are there any studies that attempt to address this?  Related questions:  Is there any information on the reported duration of ganglion cysts in the case that they do spontaneously resolve?  I imagine this is complicated by lack of follow-up by patients when the problem goes away.  Are there any reported complications due to aspiration of dorsal ganglion cysts?  I found a reference to a 5% complication rate in a referenced article from the survey (abstract here), but this was for palmar ganglia.  Lacking more specific data, are there known complications for aspiration procedures in general? "
654,Washing the ear?,"I'm 21 and I've never had earwax problems until about a year ago.  In the past month, I've had what I believe to be ear infections (or maybe just hardened earwax) in one ear and then 2 weeks later, the other ear. They are extremely painful, and I've been taking pain killers. This has severely effected my work.  Sometimes when I poke my finger into my ear and scrape with my fingernail, large chunks of ear wax comes out. I don't remember this every happening when I was younger.  I'm trying to learn more about how I can prevent this by understanding how I should treat my ears in order to prevent this from happening in the future.  I've been cleaning the hole in my ear with my wash cloth which has soap on it using a single finger. Is this bad? Will this actually increase the amount of earwax or possibly the soap mixes with the ear wax in some way leaving infection prone residue in my ear? Should I just try to not get soap or water in my ear? I've also noticed that I have these problems when I was using Dove soap, which I've always felt the residue burns the skin. Or are the hypotheses totally wrong, and it's just normal for some people to get a ton of earwax. "
655,Is it possible to have a smile on the face after death?,"A lot of novels state that a person died with a smile on the face, or how relatives/friends notice a smile on the face that remains even after death.

659,Are these studies about red algae reducing cold virus by 92% believable?,"I was using this spray meant to hasten recovery from the common cold. A study [1], sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that produces the spray, stated it reduced virus by 92% (this value only appear on the promotional material), and so shortens the duration of the common cold.  Meanwhile a doctor told me that these kinds of things don't work.  I found some ""similar"" studies [2,3, 4, 5 ,6] but I lack the competence to assert their value.  Does someone have some perspective on this? Are these believable studies? Was it well designed, and has it been duplicated?  If so, why wouldn't the pharmaceutical produced a certified and expensive drug instead of a no-prescription drug? I would think anything that would hasten common cold would get an enormous buzz (and profit...).  [1] [website][2] [website][3] [website][4] [website][5] [website][6] [website]"

When I ask about activation, I mean this: get the relevant muscles to stay tense and active for a long time after the workout so that my posture stays OK with less conscious effort. What is a training modality or exercise to achieve this effect?  I'm mostly looking at planks and kneeling ab-wheel rollouts as exercises that have, I think, a more max-strength focus for me but I also occasionally do exercises with a stronger strength-endurance focus.  Should I prioritize one over the other to achieve muscle activation?  (I've asked this on fitness but it may be appropriate here, too) "

I believe that too much Vitamin A is not good for you, and going above the RDA by twice as much of anything probably isn't a good idea. But there is no way to avoid it as both capsules have 100% RDA.  Am I risking damaging my kidneys by giving them too much Vitamin A to process in one go?

678,What needs to be exposed for the body to produce Vitamin D?,"What parts of the body need to be exposed to sunlight for the body to produce Vitamin D?  Some say it's the skin, some say it's the eyes, and some say it's a combination.  The most common answer I have received from doctors is that ""it's just the skin, not the eyes"" (although I have heard all three from them).  But I remember seeing a television show that talked about dramatic increase in disease of indigenous people living near the Amazon river when they started wearing sunglasses provided introduced by non-natives.  The investigators came to the conclusion that the disease was most likely caused by the introduction of the sunglasses because they were preventing the production of Vitamin D.  Naturally, I take anything I hear, see, or read with a grain of salt (especially from the boob tube), but that TV show made an impression, for whatever reason.  Is there any truth to it?  Although good for the eyes, does wearing sunglasses reduce the amount of Vitamin D we produce? "

683,How long is infectious mononucleosis contagious?,"The English Wikipedia article about infectious mononucleosis says about transmission:     The length of time that an individual remains contagious is unclear, but the chances of passing the illness to someone else may be the highest during the first six weeks following infection. Some studies indicate that a person can spread the infection for many months, possibly up to a year and a half.    So according to this, you may be contagious for at most 78 weeks.  The German Wikipedia article about this disease (Pfeiffer-DrÃ¼senfieber) says about transmission:     AuÃerdem kommt es nach der Ausheilung der Erkrankung immer wieder zu Reaktivierungen der persistierenden Viruserkrankung. Von diesen bemerkt der Betroffene in der Regel nichts, er scheidet dann aber wieder Viren im Speichel aus.   This roughly translates to: The persistent viral disease reactivates itself frequently. Affected persons usually donât notice this, but in these periods the virus is contained in their saliva.  So according to this, you may be contagious your whole life, but only periodically.  Is this really contradictory or am I missing something? What is correct? "

689,What happens to melatonin and the circadian rythm when one adopts biphasic sleep cycle?,"I have read that the sleep cycle is driven by melatonin, and that there is a  natural 24h ""sine-wave"" of melatonin, where during the day, melatonin is at low levels, while during the night, it is at high levels.  However, I'm wondering, if one adopts a biphasic sleep cycle, where one e.g. sleeps 4 hours during the night and 4 hours during the afternoon, or 6 hours during the night and 2 hours during the afternoon, will that turn the circadian rythm/melatonin-sine-wave into a ""double-frequency sine wave""? i.e. will there be a bumb in melatonin during your afternoon nap?

690,Negative health effects of loneliness?,"Feeling lonely seems like a natural phenomena, but are there negative health consequences of specifically feeling lonely? What exactly happens in the brain to make a person feel lonely?   And if it has negative conseuqences, what actions should one take to amend these negative effects? I assume one would be to interact with people more, but given limited time, energy, and commitment abilities, I wonder if other techniques exist. "
691,Heart Rate Versus Respiratory Rate,"There are times when my respiratory rate increases more than my heart rate.  If running or cycling at a stead state (flat terrain, constant speed), heart rate and respiratory reach some steady state.   Then I start up a hill or run/cycle a sprint (say over several minutes), my breathing greatly increases but my heart doesn't change all that much.  At other times when climbing a long hill at a steady state over a period of time (say 30 - 60 minutes), my heart rate can get fairly high but I'm not breathing that hard.  Without commenting on my personal situation, what I'm trying to understand what is the normal relationship between heart rate vs respiratory rate in the human body during exercise?  I'm guessing that what I'm noticing is just anaerobic exercise?  What is the physiology of this relationship?  "

693,Need to exhale while holding breath,"Recently I tried holding my breath for as long as I could. I managed to hold it for almost 2 minutes, but after a bit more than 1 minute, I already felt a strong need to exhale some of the air. At the same time, I did not feel like I had to inhale again though. I ended up with two possible explanations:  1. At the beginning, I took a deep breath of air which was about 20 Â°C in temperature. After this one minute in my lungs, the air warmed up (I assumed it warmed up to 35 Â°C). For the sake of simplicity, I calculated with the ideal gas law  pV = nRT  that the pressure in the lung would increase by about 5%. Ok, this is why I had to release some air. But wait...  2. From what I learned about physiology, I know that our body has certain chemoreceptors to determine the oxygen saturation in our blood. And there are such chemoreceptors for carbon dioxide as well. The concentration of CO2 in my blood reached a certain threshold and I experienced this strong need to exhale.  Can anybody of you confirm one of these theories? Or are both of them wrong? "
694,Why is the cost of health care so high?,"Can someone explain in simple but very concrete terms why medical services cost so much in the US?  By cost, I am referring here to the medical fees being charged prior to any adjustments or reimbursements by the insurance.  I understand it takes many years of hard work to become a doctor and they deserve to be remunerated for that hard work. I really do.  I do get that medical students come out of school with massive debts as well.  I do understand there are significant costs in operating medical facilities, purchasing high-end medical equipment, running a medical staff, and being insured against law suits perhaps.  With a stretch of my imagination, I may see how all this adds up so that a visit to the doctor is charged for [tex]200 even though the actual interaction with the doctor + nurse is usually on the order of 10 minutes per patient.  10 minutes for a few hundred [tex] to cover the salary of the medical staff, the rent, and amortizing the cost of medical equipment. That seems very high to my intuition but I can at least make some sense of it.  But then on top of the visit cost, there are often ""extra"" costs that seem completely disproportionate with what is being done.  From random personal experience: - a hospital charging ~$20 for one pill of ibuprofen - a dermatologist charging an extra ~$150 for ~10 second procedures such as spraying nitrogen on a foot wart - a few hundred bucks for spending less than a minute taking a skin sample for a biopsy (charge for the biopsy itself separate) - a visit to the ER for a very minor injury resulting in one stitch point on a finger and a medical bill >$1,500    What is the reasoning behind these charges?  Could someone perhaps break down in simple concrete numbers the operating expenses of, say, a medical office, and a hospital and help me understand how this explains why an ibuprofen pill costs [tex]150 extra? "
695,How much food when taking vitamin supplements?,"If you want to take a few vitamin supplements but don't have time for a meal, would 50 calories or so of food be good enough?

696,"Definition of ""prospective birth cohort study""","From a news article:     âProspective birth cohort studies suggest that childhood infections are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia in adulthood and with abnormal neurodevelopment in childhood/adolescence as measured by school grade or neurological soft signs; however, studies using IQ tests in a general population sample are rare,â Golam M. Khandaker, PhD, department of psychiatry, University of Cambridge, and colleagues wrote. âIt is unclear whether lower IQ mediates or moderates the association between childhood infection and adult psychosis.â   What is a ""prospective birth cohort study""? Is it a study planned in advance, before the data collection process begins? Is it always a study that begins before the persons to be studied have been born?   Or can it be a study conducted post-factum, with some information taken from records that existed prior to the beginning of the study?   I translated this term into Russian word-for-word, but was told by a fellow translator that I should explicitly point out in my Russian translation, as an explanation for the reader, that these studies are ""begun prior to the birth of the test subjects"". I started googling for clear authoritative definitions and have found none thus far. "
697,"Olive oil - healthy as a substitute, or in its own right?","There are many articles about extra virgin olive oil being healthy - for example here. This implies, at least, that replacing other fats in the diet (such as butter or other vegetable oils) with olive oil is beneficial. But is olive oil also beneficial to health when consumed in larger amounts? Assuming it is not contributing too many calories and leading to an unhealthy weight.  I really love the taste of olive oil, and enjoy snacks like bread with olive oil, or just using it as a dressing on lots of things. Is this healthy (because olive oil is healthy) or unhealthy (because, even though it is a ""good"" oil, having a larger fat intake is still bad)? "

I understand the long term effects of alcohol in causing alcoholic steatohepatitis. However while looking for the causes of acute liver failure, I only came across paracetamol poisoning and viral hepatitis as potential causes.  Are the harmful effects of alcohol on the liver limited to chronic abuse? Or can a person who has never indulged, potentially risk liver failure after just a single episode of excessive consumption?

Is it dangerous for an old lady to take pneumococcal vaccine twice within 2 years? Any over-dosage hazard to be mindful of? 
702,Can diabetes relieve symptoms of hemophilia?,"This question can be seen silly, but I wondered about this question for several years. I learned that diabetes make our blood so sticky that it can block blood flows of capillary vessels.

Does the sticky blood caused by diabetes help stopping bleeding the area?  Yeah, I know that blood coagulation factors like pibrin are the primary factors for stopping bleeding, but I want to know the effects of sticky blood caused by diabetes on cut area.  P.S. Sorry for poor English. "

Dartmouth University   I also found some sites that mentioned that higher cholestrol resulted from people who were more stressed, but I believe there might be a confounding factor whereby people eat more unhealthy foods to compensate for stress.

I wonder, is there a precise biological mechanism whereby we can reduce stress by reducing cholestrol intake? "
705,What happens to the heart during cardiac arrest?,"I am confused about whether the heart stops beating during cardiac arrest or not. The answer in this question states, ""the heart does not pump blood sufficiently to sustain life."" Isn't that the definition of heart failure? This article states that a flat-lined heart can not be revived. However, in the case of cardiac arrest, the patient's heart can be revived. If this article is correct, then the heart does not stop beating aka flat lines when it is in cardiac arrest. However, in this article,  it is clearly stated that the heart stops beating during an ongoing cardiac arrest.  So, which is correct? Does the heart stop beating during a cardiac arrest, or no? If it does stop beating, how is that not the definition of death? Does a person have any consciousness in this time? Do they have an neurons firing in the brain? Since the brain doesn't die a few minutes after death, is the person able to hear, feel pain, think or feel any stimulus while they are in cardiac arrest?  "
706,The next generation of contact lenses,"My eyes have the problem of keratoconus and the last 10 years I live using rigid gas contact lenses. The last years piggy-backs. But I am not so satisfied with the precision and accuracy. To be more specific, I am not feeling that in our times this field is up to date. It is still in Machine Age. Nothing in harmony with the Information Age.  So I am wondering, I am kind of crazy to miss a contact lens with cpu and ram or something like that, being able to see other galaxies? On the other hand, these rigid gas ones are relatively cheap (100 - 200 Euro), and you can use them for 1-2 years but I can afford even 5000 euros every 6 months to have something better. But capitalism does not give me this opportunity. Hard and Scleral ones are on the same level, nothing completely serious.  My questions: Does this field really have problem of not being up to date? Why it happens? Or I have not understood something well? It is expected a new generation of contact lenses soon, and how it will be?  Thank you all for your answers. "

I live in Vancouver, British Columbia (Pacific Northwest). At first, the bite didn't hurt too much, but hours later, the punctured site get swollen and redder and redder, and the pain began to increase. Soon a blister formed around it.   Now the redness has radiated and a line stems from it continuing down my body. The blister has since burst and there is a scaley brown ulcer that has emerged. The redness are also dry and flaky and hot to the touch. Also, the pain feels deeper? The bite is on my chest, and it hurts when I breathe.

712,Omega 3/6/9 versus Omega 3 supplements,"Are there any benefits to taking an Omega 3/6/9 supplement versus just taking an Omega 3 supplement?  According to Wikipedia, in a ""typical Western diet"" the ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 fatty acids is already too high, and many commonly-used cooking oils already contain ample amounts of Omega 6, so it seems counterproductive to consume even more Omega 6 in supplement form.   Omega 9, again according to Wikipedia, seems to be non-essential (i.e. can be synthesized by the body), and it also seems to be present in commonly-used oils, so supplementation seems a bit pointless.  Yet, I see Omega 3/6/9 supplements being sold.   Are these 3/6/9 supplements just a marketing trick, or do they actually have any real advantages over the omega-3-only supplements? Or is the 3/6/9 combined supplement supposed to be helpful for a specific health condition (where just omega 3 would be less helpful)? If so, which condition(s)?  "
713,Are water only fasts healthy?

Absolutely no other foods or beverages (no additional micro/macro nutrients) is taken during the fast duration.  Questions -   Is this fasting protocol healthy? Any medical studies/literature explaining why it would be health/unhealthy? If the answer to #2 is negative, then wouldn't intermittent fasting in a paleo type of diet context be unhealthy as well? My understanding is that it'll involve similar type of fasting protocol but on alternate days.  "

716,"Swab tests reveals I have a staph infection. Can it tell if it's MRSA? Or is that a different test? If so, can that distinguish HA-MRSA & C-MRSA?","I had a blistered rash that kept spreading so my doctor took a swab to see if there was any kind of bacterial cultures present. The results came back today -- I am positive for a staph infection.   Because I have Lupus, and have had over 15 surgeries, my doctor asked me asked me if I had a history of MSRA (I suspect HA-MRSA, considering my medical history), but I had not heard of MSRA before so  I told him ""no."" So he prescribed me Cefalexin.   Do the the swab tests they do to see if any bacterial cultures grow --- do they give information if the staph infection is resistant to antibiotics -- caused by MRSA? If so, would the info be detailed enough to tell whether or not if I had HA-MRSA or C-MRSA? Or would they have to do a different kind of testing for that?   I'm assuming I'll eventually know if I have MRSA by seeing if my staph infection gets better, but I'm wondering if the tests would have had the results for that to begin with? Or if that is just determined based off of medical history and living conditions?  "

720,How can a marathon eater maintain their health?,"Longtime lurker, first-time poster.  My best friend (who is a big user of this site) was reading this post from another forum:  [website]He's a super competitive guy, and he's now got this into his head that he's going to try out marathon eating.  I was telling him this is crazy and it's going to be horrible for his health, but he insists that it's not that bad.  So to settle some disagreements, we both agree that I should post some questions here:    How does one actually keep their health while doing something like this?  Are there certain exercises or eating habits that will help? This guy talks about eating over 100 McDonalds burgers in 12 hours and 44 boxes of Oreos in 8 hours.  How does one actually do that?  Is there a physical limit on how much somebody can eat?  Do they exercise while eating to burn calories? If someone were to attempt to marathon eat, what are the best/worst foods to do this with? How much rest does somebody need between marathons?   Thanks! "
721,How important is having an anti-reflection layer on a glass lens?,"There are many factors that play a role when a person chooses their next pair of glasses. For example, I would think that the exact material of the lens would be of crucial importance. Yet, it looks like having/not having an anti-reflection layer is (at least marketed as) a crucial component for a decent pair of glasses.  I have had three pairs of glasses, one of which had the anti-reflection layer. I failed to notice any difference whatsoever. Now that I am buying my 4th pair, I would like to know:  How could we measure the difference between the lens with and without the anti-reflection layer? Are their any comparison studies/hard facts that an anti-reflection layer significantly improves the lens ability to convey light?  Related search on the physics.stackexchange. In particular, this Q&amp;A makes me believe that an anti-reflection layer makes sense only when the following is known:   exact wavelength exact angle of incidence    Which makes me further doubt that anti-reflection layer is important.

725,"Is there a disease that involves progressive loss of feeling, a tremor, and muscle twitches?","I have seen multiple doctors, including a neurologist, who are bewildered by my symptoms.   Upon altering the dose of lamotrigine from 400 mg to 375 mg, and then back up to 400 mg (split into two doses), I experienced violent myclonic jerks soon after administration of the medication, and noticed a numbness in my right palm, and a tremor I didn't previously have in my left. I also recall consuming alcohol and taking Valium that night.  Shaken by the experience, I begun to taper off the lamotrigine under my doctor's guidance.   Over the following few days, the numbness that I initially noticed in my right palm spread throughout the right side of my body. Although originally localized to my right side, this numbness soon presented on my left palm, and spread until  my capacity to perceive pressure, temperature, pain etc. was noticeably reduced throughout my whole body (including head).    I also experienced frequent muscle twitches throughout the day, and continued to experience myclonic jerks following the administration of the night dose of the lamotrigine.  Now, having tapered off the lamotrigine, my body continues to loose sensation. I experience occasional muscle twitches, and have a tremor in my left hand that I did not previously. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is a ""normal"" ability to perceive somatic-sensation, and 0 being none, I would be a 3.   Is there a label that encompases these symptoms?  I have had an EEG, MRI, blood test (B12, etc.) and EMG. All of these tests have come back as normal. Where should I go from here?  I would like to highlight that I am off the lamotrigine, and continue to lose sensation throughout my body. "

727,"How common is the side-effect of ""outbursts of words/sounds"" for one taking Dexedrine for ADD?","A few years ago, I was diagnosed with adult ADD. Initially, I was prescribed with Adderall when I lived in the USA, but when I moved to Canada, my doctors switched me to Dexedrine for whatever reason (I think costs?).   Around the same time I started taking Dexedrine (about 4 years ago), I developed a quirk where I randomly blurt out words (such as names of my family members) or make little yelps for no reason whatsoever -- even when I was alone. I thought I was just an odd person. My family noticed it too when I visited them, and they playfully make fun of me. And I never understood why it is that I do this because I don't consciously make the decision to do these things. It's not a big deal, and it's not harming my life in any capacity, it's just odd... especially since I'm such a serious person.   Then one day I was reading the fine print of the side-effects of Dexedrine (to see if it could be causing other symptoms in my life), and I noticed that it says: ""outbursts of words/sounds"" on  [website]What does that mean exactly? Does that explain my quirky behavior? Is their a medical definition for this type of behavior? Is it like turrets of the mouth?

731,How do I confirm death and the need for CPR?,"How can I confirm that someone is dead with 100% certainty?  I have read many articles about this issue but all of them have only what I consider superficial information. All of them focus about some essential points to confirm death:   To listen for lung sounds for 1 min. To listen for heart sounds for 1 min. To check the carotid pulse. To assess the pupil reaction to light. To assess the response to a painful stimuli.   My argument is that for points 1 and 2 above, the person might be simply obese or having a pneumothorax/pleural effusion or pericardial effusion for example and thus the heart/lung sounds can be very low and difficult to hear. For point 3, the person might have simply a hypotension, and even the carotid artery pulse can't be palpated. For point 4, the person might have an old CVA or blind for other reasons and the pupil reaction to light is absent. For point 5, if the person is in a coma, he might not respond to a painful stimuli. Other signs of death like cold extremities can't be relied on.  The other related question is when to start CPR. Of course in a hospital if the person has a cardiac arrest (recognized as absent pulse + unresponsive + difficult/absent breathing), we start CPR right away, but in the ED department or in a clinic (where we might not have an ECG machine), how can I tell whether the person is dead and there is no need for CPR or he/she is not and I should start CPR?

732,Parts of the Brain,How can we prove that certain parts of the brain are involved with certain functions? Is it through showing subjects images and then using neuroimaging to see what parts of the brain light up? I am specifically interested in emotions and memory. 
733,Are tourniquets only used to stop bloodflow?,"Basically you only use a Tourniquet on a hemmorhage/bleeding that you can't stop.  However, on medium sized bleedings, you need to use a bandage and apply a lot of preassure (for example you do the knot on top of the wound). Wouldn't it make sense to put a cat tourniquet over that spot, and tighten it only a bit (but not all the way), to add some extra pressure?  Normally you would first put down a layer of gauze-bandage, before covering the wound up with a cover-bandage. Wouldn't it make sense to do this with a SWAT-T (Tourniquet) instead? To add some extra pressure, when covering it? "

735,Supersaturation vs Undersaturation of the Urine | Kidney Stones,"A significant factor that determines if a crystal will develop into a kidney stone is the saturation of the urine with stone-forming salts. From my understanding, supersaturation leads to precipitates which result in stones. Undersaturation does not lead to stones. So my question is what determines super/undersaturation from a dietary perspective? Does increased water intake help dilute the concentration of the crystals (eg. calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate), thus preventing the formation of stones?  "
736,Biochemistry of (tap water) iontophoresis?,"I'm curious to know what science has to say about the biochemical processes of tap water iontophoresis. I was trying to find some insights from the mechanism of action to answer things like:   Why does it block sweat glands? How does it affect other types of glands/cells in the (epi-) dermis, i.e., what are the side effects? What are the processes that trigger reddening of the skin and tingling/pain in the first place? For instance, is this the result of direct stimulation of e.g. TRPV1 or rather the result of destroyed cells triggering an immune response.   Searching for a good resource of the science behind iontophoresis on Google/PubMed seems to be difficult because information is commonly targeted for iontophoresis end-users and publications often focus on the drug administration aspect.    Side-note: personal iontophoresis fun fact  I was using iontophoresis on my hands with room-temperature water on one hand, and fridge-temperature water on the other hand. After 4 weeks of daily application, I noticed a significant difference between the two hands: In my case, cold-water iontophoresis seems to be much more efficient in blocking sweat glands. I couldn't find this effect in literature, but I'm wondering if it could be explained from the underlying biochemical processes. "

740,Did Gary Taubes prove that cholesterol levels between 200 mg/dl and 240 mg/dl are normal and healthy?,"I am now holding the original, Polish edition book called ""The Hidden Therapies - What your doctor won't tell you"" authored by Jerzy ZiÄba, who is widely considered to be a quack by medical authorities in my country. Nevertheless, the sheer amount of facts (or ""facts""?) and research papers cited by Mr. ZiÄba warrants some closer skeptical attention.   Among many other claims Mr. ZiÄba says that cholesterol levels between 200 mg/dl and 240 mg/dl are healthy. In particular, he cites Gary Taubes, who in an article titled âThe soft science of dietary fatâ, published in March 2001 in Science, supposedly proved that:   No increased risk of mortality in women nor men was associated with cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dl to 240 mg/dl; Cholesterol level of 240 mg/dl was associated with a reduced risk of mortality among women from heart diseases.   Did Gary Taubes publish an article claiming these things?  Does this article indeed prove what Mr. ZiÄba claims it to prove?  The aforementioned claims come from: Ukryte Terapie - Czego lekarz ci nie powie by Jerzy ZiÄba, vol. 2, pages 107-112. "
741,Machine learning for medical image scanning,"I'm searching for a topic of interest in the domain of machine learning and computer vision. More specifically, researching can computer vision be applied to classify medical image scans and/or predict the future state of a scan. I'm not a health care professional so in order to frame the problem into something that is attainable I'm aiming to research the topic of image scanning some more.  What I would like to know is :   What is the current state of the art of image scanning technology ?  What are it's weaknesses ?  I have many unknown unknowns and I'm unsure where to start to attain a basic knowledge.  Book recommendations are welcome, for example this book seems like a good place to start :  For example the book ""Medical Imaging for the Health Care Provider: Practical Radiograph Interpretation "" : [website]The dataset I'm intending to use for this research is 'DeepLesion'  [website]Update : this seems like a good place to start : Medical imaging - image quality?  Update 2:  I'm aiming to utilize image and annotated data from DeepLesion to develop an AI to diagnose future and/or present state of a scan. 'future state of a scan' refers to predicting the future state of scan attributes . The attributes are what is contained in the DeepLesion annoted dataset which includes lesion diameter, patient gender and patient age. So I will attempt to predict 1 or a combination of these attributes.Â   At this stage I'm not aiming for the AI model to perform a diagnosisis or prognosis but provide a prediction of attributes that aids the healthcare practitioner in performing the diagnosis or prognosis. Due to DeepLesion containing CT image scans the healthcare practitioner in this case is a radiographer.Â   Other type of more high level predictions/classifications I may consider are detecting liver, lung, kidney lesions.  The type of predictions are dependant on the type of data available.Â   Another research question I have is what type of predictions are of most value to the practitioner. This will help focus my research. "
742,CPR on injured person?,"I have taken CPR training. Sometimes you read in the newspaper, a person injured in a car crash or anything, that they tried CPR in vain. I'm wondering, when a person is seriously injured, what's the point of CPR? Why would you try CPR when the blood is flowing away anyway? "
743,Is the drug's effectiveness directly proportional to the half life formula?,For instance half life of a 150ml drug injected to you is 50 days (so you have 75ml left in your system). At 100 days you'll have 37.5ml left in your system. But does that mean the drug is most effective as well on the first 50 days? And only becomes half as effective between 50 days to 100 days? 
744,Can side effects on test drug be not fully disclosed and still ethical?,"Say a doctor invites a patient to test a new drug, because there is currently no effective drug to cure the illness. The patient says ""I trust that what you are doing is best for my benefit. I'll take it.""   But to avoid placebo/psychological effect, are they allowed to not fully disclose all side effects that the drug has, even when they know it? For example, they know ahead that the drug will make the patient nausea and body burning, but they just say that it will make them mildly dizzy. Is that ethical? The patient should have been informed all these effects before accepting the experiment â failing to do that breaks the trust they put on the doctor. But if telling their expectations to the side effects can distort the actual results.  I'm interested in the case of no treatment is available, but without a treatment the patients only continue to suffer the illness, not die.    Related: Is it ethical to deliberately provide incorrect information to participants in a psychological study? "

746,Is daylight savings linked to heart attacks?,"I was told this earlier today and a quick search produced the following Reuters report from 2014:  [website]This is the first paragraph of the article:     Switching over to daylight saving time, and losing one hour of sleep, raised the risk of having a heart attack the following Monday by 25 percent, compared to other Mondays during the year, according to a new U.S. study released on Saturday.   The study was led by ""Dr. Amneet Sandhu, a cardiology fellow at the University of Colorado in Denver who led the study.""  I don't know how to research something like this and so my question is twofold:   Is the study credible? How would I find the original study?  "
747,Is going to sleeping with socks beneficial or detrimental?,"I've recently read this piece:  Is sleeping with socks on good for you?  from ""MedicalNewsToday"", and supposedly reviewed by a ""PhD, RN"". Having moved into a poorly-insulated apartment, and being generally sensitive to cold in my feet I'm considering this possibility. Now that I've heard a pro-socks spiel - I'd like to ask:   Whether any research has been done on the effect of socks on quality of sleep, particularly in colder ambient temperature and/or with people who report feeling cold feet in bed. (If it's anecdotal / local small sample study - please mention that.) Can an opposite case be made - against sleeping with socks - based on established medical fact, even if the conclusion is more speculative (like in the link I gave)?   PS - For the sake of discussion let's ignore the fact there are many kinds of socks one could use. "
748,The effects of heating and lighting using open flames on brain health?,"There are many sources that indicate that people are healthier and live longer than people 100 years ago. I have also seen studies that show IQs are higher by something like a standard deviation than those of our recent ancestors.   The latter is called the Flynn Effect and I think a major cause is supposed to be improved nutrition which sounds plausible to me. Air pollution being significantly less (elimination of leaded gasoline) has also been mentioned. But what I wonder is, how reasonable is it to attribute the differences to the prevalence of fireplaces and gas flames being used by people prior to modern heating and lighting? Is it possible that literally millions of people had chronic, low-level carbon monoxide poisoning, not to mention the effects of particulate matter that they were inhaling?  EDIT: And in the present, in the developing world, people might also be affected by the same thing. A reason to try to get the benefits of reliable electricity to more of our fellow humans. "
749,Is reduced brain health really inevitable for those who can't use their legs even with upper body exercises?,"Is reduced brain health really inevitable for those who can't use their legs even with upper body exercises?  According to this article, mice that were prevented from using their hind legs lost 70% of their neural stem cells even though they could use their front legs. [website]People with polio, spinal cord injuries, or leg injuries may have little or no use of their legs but can often use their upper bodies. Think of them doing wheelchair based sports, handcycling, or weight lifting.  Would those activities prevent the loss of their neural stem cells? Is it possible that the loss of neural stem cells was caused by not burning enough calories?  Arms tend to be weaker than legs that means fewer calories can be burned. I imagine that 100W (considered an easy pace for many of us while walking) with our arms isn't easy to sustain for many of us.  "

751,Which conditions are associated with (multiple) food allergies?,"Most people with food allergies are allergic to one or few foods, but allergies to more than three foods are relatively rare (PubMed, 2010). In some people who are allergic to several foods, an underlying condition is discovered, for example:   Atopy Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID)   Question: Are there other known conditions that are associated with food allergies and are there any known triggers that trigger their onset?  To put the questions in the context: Does it make sense for someone with (multiple) food allergies to undergo investigations to find an eventual underlying disorder or trigger? Because, sometimes, treatment with desensitization  may be possible.  The focus of the question is not on ""multiple,"" but I was thinking it is more likely that multiple allergies have known underlying causes. So, I'm looking for a list of ""underlying conditions,"" ""related conditions,"" ""risk factors"" and ""triggers"" of food allergies.  "
752,What nutritional flaws are there in an amino-diet?,"I am trying to talk a friend out of starting on a new cleanse / diet fad, which consists of some products with ""concentrated amino acids"" and some sugars and fats, and very little else. Apparently, the idea is that the body can produce whatever it needs from just amino acids and sugars/fats, and thus avoid ""toxins"". I convinced her to at least take vitamin and fiber supplements, but beyond that, she swears that this diet has all her body needs. Does it? If no, what consequences can this fad have for her health and why, so I can talk her out of it? "
753,Can superficial injury and exercise elevate AST and LDH levels?,"Reading the information available here and here, it's stated that both exercise and other injuries can cause elevated results on a couple of indicators commonly used to measure liver function.  Specifically, it's noted that:     High levels of AST may be caused by:         [...]   Very strenuous exercise or severe injury to a muscle.      ...and:     Some of the elevated LDH level causes include tissue damage due to   trauma or disease, a recent heart attack, disease of the liver or the   kidney or even the lungs, cancer, anemia, HIV, meningitis or   encephalitis to name a few.   Which are fairly consistent but also a bit vague.    For instance, how strenuous must the exercise be to trigger a detectable increase?  Are we talking about something on the order of running a marathon, or more like pushing things a bit too hard at the gym?  And when it comes to injury/trauma, would superficial injuries like cuts, scrapes, and bruises be expected to have an effect, or must it be something more severe like a heart attack or other major internal injury?  Lastly, what magnitude of increase would typically be attributable to ""strenuous exercise or severe injury""?  "
754,Where can I find information about foods fatty acids?,"Question  I want to be able to search for foods by specific fatty acids. My specific use case is finding foods with short- and medium-chain fatty acids but not long-chain fatty acids.  Are there any data-sets / websites that provide this sort of information? This is the sort of thing that either requires programmatic filtering of the dataset or for someone else to have specifically provided features for searching based on this criteria.  Approaches tried  The USDA database does not provide this information. As included in @tetraminos answer below, USDA contains the necessary information: individual fatty acids are given names like ""4:0"" and ""16:1 undifferentianted"" with codes like ""F4D0""  Self nutrition data appears to have this information, but no effective way to search for what I want  (fatty acids more details). Is there data derived from a public source?  Given a particular food you can often find the information you want by googling. "

758,Downward Double-Vision,"If I focus on the ring in this image (the ring is 1 cm tall on my monitor, I stand 300 cm away, the room is dark, and I cover one eye), I actually see an ""8"" formed from double-vision where the lower ring is dimmer.  So, I'd simply say that this lower ring is caused by a cataract.  To be honest, the ""cataract ring"" is not just lower, but also slightly right; the off-vertical angle is roughly 20 degrees.  It's interesting that my other eye also has similar downward double-vision (with a smaller 10 degree rightward shift).  (I get even more cataract glare details when I focus on the small dot to the left, instead of the ring, but I'm trying to keep this question simple.)  Do most people have downward double-vision in both eyes like me?  If so, is there any theory about why/how the eye changes asymmetrically as we age? I guess that the exact statistical study I'm suggesting here has never been done, but hope cataracts have been studied enough to answer theoretically.   "
759,Can a healed fracture impact the structure of the sinus?,"Could a healed fracture, years old, cause ridges/distress in the sinus? Enough for bacteria or fungus to cling to and cause a sinus infection?  I researched some pictures of how the inside of the sinus looks and it seems to be mostly soft tissue. To me this makes it look like a healed fracture, even if it wasn't healed that neatly, couldn't cause any rigs or bumps that bacteria could house in easily, because the tissue would have grown over it by now.  So my question is: Can a healed fracture impact the structure of the inside of the sinus? Or will the soft tissue do it's job? "
760,Can a healthy baby / new born be carried longer when the weather is hot if carried skin to skin against its father's chest?,"First of all I'm not a medical specialist at all, but still I hope my question is precise enough to be answered.   One day I asked a General Practitioner if a father could go outside with his baby / new born while the weather was hot (let's say around 30-35Â°C), carrying it skin to skin against the father's chest in a carrying scarf. The GP's answer was ""obviously the father shouldn't"". Unfortunately the GP could not explain me why the father should not.  Disclaimer : This question intent is only theoretical, I don't plan nor recommend to go outside with a new born when it's hot, since I know it could be dangerous for the baby.  So I wanted to know if in a carrying scarf (skin to skin against the father's chest) the adult's body could help the baby's one to regulate its temperature, throwing away the exceeding heating from the baby. Or put another way can the adult's body act as a heat exchanger to keep the baby's internal temperature around the adult's body temperature (~ 37Â°C) ? Or would it be worse and would the baby's internal temperature increases up to risky values ?  Thanks in advance to whoever that can shed me some lights! "
761,What would happen if you administered endothelin during a myocardial infarction?,"I have been going through the Rhodes medical physiology and have learned about Endothelin (specifically its role in hyperplasia) and collateral vessels in slowly developed [cardiovascular disease] (CVD). This makes me wonder the following things:   Why can we not avoid the scar tissue formation that plagues myocardial infarction (MI) survivors by administering Endothelin in a selective manner so as to make it only hit the type A receptors ? How plastic are heart cells?   FYI: I have no idea how the heart controls its plasticity and cell growth, but given that cancers in the heart are so rare surely the administration of endothelin would be well regulated "
762,Relationship between Helicobacter pylori and stomach acid,"Omeprazole (or other proton pump inhibitors) is often used to treat patients diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori. I heard of people treated this way and there's a study which suggests doing so. The drug reduces gastric acid secretion.   On the other hand, I found tons of non-scientific articles, e.g. here, suggesting that the bacteria thrives when the stomach acid level is low. If this is the case, why is it treated with antacids?   I found lot of scientific papers on the subject, but I find them incomprehensible. Could someone explain in plain English? "
763,Does the body adapt to recurring blunt force trauma?,"If skin is constantly scraped or rubbed, callouses form and the body better deals with future scrapes and rubs.  Is there any process in which we adapt to being hit by blunt objects?  When I am hit hard by something blunt I will bruise, is there any process in which we get better at dealing with this? "
764,Should I still worry about my Omega-3 to Omega 6 ratio when I consume other anti-inflammatory foods with my meals?,"I hear that we must maintain a healthy ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fats of at most 1:4 to avoid excessive inflammation in the body. However, Omega-3 fats are so hard to find in significant quantities in regular foods, and the few Omega-3 rich foods that do exist are pretty pricey.  So, I was thinking. Does the ratio still really matter that much when you're consuming other kinds of anti-inflammatory foods like cinnamon with your meals?  Wouldn't cinnamon, for example, serve the same purpose as Omega-3 fats as far as anti-inflammation goes that would allow me not to worry too much about the ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fats? "

769,"Why is nutritionally complete food always powdered, and are there non powdered versions?","There have been a large number of startups that offer nutritionally complete food, like Soylent and Huel. All of them, as far as I know, offer it mainly in powdered form. You have to mix it with water, and shake it, giving you a 'nutrient drink'.  However, all this mixing is very annoying to me.   Why do they offer powdered versions only, instead of the kind of bars that astronauts eat?  Huel offers this bar version, but its small, and only intended as a side snack.   Are there any other companies that offer nutrtionally complete food in hard-form rather than powdered-form, that can be used as a primary meal replacement? "

The headaches started to occur after after I moved into a new build house. Our last house was colder and humid.   The new house is warmer and less humid.   Is it possible that warmer and dry air cause dehydration overnight? Can that cause morning headaches and fatigue during the day? 
775,What is proper time for drinking water with meal?,I've gone through many articles on Google.  One says it's good to drink water after meal as it aids digestion while others say never drink water after a meal because it will dilute the acids (i.e. HCl).  I am a teenager and want to gain weight. Is it beneficial to drink water immediately after a meal (as I usually do)?   What is actually going on there? 
776,"Are retainers preferred to fiberotomies after dental work and, if so, why?","Long ago, after years of wearing braces and expanders to correct some pretty severe problems, when they came off I received what I now know is called a fiberotomy on my top teeth only. I was also instructed to wear top and bottom retainers.  I was... less than loyal to my retainers.  After a period of time, my bottom teeth reverted partway back to their original positions -- today, they aren't even close to straight.  My top teeth, however, remain perfectly straight to this day, almost 20 years later.  However, I've noticed that every single person I have ever spoken to who had dental work done has never heard of this procedure. It strikes me as odd because the procedure was quick, simple, and apparently with excellent outcome.  My questions are:   The lack of awareness of this procedure leads me to believe that it is not that common. If this is true, why is it so? Are there risks? Is the success rate not high? The procedure seemed to entirely negate the need for a retainer, for me at least. Is this typical? If so, why would retainers ever be recommended over a fiberotomy? Are there only certain cases where the procedure is effective? Is there any reason, related to the questions above, why the procedure wasn't done on my bottom teeth?   Or is there perhaps some more modern alternative to both fiberotomies and retainers that has appeared in the last 20 years? "

Do I need to worry about not getting enough iodine? Is it healthy to only get the sodium you need from food, provided you eat a healthy Westerner diet?  "
779,Why are people with certain blood types more/less susceptible to norovirus?,"Infection with some types of norovirus appear to be rarer in people with some blood types than in others, see Norwalk Virus Infection and Disease Is Associated with ABO Histo-Blood Group Type, from the Journal of Infectious Diseases.      Results reported here suggest that individuals with an O phenotype have an increased susceptibility to NV infection and that those expressing the type B antigen are more resistant to NV infection and symptomatic disease   That study is from 2002 and has a few possible mechanisms for it in the Discussion section - however, there is a lot of ""may"" and ""we suspect"" and basically, that  further research is needed.   Has there been any further research on this? Is there any lead as to what the mechanism behind this susceptibility of type O / immunity of blood type B is?  "
780,about one-piece dental implant,"I read on some articles saying that two-piece (kind of nut-and-bolt system) dental implants might have gap as time goes, because a man chews foods everyday.  Some bad bacteria (anaerobic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis) may live in the gap, as I read from a dentist's article.  However, most famous dental implants are still two-piece system, although I found that many small manufacturers produce one-piece system.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of one-piece system? Are there any guidelines for helping patients decide between one-piece and two-piece implants? "

782,Long term vaccine studies of subjective characteristics,"I'm looking to vaccinate my son with Hexacima in less than two months. I've been going through studies looking at the long term efficacy and/or adverse effects for EU infant vaccines (Hexacima and Infanrix Hexa in particular) and, as expected, the number of adverse effects reported is quite low. What I haven't been able to find, however, are long term studies looking at more subjective attributes like intelligence, attention, personality, etc. How are these more subjective attributes studied? Where can I find these studies? "
783,Is it better to sleep without a pillow?,"I have read several web pages that mention the potential benefits of sleeping without a pillow.   Examples:  [website]  Is Sleeping Without a Pillow a Good Choice? Yes, it is. Not only will sleeping with no pillow save your money, but it will also lead to less neck, back, and shoulder pain, higher quality sleep, and even fewer wrinkles! When you were a child, you could fall asleep anywhere without a pillow. The body is resilient and adaptable when we're young. Even as we age, our body, including heads and necks, is able to rest comfortably without the support of a pillow.   [website]  While sleeping with or without a pillow is a personal preference, there are some medical experts that believe there are real benefits of sleeping without a pillow.         Spinal benefits: Some argue that sleeping without a pillow is the healthiest method of sleeping as it greatly benefits the spine.  Sleeping on your back without a pillow allows the spine to rest fully with the natural curves of the body.  When you sleep with a thick pillow it can displace the spine.   Facial benefits: Others argue that sleeping without pillows can help reduce wrinkles and other often considered unappealing facial features.  This can be attributed to the fact that the face is not being squished against a pillow.   Sleep benefits:  Some argue that pillows interfere with quality sleep, especially when people use the wrong pillow.  Sleeping without a pillow helps ensure quality sleep because the body is allowed to be at a normal level and not elevated like with a pillow.   Neck benefits: The people that believe sleeping without a pillow is best for you, argue that sleeping with a pillow can be the main source of shoulder and neck pain.  It is still good to do stretches and use heat packs, but they say that the best way to alleviate neck pain is to sleep without a pillow.      Is there any scientific study confirming or infirming the claim? "
784,50:50-sugar-fat mixture and weight gain. New research?,"A couple of years ago I saw a BBC Horizon television documentary about sugar and fat. One section mentioned three experiments performed by Dr Paul Kenny in which rats were given their ordinary rat food plus and unlimited supply of:  Experiment A. Unlimited sugar  Experiment B. Unlimited fat  Experiment C. Unlimited sugar and fat mixed together (50:50)  The stated results were that in experiment A the rats did not put on any weight, in experiment B the rats put on weight but not much and in experiment C they put on loads of weight and would eat the 50:50 mixture to the exclusion of their ordinary food. I also remember the documentary said the 50:50 ratio was critical and if the ratio was shifted too far in either direction then the weight gain effect reduced sharply. It was postulated that the reason for the satiety error was that sugar and fat don't often occur together in nature so the rats (and maybe people too) haven't evolved the biochemical feedback mechanisms for determining when they are satiated from such a mixture.  Edit: (Dr Kenny's work seems to be related to this earlier paper)  My question is this: have there been any follow-up experiments from this work? Either with humans, or perhaps with other unnatural mixtures like sugar/salt? or a triple-mix of sugar/fat/salt. "
785,Which type of chair is best to avoid back pain?,"I'm aware that such chairs are called ergonomic chairs. But what things does one have to consider while buying these chairs? Height, arm rest, back rest, etc?  I'll be thankful if you could post some images for the explanation. Also what should be the height of table to keep your laptop and operate it?   Images would be very helpful. "
786,What blood tests are worth doing for a healthy 30-year-old male?,"The patient is a 30-year-old male who seems healthy. The patient has to do a blood test for some administrative forms (namely, proof of immunity to rubella and varicella), and wonder what else could be worthwhile to test.  What blood tests are worth doing for a healthy 30-year old male?  A comment deleted by a moderator suggested â""Glucose, HbA1c, HDL and LDL cholesterol, TSH, T4, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium"".  The patient has no concern in particular, and cost is not an issue. "
787,Craving sunlight with melatonin?,"I have noticed a very strange, but positive, side effect of taking melatonin supplements or cherries high in melatonin (I have blood tests which confirmed food allergies, and apparently my absorption of melatonin is blocked, in part for this reason).  When I am deficient, I don't like to open the blinds, but I actually consistently actually crave sunlight in the morning when I have sufficient melatonin (and I feel less anxiety (unless taken in too high of an amount, in which case I feel depressed), I better experience and remember dreams, and I am actually able to engage in prayer, which is something that has been hard for me to muster the energy for while deficient, despite having enjoyed the activity previously).  Are these effects, in particular sunlight craving, recognized phenomena? Is anyone familiar with a mechanism by which melatonin would do this?  Does melatonin directly cause the craving of sunlight, or does its deficiency turn off the craving to prompt us to find darkness so as to allow our bodies to regenerate it by whatever other process does the generation? "
788,When is angiography needed in stable angina patients?,"Under which conditions is angiography needed in patients who have 'stable angina')? In other words, what are the 'indications' of angiography in such patients? The angiography is done with a view to perform revascularization with angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). "
789,Do protein bars/shakes provide nutrients that your body can use?,"To my understanding, a lot of people consider protein bars/shakes unhealthy. They are processed, often sugary, and contain chemicals that are probably used to create gym mats.  I eat protein bars regularly. The ones I typically eat are called Pure Protein or Balance bars. They are relatively low on sugar and calories in general (obviously there are artificial sweeteners used), provide around 20 grams of protein, and provide many other vitamins that are probably missing from my overall diet.  My question is not really whether or not processed foods are healthy to eat (Natural > Processed > not eating), but rather if the human body utilizes the protein and vitamins contained in them. Will 20 grams of protein from a protein bar have the same effect as 20 grams of protein from organic grilled chicken? Are the vitamins they contain (which I assume are similar to taking a multivitamin) effect the body in the same way as if I ate nothing but organic fruits and vegetables?  I have attempted to look this information up myself, but find that the answer is often pretty biased. A quick search shows me numerous articles that use vague statements like ""studies have shown"", or refer to links to other organic food/herbal remedy sites.  What I am looking for is some sort of concrete, scientific proof that protein/vitamin supplements are either less effective than natural foods, or are flat out unhealthy for you. "
790,What disorder would cause sweating to appear only on one half of the face?,"Or a more detailed question, what would cause a vertical divide (through the center of the nose) of the face, where one half has normal sweat gland function and another does not? There are no motor or sensory deficiencies otherwise.  When excercising, only the half with normal functions blushes, which would lead me to think it's an innervation or vascular problem. What controls blood circulation and sweat in the specified area (which part of the brain or which nerves carry the commands)? "
791,Long term management of AC joint injury,"What is the best way to deal with AC joint injury (Grade III) in the longer run, if the surgeon suggests that surgery is not a worthwhile option for the degree of injury I have? I regularly feel mild pain in the shoulder around the scapula even after several months of the injury. Is this normal? Is there anything I can do to manage this pain well?  I have experienced that stretching elastic bands and lifting small weights do provide some relief for a short duration when done after several days. Also, ice packs do help in subsiding the pain. I could not find much literature on pain management related to AC joint injury. "
792,Decisions about anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: how to factor in thrombocytopenia?,"The benefit of anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation has been well established. However, the benefit is always to be weighed against the risk, in this case, primarily bleeding. Among the many potential reasons not to anticoagulate, other factors that predispose to bleeding are often brought up. My question is about one such condition &mdash; thrombocytopenia (low platelets).   In a patient with atrial fibrillation who otherwise meets criteria for anticoagulation,1 what level of thrombocytopenia2 is considered a relative contraindication to anticoagulation?      1. Of course, not all ""meets criteria"" are the same. For the sake of the question, let't discuss the sort of ""middle risk"" group (nonvalvular afib, CHA2DS2-VASc = 2-3). Let us also assume no prior bleeding history.       2. Using whatever units you would like, but as far as I know normal people talk about count per mm3 = mL, with a normal range 150k-400k.   "
793,"How accurate is the saying that fat loss occurs first in the place it was put on last, and vice versa?","I've heard that you lose fat in the areas it was last gained. Similarly, the last place you'll lose it is the area you first put on the weight. What is the reason behind this mechanism? Is it a myth? "
794,Sex as a generic medical treatment modality?,"Sex therapy (including clinical, licensed sex itself) is a treatment option for sexual health issues - when there are problems and goals pertaining to sex itself.  Sexual health tends to be studied from the angle of being on the 'receiving' end of health, merely being 'improved' as a benefit of good health, or hampered as a result of bad health.  But I wonder whether there have been examples of, any research on, or plausible basis for, sex (whether just orgasm as the common denominator, specific sexual techniques similar to Tantra, and whether solo or with a partner) being a 'medical treatment' mechanism for anything non-sexual in nature also.  In other words, considering the opposite - sex helping to not only improve health itself - but actually be a legitimate and studied field of (alternative) medical treatment for a whole range of scenarios whose goals have nothing to do with sex.  I have no collated research to offer up-front in the question, but only one particular angle of inquiry of my own, which is that sexual activity is part of the parasympathetic nervous system and that, given the involuntary and powerful nature of sexual function, perhaps it might assist in nervous system balance/repair/damage/even issues with PTSD/fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system issues (e.g. maybe it is the strongest way to activate and train the parasympathetic system where a patient has issues relating to it), if studied.  There are many studies that show sex (and especially intimate sexual activity with a partner) has many direct health benefits, proven mechanisms to relieve mental stress and certainly regulate hormones of the endocrine system which then has further beneficial domino effects itself.  But is there basis to suspect it could do more? (Similar to well-understood exercise and body movement therapies having massive positive and thus often healing effects on the body?) Has this been studied at all?  Obviously in our current society the principal reason for a lack of such study would be the cultural and 'moral' taboos associated with this idea - sex always being an end, but hardly ever a means. "
795,Effects of commuting on health,"I've been trying to figure out whether or not my commute may be affecting my health in a major way. Does commuting have an effect on health in any way? If so, does it matter how long the commute is, what kind of transportation (bus, train, or car), or the time of day when commuting?  I tried googling this but while I found several news articles, I haven't found links to studies and solid research. "
796,Thiamin quantity in Kiwi - which source to believe?,"I would like to know what is the Thiamin quantity in Kiwi.  There are two websites:  [website]which says that there is 0.027mg Thiamin in 100g of Kiwi  [website]which says there is 0.006mg of Thiamin in 100g Kiwi  So, one website claims the quantity is 4.5 times more than the other.  Which information is more reliable and why?  Is there any obvious reason that I am missing why there is such huge difference? I think the product name and quantity and units agree in both websites, so..? "
797,Do we have a general system of class of drugs that a layman can understand?,"When I was reading the accepted answer in the Why do doctors prescribe steroid tablets even though they know the side effects? question, I noticed this phrase located in the second paragraph:     ...if there is a single class of drugs...   I wonder what class of drugs we have. So I started researching and got to the Drug Classes page on Drugs.com. But I don't understand a word. And even if I can understand them, there are so many classes that I cannot remember them all. Do we have another class system that is more general and less number of classes? If there is not, which classes should I know as a layman?  Clarification: while I know nothing about medical, in my high school I used to study natural sciences very well, which include biology and chemistry. "
798,Olive oil versus sunflower oil,"I wondered what was the best for the health.  In general but also, I noticed that my sunflower oil indicates on its bottle that it shouldn't be cooked over 175 CÂ°, what happens if we do (by mistake for instance)?  Bonus question: I picked those two oils because this is the only ones I really know about, is there other good alternatives?  Related question: Olive oil versus sunflower oil (on sustainability.stackexchange.com) "
799,Is hydrogen peroxide therapy (drinking it) safe?,"I've found some sites which claim that drinking hydrogen peroxide is ""very"" healthy for detoxification of the body. But these sites lack credible references.  As far as I remember from secondary school, oxygen is very reactive and can cause lungs cancer. I was searching for publications about ""hydrogen peroxide therapy"", but I haven't found anything. I also searched here on NCBI &mdash; Is that a reliable place for searching such topics?  Is it safe to drink hydrogen peroxide according as these sites claim? Are there any more-credible publications about it? "
800,"In childbirth, can one twin's arm stick out of the womb and then the other child is born first?","There is a story of a birth of twins from Genesis 38:27-30 with some details that raise some medical questions. Among them:  It is implied that before birth, they knew the mother had twins. The first thing to come out of the womb was one baby's arm (upon which the first thing the midwife does is tie a crimson thread to it). The arm goes back into the womb. The other baby is birthed, followed by the one with the thread.  Without using modern medical technology, are any of those things medically impossible or are they just uncommon? "
801,Attempting to move with nerve block? Harmful?,"Today I had surgery on my shoulder to repair my torn labrum. After the surgery, I had the option of receiving a nerve block, which I took.  I have been periodically attempting to move my fingers despite the nerve block not having worn off yet. Sometimes I try to move my fingers with fair determination (trying pretty hard) and I feel mild to moderate tingling (corresponds to how hard I try) in my wrist and hand which dissipates quickly.  Is trying frequently or with decent effort harmful? Can it damage anything? Am I free to keep trying or should I wait until the block is worn off? "
802,How long does it take for the simple sugars in a drink to reach the bloodstream?,We are talking about 24g of sugar in Kool Aid Jammers. Does the sugar enter the stream nearly instantaneously or does it take a while? 10 minutes? 30? 
803,Does BMR adjust and decrease in response to calorie restriction diets?,"Is it possible for your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) to adjust in response to dieting for long periods of time? If this does happen how much can it go down? I have heard that BMR ranges from 1000 - 2500 calories. Assume that multivitamins and other nutritional supplements (calcium, magnesium, minerals) are taken. "
804,Can the body be shocked into a faster metabolism?,"It seems to be a relatively well-known fact that sudden extended periods of caloric restriction will cause a severe drop in metabolism. But I can't seem to find much research about the reverse process. So the question is, does it work the other way too?  The basic scenario I'm asking about is if one were to go from a lifestyle of plenty of exercise, and a high-calorie diet to compensate (if you need more detail, say the diet consists of plenty of proteins, decent fats, relatively-low carbs, so quite healthy) to a lifestyle of no exercise, half the calories, much more carbs, much less protein. Current evidence seems to indicate this would cause a significant drop in metabolism.  So what about the inverse scenario? Say after six months, our subject adds back the exercise, and doubles calorie consumption by switching back to a diet of plenty of proteins, decent fats, and relatively-low carbs. Say this change takes place over a single week, and remains afterward.  Would this sudden change result in a rapid increase in metabolism, similar in magnitude to the rapid decrease caused by the inverse, and would it last? Is the body more conservative with increases in metabolism than with decreases? What would be the effects on the body?  Disclaimer: I realize ""metabolism"" is non-technical shorthand for the convergence of thousands of chemical processes used by the body to essentially process energy, and that the changes above would result in complex chains of changes that can't be exactly predicted. I'm not trying to calculate exactly what would happen, just get a general sense of how this process reacts to changes. "
805,Are consumable goods from stores safety tested?,I am aware that to sell food items supermarkets and such require licences and must pass health inspections. But what about the products themselves?   I read this which mentions some low risk products can be sold before being tested. Does this imply all other foods require a lab test and government approval prior to sale? I believe the FDA is the department that keeps dodgy stuff out of US markets. 
806,Stray cat scratch - tetanus?,"My mother was scratched by a stray cat that lives in our apartment basement two days ago (when she was going out for a walk). Long story short, after about thirty minutes of walking, she noticed the scratch and that's when we cleaned it with running water and applied betadine.   We went to the doctor (emergency hospital) exactly 24 hours after the incident. The doctor suggested us to get 4 shots:   Tetanus, Tetanus Immune Glubin, Rabies, Rabies Immune Glubin.  But we opted to take just the first one, Tetanus. (For many reasons. It's gonna be super long if I had to explain everything)  It's been two days after the incident, and we are applying Bactron to the wound. Every time I apply the ointment, she says it stings.   Anyways, my question is - will she be okay? Is the wound tetanus or not? Was it right to just take the Tetanus shot?   Oh and additional info - she said the wound did not bleed.   Here are some images of the wound     "
807,What factors affect exercise induced nausea?,"I know a few people who would vomit after or during training (various running exercises). My trainer said it was due to the lactate level in the blood, though I can't find a source to corroborate this.  According to the reference from Wikipedia's entry on exercise-induced nausea the duration of exercise and intensity (aerobic vs anaerobic) and prior food or drink consumption are the main factors contributing to this effect. I gather it is not a very common phenomenon. It seems like a basic reflex to get rid of food so the muscles and/or brain can get more blood.  So is a high lactate level and a non-empty stomach all there is to this? If so I think it would be more common. I'm guessing there is a psychological element too? Can anyone explain the triggers/causes better?  Edit:  Consider the following scenario: a group of 30 people of a similar age perform intensive exercise. 2 people feel really nauseous afterwards. Assuming that hydration is not a cause, what mechanism(s) explain(s) why these people feel sicker?  I think assuming that only pH is a factor is flawed. The wikipedia article I mentioned explicitly states that food intake affects nausea. I can also corroborate this with experiences of many of the people (friends/family) I asked. The article also states that nausea is a consequence of bloodflow to the stomach/gut being restricted (implying the pH recepter does not directly induce nausea). So I'm guessing this flow restriction follows from the pH mechanism in the brain?   By piecing together this info I then get this order of events:  1 - Exercise reduces pH  2 - Brain pH receptor reduces blood flow to stomach  3 - Stomach receptors trigger nausea when blood flow is low (stronger signal if stomach is fuller)  This theory seems to cover both claims of pH (in the answer below) and food intake (in the wiki article). But it is just conjecture on my part.  I could imagine a 4th step where a person has less nausea if they produce more endorfins during exercise, or more when they have a psycological tendency to throw up whenever nauseous.  Or maybe I'm wrong about pH affecting blood flow to the stomach.  So, barring hydration-related causes, is it just blood pH and stomach contents that determine the nausea felt after some forms of exercise? And if pH is a factor (as stated by an answer), how much does sensitivity depend on 1)their fitness/condition to counter the pH decrease and 2)  their physical response to a low pH--e.g. maybe a genetic factor makes some people more sensitive? "
808,Is drinking water during or after a meal better?,"Is it better to drink water during or after a meal?  Clearly, there are different opinions about this topic.   In this Mayo Clinic article, it is mentioned that drinking water immediately after or during a meal should not make much difference, and in fact doing so actually aids digestion in general.  On the other side, this link says exactly the opposite:     Remember not to drink too soon before or after a meal as the water will dilute the digestive juices.  Drink water an hour after the meal to allow the body to absorb the nutrients.   Which approach is better for health? "
809,Sleeping on stomach - why are people naturally drawn to it if it's bad?,"Why are some adults and children naturally drawn to sleeping on their stomachs if it's not a good sleep position (according to many articles)?  I understand it's not good for babies because of the increased SIDS risk, but I think I also recall hearing or reading that it would cause them to sleep deeper than on their back which, aside from SIDS risk, sounds like it has potential to be beneficial for people?  EDIT: Here are some example articles which speak negatively about stomach sleeping.   [website][website][website]"
810,Do vitamins affect sense of taste?,"I like oranges. I really like oranges. But I go through cycles of eating them. When I start, they are really sweet. By my fifth of the day they have turned quite bitter.  Sensing a pattern I have performed an experiment.  The theory is that the more vitamin C I eat, the less I want foods that contain vitamin C. So, I stopped eating oranges for a month. I had one orange and it was really sweet - which validates the inverse of my theory (the less vitamin C I eat the more I want foods that contain it).  I then started taking vitamin C tablets for a week and had an orange, and it was bitter. To make sure it wasn't just a bitter orange I asked a friend to share it with me (without explaining why I wanted to share the orange with him). He said it was very sweet and enjoyed it loads.  I have been unable to locate studies or anecdotes regarding this sort of thing.  So, my question:  Do our bodies alter our taste buds based on what we eat in order to maintain a stable balance of nutrients, vitamins, etc? (by encouraging/discouraging us to eat food x because we need/don't need the nutrients/vitamins/etc)?  I have previously noticed a similar alteration in sense of taste for spinach for a little while. I assume I needed the iron?   From an evolutionary point of view this makes sense - as a way of encouraging us to eat what we need to stay healthy. "
811,Can food poisoning be detected in the blood after recovery?,"I've been ill for the past week with food poisoning, buthave had no time to go to the docto,. as my registered GP is in my home city and I am at university.  I've recovered now, but I was wondering if I were to go to the GP now, is there any way that they could tell of I was sick these last couple of days? Could this be done through a blood test or something similar? Ideally, I want proof that I have been ill this last week to claim mitigating circumstances for one of my exams, as I came down with the case of food poisoning two days before it. Will there be any trace of the bug left in my body?  "
812,Strapping a reduced hernia,"On the embarrassing bodies TV show I have noticed that hernias seem to be very simple to fix if deal with early on.  Would it be safe to reduce it by gently easing it back in behind the mussel, then strapping it until the muscle is strong enough to keep it held in? Avoiding surgery all together? "
813,Is it possible to maintain my health during irregular sleeping patterns?,"I'm 23 years old lanky guy, and my health is below average. I believe it's also wise to mention that I currently have Tuberculosis in my lymph nodes around the neck area, for which I'm taking my medications. My past health issues were typhoid and recently pneumonia (February 2014).    With that being said, I'm currently working two jobs out of necessity. First starting from 1pm till 10pm, and another starting from 11pm till 5am. So my routine is work from 1pm till 5am, and reach home by 6am and sleep till 12 noon, get ready and the cycle continues. This happens 5 days a week, and I get a full two days of rest.    Now I've recently thought about taking a leave on my night job (11pm - 5am) every Wednesday, such that I'll get to have a good rest in the interval of 2 days (I hope you understand the pattern). By first thoughts, this feels like a good enough decision.    But my concern is that I may worsen my health even more. I think I read somewhere that random changes on one's routine can confuse the body which will lead to serious health issues, and since this new routine is pretty random, I fear that I may fall sick all of a sudden, something that I cannot afford financially and health-wise too.    So should I go ahead and follow this new routine? I know there aren't many options that I can choose from, but is there better routine that could follow? "
814,How risky is it to try a dog shock collar (e-collar) on yourself?,"OK, so this might sound highly masochistic but that's not for my personal enjoyment.  As a dog trainer I strongly advocate against the use of shock/electric/remote collar and I arrived at the idea that a video showing such a collar on a human would make a strong point. Indeed many people using these are saying that it is not that bad for the dog, which I really don't believe to be true.  So are there actual risk (electrocution, burns, etc.) on demonstrating that on myself?  I certainly wouldn't start on my neck, maybe on my leg? "
815,Reversing sleep cycle,I have been a nocturnal for some period of time and thus altering the sleep cycle seems difficult i.e. moving back to the normal 10 to 5 sleep cycle.   What can be done to revert back to the normal sleep cycle? Should I need to skip a day of sleep or you recommend any health hack? 
816,Is targeted antimicrobial peptide mouthwash currently available anywhere (including experimentally)?,For reference: [website]Antimicrobial peptides as mouthwash were first invented in 2011 at UCLA according to this article. There was a brief burst of news/media attention around them in 2015 and then nothing. What happened to them? Are these mouthwashes available anywhere (including outside the U.S. or in experiments/clinical trials) and where can I get them?  Several searches for where to buy them turned up nothing.  Extra credit question: could this approach be used as a substitute for antibiotics in certain applications or deployed against bacteria that are dangerously resistant to regular antibiotics? 
817,Do infected family members need to be treated with antibiotics at the same time?,"When antibiotics become necessary I assume that the body can not kill the bacteria on its own and there are no useful anti bodies being built.  So in a case where the child is treated with antibiotics and the parents are sick too, isn't it necessary to treat the parents with antibiotics exactly at the same time?  Since the body can't cope with the illness without help, it won't develop immunity and could get infected by the same thing at any time after treatment.  So if only the child is treated, but not the parents chances are the parents are going to infect the child again after antibiotics treatment.  So the whole family needs to be treated exactly at the same time? "

819,Which essential nutrient is the first that will cause debilitating illness if supply is insufficient,"While reading about the US requirements for food labeling (How to Understand and Use the Nutrition Facts Label) about essential nutrients it became obvious that that label is far from complete.  Currently it is just required to list a small subset of vitamins, minerals etc., for example: Water, Energy, Protein, Fat, Cholesterol, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Sugars, Minerals, Calcium, Iron, Vitamin C, Vitamin Aâ¦   This is clearly a very rough, an incomplete list and compiled for almost entirely different reasons, I can only guess at. One guess would be trying to help to prevent, in the name of public health, those types of malnutrition that are most commonly seen over all in Americans, not those that would have the fastest onset.  Asking the world's favourite search engine for example ""first micro-nutrient to cause deficiency"" yields mainly  results applicable for plant growth, where people seem to have pondered this question more frequently in the past compared to human nutrition. Similiar search terms were equally unsatisfactory.  So I keep wondering, phrased  in a very naive way on purpose: what is the most ""important"" essential (the most limiting nutritional factor?) nutrient to be consumed regularly enough to avoid any type of deficiency (serious malnutrition)?  Obviously the essential micro-nutrients  are all important at least in the mid- and long term, hence their name. But which are really needed most frequently almost or really daily?  One isolated example is vitamin C and scurvy caused by a serious lack of vitamin C in a diet. Wikipedia for example claims that:     Typically, scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet. It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before symptoms occur.    That seems quite a long time for relative malnutrition that will not cause concrete and visible or clinically relevant symptoms. But I seem to be unable to find such a list and I am even hampered in compiling a list of essential nutrients and the possible problems when 'time until the symptoms of malnutrition/deficiency  develop' is a central criterion to be involved.   For B12 it seems to take a very long time until symptoms develop, for fat-soluble vitamins it is similarly prolonged interval but my guess is that water soluble vitamins and some minerals would be less suitable to skip on while remaining healthy.  As evidenced by our human past, general energy deficiency causing starvation is not really part of this inquiry, since it presents a larger problem in itself. So it is not about water, energy, fats, protein or carbohydrates.  That situation in question would entail: all micro-nutrients (and macro) kept at recommended levels or above, only one single of the essential micro-nutrients deprived. Which micro-nutrient deprivation causes the first signs of malnutrition the fastest. This would be applicable for an otherwise and previously healthy and well fed adult, not necessarily for children.

821,How long do you have to take an SSRI for before PSSD becomes a risk?,"PSSD or Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction really worries me. This is when you carry on experiencing the sexual side effects of an SSRI for years after stopping taking the medication.  If you take a single pill and then stop, you may feel a few side effects including sexual dysfunction, but I find it very unlikely that you will carry on experiencing this side effect for years to come, from one pill. I think the same applies if you take an SSRI daily for 3 weeks. You will likely experience the side effects for the 3 weeks, and then maybe for a couple of weeks afterwards, but I do not think that 3 weeks of medication is significant enough to leave you with sexual side effects for years or forever. The brain is very plastic and can heal remarkably well.  But then you here stories about people who have taken SSRI's for months and then stopped, but then carried on experiencing sexual dysfunction for years or permanently.  So where's the line? How long do you have to take them for before PSSD becomes a risk? "

824,Should a chiropractor be called if my neck is (moderately) out of alignment?,"Let's not beat around the bush:  ~3 days ago, I was jumping on a trampoline. Being that I was jumping on a very good trampoline with a gymnast and a cousin or two of hers, I started endeavoring to do flips.  After trying to successfully land a front flip 1-2 dozen times (I only succeeded once -- Hey, it was raining. :D), I decided to try to do a back flip.  That, dear reader, is the crux of the problem. Inspired by my (almost) successes in the past, I jumped up, flipped 180 degrees, and landed on my head.  Naturally it didn't feel too good, so I climbed out of the trampoline and took a break. I didn't really figure it would turn out all that bad. I kept turning it from side to side to keep it loosened up, but the next day it was worse than it was when I first landed on it.  The day after my accident, you could feel where a vertebrate in my neck was out of alignment. Over the past couple of days, I've been treating my neck gingerly. (Partly due to that, perhaps, my shoulders are feeling sore as well.)    So:  What's the correct thing to do in this circumstance (or a situation like it)? The way I see it, I have at least 3 choices.  First of all, I could ignore it. Arguments in favor of ignoring it would probably follow the lines of:   People hurt their necks all the time. Don't get so worked up over it. If you were a real man, you wouldn't let a little bit of pain bother you. Just deal with it, dude! You're not crippled, yet, are you? (Said sarcastically.)   Arguments opposed to ignoring it would probably sound something like this:   You only have one neck, Bro, take care of it! It certainly won't hurt to have someone take a look at it. As Benjamin Franklin said, ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" A true disciple of wisdom would point out that to truly prevent an accident, I should've stayed off the trampoline! Since your neck hurts when you're checking your blindspot while driving, it's probably a good idea for you to get your neck checked out for your my safety.   My second choice is to have a friend fix(?) it for me. I don't really favor this idea for the following reasons:   I only have one neck. I might as well take care of it. (You might remember this point from the points against ignoring the problem.) If one of my friends mis-adjusts my neck, I'll really have to go to a medical professional. I don't trust my friends with my health ... :D   My friends, of course, would point out the following:   We know what we're doing. We'll save you money, etc. Since I don't like parting with $$ (you don't either!), this point would have some weight if not for the second point against my friends adjusting my neck.   Lastly, I could just go to a chiropractor. I was originally leaning very heavily to this option, but then I started reading about the risks of going to a chiropractor (especially with regards to neck manipulation!). The arguements for going to a chiropractor look something like this:   Jeffrey, you should go to a trained professional. Better to get your neck adjusted now, than suffer the consequences later. Your neck obviously isn't right. You should go to the chiropractor to get it adjusted properly. Won't it be great to be able to twist your head normally again? Your cousin went to the chiropractor when he injured his neck playing football. (His symptoms involved the fact that he was keeping his neck in a rigid position.) After three trips to the chiropractor, his neck recovered and he no longer has troubles with it.   The arguments against going to the chiropractor go something like this:   Your father knows someone who was ruined for life by going to the chiropractor. Your body will heal fine on its own. (See the points for ignoring it.) Adjustments to the neck are dangerous. (Anyone eager to get a stroke?)   And the question is ...  In this case, what is the best course of action to take in regards to my neck? Should I ignore it, take a chance by letting a friend adjust it, or immediately go to a chiropractor? Should neck injuries, such as this, be taken seriously or should it be taken as a light matter? Can anyone shed some light on what they believe to be the best path to take?     Other:  PS: I'm not using this site as the final health authority!  PPS: I can get my neck within about 1-2 inches of my chest before it starts to hurt. I cannot comfortably twist my head around to either of my shoulders. "

826,"How to clean out all the earwax buildup in ears from hearing-aids if hearing-impaired? Q-tips are unsafe, right?","I was born with congenital bone fusions in several places in my body, one of those places are in the set of three small bones (malleus, incus, and stapes) in both my ears. Because they are fused, they don't vibrate. I've had several ear surgeries, which have unfortunately only caused nerve-damage and scar-tissue so I'm hearing-impaired. Bottom-line: I've been wearing hearing-aids my entire life.   Growing up, I would always use a Q-tip to clean out the earwax buildup in my ears (hearing-aids are constantly in my ears so they don't allow my ears to ""breathe"" and trap in a lot of bacteria). However, as research became more available as the years went by, audiologists and doctors alike have told me that Q-tips are not the best way to clean out your ears. In fact, they have the potential to cause further damage to your ears because you may just be jamming the earwax further down your ear canal, which can lead to infections/inflammations/loss of hearing, etc.   So the alternative method to cleaning out my ears with a Q-tip was to blow-dry them when I got out of the shower. I did this for a few years until the audiologists said that even though the blow-dryer doesn't sound too loud to me, I could be causing a lot of damage to my ear drums.   I don't recall what the alternative cleaning method has since been. How do I clean out my ears on a regular/daily basis? Yes, I am fully aware that a doctor can flush out the earwax, but I don't have the time nor the money to constantly be seeing the doctor since I have earwax everyday due to my hearing aids. I have a lot.   What is the safest, most effective, yet realistic/practical method? "

Even the ones from widely known manufacturer Thinsulate (âââââ4.6/5 stars).

830,"How to request copies of CT-Scans, MRI, X-rays & ultrasound/endoscopic imagery from Dr.'s/Surgeons for personal records? Possible?","Because of the many congenital-bone-fusions (due to Klippel-Feil-Syndrome) throughout my life, doctors have performed many, many medical-imaging tests (CT-Scans, MRIs, X-Rays, Ultrasounds, Endoscopies, etc.), which have led to numerous (15) surgeries.   As an Archaeologist, I have lived all over the USA, Canada, UK, and Israel. So my medical-imagery is scattered all over the globe.

837,How to decide which painkiller to take?,"This is a dilemma I find myself in every time I'm in need of a painkiller: should I take paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen or aspirin?  I've come across several articles outlining the differences (most notably one by NHS and one by NPS) and, while a good overview, they don't really provide a clear mechanism to make the decision.  Specifically, my understanding so far is:   Aspirin and ibuprofen are NSAIDs and thus can be used to ease inflammation, unlike paracetamol Ibuprofen and paracetamol are similarly effective in treating pain, while aspirin may be less so (however, other sources claim paracetamol to be ineffective for some types of pain) Aspirin should never be taken by those under the age of 16 In terms of adverse effects, ibuprofen may be a better option in comparison to paracetamol (according to this answer at least)   In many cases, different sources provide different, very often contradictory information, especially in terms of effectiveness and side-effects.  To make this question less broad, here are a couple of specific questions (all of these assuming the person in question has no allergies or an existing condition which may limit his options in this sense):   When should you not take a NSAID? It seems the fact they ease inflammation doesn't seem to make them less effective in any way. Which is the most suitable to relieve symptoms of cold and flu? Which is the most suitable to relieve pain caused by physical injury?  "

I know that the deceased's relatives must give consent for an autopsy to be performed (if they do not already know the will of the deceased beforehand), but what are the circumstances in which autopsies are performed?  Obviously, it's when a Jane/John doe's body is found, a murder/suspected murder has taken place, death is caused by an unknown reason, medical malpractice may be the culprit of the death, the body experienced traumatic exposure to the elements, scientific research conducted, a third-party (e.g. medications or faulty devices like parts of a car), may have contributed to the demise, etc. What are others?  My friend and I were discussing and he thought that autopsies were performed on EVERYONE, unless the deceased's loved one's did not give permission, because the death certificate had to state the cause of death. But I think this is wrong; I know it's wrong. Because I know plenty of elderly people who have died in the hospital and did not undergo autopsies. The cause of death could be apparent; an autopsy is not necessarily needed to determine cause of death. In fact, wouldn't autopsies be an exception the rule? Because of the expenses surely tied to it?  How many are actually done?  "

But why exactly doesn't it counteract methotrexate's therapeutic effects? Why doesn't this ""leucovorin rescue"" make tumors grow?   I found this explanation:      because the cancer cells have decreased function of the Reduced folate carrier, LEUCOVORIN can be used to rescue the normal cells following administration of the extremely high doses of methotrexate needed to kill the resistant cancer/bacterial cells.   Basically, folinic acid gets more into healthy cells, which have RFC on them, while it does not get as much into cancerous cells, which have less RFC on them, according to this webpage. Subsequently, cancerous cells die off.   I did not manage to find a corroboration of this explanation in Google Books or in scientific reviews though. Is this explanation correct and up-to-date? If so, I would be grateful for references. If not, I would be interested to know the current state of understanding of this issue.

The genetic data for this branch of lice would give us a date when humans started to get dressed and the data indicates that our ancestral humans lived naked for at least 2Â½ million years.  Clothing was first used at least 83,000 years ago and possibly as early as 170,000 years ago (Reed, et al., 2011) (Horizon: What's The Problem With Nudity, 2008).

Additionally to another question I asked on parasite reduction through being naked, I am asking...     Will going nude improve homeostasis?   Example  Professor Peter Wheeler of Liverpool John Mooreâs University says that the average human can lose heat at a rate in excess of 1 kilowatt, which is the amount of heat put out by a 1 bar electric fire.  If you have body hair, you can still lose heat by sweating, but the rate of heat loss will be reduced because the air flow across the body would be severely reduced which in turn would reduce the rate at which the sweat is going to evaporate.  Sweating into a fur coat would have been no use to our ancestors.

853,Should Ureaplasma Urealyticum be treated if it doesn't cause any symptoms?,"Ureaplasma Urealyticum is a bacterium that can be passed through sexual contact although it is not considered a classic STI or STD because of its low degree of pathogenicity (ie, harm the infected person). The two species of Ureaplasma are Parvum and Urealyticum.  On one hand it may not lay dormant forever and once the immune resistance is weakened it may cause inflammation. On the other hand treatment (antibiotics) may actually cause more harm than Ureaplasma itself.  What is the modern approach to this? Is there a consensus? What are the criteria to decide whether the treatment is required? "

How to detect cancer development?  Are any actions required if there are no visible condylomata?  Also, is there any statistical data on how often HPV 51 causes cancer in males? "
855,The most confusing concepts in weight loss,"Here are some of the subjects that I found so confusing :     Try to eat good Carbs/Sugar not the bad ones (simple / complex ):   Checked internet and from what I understood that they are quite similar but the chemical structure is different.  The differences between the structures makes the absorption more slow for the complex carbs ( and non processed sugar ).  The question is does the fact of the slow absorption is really good?   The way I understand this: At the end it's a matter of time until these Carbs get absorbed and turned into fat, so it is just a matter of time!     Abs exercices will not burn the belly fat!   They also explained that you can't burn a specific area of your body ( this one makes a sense for me ). But saying that doing abs exercices will not burn the fat around your belly - I cannot trust this fact easily: what I'm burning then? Fuel?   No blog post explained in deep why you should this and shouldn't eat that, basically the same information is duplicated in all blogs. "
856,What is the amount of caffeine in the human body over time?,"Let's say I know how much caffeine I drank and when. Just knowing my sex, weight (and maybe height), what is the best estimate for how much caffeine is in my system now?  For example: Suppose I drank 180 mg of caffeine 5 hours ago, another 180 mg of caffeine 2 hours ago, I'm female and weigh 140 pounds.  I'm guessing food intake may also have a lot to do with it, but let's ignore that. Is a good estimate available?  Motivation: I am logging my blood pressure and want to know if it's correlated with the amount of caffeine in my blood. Rather than just write down how much caffeine I had that day, I wondered if there might be a better measure of how much caffeine I have at the time of measurement. "
857,Is Depo-Provera shot directly start working?,Is Depo Provera shot directly start working or waiting must be required for it's effects. Secondly when the second shot should be conducted? Exactly after three months or can a delay of one to three days be acceptable or not. Or can we inject it again two to three days before the exact time? 
858,What's The Minimum Staffing/Logistics For Running A Hospital?,"Specifically, a hospital serving a local population of 200-400 people, and assuming departments include ER, ICU, dentistry, maternity, outpatient, pharmaceutical, radiology, and general surgery. What would the physician to nurse ratio be? Could a physician cross departments for efficiency (i.e. unused ICU staff doubling as GP for outpatients)? Money is of no concern, and administration is run by the physicians themselves. "
859,"Are chiropractors the only professionals who will ""adjust"" the spine?","I've had various periods of extended back pain that chiropractors can relieve by ""adjusting"" (a.k.a. ""cracking"") my spine in just a moment, providing immediate and long-term relief from pain sometimes in a single visit.  I've asked massage therapists if they can do that, and they decline.  When I see an MD for the exact same problem they may prescribe anti-inflammatories and seem more concerned with whether it's worth sending me to get an MRI, or whether I should just ""give it time.""  Are there any other professionals that will do the spinal adjustments for which chiropractors are known?  If not, why? "
860,Lactase enzyme products and dental health,"It is possible to buy lactase enzyme products, such as chewable tablets or drops, that convert lactose in dairy produts to glucose and galactose on-the-fly (supplementing or replacing low human lactase production).  Some of these, particularly chewable tablets, may interact with lactose while the lactose-containing food is still in the mouth.  What is the effect on dental health of glucose/galactose compared to lactose? Is there a higher risk of dental health problems, e.g. cavities?  If glucose and/or galactose are more detrimental to dental health than lactose, would swallowing the chewable tablet supplement (often also a listed administration method) be better for dental health? "
861,Can you eat nuts after brushing?,"I recall from a commercial that brushing is to get rid of plaque, and the point of getting rid of plaque is to stop it from producing acid with sugars.   So what if I don't eat sugars?  Does that mean foods like nuts, breads, potatoes, meats can be eaten after brushing?   Further, can I eat potatoes and breads without brushing ever again and not have any adverse effects on my teeth? "
862,Does conscious sleep impair immunity?,"It's common knowledge that getting insufficient sleep makes people immune-compromised.  However, what about light rest? In particular, if you spend a significant amount of sleeping hours conscious (but sleeping by every other part of the definition) does that impair immunity?  For reference, this condition could be caused by sleeping disorders or other health conditions. "
863,Why does gas cause pain?,"If I have gas in my intestines, why does it hurt?    The mayo clinic has a lot of words, that describe the how and why you get gas.     Anything that causes intestinal gas or is associated with constipation or diarrhea can lead to gas pains. These pains generally occur when gas builds up in your intestines, and you're not able to expel it. Most people pass gas at least 10 times a day.    There are a few answers at Methods for dealing with gas pains? talking about how to get rid of gas.  But why do some, health people feel pain when they have gas?  I can't imagine the gas bubble has a sharp point, so it's not like the gas bubble is poking your intestine.   Pain is ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage."" so some mechanism must be turning the physical presence of gas in the intestine to pain.  What is that mechanism?   Clarify: this question is about a healthy persons normal daily gas causing occasional pain.  "
864,Which long-term effects can hypocortisolism have on behavior?,"Chronic stress can have a serious impact on our physical as well as psychological health due to sustained high levels of the chemicals released in the âfight or flightâ response.  I've studied the neurobiological implications in abused children, and i found that in those children is noticed a dysregulation of the ""Hypothalamic - Pituitary - Adrenal"" axis and particularly anomalous levels of Cortisol (Hart, Gunnar, Cicchetti, 1995).  The authors hypothesize that the reduced activity of the HPA axis may have an adaptive role cause it protects against the consequences of a chronic hypercortisolism (Cicchetti e Rogosch, 2001).  Can this alteration have effects on social skills? Are there neurobiological evidences? "
865,Are there any side effects of general anesthesia over local anesthesia?,"I finally decided to have a surgery for my ACL since I tore it completely, and after taking so much time to think about it and gather opinions from doctors, friends, etc. I think is the best move I have right now.  A friend that already got his ACL fixed told me that he got a shot in the back right before the surgery and that he was awake most of the time. I asked my doctor if that was going to be the case for me and he told me that he was going to put me a mask around my mouth and nose and he will put me to sleep for all the time of the surgery duration, I told this to my friend and he said I should be careful with that because if they leave the mask for more time than needed that I can get into a vegetative state which made me very nervous because I think that is worse than dying in my opinion, is this true?  What can I expect to be the side effects of general anesthesia over local anesthesia? "
866,How does the schedule for a vaccination in multiple injections work?,"My doctor advised me to get vaccinated against the Japanese encephalitis before a trip to Cambodia. He recommended three injections in order to get protected for 10 years: a first injection, a second one a month later and a third one six months later.   I know that the basic principle of vaccination is to inject an innocuous version of a virus so that the immune system knows it, and recognizes it and respond to it quickly in case of contact with the real virus.  Could someone explain how the multiple injections vaccination works?   As a guideline for answering:   Why three injections and not one as for many other vaccinations? Are the three injections in the process the same? How flexible is this schedule? In particular, I had always been confused by the ""6 months later"" for the third injection. Is it 6 months after the first or the second injection? Does it matter?  "
867,What is the failure rate of orthodontic treatments?,"For orthodontic treatments such as braces, after completion of treatment, sometimes teeth return to their original position or some degree of misalignment.  How frequently does this occur?  How often does it occur if maintenance (such as retainers) treatments are done properly? "
868,Is there disadvantages in staying idle with hunger?,"I usually take lunch at 2 PM and take dinner at 9 PM without any snacks or coffee in between. I will take a glass of green tea and two liters of water in between lunch and dinner. I feel hungry around 7 and I don't eat anything until 9.  Can staying hungry have any effect on health ? If so, what measures do I need to take ? "
869,Is there any disadantage in reduce belly fat by machines or by medical treatments,"I saw lot of companies advertising in online or in TV that we can reduce belly fat by using their machines. Is that really works , Is there any disadvantages  ?  also i saw some take medical treatments for removing extra fat present only in belly part ? what affects will happen on health ?    "
870,Resistance of Bacteria to Antibiotics after fall-back,"If an infection comes back a few weeks after taking antibiotics, because the full dose and prescribed amount of antibiotics wasn't taken, does this mean that the bacteria is now immune to that antibiotic? Or can it still be treated the same way? "
871,What are the most likely essential amino acids to be deficient in a vegan diet?,What are the most likely essential amino acids to be deficient in a vegan diet? Where to find them? 
872,"Nutritionally speaking, are food volumes calculated pre- or post-preparation?","I'm trying to lose weight, and to that end, I've started logging my meals.  90% of the time it's very straightforward, except for one scenario: food that changes volume significantly.  For example,   Dry rice, when cooked with water, grows quite substantially. A single cup of dry rice might become 2-3 cups or more of cooked rice. Alternatively, a single serving of cooked (and thus wilted) spinach is often sold in containers that require moving equipment to get out to my car.   When reading nutrition tables and other statistics about food, should volumes be understood as pre-preparation, or post?  And is the answer standardized across all (or at least most) platforms and info sources, or does it change from place to place?  If I cook 1 cup of dry rice with water and it becomes 3 cups of cooked rice, and I eat it all, did I just eat 1 cup of rice, or 3? "
873,Itchy miscolored inflammed bump on elbow,"For the past 48 hours, I've had a miscolored, raised patch of skin on my elbow that has been itching non-stop.    I've applied topical diphenhydramine hydrochloride (2%), which seems to have no affect on the itchiness.  The only way to stop the itch has been to wrap it with an ice pack.  What are the possible causes of this?  Could it be serious enough that I need to consult a dermatologist? "
874,Do I have to wait after a tick bite to get vaccinated for encephalitis?,"I recently removed a tick I must have caught while camping. Thinking of my plans for the summer (which involve frequently changing clothes in the wilderness), I realized I'd like to get a vaccination against tick borne encephalitis.   Usually, a vaccine is not given right after potential exposure to the pathogens against which it protects. Is this so for the vaccine against tick encephalitis? How long do I have to wait after my last tick bite until it is safe to get the vaccine?   Also, how long does the vaccine ""hold"" without renewal? If it needs renewals, how is it best to time them (e.g. which season is optimal?)  Update In case that ticks are a vector for different diseases in different parts of the world, I expect to get bitten in the southern parts of Germany and the eastern parts of France. I am worried about the disease known in German as ""FSME"", which is endemic in these regions.  "
875,Probiotic: capsule or powder?,"What form of probiotic has the greatest health benefit- Capsule or powder?  I have searched for it but the results talk about everything on probiotics except my question!  (A snapshot of my endeavors)  In my opinion it is better to use capsule since it will protect the bacteria from the acid environment in the stomach. But then I'm skeptical about that: if the powder form is useless, why does it exist? "
876,Is brushing teeth without toothpaste actually harmful?,"Another user mentioned that brushing teeth without toothpaste is dangerous because it's ""likely to cause micro-scratches in the enamel of one's teeth"". How true is the claim?  To be exact, let's assume that the mouth is ""fully rinsed"" with clean tap-water and the bristles of the toothbrush are ""fully wet"" with clean tap-water.  Is  brushing teeth without toothpaste actually bad for the gums (and teeth / general oral health)? "
877,What is the mechanism of eczema?,"I'm trying to link the signs and symptoms of eczema (especially atopic dermatitis) to its causes. In short, what is the mechanism of the disease?  In an answer of another question about eczema, @anongoodnurse has said (bolded words added by me):     Signs and symptoms: Eczema (or Atopic Dermatitis) is an incompletely understood skin disorder, in which the normal skin barrier function (permeability) is compromised, allowing the skin to dry out more than normal skin.      Causes: The cause of the dryness in AD is thought by some to be (1) a deficiency of a naturally occurring fatty substance in the skin called ceramide. Others believe it's (2) an abnormal or missing protein which causes the skin barrier to be compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to cause immune responses more easily, triggering the itch/chronic inflammation (this might explain the response seen with topical steroids).     If the cause is a deficiency of ceramide, what causes this cause? Ceramides are a family of waxy lipid molecules, so exactly which chemical is produced? Is it because the skin produces another kind of ceramide which has lower quality, or it does not produce enough? If the cause is an abnormal or missing protein, what causes this cause? What protein it is? Is that something related to T cells (recognising antigens) or B cells (producing antibodies)? Is it a skin problem or an immune system problem? Also, I heard from many sources that this is an immune system problem. And the source of this problem is the gut. They quote Hippocrates: ""All disease begins in the gut"". Is that true? Will just eating healthy food, adding more probiotics,  and applying moisturizer help the skin effectively?  "
878,Do salt rooms really help fight pollen allergies?,"I've heard that sitting in salt rooms, also known as halotherapy, can help fight pollen allergies. Is there any scientific proof that this claim is true? If so, why? "
879,What is the likelihood of contracting genital HSV1 through oral sex?,"I know genital HSV1 can be contracted from unprotected oral sex, but what is the actual  likelihood? For example, what is the likelihood when the partner is asymptomatic vs symptomatic, and what is the likelihood if the person contracting it has already been exposed to oral HSV1 as a child? If genital HSV1 is contracted, how long does it usually take to find out? (when would symptoms start to appear) "
880,How to detect cancer in general?,Can a common blood test spot cancer in general? Or is it necessary to take some specific tests for each kind of cancer? 
881,Can overdoses occur from ingesting nicotine from cigarettes?,Is it possible to overdose on nicotine from cigarettes? How many cigarettes would one have to smoke to reach this point? 
882,What health risks are associated with expired condoms?,"Condoms have an expiry date, usually about five years from their production date, as far as I can tell.  Obviously, it means their effectiveness is dramatically reduced if used after that expiry time (and chance for tearing/holes increase), so there would be the usual risk of having unprotected sex if used for that purpose.   Are there any other health risks beyond that? If there are, would they occur by simply handling the condom or using it for something other than its intended purpose?  "
883,My doctor says he's not qualified to prescribe HRT,"I'm a pre-transition transwoman living in Northern Illinois, US, and have been for years. Recently I went to my doctor's office to be prescribed to HRT medications, but my doctor said he's not qualified to prescribe it. Is that possible?   If I can't get a prescription from my doctor, how do I get HRT? I don't have the income to spend a ton of money getting it by order through the internet. "
884,What leaf resembling a mint numbs toothaches?,"While I was on Reddit, I found an interesting claim about a leaf that looks like a mint that can numb toothaches. Here is the exact quote from Reddit     I do know that some tribes in Cumberland island (along the coast of what is now Georgia) would place a mint-style leaf in the side of their mouth to numb tooth aches. I can speak from experience that it is very powerful - I first learned this during a guided tour of the island many years ago.       Here is some more info and a citation.      [website]Alas, that link is nonoperative. So to what leaf was the above referring? Is the claim actually true? "
885,Are there medications that relieve and stop migraines quickly?,"From websites such as this from Mayo Clinic, powerful migraine medications mostly appear to prevent migraines, and NOT to stop an acute episode?   However, if a migraine sufferer wants to minimize the quantity of medication consumed, are there any medications that are intended for a fast effect and relief? If so, which ones?  "
886,How much hard liquor is safe for very small children?,"I live in a location where hard liquor (48%-52% alcohol by volume) is frequently given to small children as young as two years old. This is usually not in large quantities, although a recent story in the local newspaper did report the death of a three-year-old by alcohol poisoning for consuming about 100ml in a short period of time. (This would be without water, as shots, and possibly on an empty stomach, per the local custom.)  Everyone knows that too much alcohol has averse effects, but I'd like to quantify this a bit if possible. Assume a healthy two-year-old child who weighs about 25 pounds; how much hard liquor would be unhealthy and why?  I'm looking for an answer that isn't zero for the sake of being zero (unless there's a true reason that any amount at all is damaging). Kids often taste it off the end of a chopstick or something similar, so dosages of &lt;1ml in an evening may be realistic in the common case, a couple of times per month.  In other cases, a child will be able to drink from the glass, and once at a wedding I've seen a three-year-old nephew-in-law drunk as a result. His dad is undoubtedly giving him too much, but too much by how much?  This is the closest related answer I found on this site. The research cited suggests that even a short period of time with high exposure is damaging (which is obvious), but not really the minimum dosage for damage. Several sources posit that a little alcohol each day is healthy, suggesting a threshold effect is in place. Does the threshold also exist for children with developing brains, given alcohol quantities proportional to body weight and likely a coefficient related to mental development stage?  This is the closest related question I found on a web search. The Question was ""If the quantity is small, is it still a risk?""; the Answer immediately sidesteps the question, asserts that 60ml is a small quantity, and then concludes by explaining that 60ml is not a small quantity.  The correct answer may be that the truth is intractable, similar to this fine answer, but the situation here is different. I'm not seeing multiple conflicting studies; rather, I'm seeing very little research on this topic. My guesstimate, based on absolute air, is that it's somewhere in the vicinity of 5ml, but I'm hoping there's some real relevant research out there given how important the issue and how absolutely prevalent of a practice it is.  Edit for clarification: For the purposes of this Question, I'm only interested in direct health effects and long-term damage, and not second-order effects like increasing propensity for alcoholism.  I'm really trying to understand how much physical machinery a two-year-old child has when it comes to processing alcohol, such that a few hours later they'd be just fine in the same way an adult is just fine after drinking a small amount of liquor.  Do the necessary enzymes exist at all in small children? If so, how much liquor would the child be able to process? (If not, what happened to the ~10ml that the child in my example consumed? What sort of damage did it cause?) "
887,How important is the amount of active ingredient in an ointment?,"I own a small tin of ""Dr Chase"" ointment that is probably 40 years old. This stuff is amazing. In my family we save it for particularly stubborn or difficult cuts and sores because it will heal anything. Recently, I had something on my leg that Polysporin was not helping - after a week of twice daily Polysporin I got out the Dr Chase and in two days it was better. It is a matter of family legend that it must contain radiation or mercury or something because it is just not like any other ointment.   As far as I know, it's not made any more. I would love to replace my tin and use it more often, but I haven't been able to find it. However, I can read the back of the tin just fine and it consists of:   Zinc Oxide, 18.6 % w/w Phenol, 0.59% w/w   Zinc Oxide suspensions are easy to find (diaper cream) but they don't have phenol in them. I have turned up a Canadian ointment (how convenient, I am in Canada) called Ozonol that contains 0.18% phenol and 3.72% zinc oxide. How likely is this to be as good? The Dr Chase is a tiny little tin, 2"" across, and you use very little at a time of this very thick ointment - it's just like diaper cream. The Ozonal comes in a tube. Perhaps I could just use more each time?  Is the more dilute cream likely to be a reasonable substitute for the thick ointment? "
888,Does soy milk help prevent cancer?,"In this TED Talk the speaker describes the anti-angiogenic properties of soy extract for cancer prevention. I am lactose intolerant, so I was about to give soy milk a try anyway, but I'm wondering how much soy extract is there in normal commercially available soy milk? And, are there some side effects I should be aware of when it comes to drinking soy milk on a regularly basis as a substitute for cow milk? "
889,What are the drawbacks for the body of eating an apple?,"Most people would say that eating fruit is good for us; vitamins, micro-nutrients, phyto-chemicals.  However, a colleague of mine told me he eats no fruit because of the sugar.  Is eating an apple as bad as eating an equivalent amount of pure sugar with a spoon? (Assuming pure sugar is considered bad for us.)  Is there any other way in which eating a fruit is bad for us? "
890,Coagulation factors and rheumatoid arthritis,"A doctor once explained to me that elevated values of factor XIII and van Willebrand factor can be caused by rheumatoid arthritis.   I didn't get around to asking back then, but is that something specific to rheumatoid arthritis or something that's normal during any kind of inflammation? And is it something that's only elevated during an acute episode of RA or does it stay elevated?  "
891,Splitting pills in half,"Sometimes a physician will instruct the patient to reduce the dosage of a prescription medication by 50%.  Obviously, if the tablet has an enteric coating, or is in a special encapsulation (such as with medications like Pristiq), it should not be split in half.  But what about other medications?  Can they be split in half?  I have heard that, unless the pill is scored, the patient should not split the pill in half.  The reasoning I have always been provided is that the active ingredient in the pill may not be evenly distributed.  Is this true?  Or is it a way to sell more medications and increase profits?  Is there any scientific (or even anecdotal) evidence regarding this? "
892,Are tobacco packaging warning messages improving health of society?,"Are there any countries with law not requiring such warnings? If yes, were there conducted any smokers-related studies? "
893,Omics vs Classic Blood Sample,"It seems to me that omics data offers much more information than a classic biochemical blood analysis does. Are there more features that can be known from a patient blood sample using omics data in comparison with classic biochemical markers[2]?  By omics data, I mean knowing all of the molecules and quantities of a blood sample.  Could integrating all the omics data associations present in databases and comparing with the blood sample say a lot about a patient's overall health?  Two examples of using omics data to get information about a patient's psychological status:  [website][website]Many diseases are multifactorial, such as psychological ones. On the other side, some of them, such as the ones already being monitored via classical biochemical markers are not. We could then be here limited by the current concept of disease in medicine, and thus we would not gain too much with blood omics data.  "
894,Pre diabetic after fasting blood work?,"So I have been feeling very lethargic the past year and went in to get some blood work.  I fasted for 12 hours prior to test, with the exception of mint that I had that morning hour before test that had sorbitol and less than a gram of sugar.  I'm in terrific shape and have a squeaky clean diet (FODMAP for the past 2 years because its easy on my stomach) yet my blood sugar levels came back at 106 mg/dL and that is considered pre diabetic when you're fasting.  Normal is 65-99 mg/dL.  So do you believe that the mint heightened my blood sugar that much that I should retake the test?    I have not spoken to my doctor about it yet (results emailed to me) and have been trying to do some research prior so I can be prepared to have any additional questions.  Thanks in advance!  Edit  Not sure if it matters, but I'm 185 lbs, 7.5% body fat and workout 6 days per week.  From all that I read, it looks like the results indicate that I'm moving towards type 2 diabetes?  Better yet, the best way to prevent it is to eat healthy and exercise more.  I could break down my diet easily since I eat the same thing daily and record calories, fat, carbs, protein and it's all low on the glycemic index :( "
895,"What OT techniques are common following heart bypass, and how do these correlate to resuming normal daily activities?","An elderly person has suffered a heart attack, and later had an extensive cardio bypass surgery.  The patient is now undergoing Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT) with the goal to return to independent living in several weeks.  In trying to help this patient to resume shaving himself or to cooking his own dinner, I can understand that you do not necessarily want to begin by handing him a sharp razor or a hot frying pan.  What activities might an OT begin with to assist the patient, or to evaluate what steps the patient will need to reach the goal?  Further, is there a standard set of tests that are used in all situations in order to assess the patient's current abilities?    Disclaimer:  My motives behind this question are my own father and his ongoing recovery.  I have not been present for his OT, but the things he describes are baffling to both him and me, having the feel of kindergarten arts and crafts.  However, I do not wish to question the methods of a person with extensive training and experience in a field where my level of knowledge is how to abbreviate it.  It is difficult to separate myself from these emotions and biases.  I have tried to frame this question in as general a manner as I could to benefit multiple readers.  If I have strayed, I apologize.  I welcome any edits that improve the neutrality of the question while still helping me learn what I need to.  Please leave this disclaimer.  See also this meta. "
896,Are 3D-DSA and 3DRA the same?,"This question is to radiologists.  I'm a PhD student in medical image processing and (I thought that) I was working with 3D-DSA images obtained by subtraction of non-contrast enhanced CBCT from a contrast enhanced one. Now I see here and there people mention 3DRA modality. Is this actually just a different word for the same thing? If so, which one is a standard one (could not find either in DICOM standard text for example)? "
897,What is proper capacity of adult non-rebreather masks?,"I've looked at a few different brands of non-rebreather ""adult"" masks and all of them have reservoirs of about 1L.  Even connected to 100% oxygen There is no way that's going to give an average adult a significant oxygen boost if he's breathing deeply (3L+ inspiratory capacity) -- much less an above-average adult.  So how do EMTs give a large adult with critically depressed SpO2 enough oxygen?  Are there even more aggressive means of administering oxygen?  Or are there larger-capacity non-rebreather masks (perhaps known by a different name, since a few searches didn't reveal any)?  Amendment: I just put an NRB on a tank of regular air with a 25L/min regulator. The bag fills in about 2 seconds, and if I'm resting it's more than adequate. But if I do a minute of squat-jumps my breathing rate rises to roughly 1 cycle per second. Then if I put on the NRB I'm sucking the full bag down in less than half a breath, after which I'm fighting the safety valve and mask seal to get enough air. If I were in respiratory distress it seems like it would only make things worse! "
898,How can one protect themselves from toxic substances released from fatty tissue during weight loss?,"It is well-known that obesity is associated with many health risks and obese persons are advised to follow a healthy diet and increase physical activity to lose weight and improve their overall health.  However, adipose (fatty) tissue accumulates lipophilic toxic substances, such as poly chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Studies have shown that:     Body weight loss increases plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in obese subjects.   Furthermore, the review on Toxicological Function of Adipose Tissue: Focus on Persistent Organic Pollutants cites research to support the claim that plasma concentrations of POPs increase with weight loss, and cites animal studies which have shown that weight loss promotes POPs redistribution to other lipid rich tissues, such as the brain and the liver. This implies that losing weight, especially rapidly, could have toxic effects on the patient.  My questions are:   If we stipulate that a person is losing weight gradually, are there any protective/precautionary measures they could take, to protect themselves from harmful effects of toxic substances stored in their adipose tissues, which are released on losing weight?

899,Correlation between pre-pregnancy training level of abdominal muscles and the risk of getting diastasis recti,"Is there any evidence that (very) strong or (very) weak abdominal muscles before becoming pregnant increases or decreases the risk of developing diastasis recti during pregnancy?

900,Does relighting a cigarette have a harsher effect on your health?,"From the Cancer Institute of New Jersey:     According to Michael Steinberg, MD, MPH, FACP, a member of The Cancer Institute of New Jersey and director of the Tobacco Dependence Program, who is the senior author of the research:            âIn fact, smokers who relight cigarettes may be at higher risk of lung cancer and chronic bronchitis.  That is something of which policy makers need to be aware,â he notes.   From Oxford Academic:     Given that previous research has indicated that relighting cigarettes leads to increased harm, the public health implications of this smoking practice are discussed.   Sadly, I do not have permission to access the Oxford article.  From a seemingly unofficial source on Quora:     When you relight a cigarette, you're breathing coal. Read about breathing coal &amp; black lungs. If you're going to relight a cigarette it is desirable to sever the burnt end of the cigarette to remove the burnt coal. The relighting of the burnt coal causes marginally higher incidence of lung cancer compared with people who use a ""cigarette snipper"" (or just small scissors).   From another Quora post:     There are some simple physical truths here.         The last few drags of a cigarette contain far more tar, as the tar from the first half has partially condensed and saturated the butt.   There are also a lot of other toxic chemicals that do the same thing.   Also, most of the horrible stuff in cigs is worse once it becomes oxidized (burnt.)      Although most online sources suggest, ""Yes, relighting cigarettes is worse for your health"", the official sources don't explain how.  The unofficial sources do conjure some possibilities, I would prefer documentation that's a bit more official.    Question  What is the set of health concerns to consider when relighting a cigarette, compared to smoking a full never-been-lit-before cigarette? I'd assume the set would contain all the concerns of smoking in general, but what deviations exist?  "
901,Replacing bedding and underwear for hygienic reasons,"Many sites claim that bedding and underwear should be thrown away for sanitary reasons every few years (the exact recommendation varies between sites and clothing/bedding type).   This, regardless of the laundry routine they endure. So for example, even if you wash your underwear at 60Â°C with bleach every day, they should allegedly be thrown in the garbage every year for sanitary reasons.  How does this make sense? Why does the item's age matter? Isn't a 5-year old item (pillow/underwear/duvet/etc) as good as new, hygienically speaking, after being washed with a detergent at 60Â°C? Do you mean to tell me things get ""too contaminated"" over time, to the point where they are a ""sanitary lost cause"" and must be thrown away and replaced?   Note that I'm only talking about the hygienic perspective. For the sake of this discussion let's ignore things like loss of functionality, comfort, aesthetics, etc. "
902,To what degree does a Vitamin D course mitigate the effects of Primary Hyperparathyroidism?,"Primary Hyperparathyroidism, often caused by a parathyroid gland having an adenoma on it, increases the release of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the body.  This causes the excess release of calcium from bones into the blood, and the weakening of said bones.  A low Vitamin D level often accompanies hyperparathyroidism (or perhaps is a result of?) and while most calcium is excreted then through urine, some of it forms into kidney stones.  Recently, some studies show, and consequently some doctors now recommend, a course of vitamin-D to re-absorb the calcium that had been released.  Given a patient with low vitamin D, a calcium level of 2.9 mmol/L and PTH level of 12.9 mg/dl, what would be the expected impact of a course of Vitamin D at 50,000 IU/week ?  Would the effects of hyperparathyroidism be fully mitigated while on the course, or if not, to what degree would they be?   "

What I have found so far:  From {1} (RCT on 56 rats done in 2012):     Hyperbaric oxygen therapy creates a positive histological and biomechanical effect on tendon healing after Achilles tendon repair.   From {2} (RCT on 13 rabbits done in 2004):     The results validate the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of tendinopathy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may increase collagen synthesis and collagen cross-link formation during the early healing process.   I wonder if any study (preferably RCT) has been done on humans.

Is this discovery as great as it sounds? Based on how I understand the article, the type of tissue was already known. The article only shows article mere scale of it.  How feasible is it that this organ was undetected by now? How feasible is it that the tissue does in fact qualify as a fluid system and organ and isnât just a type of tissue? "
908,What is the benefit of effervescent tablets?,"So you have these 'fizzing' tablets, that are to the best of my knowledge referred to as effervescent tablets. The wiki page provides some details, including that they are tablets which are designed to dissolve in water, and release carbon dioxide.   However, I haven't been able to find out what the benefit is of a normal orally taken tablet dispersed in water, versus an effervescent tablet?   For example, take acetylcycteine against thick mucus - it comes in various forms, including regular tablets and effervescent tablets as well.     Is it just to add some carbonic acid to the water to make it sparkling to make it taste better?  Is it a method to dissolve materials quicker by the generation of bubbles?   Is it to make the water more acidic by generating carbonic acid? Is there a more pharmacological reason for the use of effervescent tablets?       Effervescent tablet. source: wikipedia "
909,Is there a significant difference between Xhance vs generic (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray?,"I'm trying to find out what the difference is between Xhance and Flonase, generic (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray.  For those who don't know: Xhance is fluticasone propionate with a different delivery system than the generic fluticasone propionate sold at a warehouse store.  As you can see in the diagram, the Xhance delivery system is inserted in the nose and sprayed, while while the user simultaneously blows into the dispenser to presumably distribute the medicine further into the nasal cavity; while the generic medication is delivered as a simple nasal spray.  My wife's insurance won't cover her Xhance prescription, which is about [tex]40 for a 3 or four month supply.  So of course my question is, if we could get the same effect using the generic, if we were able to build a similar delivery mechanism; i.e. 3D printer, etc?    Anyone have any thoughts on this?   "

911,Why is episodic use of infliximab associated with a higher incidence of antibody formation towards the drug?,"It has been shown in many studies that episodic use of infliximab (and other Anti-TNF agents) increases the incidence of antibody formation towards the drug, when compared with giving the drug on a regular schedule, such as once every 8 weeks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  Why is this? What is the underlying mechanism for why maintenance administration results in lower incidence of antibodies than episodic administration?  Why are antibodies formed towards some drugs, such as Infliximab but not others?  Episodic use would mean to use the drug on an intermittent basis only when required.  1:Incidence and importance of antibody responses to infliximab after maintenance or episodic treatment in Crohn's disease.  2: Theodore M.

913,"How is ""histologically invasive diameter"" assessed in live patients?","Quote:     A total of 34 patients were registered between July 2009 and June 2012. The mean age was 53.5âyears. The median follow-up time was 23.7âmonths (2-24âmonths). The age at the time of recurrence, state of menopause, T and N stage, histologically invasive diameter, number of lymph node metastases at initial diagnosis, histological grade, HER2 status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PgR) status (priority order was defined as status at recurrence â that at the time of surgery â that at the initial diagnosis), interval from the resection of the primary lesion until recurrence (&lt;12, 12-24, and â¥24âmonths), and site of recurrence are shown in Table 1.   As I understand, ""histologically invasive diameter"" stands for ""maximal diameter of the area invaded by the primary tumour"". But how is it measured in live patients?   In my understanding, one can't get a whole slice of tissue (histology) out of a living person to determine where exactly the tumor ends - but it's hard to estimate from one-off biopsies. The shape of the tumour might be irregular, and one or two biopsies won't help establish it precisely.   Maybe histology is somehow combined with imaging in order to establish the diameter? "

916,What is the name for the symptom of mishearing words?,"Thereâs a really interesting symptom I remember hearing about, wherein the patient will fail to understand certain sounds correctly, in a repeatable fashion.  For example, the patient could be watching a TV show, and hear âWhat kind o-z on the pizza?â Rewind 10 seconds, âSo you want one large and one bottle of Sprite. What kind o-z on the pizza?â Rewind again, listen again. âSo you want one large and one bottle of Sprite. What kind o-z on the pizza?â At this point, the patient has figured out that the sentence was âWhat kind of cheese on the pizza?â Yet even after rewinding again, the patient logically knows what he or she should be hearing, but still only understands âWhat kind o-z on the pizza?â  This could be a TIA, but the effect can continue intermittently for days potentially, so it would seem to be something else. Anyway, what is this symptom called? "

920,What is the fetal viability of a full-term birth baby?,"The Wikipedia article on fetal viability gives a table giving fetal viability at each week of gestation:    So at 34 weeks the viability rate is >98%. But I'm wondering what is the viability of a full-term baby, that is, at 39 to 40 weeks of gestation? The reason I ask this is because I assume that some full-term babies don't have a 100% viability.   Also, does anyone know what viability means exactly? In the article I checked it's defined as      ""The ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus.""  Fetal   viability (Wikipedia article)   I'm not sure exactly what this means, because it seems to me vague. For example infant mortality rate is not vague, it specifically expresses the number of babies that die within the first year of their life, but the fetal viability measure doesn't mention a fixed time period. For example would a baby who manages to live for 6 months be considered to be viable or have been considered to be viable?  "

922,Does wearing UV blocking glasses worsen myopia in children?,"I have found this article which claims (for chicken) that blocking outdoors UV light made myopia worse.   Some kids require glasses from a young age, e.g. 6 years old. Most of these glasses do have UV filter on their lenses. Another study claims that the younger the patient is when the onset of myopia the worse their outcome is.  The question: is it possible that the lack of outdoors UV light at a young age causes the worsening of myopia? If so, would glasses with no UV blocker be a better alternative for kids?  "

924,Effects of Garlic on Tacrolimus via CYP3A4,"Garlic is said to be an inducer of CYP3A4, Tacrolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4.  The list of drugs (and some foods) interacting with Tacrolimus is long but nowhere I found a note on garlic. Grapefruit juice is always mentioned, but regarding the fact that it is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 at least there would be no graft rejection when exposed.  Is garlic in this context not mentioned because it has absolutely no effect or because there are no studies available? Green tea for example is also not mentioned but according to current studies it may have an effect and the university of Munich for example advices transplant patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors to avoid it.  What is the current situation with foods like garlic or ginger? "
925,Definition of Prevalence,"I have been informed that the prevalence of chickenpox and smallpox in the general population are 10% and 0.1%, respectively. On the Wikipedia page it is written      Prevalence in epidemiology is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seat-belt use).   Should I read these numbers as 10 out of 100 people at any given time has chickenpox, knowingly or unknowingly? Similarly, 1 out of 1000 people in the general population has smallpox?   To me these numbers sounds very high. "
926,Is there any medical evidence that one toothbrush shape is better than another?,"I've noticed that electric toothbrushes these days typically come in one of two shapes, or a combination of the two.   The first shape is a circular shape, where the bristles spin in a circle. The second shape is the more traditional oblong shape that we recognize from manual toothbrushes.  Electric toothbrushes of this kind tend to vibrate up and down or front to back. The third shape is a circular shape in the front, with an additional oblong shape behind it.  The circular shape spins, and the oblong shape vibrates.   Is there any medical evidence that one of these shapes is better for cleaning the teeth?  What about for cleaning the gums? "
927,Values of Body Hydration Values to calibrate the readings of Galvanic skin response sensor,"I am trying to make a circuit to implement a Galvanic skin response sensor to measure the skin resistance and then use it to find the skin conductance. Then, I wish to calibrate these readings with some standard data so that the actual body hydration level can be calculated. In order to do so, I used one of the reference designs of Texas Instruments (Link). (The discussion related to this project is running on another TI forum with the link HERE.)  The final circuit has been pasted below.   The circuit has been implemented using hardware and I am getting voltage values from the op amp output terminal. The problem arises when I cannot compare these values with some standard data that is used in the Clinical labs for measuring body hydration level. So, the voltage values that I get cannot help in finding whether the person's body hydration level is high/low/some xyz value.  I need to calibrate these readings with some standard data so that the actual body hydration level can be calculated.  Where can I get the standard data that I use for the calibration? OR is there some alternative approach to calibrate my readings? Thanks in advance. "

930,World's decision to switch to LED lighting (to save $) cause more health problems? Migraines? Circadian-Rhythm? Seizures? Light-sensitivity?,"I have not switched to LED lighting in my home (though I know that it saves a lot of money in the long run) because I know how it personally impacts me. Not only does it disrupt my circadian-rhythm (and as an insomniac -- it makes it that much harder to sleep --- it's like taking an alcoholic into a bar), but I find that I have a lot of sensitivity to the light, which often trigger some of my migraines with a migraine aura. Once that migraine get's triggered, it's all downhill from there.... so I try to minimize the impact of LED lights in my home as much as possible.   However, no matter what I or others do, the world is quickly jumping on the LED bandwagon (it makes economic sense -- I don't blame them), but I'm wondering if anyone has considered how LED lighting will negatively impact societies' health?   For instance, now that cars have LED headlights, I find it really difficult to drive at night as my eyes are super sensitive to the brightness of the lights and I wince.... Not only does it trigger a migraine, but it could potentially cause me to have an accident if my eyes are closed.   Are LED lights known to cause seizures?  What kind of research has been done, if any, to see how the switch to LED lights will negatively impact the human health? "
931,How to prevent teeth-grinding at night & TMJ (Jaw) pain? Mouth-guard causes dry-mouth & restless sleep. Alternative treatments?,"I've always been an insomniac. However, I haven't always been a teeth-grinder. This is a recent development in the last 5 or years of so. It's so bad that someone sleeping across the room can hear me grinding down my own teeth! Ah!   Of course, I've seen a few dentists about this and have tried a number of different mouth-guards. Unfortunately, for me, mouth-guards cause excessive dry-mouth which also lead to restless sleeping because I'm constantly waking up to get water.... or I subconsciously in my sleep throw the mouth-guard out of my mouth.   So here I am still a major teeth-grinder and I now suffer from TMJ -- Temporomandibular joint syndrome.   Are there ways to treat:   1) Teeth-grinding (w/o mouth guards) to prevent further damage to teeth and TMJ?  2) If I can't treat teeth-grinding w/o the mouth-guards, is there a way to treat the dry-mouth to make the mouth-guard more bearable?   3). Is there a subconscious stress I'm unaware of that needs to be addressed in order to stop the teeth-grinding all together? Or do people teeth-grind even when they are not stressed? "

I'm not asking about physically demanding jobs (e.g. manually digging holes all day) although the job in question rarely involves sitting down. I think it is mental overload manifesting itself as exhaustion. I'm talking about a job where you work an 8 or 9 hour shift without a break, no quiet moments, always maintaining high concentration.   I'm guessing the main solution might be sleeping for as many hours as possible, since that is what the body appears to be suggesting! But maybe there are other nutritional/medical/psychological tactics that can reduce the level of misery slightly? Or make the body more able to cope with this assault?

In a matter of hours, I started experiencing the following symptoms (most of which remained for a while even after the fever was over) -   Weakness/Fatigue - Something simple like lifting my arms for a few seconds caused fatigue as if I had lifted weights. My wrists felt like they would break if I lifted something heavy.  Brain fog  Motor control - I walked as if drunk.   All of the above made me wonder -   Questions -   Exactly what changes happen inside human body that result in this sudden weakness/fatigue? Why do they continue much later after the fever is gone? Is the weakness/fatigue an unintentional side effect of fever or is it by design (supposed to help in recovery in some way)?   It is too sudden for muscle atrophy, then what else? Do the muscles stop producing sufficient ATP? Does the body for some reason start accumulating too much lactic acid? Something else?  I'm looking for answers that scientifically explain the root cause. "

I was redirected to the Nuclear-Medicine Department, and was first injected with a nuclear dye, and asked to come back several hours later. I was then handed with an official document for me to hand to any personnel or authority at a border crossing/airport since the radiation inside me would trigger nuclear alarms/triggers (had no idea that this existed). Then after the dye was dispersed throughout my body several hours later, I returned, and they put me in a machine (I think it was labelled SCENE) and it supposedly took images of my bones.   1. How does the nuclear dye improve the quality of the images that they acquired?   2.How is a bone-scan any better than a CT-scan? Is it a new technology?  3.What purposes does it fulfill?

My test result is seen below: Abnormal 1:160. My WBC was also soaring, but, my Dr. was undecided on whether or not to diagnose me with Lupus -- though the laboratory technicians had recommended the diagnosis.   So is a positive 1:160 ANA test result still considered ambiguous for diagnosis Lupus? He labeled me border-line Lupus. Is that a real thing? What other diagnostic testing is needed to diagnosis definitively that I have or do not have Lupus?   Or should I see a different rhematologist?    "
940,"Why do some General Practioners not consider Fibromyalgia as a genuine, real auto-immune disorder?","Before I was diagnosed with my Fibromyalgia by my rheumatologist, I had told my Canadian General Practitioner that my USA Family Doctor had thought I had thought I had Fibromylagia, and my G.P. laughed at me, and said... ""Don't ever tell a Rheumatologist that you might have Fibromyalgia because they might not take you seriously because Fibromyalgia is not considered a real disease.""  I didn't tell my Canadian Rheumatologist any of this, but he did diagnose me with Fibrymyalgia in the end.   Is there truth to what my Canadian GP was saying, that Fibromyalgia is not considered a genuine, real auto-immune disease by some?   I found it really hurtful because my life has been and continues to be pretty rotten because of all the Fibromyalgic symptoms, and him not legitimatizing it as a genuine auto-immune disorder, seems that he either thinks my symptoms are psychosomatic or just made up!   Why do some General Practioners not consider Fibromyalgia as a genuine, real auto-immune disease?    "
941,"Dentist says Dry-Mouth leads to bad breath (halitosis), gingivitis, tooth-decay, periodontal disease, etc. Why isn't Dry-Mouth diagnosed more often?","I had my semi-annual check-up with my dentist today and he noted that I had a severely dry-mouth. I've known I had this, but with all my other medical issues, I didn't consider it to be one of my major concerns, and simply dealt with it.   However, my Dentist made it very clear that dry-mouth can be a very serious problem for oral-hygiene. Not only does it lead to bad breath (halitosis), but it can lead to gingivitis, cavities, tooth-decay, and eventually periodontal disease....    Considering how serious dry-mouth is (at least according to my dentist), why don't you ever hear people suffering from ""dry-mouth""? Why don't doctors diagnosis you with dry-mouth? Or if doctors know that some of the medications you're on aare known to cause dry-mouth, why don't they offer a treatment plan for the symptoms? Why isn't dry-mouth taken more seriously?  "
942,Possible to build a tolerance for the sleep hormone melatonin?,"Good evening again, everybody!   As my backstory goes, I am an insomniac (why you get so many questions from me).   I am so fatigued, but no matter what, I just can't fall asleep...   I've tried Melatonin -- the natural sleep hormone -- before, and it worked for a while, but it lost its effectiveness quite quickly. I started upping the dosages to get that ""sleepiness"" effect, and then stopped because I didn't wanna do anything dangerous.   But I wasn't sure -- is it possible to build a tolerance to melatonin (if it's natural)? Or was it not working because I was more stressed than usual?   What is the highest safest dosage an adult of 150 lbs should take?   Thanks. "
943,"Any evidence that ""burning off tastebuds"" increases oral cancer risk?","I know some spice can be helpful: Is eating spicy hot (pungent) food (hot chilli &amp; peppers etc.) healthy or harmful?  That said, many people seem wear it as a badge of honor that they can eat very spicy foods or sour foods. Some take it to the point of ""burning off their taste buds"" (I personally did this on several occasions with sour candy as a child), such that everything you eat has a bit of a metallic taste until healed. Other parts of the mouth are also likely damaged, but damaged taste buds have always been the most noticeable to me.  Apart from the risks of initial tissue damage (e.g. burning a hole in your esophagus with a ghost pepper), is there any evidence of oral cancer risks from repeated tissue damage to your mouth similar to chemical burns (e.g. sour/spicy foods) or temperature-related burns (e.g. coffee/soup that didn't cool down enough before the first sip/bite)?

944,Do taller/larger individuals have a greater risk of developing cancer because they have more cells that could go rogue?,"I recognize this sounds like an immature/ignorant question, and I hope it doesn't rub anyone the wrong way, but I came across this CNN article claiming just that, and I was wondering if there is any truth behind it or if this is just an oddity (against the grain) article? CNN isn't exactly ""scholarly"" or ""medical"" research.  [website]Do taller/larger individuals have a greater risk of developing cancer because they have more cells that could go rogue? "
945,How to know if it's exercise-induced asthma? Or if tight-chest & wheezing is due to being out-of-shape? Or combo?,"As a child, before I was out-of-shape, I was diagnosed with ""exercised-induced asthma."" Is that a lifelong diagnosis? Or do youngsters tend to grow out of it?   I continue to take my Albuterol inhaler and daily puffs from my Advair as the ""exercised-induced asthma"" diagnosis has carried over into my adulthood. This is because I continue to get a tight-chest and consistent wheezing/coughing during and after any period of exercise. But... are these caused by ""exercised-induced asthma"" or could it be that I'm simply out of shape (admittingly, I could lose 15 pounds)? Or could it be a combo?   How do you know if you have exercise-induced asthma for sure?   Do pulmonologists consider exercise-induced or ""seasonal"" asthma a legitimate diagnosis? "

947,Wearing a corset,"First of all, I am not an english native speaker, however I will try to explain my issue as clear as possible. I am not asking for any diagnosis, but to clarify my question I will share my personal story .   My work needs about eight hours daily  sitting  in front of a computer. For that, trying to keep by body healthy, I start a new program, in which  I change my food habits into healthier ones, and try to do exercises three times  a week  plus taking a walk daily for  20 min.  However dueto stress I am still facing a problem :  I am thin, even though all fats are accumilating in the abs and waist!  I was thinking that, maybe wearing a coreset can prevent this accumilation of fat. So I did some research on different corsets products.  However, what I found is that:  as many warning of wearing such corset as many  encouragings for wearing it. Maybe this  is due to commercial  facts.  My question is : From  medical poin of view,  Does wearing a corset has any disadvantages? What if I wear it for 8 hours a day  ?  does a corset affect the skin ( or as I read the fat under the skin ) ?  "
948,"If compression socks increases the blood circulation and this is good for swelling, then how comes it is said ice is good for swelling?","âCold slows down blood flow to an injury, thereby reducing pain and swelling. Cold therapy slows circulation. It should be used if the area is swollen or bruised.â âCompression stockings are used to help increase circulation. This helps swelling.â  How comes these two are true at the same time? I have reactive arthritis and my feet are swollen after long days especially when I stand up or walk a lot. I've read that poor blood circulation causes this and shifting between cold and hot water improves blood circulation. Normally I avoid hot water because it triggers my inflammation, it definitely makes it worse and cold is always good. Anyway, I tried it and I ended with ice compress after massaging in hot water. It didn't reduce swelling at all, it just made it worse. People also say that I should try compression socks for my swollen feet, but I am suspicious about it. If it increases the blood circulation it can't be good for me. Cold slows down the blood circulation and I know it is good for me. So, what is this all about poor circulation, swelling, inflammation, cold treatment thing? I can't make connection. Which one is good? Slowing down the circulation or increasing the circulation? Ice or compression socks? Elevating also is certainly good for me as I experienced. "
949,Is saliva safe as a sexual lubricant for male masturbation?,"I normally masturbate by licking my hand and using the saliva as a lube, because I'm circumcised and the thrusting motion I actually don't likeâit can tear my penis skin since it's too tense.  Is using saliva safe, or does it contain bacteria that could cause me something? Obviously I can't contract a disease I didn't have, but maybe bacteria in the mouth should not reach the penis? "

952,Why are taste and smell (and hearing a song from the 90's) such potent triggers for nostolgia? Benefits and Negatives of nostologia?,"We've all experienced it, where we get a waft of some odor (whether pleasant or not), or bite into a long lost taste, or hear an old tune, see some forgotton photographs, (but emphasis on the taste and smell), and instantly we are in taken to a different time and place, and we are sometimes flooded with emotions. I think a Swiss man coined the term, ""Nostalgia"" (lit. Greek for ""Home-sicknesses"").    How/Why are our senses, particularly smell and taste, so strongly tied to memories??  There is a debate among scholars whether indulging in nostalgic activities is beneficial for our health. What are the key arguments?

I've always been told growing up, ""yawns are contagious"" or ""you gave your hiccups to me."" Is there any truth to yawns and hiccups be pscyhosomatically contagious? As in our body subconsciously sees a yawn and mimics it because the brain needs oxygen and yawns bring oxygen???  But for hiccipus... I don't understand. I know its a reflex of the diaphragm, but I don't know why suddenly our body would do that if we weren't eating or drinking. What benefits are there to hiccuping?    "
954,Effects of Modafinil,"As someone who suffers from chronic insomnia and often has to get things done during the day without much or any sleep at all, I would like to know from those experienced what the effects are of Modafinil and other wakefulness drugs before trying them myself. I guess my questions are mainly:   How does one feel after taking Modafinil? If I go without sleep for a night, will Modafinil give me an energy boost for the subsequent day? Does Modafinil have similar effects as energy drinks or other stimulants in that they increase your heart rate and can make you feel nervous?   I have tried drugs like cocaine and amphetamine and although they do the job and keep you awake without sleepiness I don't like them at all because of how they alter your mood and cause depression when the effects wear off.

I'm now 130 lbs and 5 foot 11, and 25 years old. As a result, my breast size has also decreased.  I've heard that you lose more of your breast fat if you're on a calorie deficit, than what you gain if you're on a calorie surplus.  In other words, I've heard that if you lose 5 pounds, and then gain 5 pounds, you will have relatively less fat in your breasts in the end than before you lost the 5 pounds, and relatively more in your belly.  Is this true? is there scientific evidence for this, or for it being false? "

960,How can I trust my doctor and what he said,"I have been coughing for around 3 months now, with a feel of air flow on my throat. I went to my family doctor, who said it was reflux from my stomach that went out to my throat and made like red things on my throat that make me cough. I wasn't convinced so I went to another doctor who said the same and gave me Esomeparzol to reduce stomach acidity (Even I don't feel an acid taste at all), and that made me go to an Otolaryngologist who said that I have allergies in my throat due to my nose secretions and he did Nasopharyngolaryngoscopy to be sure of that.  I am not convinced. I am not seeking any medical advice here. I worry that I have a tumor in my lung that makes me cough (though no blood, or anything else other than the cough for 3 months now). I know my doctors are right. But how do I stop being nervous? How can I trust my doctor ?   "
961,Circumvent death by hypothermia,"What I've read seems to indicate that hypothermia leads to death by stopping the heart, which means your cells slowly die from oxygen deprivation.   Is that accurate? Suppose you mechanically pumped a person's blood as they got colder, and also oxygenated their blood. Would this enable them to survive?  For instance, could you use this as a kind of partial cryosleep?  "
962,Is it a good idea to consume Soylent meal replacements (specifically containing potassium supplements)?,"The reason I am asking this is actually related to daily recommended potassium intake, which is stated to be around 4.700 mg daily. However, even if I concentrate all my meals on potassium intake, it's very hard to get near this number (I think around 14 bananas would suffice).  So searching for possible ways to increase intake, I noticed a number of ""meal replacements"" (like Soylent, but many of them DIY), which use potassium chloride or potassium citrate to provide the necessary intake.  For example, this ""Keto Chow"" recipe contains 6 grams of potassium citrate, and apparently perfectly provides all the nutrients:   Image taken from www.completefoods.co  So the ""numbers"" look rather nice, but I am wondering:   Are there any downsides using such meals? Specifically for potassium, is potassium citrate a safe supplement?  "

If the instructions said   AT LEAST one-half to one hour before breakfast  Then the answer is obvious, but according to the wording it implies food MUST be eaten 1 hour after taking Synthroid.  Please clarify. "

Nowadays my dad barely eats anything so very rarely something would come up.  I am reading that drugs such as Prevacid have increased risk of Kidney failure. (link)  For past 2 years when Dad took blood tests he had slightly low levels of Sodium, Chloride, Potassium and CO2   Last week he took blood tests and here were results   Sodium 132 Lo (reference 135 - 147 mmol/L) Chloride 93 Lo (reference 96 - 108 mmol/L) C02 17 Lo (22 - 29 mmol/L)   The Internal Medicine doctor said these levels are so insignificant there are no associated Pathology to treat these small ranges and on the physiological level they don't do anything clinical  Now I am questioning this. What if they are related.  Plus FDA (link) warn long term use of Prevacid      can cause bone fractures in the hip, wrist, or spine. Long-term use is   defined as multiple daily doses for a year or longer.      If you take this drug for three months or more you may also develop   low magnesium levels. This can be serious and may or may not come with   symptoms.   Question: How can my Dad stop taking Prevacid? Will the doctor take him off completely or gradually lower his dose? What other questions to ask Doctor regarding this.  As it is my Dad barely eats anything, let alone anything acidic. Mostly eats fruits, veggies, fibers, drinks lots of water.  Thank you for any guidance.   If it helps, below is a summary of his daily meds and vitamins    Plus his daily routine   "
969,"Having sex with someone who's had many sexual partners,","There's someone who I've been getting to know and she's particularly free-spirited and very smart and mature for her age (in college).  As our discussions have started to lean more towards us potentially having sex, we started to share more personal information with each other, and something she revealed is a bit shocking to me: she's had 25 sexual partners in the past.  I've only had a few - and can remember every girl that I've ever slept with.  How can I protect myself in this situation?  I'm not seeking medical advice, but more like, is it dangerous for me to have sex with someone who has had that many sexual partners in her past?  I've thought about asking her to let's go and get an STDs test together at some clinic, but I am afraid that would insult her and ruin any chances of us getting intimate.  Now I sort of wish that I hadn't known so much about her, to be honest.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks, "

So, I'm now curious to add this to the question as well.  If there is any valid study that pin-points cervical pain to be a reason for Tinnitus?

979,What user error can lead to a too-low blood pressure measurement?,"I was prescribed a medication which can increase blood pressure as a side effect, so I impulsively bought a small home BP measurement unit of the foolproof kind. It is made by a known brand for home medical electronics, so I think it's of reasonable quality. I've never operated one before, although I've had it used on me.   After extensive RTFM, I used it several times over two days, and I frequently got weirdly low measurements. Diastolic was mostly between 50 and 60, but a few times, I saw the display drop to 30, then turn off and give an error. Right now, half an hour after the medicine, diastolic was 63, but systolic was only 90.   Seeing that I usually have a BP in the middle of the healthy range (when measured by somebody who presumably knows what he's doing), and I don't feel close to fainting, I assume that I'm doing something wrong when measuring. I tried doing everything right - sitting straight in a chair, cuff on the naked left arm at heart height, not moving for a while. What are the possible error sources left? Could I be making the cuff too tight or too loose? I am velcroing it at a width which feels similar to a long-sleeve undershirt.  "

For example, the book Dental Erosion: From Diagnosis to Therapy (edited by Adrian Lussi) mentions link between use of effervescent tablets and tooth erosion.  Could somebody more knowledgeable tell me more about this? Specifically, I want to ask:   Are effervescent tablets really bad for teeth health? Or is it ok assuming I  do not use them too much? Are only some of the effervescent tablets on the market problematic? If yes, how can I choose some which do not cause teeth problems.

984,Do we really need as much calcium as the government recommends?,"The US RDA for calcium for children 9-18 is 1300mg/day, for which milk and dairy seem like the only reasonable source. The vegetable sources of calcium would need to be eaten in impractically large quantities (e.g. 10 pounds of broccoli), and Iâm a little uncertain about the bio-availability of calcium in supplements.  Are bone fractures the only important thing to measure about calcium consumption, or could there be other important factors? Will children not be as tall and strong without that much calcium? Is the US RDA simply wrong?   Certainly, our Paleolithic ancestors werenât drinking milk or taking supplements, yet they seem to have been just as tall and strong as we are, and maybe more so. Could they possibly have been consuming that much calcium?  Because we want them to be tall and strong, we try to have our kids drink 3 cups of milk per day, but I don't like the extra sugar calories in all that milk, and my kids donât like it enough to drink that much without battles.   So should we stop worrying about calcium, or do they really need 1300mg/day? "

990,"Can ""Waterproof Swim Cap"" be good for people with ear infections?","OK, I have an ear infection. The doctor says that I should not allow any water to go into my ears. However, I want to swim, but I don't want any water (even a tiny drop of water) go into my ears.  So, what should I do?  I heard there is a ""Waterproof Swim Cap"" for swimmers? See samples at this site about swimcaps.  But I'm not sure whether it will prevent any tiny drops of water from going into my ears. I doubt that. "
991,"What is excess blood from blood donations used for, and do we ever run out?","I regularly donate blood, however, I am curious as to what happens to my blood after I donate.  Obviously some of it will go to people in emergency medical situations, as I intend.  However, I have never heard of situations where someone died because we didn't have blood to donate to them; which makes it sound as if we don't have a blood deficit.  That in turn makes me wonder what the excess blood is used for.  So I have two related questions.  First, do we ever have a blood deficit, situations where someone who could have been saved in a hospital dies because there wasn't blood to treat them?  Or specifically situations like that caused by a lack of donors, not some logistical issue getting it where it needs to be.  I have had the red cross call me and tell me that they have a 'deficit' many times, but frankly I hear it so often it leaves me questioning their definition of deficit.  How often do we really run out?  Related, if we don't run a deficit then what happens to my excess blood?  I assume that some blood is regularly thrown out, but they figure it's better to have extra and risk it expiring then to run out during an emergency.  However, if we have a high enough surplus do they do something else with it?  For instance is it used for medical research?  If we had say 5% fewer donors would it be our medical research which suffered, but not patients in the hospital?  I will continue donating blood regardless of the answer here.  I'm simply curious as to the result.  Well that and it informs this discussion: [website]"
992,Are platelet donations more needed then whole blood?,"A few months ago I showed up to donate blood and said I was willing to do any type of donation. I ended up getting dragged into donating platelets instead, which I admit I hadn't even realized was an option.  I'm trying to donate platelets more, now that I realize I can do it in between whole blood donations, though I admit I find the whole process far more annoying then whole blood.  However, what I find odd is how I've gotten far more pressure to come back to donate platelets then I ever did donating red blood, and the first time the clearly pushed me to donating platelets over whole blood even when I really didn't know anything about it and just going along to help out however they wanted me to.    This last time I showed up I told them that I thought I was due to donate whole blood, and if so wanted to do whole blood since I didn't have time for platelets, but would donate platelets if I wasn't due for whole blood.  Again they seemed very eager to get me to donate platelets, to the point of seeming really disappointing when I ended up donating whole blood.  It's inconvenient, to say the least, to loose so much time multiple times a month, I'm happy to do it to help, but I'd at least like to have an idea of exactly how much I am helping when I do it.  So, is there a reason they seem so eager to get platelet donations?  Would it do more good to never donate whole blood and only ever do platelets?  Can anyone give me an estimation of how much good a platelet donation does on average (not the best case, but the average case of each donation from a B+ donor)?   edit:  To try to make this easier I finally sat down and tried to answer another question of mine: how many &#39;lives&#39; are saved from one donation of blood?  See my answer to it.  The numbers are not guaranteed by me, I am a layman who doesn't really know much about the medicine behind the statistics I looked up, but it may give an answer some basis for comparison of the two options; IF they assume any of my numbers are right.

995,What causes twitching eyelids? Can anything be done about them?,"Twitching eyelids are common. The medical name for this is blepharospasm:     Eye twitching can come and go unpredictably for a few days, weeks or months. The spasms don't hurt, but they can be annoying. In its most common form, eye twitching is harmless and stops on its own, although it may recur occasionally.    It can occur often throughout the day. The eyelid will rhythmically twitch. It will stop on it's own if nothing is done. Sometimes if it's pinched, it stops.  What causes this, and what can someone do to prevent it?  I've read this could be related to tiredness or stress. Are there other causes? "
996,how many 'lives' are saved from one donation of blood?,"The red cross claims that donating blood can 'save up to three lives'  That seems a highly exaggerated best case scenario.  I'm curious, how many lives are really saved from a unit of blood?  Specifically, what is the odds of one pint of whole blood producing a product which will be used to successfully treat an otherwise fatal injury/illness etc, and that if the donor had not donated that pint a death would have occurred due to lack of sufficient supplies, or being forced to use fewer resources of less computable ones?  What I would love is the ability to do get as nuanced and exact numbers as possible, as part of the motivation of this question is to have the numbers needed to address another question on Skeptics.  If an answer doesn't want to do the exact math pointing me to the resources I need for me to do the math would be fine as well; but I don't even know what products are produced from a whole blood donation much less how to calculate the benefit of any one of those products.  I know that blood type of the donor could play a factor here, but to address the question I'm interested in I'd prefer to know about the 'average' pint of blood, so in essence if all the donor of all the varous blood types in the US donated and you averaged all those various pings of different types together what would the average pint do?  Of course being B+ myself I would be personally curious to know what the B+ blood type does, it would be cool to calculate a 'statistical lives saved' ratio for myself :) "
997,Does rubbing a nettle sting with a dock leaf actually help? How?,"From a young age we were taught that the treatment for a nettle sting was to rub it with a dock leaf. Conveniently, docks usually grow close to where there are nettles.    Does this actually do something to help?  Is the effect entirely/mostly placebotic? How does it work? (and what is the best technique to use) Would washing/rubbing with water be as/more effective?   As an adult if I get stung I have used the same treatment. It does seem to gradually calm the sting but it is difficult to say if the sting would be better without the treatment.  The treatment especially seems to help kids. Looking around for dock leaves is a great distraction. Kids are really happy to be able to help and do something about the problem. I have also heard that getting stung with a nettle is ""lucky"" (think magic fairy type of lucky here - woo!) and also that it gives a boost to the immune system (now that sounds much more scientific!). These two things are another good distraction and comfort to kids especially.   Physical action ?  Does rubbing the sting with juice of dock leaf simple rub away the sting needles? And does the juice dilute the chemicals injected in the sting?  In the summer when the nettles are out and it is common to get stung I have found several times that no water is convenient (even in Ireland) so the best source of something cooling is a crushed dock leaf.   Chemical action ?  I believed nettles had an acid in the sting and that dock leaves had a base. And a simple acid+base=>salt+water neturalising reaction took place to calm the sting.   However, reading a bit more about this shows up different and sometimes contradictory information. It is hard to determine what are actual facts. What chemicals are involved depend on what article you are reading!   I think the facts on nettle sting are: Stinging nettles have sharp needles of silica(glass). There is a mix of chemicals which are injected by the needles. From wikipedia : several chemicals: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT (serotonin), moroidin, leukotrienes, and possibly formic acid.   Stinging Nettle: [website]Doc leaves are related to sorrel (and related to rhubarb). The leaves contain oxalic acid and tannins. It is also said they contains an antihistamine.

1002,Ice pack/cold piece of metal contoured to skull/forehead,There are ice packs people put on their forehead when they get hit on the head or have a fever.   I thought- perhaps I could have the ice pack molded to the shape of my skull/forehead. It would cover alot more surface area. Also trying to find something that pinches/clamps gently to my temples which seem to get warm the fastest that can cool my temples off.   There are things like elastogel which does this sort of but are not nearly as cold as an ice pack or a piece of metal that has been in the freezer for a day.

1004,DRI: All actually daily?,"I wonder if all nutrients are required ""daily"" in their DRI values. What is the period of each nutrient such that my body performs its function correctly in its complete absence for a part of that period.   Examples:   If water not taken for 2 hours, its probably very minor effect, as long as its drunk every 6 hours (for digestive processes to proceed normally) My doctor asked me to take one Vitamin-D supplement (cholecalciferol) every 10 days, so I'm assuming Vitamin-D requirement is not daily.   Similarly, what are the absorption limits so that if someone tries to cheat by not taking a nutrient for a few days and then trying to make up for it every so often? I eat about    250g Tomatoes (40% of Vit-A DRI) every day  500g carrots(16 times DRI) once a week  Assuming Vitamin-A requirements are weekly, does this mean that I'm getting about 2.68 times of it? OR (the more likely scenario) that some of the carrot vitamin-A is not being absorbed and I'm just managing?   I'd appreciate including source in your answers or just pointing me to any material that would help me understand this in depth. What I'm ultimately interested in is finding the ""time period"" of each nutrient.   I can try to explain more if this is not clear, please leave comments before downvoting.  "
1005,Is it possible to acquire/activate subtle physical traits of different races through fluid exchange?,"I'm male and have always dated different races than my own (Asian). I've noticed that when I started dating a blonde Irish girl, I suddenly developed some blonde facial hair (let's say one in 7 strands of hair, so it's quite noticeable). Keep in mind that up until this point, I (obviously) have only had dark black facial hair on my chin. Is this normal? How does one suddenly grow blonde facial hair? As far as I'm aware, my lineage is pretty exclusively Asian.   Also, I've been dating this African American girl, and I've noticed that since swapping body fluids (won't go into more details unless necessary), my body's smell has drastically changed (my armpit suddenly smells a little like her lady parts, which is also a distinct smell). It's quite noticeable because of the sudden change in odor. I haven't changed anything about my diet nor other things that would really impact my chemical balance. How is this even possible?   Again, it's not like I go out and modify any noticeably different behaviors in my normal life. But I have noticed the very coincidental correlations that happen when dating.  So, can one acquire other people's chemical traits by swapping fluids somehow?  Or is it like... somehow I'm activating certain traits that I always had dormant? "
1006,What is the optimal weight within the BMI range?,"BMI is a commonly used measure to determine whether or not a person is at a healthy weight. A person is said to be overweight if they are above 25 and underweight if below 18.5. This question asks what the scientific basis is for BMI ranges, but does not question the difference between the values within that range.  Between the upper and lower ""healthy"" limits is a rather large range of weights. Anecdotally, when I am at a BMI of 25 I still look and feel rather overweight (flabby, bulging belly, etc.). I've only ever been as low as around 21 or 22 BMI, at which point I am rather slim, and at the weight I'd need to be to achieve 18.5 I imagine I would be very skinny, too slender by my personal standards.  Is it really the case that someone at a BMI of 18.5 would be equally as healthy as someone at 21.75 (the midpoint) or 25? By healthy I mean equivalent risk of long term illnesses, early death, etc. (assuming other health-related factors to be the same).  If not, then is there a more accurate way to determine an optimally healthy weight (as opposed to merely a range of healthy weights)? Having been unable to find any information on this point, my target weight is a BMI of 21.75, but I would like to fine tune this if possible. "
1007,Why is FMT an effective treatment for Clostridium difficile?,"I have a relative who has gone through a few different courses of antibiotics to combat a Clostridium difficile infection, with limited success. As I understand it, the initial antibiotic course for an unrelated infection wiped out normal biota and allowed the C. difficile to get established.  However, what I'm not understanding is how fecal transplant can be effective? The C. difficile is already established, is the biota being transplanted enough to be able to suppress/supplant the already established infection? "
1008,Why does the flu only happen in winter?,"I can understand that our immune system may be weaker when we are cold (?), but since these viruses live inside a human body which internal temperature is constant over the year, why does the season make a difference?  Moreover, we are never sick from the flu in summer, like it does not exist, yet the viruses reappear as soon as the cold season is back. If nobody was sick before winter, where are the viruses coming from?  Do people with a constantly weakened immune system (e.g. AIDS) catch flu in summer too ? "
1009,Current Theories on Ice vs. Heat for injuries,"So I will preface this by saying I've heard a couple of things that I will list out for legibility:   ""Ice should be used for Acute injuries and Heat for Chronic injuries"" ""Ice restricts blood flow therefore slows healing while Heat enhances blood flow and immune response.""   For the sake of argument lets say an Acute Injury is defined by the following:   Sharp well-defined pain upon using or pressing area Constantly present Possible bleeding/bruising Occurred within the past week   Lets also say a Chronic Injury is defined as:   Dull pain upon using or pressing area that becomes sharp with prolonged agitation Lasting longer than a week Comes and goes depending on activity No bleeding/bruising present   Looking at such cases what has research shown is the most effective way of tackling such injuries? I would guess that they are treated differently seeing as they are considered different types of injury.   If two patients sprained their left ankle in the exact same manner I imagine the one who sprained his yesterday will be treated differently than the one still experiencing problems from a month old sprain.  Since this is something that does cover a broad spectrum of issues I will coalesce it into four relatively specific questions of what I am looking for.  Are there studies/data showing that:   Heat improves healing response for injuries, while Cold reduces it. Icing acute injuries gives better outcome than heating or doing nothing at all. Heating chronic injuries gives better outcome than icing or doing nothing at all. The RICE method is truly effective.   For simplicity sake consider the question of this post to be: ""Are there any conventional theories/study/data that prove whether Ice or Heat is better for injury treatment?""  EDIT: For clarity I should note I am not asking if pain is reduced but the underlying issue causing the pain. I am looking for studies/data showing what is the best treatment for enabling recovery. "
1010,Are there any long term health risks for a woman (and/or her children) when using hormonal birth control?,"Research seems to indicate that contraceptives which contain only progestin are generally considered safe for women even when taken daily as pills for several years.  But my wife conceived while taking the pill (maybe because she forgot one day) and later had a miscarriage. At that point she stopped taking the pill and several months later she concieved again and gave birth to a healthy baby (although during the pregnancy some doctors were worried that the fetus growth was not sufficient).  Now that the baby is born, she is reluctant to go back on the pill. She thinks there are healthy risks/side effects for her, the newborn and any future children we may have.  Are these fears warranted? In other words are there any significant and provable risks to a woman, her womb and/or her breastfed infant in using hormone based contraceptives? "

1013,Can a colloid intravascular volume expander be used in chronic orthostatic hypotension?,"For conditions such as POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) which are unable to regulate appropriate blood pressure / HR on postural changes, they are treated with volume expansion - like an effective chronic hypovolemia - even though technically they are euvolemic.  Various treatments for these conditions include salt tablets and water intake, or regular home IV saline infusions.  These have to be done regularly, however, or healthy kidneys will eliminate the excess fluid.  Wouldn't a colloidal volume expander like Gelofusine or Albumin last longer, by maintaining the oncotic pressure?  I recognize that unfortunately, it seems to be hard to get, as wikipedia explains in the article on albumin:     For patients with low blood volume, there is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as normal saline, or that albumin reduces mortality in patients with burns and low albumin levels. Therefore, the Cochrane Collaboration recommends that it not be used, except in clinical trials.   However, this research all seems to be about treating acute hypovolemia, such as in cases of blood loss or severe dehydration. In those cases, saline works just as well while being less expensive.  But for EDS patients, the problem isn't low blood volume, but inability to regulate that volume. Saline boosts the quantity of fluid while decreasing oncotic pressure, which is ultimately self-defeating. Maintaining oncotic pressure would, in theory, be ideal.  Perhaps we could find a colloid that the kidneys will not eliminate rapidly.  Can blood volume be chronically increased effectively with colloid volume expanders? "
1014,Management of nail biting,"Nail biting is very common, being the most common of the typical ""nervous habits.""

1015,Why does the temporalis muscle tighten when we are under prolonged stress?,"I understood that there are a few muscles in the body that get tensed up when we are under psychological stress. I am curious and confused why would certain muscles tense up. Why does my body react to stress by making them tense? What advantage does the body assume in doing that, even if the threat is purely psychological and not physical?

1016,Why doesn't the human body lower sebum production in patients with chronic acne?,"Background  Nodular acne is a condition where sebum plugs usually cause bumps on, and inflammation of, the skin, before the sebum emerges or can be extracted with a comedo extractor. Occasioanlly, this happens without inflammation.  Treatment  Per a dermatologist I spoke with, topical retinoids open pores to help expel the trapped sebum, but only oral treinoin (E.g. accutane) can dwindle sebum production.

1021,Burning calories in bath,"If we are to believe this study ([website]Thermodynamically I would expect the opposite, cold might slightly increase calorie burn as the body expends energy in order to maintain its temperature.

As far as I know however, there is no important 'heat to work' engine in the human metabolism (see [website]I don't want a hot debate and I will agree with whatever the powers that be on this StackExchange decide (I am grateful that people spend time moderating here), but I think I should at least say that clearly the issue of burning extra calories is a health issue. The majority of westerners would greatly increase their health and life expectancy if they could manage to burn more calories a day. The next issue might be that I'm not asking about a treatment but about why a treatment might work. Well if you are not allowed to ask why a treatment works because you believe these are biology questions then there is not much point to asking about the treatment itself either. Without asking asking why you can't judge the credibility of a treatment.  So I think the question is on topic. Indeed the on topic page seems to agree with me ([website]  Environmental or nutritional factors that affect health   are on topic. "

1033,"Do sensibility to hot, cold, sweet, acid foods/drinks or air mean different levels of tooth decay?","Usually a dentist would ask you if you're sensible to cold, hot, sweet or acid foods or drinks. The dentist may even expose the suspect tooth to compresed air, but what cues do this information give? for example: does sensibility to sweet mean a deeper cavity than to cold ? does any of them mean infection ?   Which is worst or do they all mean the same ?  Edit:  For any sensibility to happen the emanel must let the substance pass throught the dentin. What I belive is that: hot or cold change the temperature of dentin which in turn change the presure around the nerve, but doesn't necesarily need to touch it directly, acid and sweet (that became acid thanks to bacteria) get to the nerve by the pores of dentin, while air needs a direct road to the nerve, thus making it the worst sign.

1067,Assessing protein bars with artificial sweeteners for diabetics type 2,"In case of diabetes type 2, I have learned that it is recommended to find a low carb diet, possibly even low fat (to ease loss of weight) and to compensate instead with whole grain food, high amounts of proteins and fibers.   Particularly for the last 2 elements, I have found that there exist protein bars that are quite rich in both fibers and protein, while having minimal carbs/sugar. But these tend to be processed food and contain alternative sweeteners such as, isomalto-oligosaccharide, stevlol glycosides, sucralose, to name a few. One such protein bar, denoted to be purely vegan, has the following nutrition table:    From my understanding, this would not be a bad snack for someone with diabetes (high on fiber and low carb per bar &lt; 5g), and it may actually also be quite filling (most of the calories stemming from the soy-protein ingredient).    But considering the point mentioned above about these bars, are they generally to be avoided for diabetics?    Please note, this table is merely an example, my main attempt with this question is to learn how to think about deciding adding such snacks to the diet in the case of diabetes type 2. Namely, is the low carb and high fiber aspects enough to assume them safe to consume, or are there more intricate complications to consider?

I have read, that even a slight increase in Co2 to about 1000 ppm (which can be found indoors quite often) can result in 15% reduced brain performance.  I wonder, what is the bottom level of CO2, below which the body starts to perform worse, instead of better?  Before the industrial revolution, the CO2 level was half of what it is now. Does this increase already have a detrimental health effect?  If we could choose the optimal CO2 level for maximum brain performance, what would it be?

1069,Is tinnitus caused by brain damage?,"This question was asked in Psychology.SE with no answer so I thought I would try here.       It is well known that loud noises can lead to hearing problems such as temporary hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and even permanent hearing loss. But this is the first time scientists have been able to identify damages to nerve cells as a result of noise exposure.      The research allows us to understand the pathway from exposure to loud noises to hearing loss. Dissecting the cellular mechanisms underlying this condition is likely to bring a very significant healthcare benefit to a wider population. The work will help prevention as well as progression into finding appropriate cures for hearing loss"", said the lead researcher Dr. Martine Hamann, from the University of Leicester in the UK. (Hear-it.org, 2014)   Listening to tailor-made notched sound or notched music reduces tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related auditory cortex activity (Okamoto, et al., 2010)     Abstract   Maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization may contribute to the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. Because cortical organization can be modified by behavioral training, we attempted to reduce tinnitus loudness by exposing chronic tinnitus patients to self-chosen, enjoyable music, which was modified (ânotchedâ) to contain no energy in the frequency range surrounding the individual tinnitus frequency. After 12 months of regular listening, the target patient group (n = 8) showed significantly reduced subjective tinnitus loudness and concomitantly exhibited reduced evoked activity in auditory cortex areas corresponding to the tinnitus frequency compared to patients who had received an analogous placebo notched music treatment (n = 8). These findings indicate that tinnitus loudness can be significantly diminished by an enjoyable, low-cost, custom-tailored notched music treatment, potentially via reversing maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization.   (Image Source: Notched Music Therapy App for Android)  The hear-it.org website at the paged linked above says:     Loud music played on earphones causes hearing loss by having a similar effect on nerves as multiple sclerosis, research finds. The research shows that noise levels above 110 decibels strip insulation from nerve fibers carrying signals from the ear to the brain. Loss of the protective coating, called myelin, disrupts electrical nerve signals.   Looking for the source, it seems to be coming from John Von Radowitz's article within The Independent newspaper (2012), stating that:     Loud music played on earphones causes deafness by having a similar effect on nerves as multiple sclerosis (MS)   With both articles mentioning Dr. Martine Hamann from the University of Leicester, I found that she was involved with three studies in that year.  The article which seems to be related is Pilati, et al. (2012), which states within the abstract:     Here we investigate mechanisms contributing to excitability changes in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) shortly after exposure to loud sound that produces hearing loss. We show that acoustic overexposure alters synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN in different ways. A reduction in the number of myelinated auditory nerve fibers leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells, which cannot be restored by increasing auditory nerve fiber recruitment. In contrast, a decreased membrane resistance of DCN granule cells (multisensory inputs) leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells that is overcome when additional multisensory fibers are recruited. Furthermore, gain modulation by inhibitory synaptic transmission is disabled in both auditory and multisensory pathways. These cellular mechanisms that contribute to decreased cellular excitability in the central auditory pathway are likely to represent early neurobiological markers of hearing loss and may suggest interventions to delay or stop the development of hyperactivity that has been associated with tinnitus.   The following is also in the article:  Acoustic overexposure (AOE):   induces hearing threshold elevations (shifts of hearing thresholds of 20â30 dB sound pressure level were observed for frequencies above the frequency used during the AOE protocol), decreases fusiform cell excitability, down-regulates auditory nerve (AN) and multi-sensory (MS) synaptic transmission to fusiform cells (FCs) reduces FC maximal firing rate upon AN stimulations decreases the number of myelinated AN fibres in the cochlea reduces FC maximal firing rate upon MS input stimulation and decreases granule cell membrane resistance disables FC gain control by inhibitory synaptic transmission   Auditory Nerve stimulations           AN stimulations (25 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger smaller Excitatory post-synaptic potentials after AOE (blue)). Membrane potential was â70 mV. Histogram summarizes excitatory post-synaptic potential amplitudes measured at similar stimulating voltages in unexposed (25 Â± 4 V, n = 4) and exposed conditions (28 Â± 2 V, n = 6). * P &lt; 0.05,            In unexposed condition (black), AN stimulations (40 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger action potentials in a FC (membrane potential of â60 mV). After AOE (blue), AN stimulations (40â45 V, 0.3 Hz) fail to trigger action potentials.   Multisensory stimulations           MS stimulations (15 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger smaller excitatory post-synaptic potentials after AOE (blue). Membrane potential was â70 mV. Histogram summarizes excitatory post-synaptic potential amplitudes measured at   similar stimulating voltages in unexposed (16 Â± 1 V, n = 8) and exposed conditions (19 Â± 2 V, n = 6). ** P &lt; 0.01: unpaired t tests.            In unexposed condition (black), MS stimulations (20 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger action potentials in a FC (membrane potential of â60 mV). After AOE (blue), higher stimulation voltages (25 V, 0.3 Hz) are required to trigger an action potential.   Not having a background in neurology, I am wondering if altered synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN equates to brain damage or is the altered synaptic transmission caused by information received from the damaged cochlea?  In other words, has it really been found that the cause of Tinnitus is brain damage which can be repaired through playing sounds or music with a ""notch"" in specific frequency spectrums?

Are there concrete standard for the safety of such procedures? Number of deaths, for example, is not enough. A scale of severity of side effects would be more the direction.   Edit:  I hoped for something like the Injury Severity Score but it seems that there isn't. I understand the subjectivity of this question. But is there a way to classify medical procedures in a way so that a man that undergone a gallbladder removal will know that tonsillectomy is easier b/c the recovery is usually shorter + the probability of hematoma is lower etc? Or maybe the side effects vary so much that there is no way to compare procedures which are not very similar(e.g. one in dentistry and on in gastro).  "
1072,Skeletal muscle injury causes hypertrophy or atrophy?,"In the following diagram from Love Bailey textbook I see that injury causes decrease in hypertrophy due to decrease in expression of IGF-1.( Love bailey has taken skeletal muscle model)  But in Robbins and Cotran ( diagram attached) I had learnt - mechanical stretch, and growth factors like IGF-1 cause increase in contractile protein synthesis.( Here Robbins has written for heart muscle as model)  So question is whether injury cause hypertrophy or atrophy? I feel that if injury is beyond repair then atrophy should occur. But is this what love bailey wanted to say or is it different?  Or is it to do with the model cardiac or skeletal? "

1074,Rising allergy and intolerance diagnosis rates,"A leading theory behind the rising allergy and intolerance diagnosis rates is the ""hygiene hypothesis."" This theory suggests that living conditions in much of the world might be too clean and that kids aren't being exposed to germs that train their immune systems to tell the difference between harmless and harmful irritants.  A counter-argument I heard recently on the radio here in the UK (on this BBC Radio 2 programme - section starting from 42min 40secs ) was that you can't say that when in some countries where cholera is high, you cannot safely allow children to play in the mud (from 46min 3secs).  When looking at the rise in food allergies, one area which I have been looking at is the constant changes in what should and shouldn't be eaten during pregnancy.  Expectant mothers are told not to eat nuts, shellfish, dairy products etc. in order to avoid allergy problems in the baby, yet when you look at the great long list of don't eats provided by the NHS, they even point out that there can be conflicting information given regarding peanuts, because     the government previously advised women to avoid eating peanuts if there was a history of allergyÂ â such asÂ asthma,Â eczema,Â hay feverÂ andÂ food allergyÂ â in their child's immediate family.      This advice has now changed because the latest research has shown no clear evidence that eating peanuts during pregnancy affects the chances of your baby developing a peanut allergy.   There are also reports in places such as this parenting site where they say that it is fine to eat high allergy foods if you as an expectant mother are not allergic yourself.  What is the state of play within medical science regarding this?  What is the cause of the rise in allergies and food intolerance?  Is it purely lack of exposure to potential allergens early in life (including during prenatal development)?  Should expectant mothers avoid dairy, nuts, shellfish etc. which others are allergic to ""just in case""? "

Treatment very often starts in rehab and continues with, for example, group therapy. What would the correct term for this department in a US hospital be? Substance Use Disorder Department? I have also read about ""Behavioral Health Departments"", but what we're dealing with here is not strictly psychiatric care ""on its own"". Thank you in advance. "
1077,"Father gets chickenpox, but doesn't infect his two children. How is this possible?","My brother in law got chickenpox, yet somehow he didn't infect my two nephews, even though they are living together. According to wikipedia, varicella has an infection rate of 90%:     Varicella is highly communicable, with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts.   [website]He got varicella over a week ago and the children are completely healthy, even though they have not had the disease yet nor are they vaccinated against it.  How is this possible? Is the infection rate actually lower, than 90%? Is an outcome like this usual or plausible?  edit: they did end up getting sick after all. "
1078,Why aren't fluoride mouthwashes with cetylpyridinium chloride labeled as both anticavity and antibacterial?,"I recall just a few years ago, there was a common misconception that fluoride interferes with the antibacterial activity of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) - in fact, I've often seen instructions on antibacterial CPC rinses specifying that you should thoroughly rinse the toothpaste (which they probably assume contains fluoride) out of your mouth before using them.  Over the last few years, I've also seen a rise in alcohol-free fluoride rinses with some amount of CPC, marketed as anticavity with the ""ADA Accepted"" seal of approval.  However, I found this article recently: [website]Additionally, fluoride and CPC both have different ways of making cariogenic bacteria miserable - for example, CPC breaks bacterial cell membranes ([website]Despite all this information readily available in academic journal articles, I have yet to see a combined fluoride/CPC rinse labeled as both anticavity and antibacterial. For some unknown reason, the cetylpyridinium chloride is labeled as an ""inactive ingredient"". 2 examples: ACT Alcohol-Free Anticavity rinse, cinnamon flavor ([website]Several years ago I recall a Listerine fluoride anticavity rinse that also contained the regular antibacterial Listerine formulation (22% alcohol and antibacterial essential oils), yet the essential oils were listed as inactive.  Why the confusion and misinformation? If a product is both anticavity and antibacterial, it should be listed properly. "
1079,Hitler's physician Morrel prescribed a drug that contained e. coli -- was this unusual in those days?,"It is my understanding that Hitler's physician, T. Morell, who was essentially a ""feel good"" like Max Jacobson (although maybe still acting within accepted practice in the days when powerful drugs were very liberally prescribed or even available otc) was giving Hitler a ""drug"" call Mutaflor that was essentially e. coli extracted from human feces.  Today I think good results are sometimes achieved with fecal transplants and what I am wondering is if there is a relationship between the ideas of the 1930s and today? Was the drug known to modern researchers and maybe even is the reason fecal transplants were eventually undertaken? Or was the drug of the 1930s a misguided therapy, prescribed for invalid reasons and fecal transplants are really quite different?  EDIT: Link to Wikipedia article although even without Hitler and Morell, the drug itself existing is enough to justify the question I think: [website]"
1080,Does a single brain lobe (e.g. parietal lobe) heat more than others during processing tasks that are related to it?,"Of course, our brains are the most powerful, stabilized processors. And they don't go outside of their temperature thresholds under normal / even abnormal(till some threshold) conditions.  I felt like (or just delusion-ed) that an area on my head(top back) heats more than other areas when I work on complex computer programs (algorithms, mathematics, three dimensional thinking etc., lots of -metaphorically- brain burner topic to think about).  I measured it like a caveman (Edit: I'm just measuring the blood flow in the scalp as mentioned in the comment below, looks like useless data), with an infrared hand thermometer and:    Top Front was: 29.1Â°C  Top Back was: 31.5Â°C   I always think that a metaphor shouldn't be totally wrong. If people made this comparison and invented the metaphor, I think we can deduct that it can be partly correct. So, does my parietal lobe heat more or it is just a delusion?  EDIT: I'm a roboticist and totally unfamiliar with the field, asked this question because of curiosity. I've read about parietal lobe functions from wiki and deducted these, the wiki page had references for them there:   knowledge of numbers and their relations (reading arithmetic information from the code?, imagining object manipulations in the simulation?) manipulation of objects, processing information relating to the sense of touch (Maybe related to controlling keyboard?)  visuospatial processing (Thinking in 3D Space?) has a function in hand and eye movements mathematical cognition, probabilistic reasoning [paper]  "
1081,Is there such a thing as a hard heart beat? (as opposed to a fast heart beat),"I've picked up weight lifting recently and the thing I've noticed is that it really gets the heart pumping. After a heavy set of squats for instance I can hear my heart beating in my ears and feel it beating in my chest.  However my heart rate monitor says that, while it's increased, it's not that much faster than normal. My heart rate is far faster while riding a bike, but it doesn't beat as 'hard' then.  Why does it feel like my heart is beating harder in these cases? Why is it different to beating faster like when doing cardio exercises? Would this 'harder' heat beat burn more calories than a normal strength heart beat at the same bpm? "
1082,Where do RDI (recommended daily intake) values come from?,"We are told to follow the RDI for a variety of nutrients. This is repeated over and over by teachers, guides, nutritionists, medical doctors and so on. However, when asked, no one can provide me with the actual source of how they came to this conclusion about RDI.   Who calculated this and using what scientific method exactly? Looks like a shot in the dark to me.   Where can I look at a study that proves that a human eating less than RDI will become deficient (showing clinical symptoms of deficiency of a certain vitamin or mineral)?  "
1083,What is the difference between cal and Kcal?,"When I started working out, I came across these two terms that are used interchangeably.

1084,How does HIV infect people?,"If a person had sex with multiple people and none of them were infected with HIV, would it cause the generation of HIV in his/her body?

But the question is, how is that partner infected?  "
1085,How Consistently Does Alcohol Affect Reaction Times?,"I've always been told that alcohol will reduce reaction times.  There are lots of sources for this online.  For example:     [website]  [website]  [website]And countless others.  It seems pretty solid.    However, anecdotally, I've noticed a trend where my performance in activities that benefit from a low reaction time improve after I've had a few drinks (namely online FPS games).  I decided to investigate further and setup a small experiment.    The Experiment  Every 20 minutes I would record my BAC level using a breathalyzer, take an online reaction time test ([website]For reference, I also consulted an online chart estimating BAC levels ([website]The results I saw are completely contradictory to everything I've ever been told.  Over the span of three hours, my reaction time did not increase.  In fact, it decreased!  Each point in the chart below is 20 minutes apart - and the estimated BAC level from the website.  And the test consisted of 10 measurements (and I dropped the 2 lowest, 2 highest and averaged the remaining).    The difference between ~270ms and ~230ms is pretty significant - according to the data collected by the Human Benchmark site I used in my experiment.  At 270ms, my reaction time is right in the most common range.  But as I drank, I ended up way ahead of the curve.     My question is - how can I explain this result?  Everything I find online says alcohol increases reaction time.  I've read studies and I can't disagree with them.  It seems unlikely that I'm some rare abnormality though....so, what's the deal? "
1086,Blood Donation After Effects,"So I just donated blood sooner today and now, 6 hours later, removed the tissue covering the extraction point. My question is that while discussing the events, I felt some side effects to it.  The short list includes heart burn which subsides as fast as it came, alternating neck and head hot spots and sudden sound dampening.  What effects can the process of donating blood have, to cause these symptoms? Is there something I should have done, but missed to do?  I am guessing it's simply something I should have done that I missed but I don't know what. "
1087,Do antibiotics contribute to bone healing?,"Two weeks ago I broke my tibia in an accident. First I was taken to a hospital near the place where the accident happened, and the doctor gave me two options, either putting a plaster or inserting a rod(which he highly recommended). Due to some reasons, I had to choose the plaster.   The doctor at this first hospital gave me a prescription which contained the following tablets:   Calcium Citrate with Vitamin D3 tablets Levofloxacin tablets (Levosel - 500) Pantoprazole (Pantosel 40) Diclofinac sodium with Paracetamol  Paracetamol   The next day I went to another hospital in my home town, and they suggested removing the plaster to insert the rod. And so it was, I had a surgery to insert the rods.  The doctor at this hospital gave me a prescription which only contained the following tablets that I have been taking:   Pantoprazole tablets(Pavonib-40) Cefixime dicloxacillin and lactic acid bacillus tablets (CEFIWOK XL -200 ) Paracetamol   Although he did not see the medicine given to me in the other hospital when I asked what to do with it, he simply told me to not take any of the tablets prescribed in the first hospital.  Which brings me to my question:  Does calcium and/or vitamin D help in the healing of bone fractures?  Do antibiotics help in the healing of bone fractures? "
1088,Is glucosamine sulfate effective treatment for meniscus injury?,"I hurt my knee by doing squats. The pain persisted for a long time (3 months). When I went to my doctor, he saw my x-rays which indicated that everything was normal, but he suspected a meniscus tear. He asked me to take glucosamine sulfate for a month.   Has glucosamine sulfate been shown to be an effective treatment for torn menisci?    Has this been compared to other treatments such as ice or heat?  "
1089,"""Complete nutrition"" in a crockpot?","I recently embarked on an experiment with a product you may have heard of called ""Soylent"".  The idea appealed to me.  I don't eat as healthy as I should primarily because of the work involved (expense isn't helpful).  I'm a busy young professional and by the time I get home from work, I just don't want to cook.  It's super convenient to pour my dinner from a pitcher that took me 5 minutes or less to prepare the night before and I feel good knowing that I'm getting proper balanced nutrition.  But I just can't do the liquid diet all the time.  It was driving me crazy and I've reverted (mostly) to my old (unhealthy) ways.  It's not that I don't like the taste or anything.  It's actually pretty good after a few days' acclimation.  It's just boring eating (read: ""drinking"") the same thing all day every day and the lack of solid food seems to present a psychological barrier I wasn't expecting.  While munching on a delicious chicken dish, much like a casserole, that was made for me for my birthday recently, I began to wonder if there was a recipe for some sort of crockpot meal that might offer similar benefits, e.g. total balanced nutrition in a simple-and-inexpensive package.  Something I could dump in the crockpot and come home to perfect food in the evening with little to no effort.  Maybe even make up several days' worth in advance.  Unfortunately, my Googling has turned up nothing but ""dieting"" recipes.  ""Less than 299 calories per serving!"" etc.  I'm not interested in ""dieting"" per se.  Just a simple meal that takes little prep for a reasonable price and contains everything a dietician would like to see me eating.  Does anyone know of such a recipe?  Or multiple such recipes?  Thanks in advance! "
1090,Effect of Blood donation needles on skin,"I have donated my blood 3 times now...all three times at different hospitals.  The first time, a very fine needle was used...almost similar to the one usually used in injection or to draw blood for blood tests.   However, subsequently, much broader needles were used...by their looks, they seemed nearly twice as broad as the earlier needle. It also caused more pain than the first time. I guess they use the broader needle to draw blood more quickly.  However, I have noticed another phenomena...the subsequent blood donations have left a depression-type scar mark on my skin.  So I have the following questions:   Am I right in concluding that a broader needle would have been used to draw blood quickly? Are the needles used to draw blood replaceable? Can I ask the nurses drawing my blood to replace the broad needle with a finer one? (I asked the nurse if it was possible and he said that as far as he knew, only broader needles came for blood donation.) If the needles are indeed replaceable, then what are they called? How should I refer to them for the nurse to be able to understand me correctly.   This information would help me donate blood relatively painlessly next time.  Thank you.    P.S.: I am not a medical profession (or even a medical student for that matter). So please pardon my complete layman-like language here. "
1091,Amisulpride and elevated prolactin levels,"Amisulpride has a half life of 12 hours, according to some articles.   Amisulpride often causes an elevation in prolactin levels, which can be chronic with long term use.  This causes endocrine system dysregulation including testosterone suppression and other deleterious effects (especially in men).  How long after terminating Amisulpride therapy will prolactin levels normalize?  Will the dysregulation resolve immediately upon levels returning to normal, or does that take time? "
1092,Can I take nootropics if I was on seizure medication 5+ years ago?,"So as a college student, we need to perform mentally demanding work and I recently found out about ""all natural"" pills that can increase focus and alertness. So I decided I am going to try them to see how they work. I tried another nootropic brand (Optimind) and did not feel like it was working after trying it 4 times. However, the bottle of 60 pills I received for a different brand said:     Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures.   I have been completely off my seizure medication for over 5 years now. Do I still fit into this category of having a ""history of seizures"" or does this no longer apply to me?

Is there any other issue?  I am asking for three reasons:   curiosity some ice patches tend to get pretty warm after 20 minutes, and doesn't seem to pose a risk of frosbites. patients sometime exercise right before sleeping, and may fall asleep during icing. Empirically, it didn't create the frostbite, so I wonder if it's okay.  "

1098,Do all very old people have heart failure?,"A 95 year old will probably not be able to do hard exercise, such as running fast for one hour per day. The heart of such a person won't have the capacity to pump the required amount of blood through its body. However, most 95 year olds won't visit the doctor complaining about not being as fit as they where at the age of 25, any complaints about feeling tired, lack of energy etc. will typically be considered to be normal for the age.  But one can ask if in fact the aging of the heart is equivalent to having (mild) heart failure. Suppose that when I'm 95 years old I disguise myself, making myself look 25 years old. I then visit some doctor complaining about not being able to exercise at a reasonable intensity. If all sorts of tests are done, would I be diagnosed with heart failure? And would treatment for heart failure for healthy 95 year olds allow them to exercise at an intensity that is much higher than what could be considered to be normal for that age? "
1099,Why is lateral epicondylitis 5 times more common than medial epicondylitis?,"[website]  Incidence and Prevalence: Lateral epicondylitis is at least 5 times more common than medial epicondylitis (Mercier). The exact incidence of lateral epicondylitis is difficult to determine, although among the US population it is estimated at 1% to 3% annually (Bryant; Verhaar). Medial epicondylitis accounts for only about 10% to 20% of all epicondylitis (Young). Approximately 15% of patients experience bilateral symptoms.   [website]  Epicondylitis is much more common on the lateral side of the elbow (tennis elbow), rather than the medial side   Why is lateral epicondylitis 5 times more common than medial epicondylitis?

In this study, the overall prevalence of lateral and medial epicondylitis was 2.5 % and 0.3 %, respectively, which are comparable with previous epidemiologic studies conducted in the general population.     I wonder whether it is due to human activities or some intrinsic differences between lateral and medial epicondyles. "

Stockholm-Syndrome?,"I was listening to the hit true-crime podcast, ""My Favorite Murder,"" (don't judge it by it's name until you listen to it -- it's not what you think), and one of the cases they discussed was about Gypsy Rose Blanchard and her mother, Dee Dee (episode 47). You can read the details of the case here, but basically Gypsy Rose's mother had Munchausen by Proxy (MSBP), which means she feigned the illness of her child (by deliberately harming her) in order to receive attention, funds, etc. from the community. In Gypsy Rose's case, her mother made her sick and claimed she had leukemia and had to eat through a tube for more than a decade until finally Gypsy Rose was able to murder her abuser, her mother.   Anyway, my question is this: Are victims of Munchausen by Proxy likely to violently react to their abuser or will they develop a codependepent relationship (akin to Stockholm syndrome)? How common is Gypsy Rose's reaction to her abuser?    "

Decision basis for which genitalia to keep?,"According to research by Organization Intersex International, hermaphrodites (born with both male and female genitalia) ""make up 1 in 2000, or .05%."" Babies born as hermaphrodites happen more than the general public realizes or history acknowledges... so I seek for a better medical understanding of these individuals.   What typically happens to these babies?    Is a surgery necessary for all hermaphrodites? Like is it physically possible for them to live full-lives with both genitalia?   Do the doctors or the parents decide what sex the child will be? If so, on what basis is the gender/sex of the baby determined prior to the surgery removing the ""extra"" genitalia? Do they base it off of which genitalia is more developed? At what age of the infant do they perform these surgeries? Are the transgender and bisexual  (LGBTQ) rates of those born as hermaphrodites the same/lower/more than others born with one set of genitalia? Are the surgeries reversible? Like if a person later on felt like the doctors/parents chose a gender that they don't identify with...    My questions are sincere and I apologize for my ignorance concerning hermaphrodites (which is why I try to seek answers) or if I lack the skills to phrase my questions in a proper manner. I know each person is different and complex, I am just wondering about what generally happens and the impact it has on their future. I apologize if I may offend anyone with my questions.

1113,Whatever happened to Tonsillitis?,"70 or so years ago, kids all got their tonsils out. I have a family member who, when perfectly healthy, had them out (75 or more years ago) because his twin was having his out, and it would be too hard on his mother to have only one twin in the hospital, and she would likely have to go through that again eventually, so get it over with. I have another who had them out about 55 years ago because ""I got sick all the time.""  Yet nobody under 40 (who I know, in North America) has stories like these about themselves or their children. Infants these days get ear infections, which generally clear up before school age one way or another. Some get tubes. But these tales of 4-10 year olds getting their tonsils out and getting to eat ice cream (in various picture books I own) just don't seem to match present-day reality.  Why? Do tonsils not get infected any more? Have doctors decided removing them is a bad strategy?  "

1122,Food Packaging Labels' Ingredient Statement Required To List Allergens?,"I discovered recently I am allergic to soy and have been looking at the labels on many foods I eat to discover it's in almost all the foods I eat.  Some don't seem to make any sense - like raw walnuts containing soy, according to the ingredients.  What should I be aware of on the labels outside of direct warnings?  I'm worried that a product may contain soy without warning of it, like:     Manufactured on equipment that processes peanut, other tree nuts.   Is a product that possibly contains soy required to make this clear? "
1123,Hospital says their blood test caused sepsis. How serious is this?,"My wife went to an Ontario (Canada) public hospital and they performed a blood test, among other things. The test revealed a presence of bacteria in the blood. They said they will send it for analysis to determine the exact bacteria, which may take up to 48 hours.   Somebody from the hospital called a day or so later and said that there's no need to worry, the bacteria should be all gone, and it was most likely introduced into the blood stream (and the sample) during the actual blood test. They said there's no need for follow-up tests. They mentioned that the needle was sterile, but the bacteria was probably on her skin. Is this normal? I thought that with proper procedures your risk of infection should be essentially zero. How effective is the sterilizing wipe that is used before inserting the needle?  I'm asking whether what happened (ie blood contaminated during a blood test) is a fairly normal occurrence or if it indicates non-trivial issues with the hospital staff's procedures that should be brought to someone's attention. In other words, something like ""Yeah, this happens sometimes, it's not a big deal"" vs ""Uh.. you should really notify your local health authority ASAP, there's a clear health hazard for other patients"". "
1124,Options after exposure to ABS fumes,"Let's assume someone has an increased risk for leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, and maybe even brain cancer because of fumes from ABS material that they have inhaled.  What can they do once they are aware of their risk?   So a few questions:   What lifestyle changes can they make, if any, to help lower the risk of those cancers? What tests can they ask their doctor to do on a regular basis to help catch those cancers early? Catching cancer early is key to survival of course.   What sort of timeline would they be looking at for developing those cancers? 10 years? 20 years? or even 5 years? Any symptoms they should be on the lookout for? Any other possible cancers that they should consider at risk for? Any other advice?  "

And they said, one can make a li'l cut around the wound and set it on fire as an immediate action to get more time to reach some medical aid. Now, there are some cases where people have done this and they are still alive(could be their luck as well)  My question is, what could be the health concerns with such a method? And is it of any worth at all?  Please, keep your answers based on medical theory or some real life cases. Thank you. "
1127,Does free sugar intake before meals cause more adverse effects than after them?,"The WHO gives sugar intake recommendations in terms of percentage of energy intake. That, combined with some popular wisdom makes the think that it isn't the same if I eat, say a chocolate bar, before or after lunch.  From what I understand, the major problem with free sugars is that they cause an insoline production spike that our body is not quite prepared to deal with in the long run. If I were to eat some not so unhealty food (such as a regular meal), the insuline levels would rise at a normal pace until the free sugar intake and would drop less after the sugar processing, because there would still be the rest of the meal to digest, effectively reducing the insuline spike.  So, it is worse to consume free sugars before a meal than after? If so, how much worse is it? For the same ammount of adverse effects, can I ingest more free sugars after a regular meal than after a small one?  NOTE: please consider as meals something a nutricionist would recommend to an average, healthy adult person, a ""regular meal"" being the lunch, and the small meal the mid-morning break. "

1130,Anabolic Effects of Beta-Ecdysterone,"Should one expect similar gains in muscle mass from supplementing beta-ecdysteroid to anabolic steroids like Nerobol or Methylandrostenediol? From the research I have done so far it is clear that beta-ecdysteroid has anabolic properties (e.g. this article), but how does the scale of muscle mass gain compare? This study would seem to show very similar effects on mass gain, but I cant' seem to find a straight and direct answer to this question.   "
1131,Is There Any Point In Getting Lab Tests Done If I Can't Find a Primary Care Physician?,"I've been seeing a therapist for depression and I've been requested to get a physical done so I can have my vitamin D, testosterone levels and thyroid checked. Unfortunately I live in a rural area where there are not nearly enough doctors and I have exhausted all efforts to try to find a primary care physician to establish myself with. It's gotten so bad our local insurance provider has stopped fielding phone calls asking for support finding a primary care physician.  It's been suggested to me by several offices to get the tests done that I need at our local Urgent Care center, which I can do, but... what happens if they find something that needs treatment? I do not have a doctor. What would possibly be my next step in that situation? "

1133,How much T4 increase do you get per mcg of levothyroxine?,"A normal starting dose of levothyroxine is 50 mcg per day. According to ATA, absorption is 60-80%. Let's assume 70% and let's assume 5 L of blood in the average human being.  50 mcg * 0.7 / 5.0 = 7 mcg/L 7 mcg/L = 7000 ng/L   According to this tool, 7000 ng/L of thyroxine is 9000 pmol/L. Free T4 is usually 0.03% of total T4 so I'd at first expect the dose to contribute 9000 * 0.03 = 270 pmol/L of free T4.  But a normal human range of free T4 is 10-24 pmol/L. Clearly I've made a mistake somewhere since the dose seems to be an order of magnitude too large.  What's the correct calculation? What is the expected average T4 increase when taking 50 mcg of levothyroxine? "

I was wondering if getting a more ergonomic chair that promotes better posture will help with my sleep apnea at night? I'm pretty sure a lot of my breathing problems are because my chin tilts forward against my chest and blocks my airway. Can a more ergonomic chair help sleep apnea?  
1136,Why is it so much harder to swallow pills than it is to swallow food?,"I don't have any real trouble swallowing pills, and I do it several times a day.  But when I try to swallow a pill without food or water in my mouth, it is a bit tricky.  We're not talking about huge horse pills either, just regular, relatively small pills.  I can swallow a whole raw oyster, which is the size of hundreds of pills combined, but a single little capsule or tablet is too much for me to consume without food or water?    It feels like I am struggling to convince my tongue and throat to cooperate with me, and they don't trust my judgment in choosing what I should and shouldn't swallow.  What is going on here?  Is there some sort of physiological explanation for this?  Note:  I am fully aware that my tongue and throat don't have minds of their own, and are incapable of trusting or mistrusting me.  I am merely trying to explain what it feels like. "
1137,Should I use salt supplements if my sweat is bland?,"Normally my sweat tastes salty.  But in hot weather it often gets bland.  I notice that when that happens I don't seem to retain water: I'll drink to the point that my urine is frequent and clear, but I'll still be thirsty.  And my perspiration rate will go up noticeably: I'll be dripping with sweat when I'm just a little hot, where in the same conditions with salty sweat my perspiration rate will be more measured.  I have long resorted to basically using the absence of salty sweat as a sign to supplement my salt intake, either by over-salting my food, eating salty snacks, or taking electrolyte pills.  I don't have a low-salt diet, and I don't work or exercise outside to the degree that many people do.  I'm in good shape and no blood or urine analysis has ever uncovered anything abnormal.  But I remember some time ago hearing that salt supplements were considered obsolete.  And nobody I know with more aggressive exercise routines supplements their salt intake.  In fact they all think the idea sounds ridiculous.  So am I misreading the signs of electrolyte imbalance?  Or am I responding incorrectly?  Could I have an above-average electrolyte ""metabolism"" or demand? "
1138,"For more exotic fruits, need you buy organic or not?","Hereafter, for brevity, define 'regular' to mean NON-organic fruits. The collective noun 'exotic fruits' refers to  fruits excluded or neglected, in lists advising which to buy organic or not (eg Environmental Working Group's List of the 'Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen', Washington Post, goodhousekeeping.com, WebMD).   Should only organic 'exotic fruits' be bought? If organic variants are not available, should I just skip the regular?   For example, my local supermarkets sell only regular dragonfruit, guava, mango, and pineapple. However, these exotic fruits originate from countries with more dubious environmental or safety standards, or  without any norms or oversight whatsoever.  "

1141,Does iron poisoning stay in your body?,"Two years back a good friend of mine got in an accident where a nail got stuck in her waist. It was removed from her body, but after two weeks she got iron poisoning and fell into a coma for a week. Last week she again fainted. Doctors say it might be iron poisoning. Can iron poisoning return? Was it still in her body? She wasn't on any supplements or medication, so I'm not sure what could have caused this. Though it might be iron overload (hemochromatosis) from what her symptoms show.  "
1142,What is the mechanism of heartburn?,"My father recently forwarded me a factoid saying:     most of us believe that heartburn is caused by excess production of gastric acid. In fact, in most cases it is caused by improper functioning of the stomach muscles, which increases the pressure within the stomach. This is why antacids create a very short-lived relieve, while taking herbs which soothe the stomach muscles are a permanent solution to the problem.    To me, this sounds like bad advertising copy. But before I dismiss it completely, could they be partially or even completely right? What causes heartburn, is it acid overproduction, musculature problems, or something else? "

I go to an immunologist, and he prescribes me a SAStid bar for my eczema skin. He says that it will strip out all of my skin flakes.      It works. However my skin is very dry afterward.

I'm looking for exercise guidelines while being on both a total fast (water only) and a fasting-mimicking diet  Fasting-mimicking diet:      day one of the diet, they would eat 1,090 calories: 10 percent protein, 56 percent fat and 34 percent carbohydrates. For days two through five, 725 calories: 9 percent protein, 44 percent fat, 47 percent carbohydrates.   EDIT: there are some concerns raised about my particular biometrics, so I've posted it in my profile.   The reason I'm asking this question is not because I want to rapidly lose weight, as I already believe I'm at a healthy weight. In a nut shell, I've seen articles indicating that fasting can have a positive effect on the body (detox, etc.. ). The articles did not touch on activity while fasting, I was wondering if there were any studies that did.  "
1151,Should we rinse with water after brushing our teeth?,"I've heard that rinsing with water after teeth brushing lowers or negates the benefits that fluoride provides to our teeth, but I've also heard everything in between; from there's no problem with it, to rinse with as little water as possible, to mix water with toothpaste and rinse with it.  Example from [website]  So, should you rinse your mouth out with water when you have finished brushing or leave some toothpaste in your mouth? ""For children, I would say wash out, because if they still have adult teeth that have yet to come through, they may end up with too much fluoride in their body, which can damage their teeth. For adults, it's good to leave a film, but in moderation â you don't want a mouthful of toothpaste. I have a semi-rinse: I put a tiny bit of water in my mouth to brush away the toothpaste on my tongue.""   and from [website]  I know this this is not common practice, but it is actually quite important! Fluoride, one of the active ingredients in toothpaste, doesn't spend much time in contact when your teeth when you are brushing. Thus, it is crucial to let it work after you have already brushed your teeth. According to dentist Dr. Phil Stemmer, from The Fresh Breath Centre in London, ""Rinsing washes away the protective flouride coating left by the toothpaste, which would otherwise add hours of protection."" If you are thirsty drink a glass of water before brushing your teeth!   In contrast, this article quotes [website]  Previous studies have indicated that rinsing the mouth with a beaker of water after toothbrushing may compromise the caries reducing effect of fluoride toothpaste. It is concluded that post-brushing rinsing with water, under the conditions of this study, does not significantly affect the caries reducing effect of a fluoride toothpaste.   and     I think the reason that there is some disagreement on this subject is because not rinsing after brushing appears to be only beneficial if you are at a high risk of getting cavities.   And as two commenters said below, not rinsing feels kind of counter intuitive, but seems to be the way to go. Is it?   Assuming normal and healthy teeth, what's actually better? Which one carries the most benefits? Should we rinse with water or not? Are there studies about this? Is there a consensus yet? "

1153,Do anti-inflammatory painkillers speed up healing?,"With a recent case of whiplash as a result of being on the receiving end of a car accident, I'm now wondering whether taking ibuprofen 4-7 times a week will help me heal quicker/more completely?  After the incident I took ibuprofen every day for about a week because the pain was intense, and since then less regularly when I've felt stiffness or pain. Now I'm quite comfortable most of the time but still find that I have limited range of motion, pain when I need to blow my nose a lot (thanks to hayfever).  My intuition tells me taking the painkillers speed up healing and ensure a fuller recovery. On the other hand I wonder if decreasing pain might cause further damage because the decreased pain will make me less careful in my activities so that I might re-injure it. I don't want to be on painkillers for weeks if there is little benefit to it.   My question is this:  Do non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do anything for actual tissue healing? I understand that they decrease pain, but are there any studies that show that they do anything more than decrease pain? "

1158,Are there behavioral causes for myopia?,"As an adult, I second guess all of my parents' advice, seeing that most of it was ridiculous, but some of them just might have been true. A large swath of it was connected to eyesight: ""Don't watch too much TV or read too many books, you'll ruin your eyes"", ""Don't watch TV without a lamp on, you'll ruin your eyes"", ""Don't read lying down on your side"", ""Don't read books in the morning before you've had at least something to drink, better yet breakfast"", ""Don't hold the book too close or too far"", ""Don't wear sunglasses indoors"", and probably others I don't remember any more.   They were never specific about what ""you'll ruin your eyes"" means, but as far as I know, the most usual vision problem in young people is myopia. But myopia's ""works"" through an anatomical mechanism, by having an eyeball of the wrong length, and I have no idea if any of these behaviors, or another one they failed to specify, can cause the eyeball to grow wrong.   Are there any known behaviors which cause or at least predispose for becoming myopic? Are any of the behaviors listed above connected to poor eyesight? Is it possible to reduce one's chances of becoming myopic by lifestyle and behavior change? If it is possible, does it only work before the process starts, or does it also slow down the progress of already existing myopia?  "
1159,Up to what temperature can you work without damaging yourself?,"Currently here in the Netherlands we're having quite warm weather, I work in a greenhouse in which temperature's rise quite fast. I had to work in 40 degrees Celcius (104 Fahrenheit) last weekend. Upcoming weekend this might get up 47 degrees or 117 Fahrenheit, what I was wondering is how long can/may I work and do I damage myself if I work a full 8 hours?  My work consists of helping customers find things, refilling plants, watering plants and moving trees/heaving things (around 20kg/44 lbs) for a full 8 hours.  If it's not too busy at our greenhouse shop I can usually take a 15 minute break around 3:00PM and that's all I get for the day which is enough although I wonder if I should take precautions to make sure my body stays healthy.  So basically I'm interested in  how long can a human being work in a store where it is 47 degrees C? I can understand that this is quite a broad question but I'm looking for a general answer and what precautions I can take. Would there be any side effects? "
1160,Can regular immersion in cold water cause loss of hearing?,"I recently found this from Wikipedia:      The cause of Beethoven's deafness is unknown, but it has variously been attributed to typhus, auto-immune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), and even his habit of immersing his head in cold water to stay awake. The explanation from Beethoven's autopsy was that he had a ""distended inner ear"", which developed lesions over time.   As someone who indulges in cold showers myself on a regular basis, I was slightly taken aback by the possibility that his loss of hearing may have been induced by 'his habit of immersing his head in cold water to stay awake' - could this really be a cause of loss of hearing? If so, how does that work exactly?  "

Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw neta.   By the bye, I don't know Wikipedia correctly used ""grilled"".  These restaurants just blow-torch the top of the nigiri.

1165,Boiling vegetables for an hour and retention of their nutrients,"I boil broccoli, eggplants, courgette/zucchini and okra for an hour on high heat before eating them, because I prefer them totally soft so that I don't have to chew them (for personal reasons, irrelevant here). But does it kill the ingredients in them? If yes, then which ingredients?  If necessary, I should pont out that I don't like to fry them, as I don't want to add any extra oil, and also it won't give me the mashed, soft texture I'm looking for.

So far, I have come to understand that it is a technique to insert drug particles/molecules in the protein shell of a virus, namely the capsid.  But I cannot find a simplified explanation on how to perform it? On contrary, for  drug encapsulation, there are many online materials and resources.  My questions are:   How does one perform the encapsidation? Are the virus gene in the capsid removed and the drug encapsidated? How does a drug which is masked as a virus not get detected by the body's defense mechanism?  "
1167,Where does the powder spray from an asthma inhaler go?,"Curious to know what happens to the powder after an asthma inhaler is sprayed into the lungs.  I presume that the majority will be naturally breathed out of the lungs. Is there residue left behind after this?   What is the long term effect of using inhalers (I have been using mine for over 40 years), can the smaller branches of the lung eventually become clogged with the powder? "

1169,Is Jicama root safe to eat every day?,"Is 4-6oz of Jicama root safe to eat every day?  According to the following website, Jicama root contains a fat-soluble organic toxin that is linked to the development of Parkinson's disease.  It then seems to contradict itself a little by saying peeled roots are safe for human consumption.  I think their point is that peeled roots contain much less of the toxin, but given that the toxin is fat-soluble, it seems that build-up could occur if a person eats enough of it regularly.  The question is: How much is too much?     Safety profile      Jicama plant contains significant levels of fat-soluble organic toxin, rotenone. This toxin is concentrated especially in the leaf tops, stems and seed pods but at much lower concentrations in the roots. Several studies found that it linked to the development of Parkinson's disease. However, peeled roots are safe for human consumption, including in children. Rotenone works at cellular level inhibiting several metabolic enzymes like NADH dehydrogenase in the mitochondria. Outside, it used as environmentally safe broad-spectrum insecticide, piscicide (to poison fish), and pesticide.   Source: [website]"
1170,Why don't all teratogens warn against pregnancy?,"I know that isotretinoin's packaging is labelled with ideograms against pregnancy, as it can cause birth defects. I'm assuming that some teratogens aren't thus labelled, as paroxetine isn't,    but according to The Hospital for Sick Children :     Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used to treat depression, are capable of crossing the placenta and affecting the baby. Most of the effects in the baby are subtle, and include irritability, agitation, tremor, increased respiratory rate,          nasal congestion, or          diarrhea. However, the SSRI paroxetine is thought to cause birth defects in early pregnancy. [I bolded.] It is important to note that depression itself may be more harmful than the drugs used to treat depression. The benefits of SSRIs in the treatment of depression need to be weighed against the risks to the unborn baby.  "
1171,Cause of distal convergence in anterior teeth,"In anterior teeth, the distal side of the incisal edge is more curved than the mesial side. Furthermore, the incisal edge slopes distally, and the cingulum twists towards the distal side. Why does this occur? Is it because of mastication, is it another reason, or does it just happen? "
1172,Do body composition analysers provide accurate readings or just estimates?,"Looking for a gold-standard measure of Total Body Fat as a possible better predictor of Cardiovascular Disease Mortality in comparison to BMI (Ortega, et al. 2016) - see also Considering obesity using BMI - are body composition analysers such as these from Tanita actually able to accurately measure Total Body Fat, Body Fat Percentage, Fat Free Mass, viceral fat levels etc. or are the readings they provide estimates?

1173,"Can a Solid Bone-Like bone ""extension"" be used?","I've always wondered if instead of the silicon-based implants for some parts of the body, particularly the chin, could be substituted with a solid piece of material, maybe plastic or even titanium or harder metals, to create sort of a bone extension. I've no actual example of this exact idea working, but there are quite similar cases.  What I mean by Bone-extension, is that it would be used on people with functional bones but underdeveloped ones, such as missing-chin, weak bones and things like that, and would not serve the functionality of a prosthesis, as the prosthesis replaces the missing bones, while these ""implants"" would only add up to the bone preexisting structure.  That would be something 3D printed based on the needs of the patient.   For example, this video: [website]in which surgeons created the missing bone due to HMF, or Hemifacial Microsomia ([website]What I'm talking about is quite similar to the one shown in the video, but the purpose as stated below is not to replace a bone, but to enhance a pre-existing one. The material could be titanium like in the video or a more elastic one that wouldn't create many problems in case of a fall, for example (in which case it would absorb part of the impact and not deliver it completely on the fragile bone above) or in the case the ""prosthesis"" is fixed during a time in which the patient can grow.   To better explain what I mean I created this drawing, sorry if it's a bit creepy and unprofessional but I do not have a graphics tablet to draw on, so I had to adapt :'). I hope it is clear what is the purpose. If it doesn't or it's too ugly, comment it and I'll try to make a better one.    As you can see, the Red silhouette represents sort of a ""weak chin"". (to be clear and honest, I don't exactly know if it is exactly the skull-level cause of the weak chin. And I'm not completely sure it's the right term for it.) and the Blue one should represent an underdeveloped mandible. I tried googling weak chin skull but found no representation so I tried guessing it by the exterior appearance. As you can see (or at least I hope) the black part represents the ""prosthesis"", which would have the shape of the 3D labeled draw (sorry again for the ugliness), so quite like a denture? (sorta).  Anyway, I couldn't find much more from trustable and reliable sources, but it's to say that English isn't my main language, so maybe I'm not using the right word. I tried searching for ""3D printed chin implant"" as 3D printing is the technique I think would be the best to use. Or I also tried with ""titanium chin implant"" but I found not that big of an amount of articles or sources.  So, does anyone know if it's actually possible, and if it is, has it already been done or is it currently available?  If there is something unclear in my explainings, feel free to comment and I'll edit the question to fix it! Thanks for reading! "
1174,Earlier wake-up times in older people,"Many studies led to the conclusion that the internal body clock period (circadian rhythm) is actually closer to 25 hours; that is, the clock was thought to drift toward a 25-hour day unless it is set back an hour each day by exposure to morning light and to external clocks. This situation is blamed for a long list of sleep problems (Cromie, 1999).  However, as Cromie (1999) points out, the most accurate measurements found that our internal clocks run on a daily cycle of 24 hours, 11 minutes &plusmn; 16 minutes (Czeisler, et al. 1999).     âIt was both surprising and reassuring that the human clock runs with the same precision as that of other living things,â Czeisler comments. âBut we did not expect to find that both young and old people have the same daily period.â (Cromie, 1999).   Czeisler, who is also director of circadian and sleep disorders medicine at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital in Boston, said that the reason these measurements were more accurate was because:     Other investigators used elaborate procedures to shield subjects from time cues and the outside world. They even coiled copper wire around the rooms in which people were isolated to counteract natural electromagnetic fields. However, these experimenters allowed their subjects to switch on lights when they were awake and turn them off when they wanted to sleep. They didnât think this would have any effect, but switching on electric lights resets the biological clock. Itâs the same as resetting your watch (Cromie, 1999).   Have similar studies been conducted since 1999 with a larger test group and were the results the same?  What are the latest ideas to explain the earlier wake-up times of older people?  This is especially when biological clock lore states that we drift to a later wake-up hour on weekends because we fail to reset the 25-hour cycle each morning as we go to work (Cromie, 1999) and Czeisler also pointed out that     Weâre not drifting, weâre pushing ourselves to a later time with our exposure to electric lights from sunset to bedtime. That resets our biological clocks.â   References  Cromie, W. J. (1999). Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour. Harvard Gazette. Retrievable from: [website]Czeisler, C. A., Duffy, J.

Is it because friction increases or something else?  Secondly, how oligohydramnios leads to decreased intrathoracic size? Is it because less fluid is swallowed in or something else is in play? "
1176,Why do some neurons live longer than others?,"It seems that the scientific community agrees that the development of new neurons stops between adolescence and early adulthood.

Is it related to the function (or ""type"") of said neuron?  "
1177,Why is it called Conscious Sedation?,"Is it common for patients undergoing a procedure where conscious sedation is used to have no memory of the procedure?   According to [website]  Conscious sedation is a combination of   medicines to help you relax (a sedative) and to block pain (an   anesthetic) during a medical or dental procedure. You will probably   stay awake but may not be able to speak...   Why is it called conscious sedation if the patient is effectively unconscious (or at least unresponsive)? By the definition, consciousness refers to the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings. So why is this term used when it is in fact not what a layperson would expect based on the standard definition of consciousness vs unconsciousness? "

1179,"Meaning of ""at baseline"" in ""Detection of antibodies at baseline in schizophrenia or major depression""","From The basis for folinic acid treatment in neuro-psychiatric disorders by Ramaekers et al., 2016, at the very end of the article:     Because the presence of FRÎ± antibodies can show significant serum titer fluctuations, we recommend collection of at least three serum samples at one-week intervals to rule out FRÎ± autoimmune disorder. For the group of patients with major depression, our preliminary results suggest selecting patients with treatment-resistant major depression for FRÎ± autoantibody testing which is estimated to occur at a prevalence of ~56%. However, further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to detect the prevalence of FRÎ± antibodies at baseline among different patient groups suffering from schizophrenia or major depression.   What could be the meaning of this ""at baseline""? My guess is that it means ""before the beginning of treatment"". Is this so?  "
1180,What is the most modern strategy for treating middle ear infections in children?,"I am trying to wrap my head around the treatment of middle ear infections in children, since my toddler is having a lot of these, and there doesn't seem to be a clear cut solution.   So far I have learned the following:   There was a time when acute middle ear infection (the type you don't expect will heal on its own) was mostly treated surgically by an incision in the eardrum and optionally tubes in addition. In more modern times, antibiotics have gained popularity as a first-line treatment and surgery is reserved for cases, where antibiotics fail. The main worry about middle ear infections, is permanent damage to the ear and hearing loss. However, data seems to suggest, that antibiotics treatment does not appear to statistically reduce this type of complication (I am not sure if this is actually true). The second most important urgency factor is temporary hearing loss, which may hinder speech development. Some data seems to suggest, that the ""tubes"" solution, doesn't appear to be very effective. Antibiotics can be applied intranasally, via a cream or internally. Some doctors prescribe anti-viral nasal drops, while others don't. Some prescribe ear drops, others don't. Some people believe, that using a ultra-red lamp may help with this condition. Surgery is not a permanent solution, but only a solution to drain the ear. Future infections may require repeat surgical procedures.   I have visited a bunch of doctors, and have anecdotally observed the following patterns:   Old Scool doctors in economically underdeveloped neighborhoods seem to be quick on the surgery trigger. Less old school, but in no way very forward thinking doctors seem to rely on internal antibiotics. Private doctors, or doctors, who are on the ""cutting edge"" are more likely to prescribe an antibiotic cream and or ear/nose drops over internal antibiotics.   So in conclusion, the therapy seems to have changed from routine surgery to heavy-handed use of antibiotics, to less heavy-handed use of antibiotics in combination with other remedies.  Since I am not a doctor, I may be completely wrong, and of course, every tool has its purpose, but I am asking about the general trend here.  What is the most current understanding, about how such infections should be tackled by physicians? What is the most ""cutting edge"" idea at the moment?  Am I correct in thinking, that over time, the approach has become more ""hands-off"", than in the past?  Please feel free to make suggestions on how to make this question better. I am trying to find out, what the most modern approach here is. Please also feel free to correct me on my list of assumptions. "
1181,What is the name of a condition where one cannot/can poorly perceive depth for objects moving towards them,"I remember a case where someone apparently had great difficulty perceiving the distance of an object if it was (quickly) travelling towards them. Their depth perception was otherwise fine, but when, for instance, catching a ball, that person could not accurately gauge depth and seemed to rely on guesswork/other cues (size of the object? timing?) to decide when to attempt to catch it. Hand-eye coordination was not a problem, and for slow-moving objects (for instance, rolling a ball across the floor) there was no problem. What is the name of this condition, and what could be likely causes? "
1182,Ethics and concerns about feeding human placenta to humans?,"Background:   Placenta is served out of a typical kitchen, i.e. it is chopped up and used in a variety of dishes. The kitchen after the event is never cleaned to any degree that say a surgical room would have been.  The kitchen continues to be used to cook meals.   Should there be any concerns about prions or any other blood born pathogens?  Prions can be found in the Placenta as can blood born pathogens(?). It is common practice for Surgical tools to be sterilized with autoclaves. Rooms where surgeries performed cannot obviously be put into autoclaves.  What can be expected of normal cutlery that has been through the dishwasher a few times and kitchen counters which have been cleaned in a typical fashion? The oven has probably just been used for cooking subsequently.  Would this be resolved after a few years?  I haven't found anything in any literature that touches on this subject.  Oregon made it legal to take home and consume Placenta, but all of the articles I have found discuss having the placenta shipped off to a companies who do the actual job butchering it up and sending back for just the mother to consume as dry tablets. There is one article I have read from the CDC where they talk about one case involving the consumption of it.   Nothing I found discusses the ramification of people doing this in their homes.   "

1184,Is it actually advantageous to ration food?,"I posted this question on the Outdoors SE site. There were some good points regarding morale and such, but I'm curious about this question from a purely biological/nutritive perspective.  Copying from other question:   What is the difference between eating a little bit of food at an interval and eating enough to be full at once?  I'm getting the same amount of calories/nutrition** regardless of when I consume it, so who cares? Why not just eat whenever you're hungry to the point of satiety?  Is that an overly-simplistic view?  ** I suppose there could be a difference in the percentage of nutrients absorbed. If I get too much of a nutrient, perhaps my body will excrete it, so, in that case, it's better to consume it periodically when your body needs it.  The scenario is being stranded somewhere not knowing when rescue will come - so generally no activity.    ** is the only counter argument I can think of, but then again, if you're hungry, that tells you that your body needs the nutrients, so maybe it's better to just eat now rather than wait.  P.S. before my question on OutdoorsSE was edited, I was also asking about hydration, so comments on that would be nice too, though maybe that warrants a separate question. "

1186,Numerical information about variables in prostate cancer data,"This question seems to be weird at first glance but I think this is the appropriate place to ask.  I'm studying Prostate data by Stamey et. al., (1989), data to examine the correlation between the level of prostate-specific antigen and a number of clinical measures in men who were about to receive a radical prostatectomy.  The variables:  lcavol: log cancer volume  lweight: log prostate weight  age: in years  lbph: log of the amount of benign prostatic hyperplasia  svi: seminal vesicle invasion  lcp: log of capsular penetration  gleason: a numeric vector  pgg45: percent of Gleason score 4 or 5  lpsa: response   I wonder if there is a numerical medical information about these variables. For example, âIs there a numerical relationship between log cancer volume and log prostate weight?â,   OR, for instance, Can someone say something like âWe expect that seminal vesicle invasion is double amount of log prostate weightâ?

1187,Does wearing glasses while on the computer increase myopia?,"Nearsightedness is prevalent in demographic groups that look at screens for most of their time, such as office workers or students. (Saw et al., 2002) Glasses correct the defocusing of the lens in the eye. The ciliary muscle then doesn't need to try hard to change the shape of the lens, and therefore is less strained.  It seems to me as if wearing glasses and looking at a close object for extended periods of time will only worsen the condition of the lens: the ciliary muscle needs to actively correct the lens to focus light coming from a short distance. Without glasses the eye is able to focus on the near object anyway without a problem.  Conversely, it sounds logical to assume that working on a computer without glasses will not change anything, but instead might ""train"" the ciliary muscle to shape the lens properly again over time.  Is this correct, i.e. is there research which deals with the question of whether one becomes more nearsighted when wearing correcting glasses and focusing on a close object? Does wearing glasses while on the computer accelerate the development of myopia or not? "

For a year or two?  Would the bone actually be responsive thus growing itself accordingly? Even adults? Is there anyone here with the science or medical career of orthopedics to please give any insights on this?  I would really want to make something like this if it's scientifically 50% possible.

The book ""Prescription for Natural Healing"" (5th ed.), however, recommends an optimum daily intake of 1,000 to 3,000 mg of ""Vitamin C with mineral ascorbates (Ester-C)"". I don't have much experience with the book and I'm trying to gauge how helpful it is.  Am I right to see a conflict here? Or are they talking about different things? Is this really as simple as the book making a wildly bad recommendation, or is there reason to think a higher dose is good? "

I ask myself: Should I get ""used"" to it or rather move away from the place? Many people say you get used to the constant noise, however I wonder if this is a healthy choice.  What I realize as well: I am working in a co-working space which has a huge white noise machine. I find it very calming but measure 52 decibels from this machine. If this noise comes from the street I think it's annoying and damaging.  So is the noise at work worse then the one at home? Is it unhealthy to be under constant noise like that?  "

1196,Does the amount of bleeding from a wound have any effect on the risk of Tetanus?,"I have heard people say that if you get a puncture wound, you won't get tetanus if you can make it bleed. Example: see here, the third point under ""But is a tetanus shot really necessary?""     Tetanus can only be contracted if the open wound comes in contact with animal feces and if it doesnât bleed.  As long as your wound bleeds freely and is oxygenated (that is cleaned with Hydrogen Peroxide solution), there is no risk of tetanus.   This quote is an extreme version of the claim, of course. And it's not hard to find claims that this is a myth (here and here), and the Mayo Clinic says to control the bleeding, not encourage it. Given a choice, I'd bet on it being a myth. But I haven't found an authoritative reference for it.  Can someone provide an authoritative reference for whether and how the amount of bleeding from a wound affects the risk of tetanus? Does flowing blood have any flushing effect at all? Is it possible to meaningfully decrease the risk of tetanus infection in an unvaccinated person by encouraging a wound to bleed?  Edit: as noted in the comments, I don't expect an answer to link to a study looking specifically at bleeding and tetanus risk. Just something more authoritative and relevant than what I have so far. It could be something about how good or bad bleeding is at flushing foreign material / antigens (tetanus spores or otherwise) out of a wound. I'm expecting there to be evidence that you can't rely on bleeding to prevent infection, but I'm not entirely sure. "

1199,Are there any herbal medicines that have been established to actually speed up or ease labor?,"Now that I'm 37 weeks pregnant, I seem to have a large number of acquaintances suggesting herbal medicines to me the speed up labor or thin the cervix.

Raspberry leaf â Should it be recommended to pregnant women? Effect of Maternal Raspberry Leaf Consumption in Rats on Pregnancy Outcome and the Fertility of the Female Offspring Oral evening primrose oil    I don't have a medical background (and I don't have access to a lot of the literature out there), so my ability to interpret these results is somewhat limited, but it seems pretty clear that these herbal medicines are not proven to be effective.   I also found a study examining a whole bunch of different herbal remedies for labor, but it doesn't really go into detail regarding the results (it just surveys a bunch of women)  Herbal and Other Complementary Medicine Use by Texas Midwives  It made me wonder, since there are also broad studies that look at multiple different commonly-recommended herbal medicines (or at least papers that aggregate other studies), are there any more broad papers that indicate a commonly-recommended herbal medicine is actually more effective than the others and that has actually been established to be effective at speeding up labor?   It would be nice to know if I should be ignoring my acquaintances advice entirely, or if their recommendations do have some merit. "

Aside from these antagonistic, pancreatic hormones, ketosis and keto-adaptation seems to emerge and establish itself through other metabolites and hormones that apparently provide fuel and epigenetic signaling... what are these?  I'm trying to understand physiologic indicators of a fully keto-adapted person, i.e. one that thrives on no-to-low carbohydrates (I'm not asking for dietary advice here, merely the evolving effects and adaptations of such sustained keto-adapted diets regardless their macronutrient composition and frequency).  My limited understanding is that the initial and early sequence of ketosis and keto-adaption is:   Free fatty acids are mobilized from adipose tissue by glucagon in lieu of blood glucose and the prevalence of insulin (could be as a result of fasting, caloric restriction, intense exercise, whatever),  Metabolizing ketone bodies first appear by the liver (converting mobilized free fatty acids into acetoacetate) and then, after a period, the liver converts the acetoacetate ketones as a precursor into beta-hyrdoxybutyrate.   The body can be observed initially shedding excess acetoacetate ketones through urine in early stages of ketosis (and acetone through respiration after adaptation occurs). At some point beta-hydroxybutyrate production becomes sufficient enough to be the primary fuel for the brain, presumably causing a cascading series of epigenetic changes throughout the body, e.g. increased human growth hormone production, autophagy, etc. At some concurrent point mobilized free-fatty acids replace acetoacetate as fuel for skeletal muscles, which presumably is now conserved to the primary role of beta-hydroxybutyrate precursor.   Is this accurate, are there other evolving aspects of metabolite, endocrine or any physiologic changes that are key and/or playing pivotal roles... and what about someone that spends years this way... what's the baseline conditions of sustained and fully evolved keto-adaptation?  Thanks. "
1204,Does sitting too much causes hip pain?,"This is my first question here, and I don't know if here is a right place for it.  I am a student, and I study software engineering, so I have to sit down for a long time a day, to study, and I study more than 6 hours usually. about 6 months ago, I experienced a sudden, chronic pain, in my hip, outer side and close to my leg. it lasts about 3 or 4 minutes, then I was alright again. but now frequency of the pain is getting more, it happen on both sides, and there is no situation that trigger that! sometimes, I am trying to sleep! or sometimes I am standing still! it may happens any time. the pain is just like the pain of injection, but it remains for about 30 seconds, to sometimes 5 minutes.  is it because of sitting too much? and if it is, what should I do?

It seems that every time I try to shave my pubic hair (like a bikini line), I always make it look a lot worse than before shaving... I'd much rather have a few swaths of hair than bright red inflamed razor burn and itchy red ingrown hairs.  I always make sure my razor is sharp and clean, and that my skin isn't lather/shaving cream is non-scented (so as not to irritate my skin), and that the skin is warm from the water and well covered in lather, and then I shave. And it looks and feels good for about 24 hours, but after that.... all sorts of tiny welts bubble up and I begin itching up a storm.   Is there a certain direction to shave? Is there a different instrument I should be using instead of my razor?  How do I shave my pubic hair without it backfiring on me?  "
1207,Knowing the root/cause of one's hypothyroidism? How to know if it's Hashimotos-Disease?,"Ever since I was a teenager, I've been treated for hypothyrodism (underactive thyrodid). However, I don't recall the official diagnosis process and am not sure if it was ever conducted. My grandmother, mother, older sister, who all lived with me at the time and saw the same doctor, had hypothyrodism and were treated for such. Needless to say, I'm not sure if my general-practitioner 15 years ago, just skipped the cause/root of my hypothyrodism and just went straight to the treatment (which at the time was Armour Thyroid Medication wherein dosages were determined by compairson to my TSH levels indicated on my blood-tests) or not. However, I've seen endocrinologists since then and know for sure that I have hypothryoidism (I'm now on Synthroid), but no one ever told me the reason.   I was reading online that:      Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the   United States. [website]I was wondering if I can ask a doctor now, years later, if they can tell me why I have hypothyroidsm, and if it at all relates to Hashimoto's Disease? I have also been diagnosed with borderline Lupus and Fibromyalgia (other autoimmune diseases), and was wondering if these all interrelate in any way?   Would knowing the reason for my hypothyroidism make any difference? "

1212,Acne underneath skin,"Introduction  Okay, I've almost won my war. The battle, its almost won... However, I must still claim victory in my final battle. The battle against the little enemies, the ones that have fought with my blade of benzoyl peroxide every single day.  Problem  Through spot treatments I have been able to fell every single one of these spots, but only the ones on my face. I've been using a spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide in, which has worked really well for me. However, my issue comes here:     There are spots underneath my skin, I think. The areas where they come through are a bit red.   So, because there is still slightly red skin on my face, and I think this is causing my acne to constantly return. I need to stop this, and end my war once and for all.  What I've tried   Washing my face with a rag and sponge every day, three times a day Changing my pillow case every day Using a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment Minimizing how much I touch my face Not interfering with the spots with my fingers, not picking at them, not playing with them. Just letting spot creams eradicate them.   Conclusion  Seriously, this driving me up the wall. I spot cream in the evening, by the time tomorrow has ended and its time for a shower, they've all come back. Its like they're coming in waves, damn waves! I must put an end to this.  So, how can I prevent acne from coming back within the space of a single school day? How can I get rid of these once and for all? What types of measures could I try? I have no reason to visit my doctor, its only acne, but I have no idea what I can try now.  Is there even a point in me trying? I acknowledge that I am a teenager, but no others that I know seem to have acne/spots like I do. "
1213,Can viruses be inherited?,"In theory, any virus capable of infecting germ cells can plant its genetic load into the sperm/ova that will eventually become offspring.

I'm not sure how true that is in this day and age in the human world, but if it is, is there a way to secrete more pheromones while in the presence of the opposite sex? Or does that just mean, I'd have to sweat profusely, in which case, that wouldn't be that attractive. I know that there are products out there that claim to be pheromone perfumes or whatever, but aren't pheromones unique to each person? So that seem like it would be bunk.

1219,Nutrition farmed vs wild salmon,"I read this link as well as watching the accompanying docmentary [website]and it makes farmed salmon look like something to be avoided at all costs.  Not only can it contain more chemicals but it can have additives and even a 1:1 omega 3 to omega 6 ratio.  On the other hand I've read articles where it says farmed salmon can have more omega 3 than wild even though it may have more omega 6.  In any case the lack of certification, bad practices and variations between farms make data on this quite murky?  I'm notonly asking about nutrition, but also about additives, chemicals, disease causing fish etc.  Is farmed salmon really so bad as the link makes out?  Would you avoid it. Also does it really have a 1:1 omega 3:6 ratio generally speaking. Your thoughts please. "

The question is, why is it that the cold, on the back, hurts, whereas the cold on the front, arms, and especially the head, does not.  Is it that the skin on the back id's thicker and tighter?  Why does this condition lessen with cold weather, which makes the blood, also, feel cleaner?  At a minimum tell me if this is due to fat cell thickness or sensor density (and I am sure it must be the latter if these were the only two variables), and tell me what the neck the blood system does there. How are the heat sensors connected to the blood, heat, and circulation. I want to live.  What is it? "

1230,Why do so many people suffer from glossophobia (fear of public speaking)? How to overcome glossophobia?,"I heard the surely fake statistic that the number one fear in America is Public Speaking. Yes, second to death. While that may not be an accurate statistic, it demonstrates that degree to which glossophobia (fear of public speaking) is feared and dreaded. Some more than others. I know that I am numbered among the ones who have an extreme case of glossophobia.   As an individual born with a hearing impairment and struggling to hear all my life (with the help of my hearing aids) and undergoing speech therapy, I always had social anxiety... so when public speaking is something I need to do... I almost have a panic attack -- except in front of a large audience.   I am presenting my research at huge academic conference in a few weeks, and I'm losing sleep over it even now. I know that whenever I present anything, I cannot speak clearly (stammering-stuttering) or articulate my thoughts (I lose my train of thoughts, which perpetuates my fear and anxiety), I shake and tremble and nervously fidget as I hold my paper/script (which is distracting to the audience, and often causes me to lose my spot), and I my mouth becomes excessively dry... (often there will be a cup of water available at these things, but I'll go right through that), and then I feel like I don't have enough saliva to even speak and I'm worried I won't be able to speak. I also sweat a lot. My heart races. I cannot look up at the audience. It's like a surge of adrenaline overtakes me. How do I prevent this from occurring?   Why does it even have it? I always try to give myself a pep talk beforehand that no one is going to eat me and it's all going to be okay, and they're just people too... but no matter what, my body freaks out when it comes to public speaking. What is it about speaking in front of the people that causes so much fear?  "
1231,Is flatulence/gas comprised of methane? Is it flammable? What about burps/belching?,"Recently, I read that in a surgery, flatulence (and its methane qualities) emitted by the patient was the culprit for a fire igniting when it came in contact with the surgical laser. [website]Are all flatulence/gasses passed comprised of methane (and potentially flammable)? Or is that dependent on the food we eat and the type of gut-microbiota we have to break down and digest the food? Or how long the food ferments in our GI tract?   Is burpring/belching comprised of the same elements? Or is that mainly trapped air? I'm assuming that it wouldn't have methane or flammable qualities, correct?   P.S.

1234,Fever lower limit ( 99.0 Â°F (37.2 Â°C) at armpit)... is it universal?,"Surprisingly, all professional doctors, school-textbooks and other resources, consider as armpit temperatures:  &gt; 99 &deg; F (some-others &gt; 98.6 &amp;deg F) = Fever;  = 99 &deg; F (Some-others = 98.6 &amp;deg F) = Normal;  &lt; 99 &deg; F (Some-others  &lt; 98.6 &amp;deg F) = Less than normal.   But this doesn't match with my experience. I feel normal when I'm around 96 &amp;deg F (officially which is less than normal); and 98.6 &deg; F is clearly perceptible as fever to me. (and this is not based upon a single thermometer on single event; it is based upon many).  Similarly; my mother tells 98.6 &deg; F is much more than a low-grade-fever whereas her normal temperature is around or below 96 &deg; F. On the opposite end we have seen peoples (such as my father when was youth) who did not reported any feverish or tired or such at near 100 &deg; F.   So it is quite surprising to me, that 99 &deg; F (or 98.6 &deg; F to some other doctors) is treated-as-definition of lower-end of  universal standard. Is it really universal? or it is just an 'average' or 'consensus' that doesn't cause serious deviation if used as an overall standard.     P.S. 1:  Wikipedia tells; normal temperature can vary slightly from person to person and by day of time. But I could not find any such mention about fever.    P.S. 2: How the human normal temperature could be only one particular value? Shouldn't there be a 'range' instead?  "

1236,Any scientific evidence that consumption of the placenta is nutrious for a new mother? Does it prevent postpartum depression?,"From what I understand, consumption of the placenta (placentophagy) either via capsule or actual eating, has become more common (although I believe it is still a fringe practice). I know that other mammals have been doing this after giving birth, but is there any scientific evidence that it benefits a human mother? I have read both those that say there are benefits and those that say there is no benefits so I'm confused.   I read that the possible benefits are that the placenta is obviously chalkful of vitamins and hormones that will help the mother to heal both physically and emotionally after giving birth. For instance, it could help prevent postpartum-depression? It contains oxytocin, which helps promote lactation for breastfeeding? It contains prostaglandin, which helps the uterus to revert back as much as possible to its smaller state?   But then I read that there is no evidence that it does either of these, and it's possibly just a placebo effect. That the placenta only benefited the fetus while in the womb.   I'm not pregnant or anything, I would just like to better understand this trend, and know the science behind it.  "

1239,Are massage creams containing paraben bad for health?,"Are massage creams containing paraben bad for health?  For example, I see that the free-up massage cream contains methylparaben: should I use a paraben-free massage cream instead of it?  I read on [website]  Methylparaben is widely used as a preservative in women's cosmetics, such as skin creams and deodorants. This compound has been found intact within breast cancer tissues. Some researchers suggest that methylparaben may increase risk of breast cancer, or accelerate the growth of these tumors.   but there is no link to any scientific study.  {1} reports:     Methyl paraben is not carcinogenic or mutagenic. It is not teratogenic or embryotoxic and is negative in the uterotrophic assay. The mechanism of cytotoxic action of parabens may be linked to mitochondrial failure dependent on induction of membrane permeability transition accompanied by the mitochondrial depolarization and depletion of cellular ATP through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Parabens are reported to cause contact dermatitis reactions in some individuals on cutaneousl exposure. Parabens have been implicated in numerous cases of contact sensitivity associated with cutaneous exposure; however, the mechanism of this sensitivity is unknown. Sensitization has occurred when medications containing parabens have been applied to damaged or broken skin. Allergic reactions to ingested parabens have been reported, although rigorous evidence of the allergenicity of ingested paraben is lacking.   but the study is 15-year-old.  The US FDA seems fine with parabens but don't cite any scientific study:     Are parabens safe as theyâre used in cosmetics? Are they linked to   breast cancer or other health problems?      FDA scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of   parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that   parabens as they are used in cosmetics have an effect on human health.   Here are some of the questions we are considering:         What do published studies show about the possible hazards of parabens, and on the effects of parabens on human health? For example,   do experimental findings with various parabens also happen in real   life?   What are the hazards and risks of not using parabens? If we stop using parabens to protect cosmetics and consumers from harmful   bacteria, are there safer alternatives for preservatives?   If there are paraben-related health effects that are scientifically supported and documented, how do these effects relate to the use of   parabens in cosmetics?   Do the different kinds of parabens act the same or differently in our bodies?         FDA will continue to evaluate new data in this area. If we determine   that a health hazard exists, we will advise the industry and the   public, and will consider the agencyâs legal options under the   authority of the FD&amp;C Act to protect the health and welfare of   consumers.

1242,How common is Stockholm-Syndrome and/or Codependency Issues in Battered-Wife(Person)-Syndrome and/or other abusive relationships?,"This is an extremely sensitive topic so I apologize from the get-go if this is offensive in any way -- I am not meaning to. I am aware that there are a myriad of reasons as to why an individual that is being physically abused may continue a relationship or remain silent (fear/feels threatened for one's own life or family -- especially if children involved, financial/living expenses -- feel unable to survive logistically if they leave, the hope that the abuser will change and just needs love &amp; support, low-self-esteem and feeling that they are not worthy of a better/healthier relationship, ignorance -- not even knowing what a healthy relationship looks like because they've grown up in an abusive household, societal norms/culture -- what will friends, family, neighbors, etc. think of me if they know what's really happening or it's a social taboo to flee, etc. etc. etc.). I am not a psychologist or a Social Service employees so I have no expertise in this area and don't claim to do so.

1246,What disease/s killed Mozart? Or was it poison?,"Have scholars since determined Mozart's cause of death?   I know that there has been a swirl of mystery surrounding his death and for quite sometime poisoning by certain communities was blamed as the cause (as Mozart seemed to think so himself and even wrote his own requiem). But for the most part, those claims have been put to rest, correct?   The most likely diseases that contributed to his demise are rheumatic fever (which may have led to bloodletting), miliary fever, a strept infection and even being a hypochondriac (which caused him to consume medicines that contain antimony that are somewhat toxic), right? Which one of these is the most accurate or believed by the scholarly community -- according to the symptoms which were described (or any physical evidence -- has his body been exhumed to examine it)?  "
1247,"If people can create an accelerated medical program that can be completed in just three years, what textbooks should they select in the curriculum?","Imagine a third-world country with a lack of doctors. They should start to treat patients as soon as possible even if they did not take full courses in biochemistry, histology, anatomy, biostatistics, etc.  So what would you give them to study in pediatrics, internal medicine, gastroenterology, emergence medicine, endocrine, etc.  In Canada, physician assistants are academically prepared as medical generalists. They are accelerated medically educated clinicians. Their practice of medicine includes diagnoses, performing physical exams, prescribing medications, and educating and counselling patients.  PAs become generalist medical practitioners in 25 months only (i.e. two years).   So what would you recommend for a similar program in a third world country with a lack of of medical practitioners? What are some of good textbooks that cover 70% or 80% of the essential medical knowledge? "
1248,How does auto-brewery-syndrome work exactly? Their bodies somehow produce alcohol without even consuming it? When was it discovered?,How does auto-brewery-syndrome work exactly? Their bodies somehow produce alcohol without even consuming it? Does this have to do with how the body breaks down food... does it ferment and produce ethanol?  Does their body produce enough alcohol to the point where they are intoxicated and they blood-alcohol levels cause hangovers?   When was it discovered that this was a legitimate syndrome?   Has anyone ever been accused of being an alcoholic because of this? Or been ticketed with an DUI?   How does one control this symptom if they have it? 
1249,"What is the function of goosebumps in human anatomy? It happens when it's cold, scary, or euphoric, but WHY?","We've all experienced it when we hear a chilling tale that scares us or we get out of the pool and there is a crisp breeze or simply something unbelievably emotionally positive is occurring (a sense of euphoria): goosebumps. But WHY? What purpose do goosebumps serve in the human anatomy?   Why do the hairs on our arms, neck, spine, etc stand up when these things happen? Is there some primal human benefit that no longer benefits us (or still does and I'm unaware of it)?  Do other animals experience this?  "
1250,what are the long and short term benefits of cold showers,"Apart from the increased circulation and sperm production (in men) what long term and short term benefits can you get with a cold shower every day?   To clarify, short term effects I'd mean immediate neurological or cardiovascular benefits (example). Long term effects I mean would it slowly boost your body's immune system in some way or another? Perhaps decrease likelihood of a stroke (again these are examples, I doubt a cold shower everyday would decrease your chance of having a stroke). "
1251,Saccharomyces boulardii with antibiotics. When to take?,"On Saccharomyces boulardii leaflet it's written that it has to be taken on an empty stomach (at least 15 minutes before eating) but if it's to be taken with antibiotics then you should take them together.  Some antibiotics are to be taken on a full stomach, others can be taken even on a empty stomach but it's suggested to take them on a full stomach to avoid irritation (Amoxicillin, to name one)  In such cases where you have to take  Saccharomyces boulardii with a ""full stomach antibiotic"" what's the best thing to do? Take them together even though you are on a full stomach or take Saccharomyces boulardii before eating and then antibiotics after? "
1252,Strengthening / recovering lungs? What is the science behind this?,"Some interesting smoking questions have led me to ask this. I am myself a recovering tobacco addict - I stopped a few months ago. Though my health has improved vastly, I still can easily get wheezing / shortness of breath in anxious or physical situations.  Some research has led to believe I have undiagnosed asthma, which is triggered by smoking. Regardless, I want to ask if there's any forms of strengthening air intake/ lung function and what is the science behind it?  For instance, its uncontroversial that cardiovascular exercise helps. But exactly by doing what? What about breathing excercises? Diet? What else can be done? "
1253,Fibromyalgia and Neuroplasticity,I am learning that the theory at the moment for Fibromyalgia is that the brain loses it's calibration about how much stimulus is painful or causes pain or like the volume knob is turned up way too high. Has there been studies or research about whether using neuroplasticity could be used to retrain the brain to relearn how painful or not painful a stimulus should be? Can a person with Fibromyalgia unlearn pain?  
1254,Difference between common cold and flu?,"What are the differences between flus and colds? I don't know about English, but in Spanish they confuse it very often when using words gripe and resfriado.  Maybe it's not the case in English, but I would like to know what are their differences and if you can give a bunch of examples for each one similar to this way: you know that you have flu/cold when...  In addition, both flu, cold and allergies in the nose (e.g. with allergy: dust) have significant symptoms related with the nose. It is many times with mucus, sneezing or stuffy nose.  How can you recognize if it's allergy, flu or cold? I didn't want to take the general case of allergy because not always it is related to the nose. "
1255,What are the criteria for assessing the quality of evidence in a medical research article?,"The medical research literature contains plenty of contradictory results (and has a strong publication bias). Attempting to make more informed decisions, I would like to educate myself to judge how much importance I should give to the results presented in a given medical research article. For the sake of concreteness, let's assume we only consider medical research articles that study the impact of drug X or medical treatment Z on medical condition Z.  What are the criteria for assessing the quality of evidence in such medical research articles?    For example,  Atkins, David, Dana Best, Peter A. Briss, Martin Eccles, Yngve Falck-Ytter, Signe Flottorp, Gordon H. Guyatt et al. ""Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations."" BMJ (Clinical research ed.) (2004). Harvard proposed the following:      which they applied to  a few research articles to exemplify the use of their   assessment grid:    I wonder whether there exist other similar attempts to lay out a systematic, objectively applicable assessment strategy.   I am aware of the Level of Evidence pyramid (image from the MOOC Introduction to Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis [website]Note that I am only interested in assessing the quality of the evidence, and not the quantity of the entire research article. For instance, the quality of writing or the quality of the literature review could be an element to the judge the quality of the research article, but is not useful when the judging the presented evidence.

1256,Why is predicted FVC calculated on height only (and not weight)?,"(please forgive me if this is a stupid question, as I have very little medical knowledge)  I've been found to have an unusally low vital capacity (about 65% of the predicted value) so I'm up for a series of tests. Naturally I'm worried.  However, it would seem that most methods for calculating the predicted VC take into account the age, gender and height, but not weight. Given that I have a very tall and slim build, it seems natural that I would have a lower VC if weight is not factored in.  What I mean is that most men that are as tall as me also have a wider ribcage. Many weigh as much as 20 kg more than me without being overweight (and that means they also need more oxygen).  So, is chest width meaningfully related to vital capacity? And if so, why isn't it taken into consideration when calculating predicted VC? "

""Tendinopathy: why the difference between tendinitis and tendinosis matters."" International journal of therapeutic massage &amp; bodywork 5, no. 1 (2011): 14-17. mention:        Vitamin C, manganese, and zinc are all important for the synthesis of collagen production (20).    Vitamin B6 and Vitamin E have also been linked to tendon health (21).       They failed to indicate which type of collagen they are talking about, and ignored the importance of the alpha2(I) to alpha1(I) ratio.  What else can be useful? "
1259,Should I sleep with my bra on?,"I have always slept with my bra on. This summer is particularly hot and the sweating makes me feel uncomfortable. I was considering sleeping without a bra.  All the below sentences are quoted directly from different websites*.        If poor circulation, skin irritation, restlessness, hyperpigmentation and breast fungus are things you would like to avoid, removing your bra at night is a small and easy precaution you can take.   ...it's OK to wear a bra to sleep if you feel like it. Just make sure that it is the right one     There is no direct connection between sleeping in a bra and breast cancer, however wearing a bra at night could offer more support or comfort, if needed.   I strongly believe that all women SHOULD wear a bra to sleep. The effects of gravity will occur even during the evening when lying down on the bed.      It turns out that there are major arguments for and against sleeping with a bra regardless of the weather.  I would like to know what are the pros and cons of sleeping with and without a bra under the assumption that my bra is a perfect fit and does not by itself cause any problems. I do not want weather to be considered. Should I start sleeping without one for ever or should I always wear one ? Please note that I am looking for a well reasoned answer with strong medical backing. I am NOT looking for answer which like the links posted here.  *Sources: - Should I wear bra on sleep on ShareCare.com  - 5 Reasons You Shouldnât Wear A Bra While Sleeping on PositiveMEd.com  - Is Sleeping In A Bra Good Or Bad For You? on Huffington Post.

How is measured the transmission rate of virusses?  Is there some table with the diseases and their respective transmission rate? "
1261,What causes tendon microinjuries to become painful in the case of a tendinosis?,"From [website]  Tendinosis/tendinopathy is a chronic degenerative tendon injury that is usually brought on by repetitive motion. The repetitive motion is often associated with activities in the workplace or with sports. Microinjuries gradually accumulate faster than they can heal until the area eventually becomes painful.    From {1}:     The term âlateral epicondylitisâ is a misnomer   because, pathologically, this condition   consists of mucoid degeneration   with a paucity of acute or chronic inflammatory   cells. The condition is, therefore,   more appropriately referred to as âtendinosis.â   It is believed that tendinosis is the   result of repetitive trauma causing microtearing   of the tendon. Scar tissue   forms during the healing process, which is then subjected to further tearing with   repeat trauma (1,3,7). Eventually, as the   cycle of injury and repair continues, the   patient will become symptomatic.   From [website]I wonder what causes tendon microinjuries to eventually become painful in the case of a tendinosis. I.e., how comes pain from a tendinopathy often suddenly appears one day even though the microinjuries accumulated over the preceding weeks didn't create any pain at the time.  I am mostly interested in the tendons that attach to the epicondyles of the humerus.    References:   {1} Levin, Dayna, Levon N. Nazarian, Theodore T. Miller, Patrick L. O'Kane, Rick I. Feld, Laurence Parker, and John M. McShane. ""Lateral Epicondylitis of the Elbow: US Findings 1."" Radiology 237, no. 1 (2005): 230-234. [website]"

1263,Why would avoiding sitting still for long periods help prevent tendinitis?,"The webpage Can Bursitis and Tendinitis Be Prevented? says:     To help prevent inflammation or reduce the severity of its recurrence:         Begin new activities or exercise regimens slowly.   Gradually increase physical demands following several well-tolerated exercise sessions.   Exercise regularly.   Strengthen muscles around the joint.   Take breaks from repetitive tasks often.   Stop activities that cause pain.   Cushion the affected joint. Use foam for kneeling or elbow pads. Increase the gripping surface of tools with gloves or padding. Apply   grip tape or an oversized grip to golf clubs.   Use two hands to hold heavy tools; use a two-handed backhand in tennis.   Donât sit still for long periods.   Practice good posture and position the body properly when going about daily activities.   If a history of tendinitis is present, consider seeking guidance from your doctor or therapist before engaging in new exercises and   activities.

1265,Do I need to communicate with my doctor if I don't want to take prescribed MRI?,"I got a prescribed brain MRI today from my doctor. Although I agreed to schedule the MRI next week, I find I am not ready to do that after I come home. I am very busy recently and my symptom is not urgent.  I am not sure what should I do. Do I need to discuss this with my doctor (which means I probably need to schedule another appointment again, and as I said I am very busy recently), or I can simply not schedule the MRI and let the prescription expire? Will the hospital charge me if I do not make a schedule? Thank you! "
1266,Radioactive Iodine for Hyperthyroidism: why avoid contact with others?,"I can readily see why it's desirable to avoid contact with women who are or might become pregnant, and to avoid contact with children.  However, many sources go further than this. For instance, [website]Given that the treatment itself is not meant to have serious side effects, how can it be that another person is put at risk by being within a few feet of someone who has taken radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism? Is there any evidence of risk from such proximity to adults who cannot become pregnant? "
1267,How to read food labels?,"How are you supposed to read nutrition information on food labels?

1268,What would life expectancy be today without medicine and surgery?,"I am from France, and noticed recently that many people I know - friends, family - would have died young without today's medicine. Apparently, in 1900, life expectancy at birth (LEB) in France was about 50 years old. I didn't do the maths (I have little data and I cannot say for sure that disease X would have killed a patient a century ago) but 50 years old average seems high compared to my personal experience.  If today, in developed countries, we had to revert to using only 1900 medicine and surgery (we can discard the medical practices that were actually making things worse), with the same environment, would we live longer or shorter?  Some random ideas of what could make LEB increase apart from medicine:   Environment is better (food is better and more available, hygiene) Better genes (mixing of populations..?) Social and technological progress (better working conditions)   What could make it decrease:   Environment has degraded (unhealthy food and lifestyles, pollution?) Genes have degraded (?)  "
1269,Different protein ratios in similar calorie diets,"Consider the following scenarios:  Scenario 1:   3000 kcal daily intake 250g protein   Scenario 2:   3000 kcal daily intake 100g protein   Question:  Does the protein ratio affect how much fat can be gained (in case of calorie surplus)? This means that in diets with the same amount of calories the protein-carb-fat ratio affects the quantity of fat gained. I understand different foods have different thermic effects, but is there any logic correlation in the previous statement? "
1270,Are all kinds of liquor and alcohol equally bad for liver?,Do all kinds of alcohol increase the risk of liver disease in a similar way? Or is an alcoholic beverage that is higher in alcohol by volume (e.g. scotch - ~60% and up) more harmful than those lower in alcohol by volume (e.g. red wine - 12%)? 
1271,Should I choose low fat milk or full fat milk?,"I am a healthy man with normal weight so I'm not concerned with weight loss.  For me milk is an important part of my diet. I've read recent studies saying that low fat products are not always good. I was searching online if I should use low fat milk or full fat. But I found contradicting posts.   For example, this post claims that full fat milk should be replaced with low fat option. On the other hand this post claims otherwise. Whom to trust? Is there any scientific study which can give a definite answer. "
1272,How can I create orthopedic insole/slipsole by my own means?,"I want to try using orthopedic insole, but found them extremely expensive if one want to get an individual design for some pair of shoes.

1273,"Did I receive the BCG vaccine via stamper, not hypodermic?","Before the BCG (TB) vaccine is given, a Heaf test is first administered, often using a stamper tool which makes many small skin punctures to test the immune response. The stamper I received my Heaf test from strongly resembles that pictured in the 5th slide in this presentation.  I'm familiar with how the BCG (TB) vaccine is typically administered with a regular hypodermic syringe injection.  However, when I received my BCG vaccination (at the age of 9) I distinctly remember receiving my vaccination using a the same stamping tool as well, except the cap was red and not yellow. I think I remember the nurse administering the vaccine saying it was an experimental delivery system, but this might be a false memory or corruption. I do not have a BCG scar and apparently I do have some level of TB resistance (according to the second Heaf test I took at the age of 14).  I could not find any information about the BCG vaccine itself being delivered by any kind of stamping tool and I'm curious what exactly happened, and why the stamper isn't used (is it ineffective? is it too expensive? is it not having a scar worth it?)

1275,What are the dangers of screening tests in overdiagnosis and overtreatment?,"I have recently seen a number of articles in the lay public print on overdiagnosis, for example in the New York Times, Study Points to Overdiagnosis of Thyroid Cancer.  In the article, they state that while the thyroid cancer rate in the United States has more than doubled since 1994, in South Korea, it has increased fifteenfold in the past two decades. As stated in the article:     Although more and more small thyroid cancers are being found, however, the death rate has remained rock steady, and low. If early detection were saving lives, death rates should have come down.   It's a bit confusing to think of ""overdiagnosing"" cancer. Sloan-Kettering in New York obviously agrees, as they now offer patients with small thyroid tumors the option to wait and see if the tumor grows, but so far, not many patients have chosen this option.  This seems to imply in the US at least (and even more so in South Korea), there is too much screening and too much treatment occurring.  What is overdiagnosis? What is overtreatment? Should the average person  stop getting screened? Isn't screening a good thing? "

1278,Cases of pregnancy due to pre-seminal fluid,"Are there such cases that a pre-seminal fluid can make a woman pregnant? Our clinical instructor told us that there are some individuals that has a strong sperm motility and high sperm concentration. Hence, it can make a woman pregnant even though in the stage of lubrication (where men's penis lubricates because of pre-ejaculation fluid).    However, there are no records about that circumstances.  Is it really true that a woman may become pregnant without any ejaculation(man) inside the woman's organ? "
1279,Are there any symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency?,"I've heard that Vitamin D is mainly obtained from the sun or you have to take supplements. Getting it from the sun also depends on many factors, such as the latitude, time of the day, skin color, area exposed etc.  I am a office worker with light brown skin. I walk in the sun for around 10-15 minutes a day which I think is insufficient. I do not take any Vitamin D supplements, as well. I am a vegetarian, but do drink milk (not fortified with Vitamin D, though) and other milk products.   I am afraid I might have Vitamin D deficiency, but am not sure. Is there any symptom associated with Vitamin D deficiency? Or would this deficiency only be determined only by a test?  I could not find a reliable source of information on the web.  "

I have a decent IT job, but it is stressful and the 3 weeks vacation time seems more like 3 days, particularly because I need to keep 2 weeks out of those to visit family in India .   I live in Canada now.  One of my life goals is to take up a lower paying job (maybe 10% lower) after I reach 40, and hopefully this job will have lower stress and more generous vacation time. I love to travel and my partner loves it even more.( 5 weeks is my goal).  Assuming that my finances are well enough for my needs, can I hope to become more happy and fulfilled because of the extra time off? Or am I kidding myself? "
1282,Why does the weight matter when consuming a certain amount of a specific drug?,"My question is actually referred to hallucinogenic substances, in particular to mushrooms.  I can understand why alcohol or other substances that relate to body mass (fat in some cases) affect people to a greater or a lesser extent depending on their weight (for a given amount of a certain drug).  What I do not understand (perhaps this is not even true) is why the more mass a person has, more grams of mushrooms that person has to take in order to get the same psychoactive effect.   If the active substance finally goes to the brain, where is the weight's role in this process?  People with experience in this recommends intakes of a certain amount of grams depending on one's weight. Does this have a logical reason? "

I don't have epilepsy, but it gave me a bit of a head-ache/eye strain after a while.  Which makes me wonder what it would do to someone who did have photosensitive epilepsy?

I would guess that most people aren't aware that this sense even exists, although life would be very difficult without it (you know how hard it is to walk when you have a ""dead [i.e., numb] leg""?

The problem is, I do not have a medical background. I need a flowchart (or similar) to tell me what the patient's 'journey' is when they arrive in A&amp;E.  I hate the word 'journey' in this context, but I can't think of a better one. The point is, it's hard for me to train people on the new software when I don't really know what they're doing with the physical patient in front of them. What are the decision points?  Some scenarios  1) Someone walks into A&amp;E with a painful but non-critical injury, like a broken toe. What happens to them?  2) Someone arrives in an ambulance. What happens to them?  3) What are the other common scenarios I haven't thought of?  For context, this is a large, NHS general hospital in a medium sized city, in England. "

He is on medication so that he ""will never get it again"". I've been told by some that this is a low risk situation, and by others that this is a very big deal.   Does c diff disappear completely? I know that many people have it in safe amounts in their stomachs. Can it be held in remission permanently with medication?  I am young and healthy, but taking antibiotics.

Now, as an adult, I've been trying to get back into running again, so I can lose some weight.  Unfortunately, my feet hurt terribly.  I have a Brooks pair of shoes that I know is good.  As well, I've gotten some custom orthotics.  However, the podiatrist I see insists that the orthotics are fine, and that my feet don't need to be pushed anymore into the right position than they already are.  I'm pretty sure he's wrong, but if he's not, I don't want to insist that my inserts be adjusted, only to find out that I was wrong.  I only have feelings as to whether or not my feet are being held in the right position, but these are subjective, and I don't think they're reliable.  Is there any objective way to know for sure if my feet are being held in the healthiest position possible when I walk or run?  Is there some sort of test that exists that my doctor, perhaps, doesn't know about?   "
1296,Does looking at a computer can be good for your eyes?,"Let's put aside harmful affects of staring at computer screen, is there any advantage of looking at computer screen for long time ?  The reason that I ask this question is this: My mother and father both did not use computer when they were young and they had sight has problems when they were around 22-23 years old, and started using eyeglasses.   On the other hand I have been looking at computers since I am 6 years old, I became a computer engineer and my life is looking at computers. Now I am 31 years old and I don't use glasses and don't have any problem with my eyes.   Even though I am genetically prone to, I did not suffer any problems. Could there be a relationship ? Or am I genetically lucky? "

This article about Common cold states, a doctor may do a throat or nasal culture, or blood test to rule out a secondary infection. If that's the case, what are those likely infection?   These article about Common cold and diagnosing (2) have given ideas on doctor asking for test, but I would like a simple explainable answer from this community. "
1299,What is the definition of Suicidal Ideation?,"Many resources on depression and suicide use the term ""suicidal ideation"" as an important sign/symptom. Some sources (e.g. Krahn, Miller, and Bergstrom, Rapid Resolution of Intense Suicidal Ideation after Treatment of Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea, 2007)      say that it alone (without anything else, like an actual suicide attempt) constitutes a medical emergency.  What is the definition of the medical term of art ""suicidal ideation""? For example, does any fleeting thought or consideration of suicide as a possible option count, or is more required? Does it require a firm conclusion that suicide is the only reasonable option? Part of me suspects that the definition is ""to think about suicide to the extent that such thinking rises to the level of a medical emergency"", but that seems like a circular definition!  This is a definitions question. I do not need help with depression or suicide! "
1300,On the mechanics of chickenpox immunity for newborns and breastmilk antibody transfer,"According to my healthcare provider, a newborn should not be affected by chicken pox if it has immunity thanks to his mother having had the infection as a child herself - this immunity is apparently womb gained and lasts roughly a year. Let's assume that the infant is also breastfed exclusively - apparently, this assists the immunity because the mother's milk contains antibodies the newborn can use for resistance to various infections.  It seems like there is thus a mechanism where antibodies can be acquired from the mother and used by an infant to fight a disease. I'm told that breastfed babies do not get sick as often as formula fed ones, because disease the mother is exposed to causes antibodies to pass from the mother to the baby in the breast milk.    is it true? I've only received this information anecdotally from midwives, but has it been subject to scientific scrutiny? Are the mechanisms well understood? (It seems unlikely to me that eating someone else's antibodies helps a person fight disease; why are the antibodies not digested and decomposed?) if true, does the newborn develop his own immunity from his own immune system, while it uses the mother's antibodies to fend off the chickenpox? Or does it replace his defence mechanism for a while (e.g the first year of life) to let him grow strong, but he will remain liable to contract illnesses like chickenpox later? if I, as an adult who has never had chickenpox myself, were to consume the breastmilk would I also benefit from enhanced resistance to chickenpox or other diseases the producer is exposed to/can generate antibodies for? Or is this antibody transfer mechanism limited to mother and child?  "
1301,"For varicella zoster(chickenpox), when are vaccination / antiviral drugs effective?","The UK does not routinely vaccinate its citizens against chickenpox though the info website of the chief healthcare provider acknowledges that vaccinations are available and there are also circumstances where antiviral drugs may be prescribed  I recently received advice from my doctor that there isn't much point in either vaccinating or prescribing drugs for chickenpox, and the consensus for adults who have never had chickenpox seems to basically be that you take your chances, suffer the infection should it be contracted and serious complications are unlikely though it's more unpleasant to contract as an adult than as a child  I'm thus confused as to why the NHS website would create one impression (steps can be taken for adults with no chickenpox immunity) and the doctor another slightly different impression (steps aren't taken..). While there isn't a direct contradiction, neither source has said when steps are taken, but the doctor implied that steps aren't taken because there is no point.  In what context would it make sense for an adult with no immunity to get vaccinated, or to take antiviral drugs?  I presume that vaccination would only be successful up to the point that said adult is exposed - walk into a party and be greeted by a child with full on chickenpox and it's too late for vaccination.. but what about antivirals? Could that adult go home, and start a course of drugs that would effectively kill any viruses they'd contracted, before developing a full blown infection of their own?  What about the situation where said adult lives with a child who wakes up one morning with a chickenpox rash? Given that the child is apparently contagious a few days before the first spot, is the adult likely too far along the infection timeline themselves for antivirals to have any effect? Is there a point of no return, beyond which AV drugs are ineffective, and for chickenpox this point is  so early that it's usually too late by the time anyone realises? "
1302,What are the long term effects of Dexedrine (for adult ADD)?,"Dexedrine is a common treatment for ADD in adults.  It is a stimulant that helps with focus and engagement in their work.  But it is an amphetamine and thus has potential for chemical dependence.  Missing a dose or stopping can lead to withdrawal symptoms like depression, anxiety, fatigue, irritability.    Therefore missing a dose may leave an individual feeling less happy, less energetic  Questions:   The longer one takes Dexedrine, will one become more reliant on it for energy/happiness/motivation?  Will the side-effects of not missing a dose get worse over the years? Are any of these effects permanent?  "
1303,"How can a BP goal be recommended, but not a diastolic or systolic goal?","Out of curiousity, I'm researching the JNC 8 guidelines for hypertension, and when reading this publication, I noticed it says:      There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion.     My question is: How can the JNC 8 recommend an overall BP goal (which consists of both diastolic and systolic measurements), yet, they don't suggest a goal for either diastolic, or systolic, depending on the age of the person? Why do they make this distiction?  "
1304,Is my diet affecting my skin?,"So I am at my wits end with acne. I've got rid of all of the spots (like the physical spots that most people would want to pop) with the help of Lymecycline (a skin antibiotic) that the doctor gave me and a spot gel she gave me, but I still have red, inflamed skin. I change my pillowcase every night on a rotor, I stopped drinking milk, I'm doing every single thing I have read online and been told because I am incredibly, incredibly angry now at this.  I don't want to come across as a picky eater, but I really find it quite hard to eat a lot of foods, primarily vegetables like peas and green beans, because I can't stand how they feel in your mouth. I also find the act of eating quite disgusting and I really hate doing it so it's quite hard for me to incorporate new foods into my diet, but I have been trying to incorporate sweet potatoes because apparently they help acne.  This is what I eat:   Breakfast. I always have a bowl of pasta with tuna in. I wanted to be able to have carbohydrates to give me energy, but at the same time, I wanted to fight acne. Tuna apparently is good for acne.  Lunch. Some days I don't eat lunch because I really just, I just hate eating. But, when I do, I have plain cous cous and nothing else, every single day. Tea. I live in England and tend to have those kinds of 'hearty' meals that are common like Sheperds Pie, Cottage Pie, meat, stuff like that. Dumplings. Curry. Those kinds of things. Often in these recipes you include carrots or parsnips but I leave these out because I don't like how they feel in your mouth.   So that's what I'm eating. I have no idea if my diet is what's giving me the inflamed skin so I have turned to Health SE for answers. I told my doctor I stopped drinking milk because it was bad for acne but she said my acne is completely hormonal and I should put milk back in because I used to have a warm glass of milk before I went to bed.  I have taken a picture of the problem so you can see it. Hang on, it's uploading.    Okay so as we can see from the image I've got 3 spots at the minute, but to be honest they'll probably go down pretty fast. The main focus isn't those - it is the inflamed, red skin.   Why do I have this red skin? What can I do to get rid of it?   I promise I will do whatever I'm told. "
1305,Mechanism of action (MOA) of Caffeine,Most people get a temporary increase in wakefulness or better ability to concentrate after caffeine intake.      There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.   Source: Wikipedia   How does caffeine block the adenosine receptors? How does it stimulate the autonomic nervous system?

1309,Has the calorie content of soda (in US) increased over the years?,"I recall reading, perhaps 25 years ago, one of those counter-intuitive factoids noting that milk had more calories than soda, ounce for ounce (but of course that this was offset by nutritional benefits of milk). I believe this was referring to skim milk, widely quoted (and presumably stable over time) at 90 calories per 8 ounces, or 135 calories per 12 ounces. And I think I remember noticing that it made sense because a 12-ounce can of (regular sweetened) soda was typically labeled as less than this -- the number I picture seeing is 120 calories.  But in recent times I see 12-ounce cans of soda labeled as at least 140 and sometimes 150+ calories, reversing the comparison that I thought used to be made. I am unable to find mention of lower calorie contents in the past or evidence of the factoid I recall (skim milk > soda). I know it is a bit ill-defined because of variation between brands/types of soda.  So: was a typical 12-ounce regular soda (Coke, Pepsi, etc.) 140-150 calories even 25 years ago? Has it increased (which I can imagine might happen gradually over time due to a stealth ""sweetness war"")? Or is my recollection off (perhaps the original comparison was to whole milk and so I'm thinking of the wrong numbers)? "
1310,What should I check before taking protein supplements?,"I read on [website]  While protein supplements may not seem dangerous, Hefford's case is a reminder of how important it can be to check with your doctor before adding them into your routine.

1313,How often should I clean my apartment?,"I understand that opinions differ viz cleaning frequency for subjective reasons: for example, some hate seeing dust, others donât mind; some clean mostly for social reasons.  But are there some studies about objective reasons for (or against?) cleaning your apartment (wrt health)?  I am especially interested in long-term, or very sudden and bad, consequences, that I might not observe until it is too late. Is more frequent cleaning correlated with lower incidence of problematic illnesses, for example? "
1314,Are vitamin C and desloratadine better absorbed when taken shortly after eating?,"I'm taking vitamin C supplements and desloratadine for my allergies.   I've heard some people saying that it's better to take your medicines right after eating because your body absorbs them better then.   I couldn't find any studies on the internet which would prove them either wrong or right.   So I'm still wondering whether my medicines will have a better effect if I consume them with food.   Will they really work better when taken with food? If so, why? "
1315,"Meaning of ""potential pharmacogenetic characterisation might also be evaluated so that these syndromes are treated at an earlier age.""","This could be offtopic because this might be just a case of sloppy phrasing and a case of ""asking to guess what the authors really meant"". A quote from an abstract (GTP-cyclohydrolase deficiency responsive to sapropterin and 5-HTP supplementation: relief of treatment-refractory depression and suicidal behaviour):     Our hope is that other patients presenting with treatment-refractory, life-threatening depression will be evaluated for defects in this pathway. A brief summary of the scientific bases for selecting the replacement therapies is included. For future research, we propose that potential pharmacogenetic characterisation might also be evaluated so that these ârareâ syndromes are treated, if possible, at an earlier age.     Besides the fact that ""characterization"" cannot be ""evaluated"", I can't understand how assessing the pharmacogenetics of sapropterin or some other drug (?) could help treat the syndrome at an earlier age. What exactly do the authors mean?   My guess is that they mean that ""some drug used on the patient could cause this syndrome in some yet unknown way"". I base my guess on this passage from the text (free full text is available):     The metabolic profile reported here is unique to GTPCH deficiency or a defect in the GTP activator protein. While there is no known demonstrated defect in this protein, it would cause similar functional deficiency. Other enzymatic defects in the pterin synthetic pathway present with very different metabolic profiles. It should be noted that little is known about alterations or responses in this pathway with neuroactive metabolic agents. For example, there could be non-specific secondary changes mimicking deficiencies that are not clinically relevant. Alterations in the pathway could be related to a pathophysiologic process or even pharmacotherapy.   Am I right? Or maybe we should read ""genetics"" instead of ""pharmacogenetics"" - this could make the phrase clear in the sense that ""we should get to the genetic roots of these syndromes""? In this case, all seemingly becomes understandable.  "
1316,How likely is the seasonal flu shot to protect you from a flu pandemics?,"I've seen various sources (notably the government of Canada) saying it was ""unlikely"", but how unlikely?

ETA: I just read ""There is a chance that seasonal flu shots would confer some protection against the avian flu virus H5N1, which has raised fears of a deadly global outbreak.

1318,Does corrective eye surgery for affect the ability to focus similar to corrective lenses?,"If corrective lenses adjust the point at which the eyes focus and, for a strong correction, inhibit the ability to focus at the opposing distance, will corrective eye surgery affect vision in the same way?  For example, will corrective eye surgery for someone with extreme nearsightedness reduce or inhibit their ability to focus on objects up close?  I am wondering if such an extreme correction would require someone to trade their lenses for nearsightedness (pre-surgery) for farsighted lenses, as they would lose their ability to focus up close? "

My sister hasn't gotten a URTI in the past five years previously. But since  starting Epuris in Sep. 2018, her GP has diagnosed her with a URTI monthly. Is there any evidence that isotretinoin indirectly causes these URTI? Some unsubstantiated commmenters allege ""yes"":      Posted October 28, 2007      Your body is under a lot of additional stress, which makes your body more prone to sickness.

Are there any tools readily available for that that do that automatically? If so, which? "
1321,Defining CPT 88184 Flow cytometry 1st marker,"There are differing opinions in my office about how to bill for flow cytometry testing.  To elucidate the difference, I need to give an example:  A patient has blood drawn in the morning.  The doctor orders two different flow panels to be tested.  Later that day, the doctor decides to draw blood again, and order a third flow panel. The pathologist issues 3 separate reports: 1 for each panel.  There are three interpretations of how to deal with the ""1st marker"" code (88184):   Only one instance of 88184 is allowed per patient per day: In this example, 88184 would be billed once. One instance of 88184 is allowed per draw: In this example, 88184 would be billed twice. One instance of 88184 is allowed per issued report: In this example, 88184 would be billed thrice.   Which interpretation is correct? More importantly, can you provide a reliable reference supporting your answer? "

1323,What percentage of fillings performed today are done with mercury amalgam?,"There's a lot of talk on the internet that mercury amalgam fillings are toxic and should not be done. In the 20 years since my first cavity I've only received metals-free composite fillings. My current dentist informs me that composite fillings are qualitatively better, while disregarding the health concerns with amalgams. This has made me wonder, what percentage of fillings performed today are done with mercury amalgam? In other words, I have a suspicion that it is an increasingly irrelevant problem.     I've tried the basic Google searching for an answer, but results on the topic are obfuscated by reports concerning the percentage of mercury in fillings, rather than percentage amalgam fillings administered.  I did find:     According to the American Dental Association (ADA), more than 100 million silver-amalgam fillings are placed in American mouths each year.      ...      As a sign of the times, in 1999, around 86 million composite restorations were placed in the United States, as against 71 million amalgam restorations.     Is it the end of the road for dental amalgam? A critical review - Journal of Conservative Dentistry   I'd like something more current though. Plus, I don't know if the sum of those figures represents the total.  Data about the United states is preferred, but any data is accepted as useful. "

1327,"Is phototherapy (light therapy) of any use to treat a tendinopathy? If so, what is the optimal phototherapy treatment (session length, light type â¦)?","Is phototherapy (light therapy) of any use to treat a tendinopathy, and if so, what is the optimal phototherapy treatment (session length, type of light, etc.)?    I have read some case studies and RCTs that seem to indicate phototherapy (light therapy) is useful to treat a tendinopathy, but the tested phototherapy treatments seem to vary between studies.   Examples:  [website]  Nora Miller was an avid, lifelong runner who had completed five marathons when she strained her Achilles tendon during the summer of 2014. Rather than abandon her regimen, Miller, a 42-year-old exercise physiology researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, pushed through the pain, hoping she could tough it out. But that only further inflamed the tendon, leaving her idle and frustrated with her inability to heal. ""I was desperate to get back to running,"" Miller says. (Try these 5 strategies to boost your spirits and heal faster when you've been sidelined by a fitness injury).      She mentioned her plight to Janis Eells, a colleague in UWM's College of Health Sciences. Eells, a professor of biomedical sciences, suggested that Miller try using a handheld device that would expose her tendon to red light for 90 seconds a day, 3 out of every 4 days. ""I was scheduled to have a painful platelet-rich plasma injection in 12 hours, and I canceled it,"" she says. ""The way Janis described the research and how enthusiastic she was, I thought, Why not give it a try?""      After 2 months of using the device and going to physical therapy, Miller began a walking program that incorporated some jogging. By October, she'd run her sixth marathon, eventually qualifying for the Boston Marathon.

1328,How common is it for local anesthesia to have no effect?,"I had a couple fillings done today at the dentist. One on the top and one on the bottom. The top filling went fine with no issues.  For the second filling, the first injection of local anesthesia didn't work at all. After I felt severe pain she did a second injection. This time I noticed some mild effect, but it still hurt severely. A third one didn't help.  We persevered and the filling was (painfully) completed. But I'm curious how common this is? and what are the possible causes?   I'd never experienced local anesthesia not working before, and I'd be lying if I said it hasn't made me more hesitant to go to the dentist in future due to the fear it wont work again.  Note: This is not in anyway me seeking medical advice. I'm just genuinely curious why this might have happened. "
1329,Can your finger bones grow thicker after extreme pressure or use?,"I've noticed that after I put extreme, ridiculous pressure on my fingers one night, my fingers for the last week look really chunky, a lot rougher and thicker. I feel like it's the bones themselves, not retention. If, very hypothetically, you put as much pressure on them as you would in 1 year in a few days, would there be the same amount of change? I know I sound like a hypochondriac, but would it technically be possible? Would the bones go back to their original size after less use? "
1330,Use of injection containing both insulin and glucose,"I'm not a medicine person (and not a chemist), and the question is mostly theoretical.  I've been thinking about how and why glucose and insulin are used and hwo they work, and I have several questions:  1) Would insulin and glucose react in a container?   From what I've found, they probably shouldn't, but googling is a bit difficult, as most results are about how they work together inside an organism.  2) Can an injection containing both insulin and glucose be used for rapid energy regain in case of physical exhaustion?  Here's what I found so far:  IV Glucose solution is used in china for energy regain, but actually has same effect as drinking sweet water (can be administered if drinking isn't posible though).  There's been some research of use glucose together with insulin for ketotic cows (looks promising, though there were only 12 cows in the experiment). [website]IV Glucose solutions are usually 5 or 10 percent (at least what I found), and it's mostly used for drips, not injections (sorry if I messed with terms, but I hope you'll understand). As far as I understand that's because injecting too much glucose too fast would be bad (lead to hyperglycemia?). This leads to the next question:  3) If glucose is administered together with insulin, could it be done as an injection and with a higher concentration?  I'm sorry if those are newbie questions and anyone who's been to any kind of medical school knows the answer. I've tried googling in different ways, but couldn't find an answer.  UPD: I am totally NOT going to inject anyone with anything. I'm writing a book and need to know if this could work (after thorough calculations and tests and everything).  UPD 2. Some details of the story:  There are people who can go berserk (and be stronger, faster, etc than usually). The effect is similar an adrenalin rush, but can last for a while and can be induced and cancelled at will (after some training). Physiologically these berserks are no different from regular people (or at least not in a way detectable by modern medicine). My guess for now is that they just somehow can control (at least partially) existing system of stress response.  This berserk state drains energy a lot (yeah, the description would match worldbuilding.se better, that is why I didn't want to post it here) and it's crucial to restore energy as quickly as possible after. My idea is that you can inject 50% (or maybe even more) glucose solution, but I doubt you could drink it, so volume is much less, which is good. Also, if something didn't go exactly as expected, the berserk might pass out on exiting the berserk state, then drinkable treatment is definitely not an option.  For sure, the treatment is complex and contains other things that need restoring. It might be not glucose+insulin, but I thought it might be an interesting solution, as it allows creating substitute treatment given access to any drug store.  Total misunderstanding of human physiology might also be the case. Then I'm sorry to have bothered you. "

1335,Exercise-Induced Asthma Daily Medication Use Short and Long Term Effects?,"I have Exercise-Induced Asthma.  I only feel satisfied when I'm either exhausted or when my muscles won't push any further. In general I don't like medication, I've always at least tried to have my body cure the disease, and at this point I almost never get sick. But Asthma is a chronic disease so there's no way around it. I've been given medication, which I have not been using, despite all the headaches, chest pain, and all around unpleasantness. But I can't reach my limits, and my thing isn't really building muscle, so I need to be able to train. A lot. I've decided it'd be best to take medication, otherwise I'm not getting anywhere.  What I want to know is whether there are any long term usage secondary effects. I know from experience there are short term ones - I feel some chest pain while training and if I use it daily (because I have tried it in the past, when I was diagnosed), whenever I stop using it, I feel the effects of Asthma a hell of a lot more. I did it for a week and when I stopped, I found that the next day I felt breathlessness simply getting out of bed.  If I were to use the medication that has been prescribed to me daily, how serious are or how serious can these previously described ""short-term symptoms"" get? Are there any long-term ones? And if so, how serious are they? "

1338,What happens if a regular person is given osteoporosis medication (Bisphosphonates)?,"Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and lose mass/strength. So medication for osteoporosis increases bone mass and makes them stronger.   My question is: what happens if a regular person with perfectly fine bones is given osteoporosis medication (Bisphosphonates)? Is their bone density going to increase or is the body going to simply ignore it and pass it out?  (Part of the below has been included into the question from the comments) Every adult person (normal or sick) has two ongoing processes in their bones - resorption (older bone tissue gets absorbed) and regeneration (new bone tissue gets created and added to bone structure).   Osteoporosis occurs when the rate of resorption is greater than the rate of regeneration - more bone being absorbed than is being created, thus leading to lower bone mass/density. This typically occurs in older patients whose bodies' regenerative capacity is starting to decrease.   Bisphosphonates (osteoporosis medication) are supposed to act by inhibiting the resorption of bone tissue. (If the mechanism is different, please do clarify in the comments or an answer.) Is there any reason this should happen only in a person with an already reduced rate of regeneration (something like the action of a catalyst which depends on the relative ratio of something and not on the absolute number)?.   Or, is the action of a bisphosphonate simply to reduce the rate of resorption (so that the new rate of resorption matches that of the naturally reduced rate of regeneration)?   In case it is the latter, is it not to be expected that the chemical will do the exact same thing (reduce the rate of resorption) in a normal person (whose bone regeneration rate is still the same) as well as a patient? Could this, in a healthy person, lead to the bones becoming more dense/massive than is normal? "
1339,Does regular intake of (packaged) butter increase the risk of cancer?,"I've heard some rumours from my peers that eating packaged butter on a daily basis could increase the risk of cancer.

I understand the need to have different signs for different letters in different languages that don't use the same alphabet so that spellings can be different for their respective native tongue, but... is there an entire new system of sign language for each language?   I know nothing about braille, but was wondering how many different forms of braille there are? Since it's reading letters... I imagine it would have a different system for each alphabet system, right? Or is it more complicated than that?   Please do enlighten me on this.

1342,Lasik Operation Choice,"I went to two different eye doctors, both with good reputations, requesting and asking to do a lasik operation on my eyes.  The first one said he would do and ""Ultra-lasik"" operation, because it is the most recent, quickest and has very low recovery time.  The second one said I needed the original ""lasik"" operation, because my eyes thankfully have no problems. (He said the original lasik is used with people whose eyes have no problem, femtolasik for people with fewer-than-normal cornea layers, ultralasik for people with even fewer cornea layers, and femto-smile for people that have so few layers that they can't even open the eye flap they open to do the operation (I am not sure of the exact name of this flap)).

1346,Is there a difference between anti-anxiety and anti-depression drugs?,"I've recently come across two terms ""Anxiolytic drugs"" and ""Anti-depressant drugs"". I wanted to know how they differ from each other; if they do.  I mean, sure, ""anxiety"" isn't the same as ""depression"" but do the effects of these drugs differ widely (so much, that they're classified under different names)?  For example, Chlorodiazepoxide is classified as an anxiolytic drug, while Phenelzine is classified as an anti-depressant. Say I had a patient A who's been prescribed Chlorodiazepoxide; patient B has been prescribed Phenelzine by a different physician. Barring possible allergic reactions, or some kind of known sensitivity to either drug, could they possibly take each other's medication and hope for more or less, the same effect? As in; A takes Phenelzine, but B takes Chlorodiazepoxide.

However, I could not find any similar collection for smoking mariujana.  I believe smoking anything is worse than any kind of alcohol since  (i) alcohol harms only after a long time of regular consumption whereas it takes only one pack of smoking something to be addicted, and  (ii) the lungs cannot fully clean themselves but only the bad effects, whereas liver can refresh itself, and the body unless it is permenantly damaged.

1358,Should Neosporin never be used?,"I read on [website]  1 NeosporinÂ®      Neosporin is a combination of 3 different topical antibiotics-Neomycin   Sulfate, Polymyxin B and Bacitracin Zinc.  They say you should use it   on âevery cut, every timeâ and claim that it will heal cuts and   scrapes in half the time.  There are two reasons why I have banned   Neosporin from my house.      First, non-infected wounds donât heal any faster with Neosporin than   with vaseline, at least not in any credible study that was performed   by a 3rd party instead of a drug company.  When it comes to simple   wound healing, washing the wound with soap and water and then keeping   it covered with Vaseline is king.  Many products claim faster wound   healing, but there arenât any randomized controlled trials that show a   better response than vaseline.  Can you think of an easier study to   do?      Second, Neomycin sulfate was allergen of the year in 2010.  Bacitracin   was allergen of the year in 2003.  With repeated usage, about 10% of   people will develop allergy to either of these topical antibiotics.    Using them on open wounds on the legs is particularly prone to cause   allergy to develop.  When allergies to these antibiotics occur,   patients develop a poison ivy like reaction on areas where they use   them (like what you see in the photograph featured in this blog post).   In addition, some patients with bacitracin allergy have developed   anaphylactic shock.  Patients with severe neomycin allergies are   unable to receive some vaccines.      I never use Neosporin and see no reason to ever use it.â   Should Neosporin never be used? "
1359,Why are we being advised to eat large breakfasts and small and early suppers?,"The common advice is that people should eat large breakfasts (that are supposed to support energy for the whole day), medium-sized dinners and lunches, and to reduce supper to only a snack and eat it no later than a few hours before going to bed (late or large suppers are accused for causing obesity and reducing sleep quality).  To be honest, I fail to understand this advice. My thinking is that:   Digestion isnât instant; early and small suppers will fail to provide energy for the mornings, and the body will only be able to use energy from the breakfast after a few hours, so however large the breakfasts are, following this advice will make you powerless in the mornings (and put you in need to drink a lot of coffee); For the same reason (that digestion isnât instant) late and large suppers will not make you fat, but instead will provide you energy for the morning. As the ancient Romans were saying, âplenus venter non studet libenterâ. Indeed, being full makes many people, me including, very sleepy. Following this advice would make it necessary to ignore the signs your body sends to you. Conversely, it is very hard to fall asleep when hungry. And even if I manage to achieve this goal, I often tend to wake up far too early, because my hunger wakes me up.   And, most importantly,   This advice seems to oppose natural instincts: both little children and animals sleep when full, and wake up and become active later on. Unlike human adults, little children and animals follow their insticts and do what the ânatureâ or evolution âwantsâ them to do. Following this advice means that one has to force themselves to do the opposite; it would seem that doctors who advice to eat large breakfasts and small and early suppers want to be âwiserâ than the evolution.   Where am I wrong? Why does the advice to eat large breakfasts and small and early suppers advice hold?  Disclaimer: I am actually not advocating here that we should eat large and late suppers and small breakfasts. I understand that in spite of my way of thinking and my feelings it still may be the case that eating small and early suppers and large breakfast is most optimal. It is just that when my thinking leads me to results that may apparently be wrong, I would very much like to see where my error lies. "
1360,Nature vs. Nurture: Is there any truth behind an ethnicity being predisposed to alcoholism?

His son, my maternal uncle, is also an alcoholic and has had his life completely destroyed from this terrible addiction (ruined two marriages, none of his children will talk to him, lost his job, his home, and many friends, etc). My siblings and I don't have never touched alcohol due to religious reasons, but can one be predisposed to be an alcoholic? Looking at my family line, though from my vantage point (because of limited knowledge of my ancestral line), it seems to be from my maternal side... so I was wondering if it's in my mitochondrial-dna?   I know that the Native Americans often have a bad reputation in regards to their interaction with alcohol, but I know that there are many, many different reasons (beyond medical) that contributed to that, which... is truly unfortunate. But I don't want to go down that road (History Exchange). However, I have also heard that there is something in certain Native American genes that predisposes us to becoming alcoholics.... but how true is this statement?

1361,"Do children with Willam's Syndrome (WS) skip the the phase of ""stranger-anxiety""?","Stranger anxiety is a normal phase in the developmental process of an infant, which reaches its apex, more or less, between 6-12 months in age (though it may certainly linger longer). While as parents,we often get embarrassed when we bring the in-laws, best friends, coworkers, and neighbors around and our children are screaming their heads off out of fear -- the ""stranger-anxiety"" phase is very typical, and assumingly an evolutionary trait that we as humans have kept because of the proverbial ""stranger-danger"" sentiment.   However, I was wondering if children who have been diagnosed with Willam's Syndrome (WS) skip the ""stranger-anxiety"" phase all together? Yes, William's Syndrome has a long list of physical and mental abnormalities, but they are also known for being excessively (abnormally so) friendly and social... so are they developmentally delayed in the sense that they skip the ""stranger-anxiety"" milestone?

1363,Chronic tonsillitis after tonsillectomy,"A topic is rather strange right? Tonsillitis is an inflammatory condition of tonsils and there is pretty much nothing after the conventional tonsillectomy. Nevertheless this is what it seems to look like.  The case. My gf, 22, had been suffering from chronic tonsillitis since childhood. Lacune samples always showed presence of Streptococcus Aureus. Antiseptic treatment by a wide range of local antiseptics (including the Chlorophyllipt, and rather uncommon Brilliant Green) in best cases gave temporary relief, in most cases there was no effect.   A year ago she underwent Tonsillectomy without any complications, however the pain remained. Moreover, something similar to tonsillar lacunae started to form where the tonsils used to be (abscess?).   I'm no medic, but considering inefficiency of antiseptics, I strongly suspect an autoimmune reaction. To support this idea, she had Pityriasis rosea in anamnesis a couple of years earlier which had been symptomatically treated with local steroids.  We had visited lots and lots of doctors. The case seems to be unconventional and nobody seems to care so this is my desperate attempt to request for fresh opinion on what should we do next. "

1365,Claustrophobia in the Pyramids of Giza: Does height play a role in who is more likely to suffer from Claustrophobia?,"I'm an archaeologist, but I am not the Indiana Jones type (tall and brawny) -- but rather, a very petite female (4'9"" to be precise). One might say, that I lack the muscle tone and strength to do all the physical labor one would expect from an archaeologist, and they are certainly accurate. But what I lack in physical strength, I make up for in my small stature (and brains -- at least in terms of archaeology). For instance, I am often the only one on the team able to fit and crawl into tiny tomb openings and document the archaeological site lurking underneath the surface, or slide down into a tight pit and document an artifact, or squeeze inside an ancient chamber and able to report back to the rest of the team what I have discovered. Tight spaces have never been an issue for me.   However, on a day-off from excavating in Egypt, myself and a few crew members went to the Pyramids of Giza, of course. We had the opportunity to enter and all of us fared the ""Ascending Passage"" with ease, though my tallish coworker started muttering complaints about how tight it was (but no one thought anything of it because it was indeed tight... but we all expected that... and none of us really cared all that much because we were in the FREAKIN' PYRAMIDS). But as we continued to ascend it got dramatically hotter and humid (less ventilation) and although we reached the Grand Gallery, where it's more spacious than the ""Ascending Passage,"" the optical allusion is such that the walls are closing in on you. It is here, in the heart of the pyramid, that my coworker must have been feeling a ""fight or flight"" instinct because she requested that we return around that instant. She was afraid that she couldn't breathe. Though we are archaeologists in the most iconic Wonder of the Ancient World, we are not soulless and we would gladly accompany her out (and just come back in without her afterwards). However, because the ascending passage is so tight... it is systematized in a way that you can't go backwards (there's a huge crowd of people behind you, which I think only increased her fears). We had to go all the way to the top (King's Chamber) and wait for the designated time to then descend and exit the pyramid. There in the King's Chamber, she started balling and exhibiting what appeared to be a full-blown panic attack. She felt like she was suffocating. We all tried to keep her calm, but we didn't know what to do... we were literally trapped in the tomb with her.   The Interior Layout of the Pyramid   Ascending the ""Grand Hall""   Eventually, when we did exit the pyramid, she admitted she suffered from claustrophobia, but that she put it aside because she is an Egyptologist and it had been her lifelong dream to enter the pyramid. She was really embarrassed about it. And I kept telling her not to feel embarrassed about it (because to be fair, it was a very humid, dingy, crowded, tight atmosphere -- we were literally trapped in a tomb).   I never did ask her the cause of her claustrophobia (I don't even know if she would know), but:   How common is claustrophobia? What are the causes? Naturally, classical-conditioning would be one (having had a bad experience of being trapped in a tight place before), but is something in the amygdala transmitting these fears??  Do taller people tend to be more claustrophobic than the shorter people?  "

Additionally, my body is proportional so I don't think anyone has ever seriously considered the fact that I may indeed be a dwarf -- a proportionate dwarf.   I have been teased my entire life for my height. For instance, I can't sit in any chair without having my feet dangle, I cannot look in a peep-hole in a door, I cannot take my clothes out of the laundry machine without a step-stool and a long pair of prongs, I am too short to drive go-carts (but can drive a real car), I'm too short to ride a bike -- I can't touch the ground, etc. But these are merely nuisances -- not critical problems -- except when it comes to walking. I simply cannot keep up with anyone even though I'm walking at twice or triple the speed of everyone else (which often wares me out and causes resentment on whoever is with me).   Besides all this, I have come across time and time again that adult females under 4'10"" are considered dwarfs, which I a fall under (I'm 4'9"")-- even if barely.   [website]  In humans, dwarfism is sometimes defined as an adult height of less   than 4 feet 10 inches   [website]  Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical   condition. Dwarfism is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet   10 inches (147 centimeters) or less.      Proportionate dwarfism. A body is proportionately small if all parts   of the body are small to the same degree and appear to be proportioned   like a body of average stature. Medical conditions present at birth or   appearing in early childhood limit overall growth and development.   [website]  Dwarfism is a condition of short stature. It is defined by the   advocacy group Little People of America (LPA) as an adult height of 4   feet 10 inches or under, as a result of a medical or genetic   condition.   I've known this information for awhile, and every time I mention it to a friend or family they just quickly shut me up with ""No you're not!"" I don't know if they are trying to boost my self-esteem or that my proportional body gives a false perception, but I seem to fit the diagnosis to the letter (the congenital bone deformities that stunted my growths and have caused me to remain within the category for ""little person"" or whatever term is preferred. I'm not looking for sympathy (because I am who I am), but why do people act like it's shameful/outrageous if I'm a dwarf? I know I'm taller than most (I'm not wanting attention), but why not call it for what it is? Why this social taboo?  "

1369,Pneumothorax first aid,"I've heard a questionable advice about open pneumothorax first aid from a school nurse and would like to ask if it is legit. I do see the reasoning behind it but it seems like attempting such thing could go horribly wrong.  When i googled about pneumothorax first aid it just says that you should cover the hole (wound) with something that would not allow air to go through while the injured person has his/her chest compressed (breath out). So that when he/she tries to take a breath in the lung will be open by decreased pressure in the chest instead of sucking air through the hole.  However the advice i've heard was to go a step further and create an improvised valve that would let air out but not inside. This is achieved by placing some material that does not let air go through over the hole but only fixing the top side of it.  So when the pressure inside injured person's chest is lowered this bandage would be pressed onto the hole by the air outside and close it.  But when the air/fluid wants to escape through the hole it would go freely.  And in case of absolute emergency and lack of better options she said we can use a credit card for it (as a flap).  The question is:   could it theoretically work? if it could work at least theoretically, how much better would it be than ordinary airtight bandage? should a person without medical education attempt it? would a person with medical education attempt it? what could go wrong and what are the chances?  "
1370,How do doctors deal with fear of blood?,"For me personally it is very hard to watch scenes from movies/documentaries where the surgeon cuts patient's skin.  I don't get any discomfort from seeing blood or wounds but it's almost unbearable to watch as the doctor slowly cuts patient's skin with a scalpel (much less so if it's a quick motion).   Punctures (injections) are not that bad but still uncomfortable (weirdly, i did not feel any discomfort from watching the doctor take vein blood sample from my own arm).  I suppose there might be people who despite having similar discomfort might want to overcome it and become doctors. Do they have some training in medical school that helps them get used to these things? Or such people are simply seen an unfit for being a surgeon like if they for example had tremor? "

1372,Do percussive massages help treating a tendinopathy?,"I read on [website]  What is Percussive Massage?   Percussive massage is a breakthrough treatment for soft tissue pain.  Percussive massage accelerates the growth and repair of tissues by providing concentrated, rapid, short-duration pulses deep into the tissues of the body.  This heavily increases blood flow to the area causing pain relief and an increasing range of motion and function.  Percussive massage also provides a gentle stretch to the muscles and connective tissues improving responsiveness and performance.      What are the Benefits of Percussive Massage?   Percussive massage and muscle stimulation are beneficial in a variety of medical and cosmetic applications, including:         Relaxing of thickened connective tissue and fascia.   Breaking down of adhesions and internal scar tissue, present after injuries or surgery.   Increased venous and lymphatic circulation.   Elongating muscle fiber, especially when spasms, stiffness and restrictions are present.   Increase range of movement by relieving stiff joints.         How do I Know if Percussive Therapy is Right for Me?   Percussive therapy is for anyone interested in injury correction, injury prevention, and sports performance.

1373,Did I catch a cold from eating unwashed fruit?,"Recently I caught a cold in presumably an amazingly short period of time (~6h). From prior infections I had the experience to have 24 to 48 hours ""left"" being a bit ill, before being forced to stay in bed. Observing my disease I asked myself what went different this time. In general I don't get ill too easy.   Morning: got to work as usual feeling reasonably well 12pm: ate some sushi bought from a supermarket ~3 pm: ate a bowl of strawberries - unwashed 6pm: already felt a scratchy throat 9pm: having a Skype call planning some event, starting to have a headache  11pm: falling to bed really exhausted I did not have contact with visibly ill people during that day.   My theory now is, that the unwashed strawberries carried the pathogen. Here are some thoughts that might support this:   Since I got hit so fast I'm assuming being exposed to a high number of bacteria. The pathogens where possibly passed by an ill harvester. Strawberries being sweet, moist and un-chilled seem to be the perfect fertile ground for reproduction. The incubation period of colds is usually a lot longer (2-5 days). Does a higher number of bacteria result in a shorter incubation period? Washing the strawberries would have helped. The bacteria was just on the surface area, since the vessels of the strawberries of course where not alive anymore.   Am I right with my assumptions or did I miss something? I'd like you to confirm or debunk my theory of getting ill.  Thank you! "

1377,Coffee for solving sleep problems?,"In this post I asked whether Coffee use could cause an increase in adenosine levels as a result of the bodyâs adjustment to lower adenosine receptor activation. An answer stated that coffee use increases adenosine receptors in the long term.   This got me thinking: If someone has sleep probems, whether due to insomnia or due to stress, could this problem be solved by drinking coffee in the morning?  This would cause adenosine receptor activation to go down in the day, causing reduced drowsiness during the day, and cause a long term increase in receptors, so that when the coffee wears off in the evening, there should be an increase in drowsiness at night.   This combination of increased night-time drowsiness and decreased day-time drowsiness seems to be precisely what people with sleep problems need, and yet sleep professionals always seem to advice against using coffee for people with sleep problems.   Is my hypothesis correct? How does this square with sleep professionals advice against coffee?   (Obviously this would certainly not work if you drink coffee in the evening). "
1378,Is hydrothorax considered as edema?,"In _Robbins Basic Pathology 9th ed., edema is defined as      [E]dema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid within tissues. Extravascular fluid can also    collect in body cavities such as the pleural cavity (hydrothorax), the pericardial cavity (hydropericardium), or the peritoneal cavity (hydroperitoneum, or ascites).   Though hydrothorax is mentioned here in relation to edema, it is not mentioned explicitly whether it is actually a subtype of edema or not. I also looked into multiple sources for edema definition; âaccumulation of fluid in the interstitumâ; interstitium refers to the tiny spaces between cells which is not the case for hydrothorax since pleural cavity is not interstitium (right?). So is hydrothorax considered as a subtype of edema? "
1379,Mechanism of retrograde propagation of arterial thrombi,"Quoting from _Robbins Basic Pathology 9th ed.     Thrombi are focally attached to the    underlying vascular surface and tend to propagate toward   the heart; thus, arterial thrombi grow in a retrograde direction from the point of attachment, while venous thrombi    extend in the direction of blood flow.   Whatâs the underlying mechanism of this retrograde propagation? Shouldnât the blood flow cause the thrombus to propagate away from the heart in case of arteries? If not, then what explains the difference in propagation direction between arteries and veins? "
1380,Abnormal thyroid function and obesity - known links?,"In conversations regarding the increasing number of people that are obese (in an American or European context), often times claims regarding thyroid function being a significant contributor to these developments come up. I've tried finding sources written by medical experts addressing a lay audience to clarify these issues, but I can't find anything that makes the issue clear enough for me.  Question(s):    Is there a known causal relationship that goes ""abnormal thyroid function -> higher weight""? I don't know whether thyroid issues develop later in life or are congenital, or how much of an impact they have, so this question might be ill-phrased. If abnormal thyroid function is known to have effects on weight gain, can we quantify how many people are affected by this, and how much weight gain per person is caused by this? Are there thyroid conditions that make it extremely difficult not to put on weight (say, you continue to put on weight despite eating less than 1000 calories a day), and if so, do we know how many people are affected by those conditions?  "
1381,How much washing up liquid do we ingest per year and how harmful is it?,"When cleaning a bowl with washing up liquid, I notice that even after rinsing, bubbles still form on the surface. A trace of washing up liquid remains on the plate or cutlery.   We must ingest trace amounts of washing up liquid every day. We are literally eating detergent.   Now, I'm sure these products have all been tested etc. But what kind of health effects would the detergent cause to our insides?  Could it be, for example, that 1 out of a million deaths are actually caused by our ingestion of washing up liquid? Have there been any studies on this?  Edit: Also note that a lot of people don't adequately rinse as in this article.  "

So are there specific lamps that have been proven not to have a negative effect on your sleep cycle if you use them before bed?  Alternatively, if there are no such perfect lamps, which lamps are scientifically shown to be optimal for evening use for promoting healthy sleep, and how bad are they compared to using no lights at all in the evening?  (I know that some lamps are marketed as such, but I don't know the science behind it.) "
1383,"What procedures do dentists use for cleaning teeth, is there variation, and what is the rationale?","I am curious if there is a standard regimen that a dentist uses for cleaning teeth, how standardized it is, and what is the rationale for that process over say some other.   The process my dentist seems to use is to ask me to swig with peroxyl swish it around for 30 seconds and then spit it out. What's going on with that?   Then he/she tends to scrape up and down between the teeth as an inspection of how much tartar has been built up. Then with a water rinse he scrapes specific areas and uses a cavitron machine/water pick like thing, but I think there two he/she is mostly working in between the surfaces. This tool also has access to the back of the teeth.  Then finally does he apply toothpaste, and again he applies to the the back of the teeth as well as front. The time spent on this phase seems pretty small in contrast to the time with scraping the teeth either with a dental tool or the cavitron.  Is this standard? Any thoughts on why this process or another one?  Notes regarding the accepted answer:   Although the accepted answer is informative and detailed, it focuses on the ""periodontal"" aspects, which doesn't cover the part at the beginning where the dentists asks me to rinse my mouth, sometimes with water or with some bluish stuff that when I asked was called peroxyl. Nor the part where he/she applies toothpaste. I believe most dentists as part of their routine do something with the swish at the beginning, and toothpaste. Also, dentists periodically take xrays to look for cavities.  The answer is also a little light on the benefit of each of the steps, or why things are done in that order if it matters. One can kind of read between the lines to infer why each step might be useful and why a particular step might be done before another. Part of understanding and improving such process requires a little understanding and introspection of what needs to be done, how each step achieves that, and what are the alternative ways to achieve the various goals.  There can be a bit of fuzziness (if not a lack of critical thought) when it comes to dental processes and explanations.  "
1384,Does boiling milk really make the nutrients in it less useful to the body when ingesting it?,"Does âdenaturingâ nutrients in milk by boiling it make them less useful, or actually more useful, as they undergo âdenaturationâ anyway during digestion? I've read online that boiling milk ""denatures"" nutrients such as protein, calcium and others contained in milk, rendering the milk less nutritious. At the same time, I've also read that because the nutrients in milk (and other foods) undergo ""denaturation"" in our body during digestion anyway, boiling it will not make milk less nutritionally valuable, and will actually help the body to more readily absord the nutrients in it into the bloodstream right after ingestion. What is the truth in this matter? Thanks for any knowledgeable answers!  I put the word ""denature"" in quotes because it's a technical term and I'm not really sure in which ways it can correctly be used. "
1385,How hot before someone gets heat exhaustion while running?,"I myself have gotten heat exhaustion once but that was while sitting still in a sauna. I knew to get out when I was dizzy. I gently collapsed onto the floor, still conscious. I noticed something odd happened. Well first off I repeatedly blinked slowly which I expected. But also, at first, even lifting my head an inch would make me dizzy. But as time passed, I could lift myself up further until an hour after collapse, I was back to normal.  But I was wondering, if someone is running to exercise and it is hot outside, how hot does it have to be before heat exhaustion sets in and they need to stop running? For me in the sauna, it took a temperature over 120 degrees Fahrenheit to make me dizzy and even then, the amount of time it took was 45 minutes between getting in the sauna and getting dizzy. But I know that exercise would lower the temperature and time needed. I think it would be closer to 100 degrees ambient temperature before it sets in and here is my hypothesis as to why:  Hypothesis   So, assuming the person in question does not have a condition that prevents him/her from sweating and is hydrated and has snacks or has eaten a meal not all that long before he/she started running so that dehydration and hunger aren't a factor here, the sweating and temperature play a role.   Sweating helps initially because it cools the body. But while you are running, you emit heat from your muscles working. Running involves most of the muscles of the body so that is a lot of heat. This heat goes into the cooler air, up to a point.  At some point the ambient temperature right around you will be in equilibrium to the amount of heat from the muscles. This is when the heat will start building up. At this point, sweating isn't sufficient to cool down much, if at all. Once sweating becomes insufficient, it is only time before that person gets dizzy.   If that person gets dizzy and collapses in consciousness, that person has heat exhaustion. Becomes unconscious and body temperature rises, heatstroke. In either case, cooling down and more importantly getting out of the heat is a priority but heat exhaustion is less urgent than heatstroke is.  So am I right about how someone would get heat exhaustion while running and also, am I right that near 100 degrees Fahrenheit would be the air temperature at which this will start happening? "
1386,"What is the difference between free sugars and non-free sugars, both chemically and medically?","Background  On this WHO entry  I read that free sugars must be limited in our diet. The limit is around 5% of the carbohydrates intake.  Firstly, I'm quite confused with the difference between free and non free sugars. I would guess it is related to mono and polysaccharides. More I supposed glucose would be a great nutrient as we need lot of carbohydrates, and it is ready for glucolysis.   Also the brain needs about 20% of carbohydrates intake - again I can't see why not glucose. In short: I cant understand what's the problem with free sugars.  Question  On this context I wonder:  What is the difference of free and non free sugars?  And why not to eat directly glucose? "

1388,Medical relevance of tetanus vaccination,"As somebody who has recently come into contact between another person's blood and/or other fluids and a cut on my hand should I ask them for the year of their most recent tetanus shot? As far as I am aware that only provides them immunity and has no herd immunity effect for others and so no application to me. I've already gotten their records for other things that seemed relevant, but my uncle says I should find out. This person is likely to give me a hard time if I simply demand it so I was hoping you could tell me if there was any benefit before I bothered.   My questions are:    Can one contract tetanus from contact with other persons bodily fluids via cut on the skin? Does tetanus vaccination of the person whose fluids one came into contact with matter? / Is tetanus vaccination of the person whose blood I came in contact with medically relevant for me?  "

1392,Does looking at monitors fatigue the eye muscles and/or affect overall fatigue?,"I will most likely spend a lot of my lifetime staring at (computer) monitors. This is necessary for my profession and technology of today requires us to look at monitors/screens more.  My question is this: Does looking at monitors fatigue the muscles around the eyes because they have to maintain a constant focus? Can this also increase fatigue? If this is the case, I also wonder if this effect can be reduced by wearing glasses with a certain correction, adjusted to the distance between eyes and screen.   I hypothesize that the muscles can relax more, energy will be saved and the strain on the eyes is reduced. I'm certainly not an expert in anatomy however so I hope you can help me out. "

1394,Elevated glucose right after waking up,"After a recent blood test that showed elevated fasting glucose (110mg/dl) and elevated triglycerides (~335mg/Dl), I got myself an Accu-check glucose tester and started regular testing to try to figure out where I'm at in terms of insulin resistance etc.  Several times now I've had a set of results I don't understand. Today for example, I tested my glucose level right after waking up and I got 106mg/dL.  Feeling this was a bit high (my average over the last 7 days is 100) I drank a bit of water (as I hadn't drank any overnight) and re-tested 20mins later. The second test result was 96mg/dL.  Same thing happened three days ago with 108 and 109 after testing twice immediately after waking up, then 97mg/dL 25 mins later (again after having a bit of water as I hadn't drank any during the night).  Which of these results is more relevant/accurate. Is the first one skewed by slight dehydration, or is the second one less relevant because of either the water or the ~20 mins of activity?  For context, I suspect that the elevated glucose and triglycerides stem from both my sedentary lifestyle and daily alcohol use. My diet on the other hand has been quite good and I've generally avoided sugars and high GI carb for almost 10 years now. For the last 10 days I've stopped drinking and am in the gym almost everyday alternating between weight training and ~30 mins on a stationary bike.  Edit 1: As Graham Chiu pointed out, water intake in the morning should not skew my results. Although, I'm unclear whether not drinking enough water on a given night could increase the result the following morning?  The other question is, can there be a ~10+% drop in blood glucose after 20-25 minutes of light activity in the morning? Or should I be chalking this up to coincidence and meter error margins (even though back-to-back results are quite consistent)? "

1396,How long does it take for an illness from radiation to develop?,"The Chernobyl nuclear accident happened in 1986 - 30 years ago. The consequences, as is very well known, were severe.   I know people who lived just south of Chernobyl at the moment of the accident. Thanks to the winds, their cities were not as exposed as the geographical area north of the accident. Still, radiation levels were serious and many people in these cities contracted illnesses and, in many instances, died.   If someone from this city managed to survive the last 30 years without contracting any (serious) illness, how likely is it this person will still develop a new serious illness, such as cancer, as a direct or indirect consequence of the nuclear accident? Does age matter in this equation at all, i.e. if they were adults or kids at the time of accident? The assumption is that no countermeasures were taken, i.e. no hiding in bunkers, no iodine treatment, and that radiation exposed foods were consumed etc.  "
1397,"In a house on fire, do children faint more easily than the adults?","Might sound like a weird question, so here's a bit of context:  The story I'm writing is quite fantasy-driven (i.e. characters can seemingly ""create"" elements like thunder and water out of thin air). However, despite these fantasy elements, a lot of realistic moments occur which are often based in human unpredictability, so it's not like characters don't fear anything because they possess special powers or whatnot. Parts can easily turn into a killing/slaughter scenario a la ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", or even ""Attack on Titan"".  In a certain scene, an entire village was put up in flames. Amidst the confusion created by this, a man saves another fellow man from a house that is completely alit in flames. Upon his rescue, the half-burnt man asks his hero to save his daughter who's still in the house, to which he replies with the question: Â«How old is your daughter?Â». The other man is baffled by this response, not understanding where he's coming from, to which he backs up with Â«If your daughter is around 4 years old, there's nothing I can doÂ».  My explanation is that this character is not risking his life if he knows the person-to-save would most likely die even after being rescued when other (possibly more important) lives are concurrently in danger. So my question is this: If a house is on fire, are young children more prone to faint since they have a more underdeveloped body system than adults, or, due to their size, can they stay safe from smoke and large fires by sticking themselves into corners until their rescue arrives? "
1398,Are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of any use for a tendinopathy?,"I wonder whether transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are of any use for a tendinopathy. I am mostly interested in the epicondyles of the humerus.  A Cochrane Systematic Review (1) in 2008 concluded that evidence was missing. A more recent study (2) seemed to show TENS is useless but is quite inconclusive due to patients' adherence to the treatment. They also pointed to a few other studies, but all seem inconclusive:     Comparison with relevant findings from other published work       Two   previous trials have evaluated TENS in patients with tennis elbow,45   46 but these trials had different objectives, included small patient   samples (20 and 12 participants per group, respectively), assessed   very short term effects (24 hours and five days), and insufficiently   reported details of the TENS intervention. Our study is the first   adequately powered primary care study in which evidence based TENS   treatment protocols were used. Hence, interpretation of our findings   through direct comparisons with results from these previous trials is   problematic.      The results of Cochrane reviews are inconsistent in terms of the   strength of evidence for the efficacy of TENS in musculoskeletal   conditions, reporting either positive effects or inconclusive   evidence.47 48 49 These reviews have been criticised for failing to   give adequate consideration to the fidelity of delivering the TENS   intervention within individual trials in terms of treatment frequency   and dose. A meta-analysis of the use of TENS in chronic   musculoskeletal conditions (38 studies; 1227 participants), which   explicitly considered methodological rigour and fidelity of TENS   application, reported highly significant reductions in pain with the   use of TENS compared with placebo.21 Abundant laboratory studies also   show identifiable and dose dependent physiological pain reducing   effects of TENS compared with placebo, although the vast majority of   these studies reported only very short term effects (1-24 hours).29 30   31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Despite this support for efficacy of treatment,   in our pragmatic trial TENS failed to show additional pain relieving   effects even in the very short term, over and above the effect of   primary care management alone.   I wonder whether there have been more conclusive studies published since then.     (1) Nnoaham KE, Kumbang J. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for chronic pain.

1399,How many years is considered long term drug/medication usage,"Patients tend to worry about the side effects that may be caused by longterm drug/meds usage. How many years do you have to consume the drug/meds to say that you are longterm on it? Likewise, if you get off the drug for let's say a couple of months or one year and then start again, is the ""longterm"" word meaning disrupted?  Example: I've been taking PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) for 5 years, but the first year I've taken them for 2 months, second year 2 months, third year 1 month, fourth year less than a month and fifth year 4 months on and off. Am I a longterm user of the drug or not? "
1400,How long does it take healthy/normal cells to turn into cancer?,"Once cells (millions of them) start to change to cancerous cells.

1402,What happens when a person gets the wind knocked out of them?,"I asked a question on Martial Arts.SE about why many boxers combine each punch they throw with a rapid exhalation (making a pronounced, sharp huffing or hissing sound).  Some of the answers say that one of the reasons for the exhalation is the expectation of being counterpunched, possibly to the body, which makes it desirably to preemptively empty the lungs to reduce the effects of having your wind knocked out.  This simultaneously makes sense and confuses me.    If you've had the wind knocked out of you (as I have, more than once), you know that it isn't simply a matter of the lungs being emptied - if that were the case, you could simply take another breath and replace the missing air without any fuss.  Instead, having the wind knocked out of you makes it utterly impossible to breathe in for a fairly long time - in my experience, you start to take in a little bit of air after about 30 seconds, and can breathe somewhat normally after a minute or so.    The reason having your wind knocked out is so panicky and terrifying is because your body seems to turn traitor and refuse to partake in the fresh air surrounding you, and which you so desperately need.  It doesn't seem to be a matter of the lungs merely emptying;  it feels like the diaphragm itself has stopped working.  What is happening here?  Have the lungs merely emptied?  Is the diaphragm convulsing or temporarily paralyzed?  Is it something else entirely, or a combination of some/all of the above, and/or other factors?  And finally, does it really make a difference whether the lungs are full when the impact occurs?  In short, what is going on inside the body when a person gets the wind knocked out of them? "
1403,Explanation of normal CRP during neutrophilia?,"Let us assume we have a patient with this history and let us try to explain his/her normal CRP values on the end of this post given the fact of commorbid high fever and neutrophilia.  The questions to intrigue are here   If it is bacterial, how come CRP is not elevated? If it is viral, how come there is neutrophilia? If it is autoimmune, how come it is not autoimmune (ruled out by hematology and clinic)?   The patient wrote this:  Here are some fact about my fever of unknown origin, the diagnosis is apparently unknown, I am waiting now for some more serology, blood tests, urine cultivation and throat culture results.  The illness had 4 onsets, connected by a ""feeling well"" periods, 3 of them were cured by ATB, the four is being left untreated for diagnostic purposes.  First onset  before seeing a doctor:  duration:    one week   symptoms:   high fever on first day (39 Celsius) elevated temperature the rest of the week (37.7 Celsius) violent unproductive cough conjunctivitis (bloody eyes) congested nose (not runny, just swelled) sore throat   therapy:   rest, hot tea, sore throat and cough off-the-counter medicine w/o medical attention   after seeing a doctor:  diagnostics:    CRP elevated to 33 stethoscope test found ""something"" on the lungs    therapy:    clarithromycin 500mg 2 times a day some otc mucolytics and antitusics (not codeine like)   duration:    four days   symtoms:   resolved after 4 days, but on the 7th day on ATB, the sore throat returned   Second onset  duration:   three days   therapy:   azithromycin 500mg for 3 days once a day   symtoms:   resolved after 3 days   Third onset  After another 4 days being ok, I went to sauna to strengthen my immunity. The next day...  symptoms:   high fever, used antipyretics when reached 39 Celsius vomitting (due to fever) violent unproductive cough   diagnostics:   referred to pneumologist CRP elevated to 48 RTG of the lungs and hearth OK stethoscope, lymph nodes, abdomine ok the ""pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas test"" showed high pulse blood: true left shift   leukocytes 18 (&lt;10)   neutrophils 0.856 (&lt;0.7) lymphocytes 0.091 (>0.2) neutrophils# 15 (&lt;7)    therapy:   cefurixim (cephalosporines 2nd gen) 500mg twice a day for 2 weeks   duration:   resolved completely in a day or two   Fourth onset  After three weeks feeling healthy and one alright blood test (cell count+diff, antigens, CRP and biochemistry), I went into a hot shower after a train trip and ended it with a very short cold shower to strengthen immunity. The next day...  symptoms:   high fever (39 Celsius) vomiting (due to fever) mild unproductive cough   diagnostics:   RTG of the lungs OK lymphnodes OK sthetoscope OK blood: true left shift   bilirubin 24 (&lt;21) ALT 1.04 (&lt;0.83) leukocytes 19 (&lt;10) neutrophiles 0.92 (&lt;0.8) lymphocytes 0.038 (>0.2) neutrophiles# 17 (&lt;7) lymphocytes# 0.72 (>0.8) sedimentation 1 (>2) BUT CRP NOT (much) ELEVATED 6.2 (&lt;5)    At this point, the pneumologist was kind of stunned by these results and referred me to the hemmatology the same day. The test there were pretty much the same, except a bit elevated CRP (~20). Hematologist ruled out malignity and referred me to the infections diseases. They ruled out some viruses Eppstein-Barr, HIV, heppatitis and perhaps boreliosis and referred me to USG of abdomen and RTG of sinuses, which were ok. "

1409,How does sleeping chest-side down hurt the spine?,"I do not know the correct English term for the position, so I will just refer it to as ""chest-side down"". The following CNN page seem to call it the ""stomach position"", and they say it is the worst position to sleep.  They have listed the shortcomings of that position, but there is no detailed explanation. I do not feel any pain when I sleep chest-side down other than pain on my neck, but this is only because I have to turn my face to one side, and this can be fixed if I buy a special pillow (something used at a massage shop).   Is it really true that it causes back pain? We are mammals and almost all mammals live and sleep chest-side down. Dogs, for example, seem to love to rest their chest and head laid down on the floor. Do we have some special spines that need to be rested chest-side up, unlike other mammals?  And secondly, how does it cause more wrinkles than sleeping chest-side up?  Source: [website]  Bad for: Avoiding neck and back pain, minimizing wrinkles      The scoop: ""Stomach-sleeping makes it difficult to maintain a neutral position with your spine,"" Shannon explains.

1420,Calcium intake vs bioavailability,"The recommendation for calcium for adults under 50 is 1000mg/day. But this seems to concern the calcium intake. However the bioavailability of calcium depends a lot on the food eaten.  If the calcium intake of a person comes from food containing a considerable amount of inhibitory substances, such as oxalates and phytates, then the actual bioavailable calcium of this person can be quit low.   So what is the recommendation for bioavailable calcium per day, for adults?  Or in other terms, what percentage of bioavailability was used to determined this 1000mg/day recommendation? "

History: During a physical, when it was time to cough, I looked dead ahead and there was a daily water intake poster that read, ""3 liters of water p/day for a healthy...""  So I asked the doctor in an attempt to break the weird silence while zipping up, ""if I mixed my daily 3 liters of water with 3 liters of, let's say kool-aid, for a total of 6 liters of liquid, does that count?""  He said no.  Needs to be water.  I didn't particularly care at the time - it was just a 'break the silence' question - but it started to grow on me.  Then it started to bug me.   Why not?  It still had H 2 and O.  Although diluted, the alkalites, minerals, fluoride and all the other stuff that comes from 'the man' is still there.  Or should be - maybe not.  Does citric acid or cool-aid and sugar break all that down.  What if I drank a glass of OJ, then downed a glass of water right after. Did I get my water in then? Doesn't it mix after it all goes down?  Is there a time one has to wait before drinking anything other than water, after drinking water?

Yes, the ginger tea helps it go away, but then it comes back the next morning persistently.  I just don't know a way to prevent it from happening in the first place?

1428,Is prolonged use of melatonin supplements safe for a 3-year-old?,"Background:  I recently adopted a 3-year-old girl.  The first weeks in her new home, bedtimes were understandably difficult.  She had a lot of trouble falling asleep, and resisted going to bed.  My wife and I realized that a lot of this probably had to do with anxiety surrounding the sudden life change (she was given little warning or preparation about her move).  We tried all kinds of bedtime routines to help her calm down and be able to sleep.  Eventually we worked out a system that worked relatively well, and resulted in a minimum of tantrums and resistance.  However, she still couldn't fall asleep. She would lie awake literally for hours.  She was calm and mostly non-interactive, but would just lie there staring at the ceiling, or talking softly to her stuffed animals, or playing with her fingers; finding ways to while away the time because she couldn't sleep.  When she finally did fall asleep, she would often wake again during the night, and then would have the same trouble falling asleep again, resulting in a severe lack of sleep.  In consultation with her doctor, we began giving her melatonin about 1/2 hour before we put her into bed.  We started with 1mg, and then, when that didn't seem to be enough, we upped the dose to 2mg (again, as per her doctor). We have found that it works amazingly well, and gives her the ability to fall asleep quickly and to sleep through the night and feel well-rested in the morning.  We've been doing this for about 2 months now.  There have been a couple of nights where we forgot to give her the melatonin, or just decided to see how she does without it, and it's immediately right back to the hours of non-sleep, so there's little chance that she can sleep well without it, at least in the near future.  In researching melatonin online, it seems that there isn't a lot known about its long-term effects, and some websites warn that using it for children can cause problems for them later in life.  I want my daughter to be able to sleep well, but I also don't want to do anything that may harm her, now or in the future, so I'm a little concerned about continuing to use the melatonin, since it appears she may need it for a while.     Do I need to be concerned about continuing to give her the 2mg of melatonin every night?       Are there long-term effects I should be concerned about?      If it's not recommended, are there alternatives to melatonin that might have a similar effect of helping her to get to sleep and to stay asleep?  "
1429,How fast is blood replaced in the body?,"I'm a writer, and I require some details for my writing. I've included the circumstances for my question below, in case they can help you answer the question.   In my current project, I'm dealing with a disease that slowly replaces the blood cells of the human body with its own infectious replicas. These cells serve the same purpose as red blood cells, with the distinct disadvantage that they keep the body infected. In all other aspects, they are essentially red blood cells.   In addition to this, the disease eventually works its way into the bone marrow, stopping it from manufacturing red blood cells altogether. Instead, the bone marrow is forced to create more of the replicas.   The only way to cure an infected person (that I can see) would be to somehow cure the bone marrow and get it to produce red blood cells again. It is my understanding that blood cells are constantly dying and being reproduced, so repairing the bone marrow would eventually result in the bloodstream being repopulated with red blood cells, and the replicas dying out.   Question: On that note, how long would it take the human body to completely replace its blood supply? Or is this even possible?  "
1430,Why do different pain killers have different effects on people?,"I've noticed some pain killers working great for me, while other have no effect.  Works for me   Aspirin APC &dagger; Naproxen   Doesn't work for me   Paracetamol Diclofenac Tramadol   I doubt there is much of a placebo effect at work, since most of these either did or did not work when I first took them, without having expectations either way.  Whenever I have a head ache, I take an APC. I suspect it's actually the aspirin in there that does the job, since when I take just paracetamol, it doesn't do squat. As a kid I got children's aspirin, which worked.  I once had a severe back ache. I was prescribed diclofenac (a larger dose than the over the counter version), which didn't work. I was then prescribed tramadol &mdash; same results. I then tried naproxen, which worked rightaway.  Why do some pain killers work for me while others don't?  Is there an underlying mechanism, that explains why some of these work for some people while others don't? Does that predict if pain killers that I haven't had to use yet will work?  Please note that I'm not looking for medical advice on which pain killers to take; I'm just curious about how my body interacts with the various ones.    &dagger;: the one consisting of aspirin, paracetamol, and caffeine, not the one containing phenaticin. Think Excedrin.    I have asked this question before, over on the Biology Stack, but I haven't received a satisfying answer yet, just the general observation that different drugs affect different people differently. "

Well, to be totally honest here, it usually comes and go and it's been like that for atleast 2-3 years now. I feel my energy very low and I do not want to do anything. Related or not but a year and a half ago, I was not feeling so well and had a few appointment with a psychologist. I stoped seeing that specialist when the words ""pills to treat depression"" went out of her mouth. Either because the sides effects scared me or I thought that I could fight it myself with exercises. For a while, I have been into exercise but recently, I have been so tired that I couldn't find the energy to hit the gym.  For example, last night I slept for about 12 hours and this afternoon I couldn't resist taking a 2-3h nap and the wake up was hard. I doubt my sleep cycles are really good. I never seems to have deep sleep.  Oh yeah, and I find my digesting system extremely slow: If I eat a good breakfast in the morning, I could skip the dinner without any problem. Having that fullness feelings following me all the rest of the day.  So yeah, after reading a lot of articles over the past few days on Internet, I found out that it could be either the depression phase that came back harder this time without the unbearable sadness part.  Some says that people have a hard time digesting carbs, it could explain why my digestive system is slow. It could drains me energy.  Lacks of Iron. I am not a huge fan of red meat. Maybe, once a month? And I don't get supplements.  Should I try to fight the tiredness and hit the gym anyway? If one of the above problem is true. Is it dangerous to drain my energy even more? If in fact I'm fighting a diseases maybe I do need the sleep.  My overall info is 32 y.o in 4 days. 5'5"" at 150 pounds. Muscular built but about 5% body fat over.

Whereas the body may normally rely on fats, proteins and carbohydrates from food, during a fast extending beyond a few days the body is forced to consume fats in place of the formerly named, and meet its carbohydrate needs through gluconeogenesis.  But in all my research, a question I haven't been able to answer is what about protein? Namely, the body really doesn't use protein for energy, but for rebuilding tissues, essentially a constant, slow healing process. Without a supply of amino acids, is proper healing inhibited while fasting? "

(I need a simple explanation, I am not a doctor) How much longer will the cancer patient will live if this treatement is used at any cancer stage? Why is it still not used in all countries? (I have heard that the UK will start to use it for all patients in 2 years.)  "
1446,Occasional medical tests and imageries,"I ouce asked on Quora, why people do not do yearly blood tests and imaging, to prevent getting stage 4 cancers.  The answers listed reasons not to do this:   It would cost a lot of money (for the country, the person, or insurance companies) No Symptoms, No tests needed (but cancer could exist even without symptoms, right ?) Use preventive medicine tests from your own money Other financial reasons   Why do we think it's a waste of money to do a test, when it's something we can do once each year, so we don't spend much more money in the future curing from killer diseases?

1447,Does Dermatitis Herpatiformis have a differential diagnosis?,"""Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), or Duhring's disease,[1][2] is a chronic blistering skin condition,[3] characterised by blisters filled with a watery fluid.[4] Despite its name, DH is neither related to nor caused by herpes virus: the name means that it is a skin inflammation having an appearance similar to herpes.......A connection between DH and celiac disease was recognised in 1967,[5][6] although the exact causal mechanism is not known. DH is a specific manifestation of celiac disease"" definition given by Wikipedia [website]For those who do not know, celiac disease is treated by removing gluten from someones diet, and that is when symptoms improve.   This means that the rash is directly or indirectly induced by gluten, as a manifestation of celiac disease.  Are there any other conditions with rashes that resolve when removing gluten from the diet, and recur on reintroduction of gluten, and it being consistent when this process is repeated?    If not, then wouldn't a repeatable correlation between gluten and eruption of this type of rash be diagnostic of celiac disease? "
1448,Is Myopia Reversible/Curable?,"Myopia, meaning short sightedness is said to develop when eyes are exposed to excessive strain. But what I've failed to understand properly is whether myopia can be reversed or cured in any manner? When I was diagnosed with myopia in my childhood, my doctor told me that if I were to stare at far away objects for long periods, it would help cure my eyes. I'm not sure if what he said was to keep me off my computer, or whether it had some scientific background. Thus my question, is myopia reversible, naturally or through medication? "
1449,Can low libido be a side-effect of schizoprenia medications?,I suffer from schizophrenia and depression and take medication for this.   My current medication are    Qutipin (200 mg) Oxetol (600 mg) Bupron (300 mg)  Arip (30 mg)   Qtencare (tablet)    I consulted a sexologist in Toronto and he prescribed Testosterone Decanoate to increase my testosterone levels.   Could any of the medication I take be responsible for my low libido? Which doctor should I be discussing this with?

1451,What does the stability of blood test means for patient who have few pains in different parts of the body,"What does the stability of a CBC (and all related tests) means for a patient who is not suffering anything besides few ache here or there like in stomach or the back?  More generalized, if a blood test repeated 3 times in matter of 9 months, and the all values are in the normal range and nearly the same from test to test. Is there any conclusions we can extract from that, even if the patient still have few pains? "
1452,Walking as a healthy habit for the aged and my doctor's thoughts on it,"Nowadays, many doctors recommend old people, who cannot do gym or such huge physical fitness exercises, to walk, as walking is considered and a clinically proven very good way to keep good health for the aged people.  Our doctor prescribes the same, but he is a bit different. According to him, walking only in the morning helps keeping good health. Walking in the evening has no good effect on the health of the person.  My question is, walking is a good physical exercise, but how does it matter if I walk in the morning or evening? Can anyone give a proper scientific explanation for what the doctor says? I cannot seem to find any, and neither can the doctor tell me anything satisfactory. "
1453,Ice bath cryolipolysis?,"I've been hearing advertisements for a new fat reduction treatment called CoolSculpting, in which areas of fat are brought down to below the freezing point of fat but above the freezing point of water, causing the fat to freeze and destroy the fat cells while the non-fat cells remain unaffected.  This makes me wonder, couldn't one just spend time in an icebath? Various sources spread throughout the internet, most notably plastic surgeons, answer this with the trivial, ""No! The CoolSculpting device is special and safe, and any method of cryolipolysis not using the device would be dangerous!"" but from a medical perspective, why not?  This is the point where I explicitly say ice baths can cause hypothermia and a host of other issues, so I'm definitely not recommending it personally, but medically, wouldn't time with the torso in an ice bath, with a wetsuit/drysuit covering the legs and groin, have the same effect as CoolSculpting, but for thousands of times lower cost? "
1454,"Being drunk, how does vomiting help become responsive?","When people get intoxicated with alcohol (as in: they had way too much), they sometimes feel very bad, and while they are awake, they stop being responsive and cannot communicate.  In that state, vomiting may bring back a certain alertness: after vomiting, they can respond and talk again and also seem to feel better, albeit both effects only last very briefly. This may happen several times in a row with falling back to unresponsiveness in between.  How does vomiting help become responsive, and why does the effect only last a short time? Vomiting does not immediately reduce the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream, so how else does it work? "

I haven't been straining it in anyway, but I have been experiencing a sore-throat and fatigue and a tickling in my throat and now it's completely gone.... (not sure if it's laryngitis). Unfortunately, I'm boarding an international flight in less than 15 hours and don't have time to see a doctor, what are my treatment options?

Many labs have exposed cells to burnt vapor and 50x doses of vapor and have reported that e-cigs are dangerous.   Have there been any tests of a cigerette and an e-cigarette side by side?   If no intelligent comparative tests of ecig have been designed published in 2 years, does that reflect a negative PR campaign funded by the tobacco industry? "

1464,Effects of microdosing alcohol on liver performance and the ability to metabolize toxins,"Has there been any research on microdosing of alcohol? I did a cursory search but it didn't yield any viable information.  Putting regular stress on various parts of the human body and its systems seems to have an overall strengthening effect. Working out builds stronger muscle, microdosing poison gets you some immunity to poison, bone microfractures lead to denser and stronger bone and so on, gradually and continuously working out various parts and systems of the body appears to have a beneficial effect on their performance.  So what would be the effect of subjecting the organism to continuous alcohol microdosing? And I don't mean ""drink a little once a day"" but adding a minuscule amount of alcohol to water and other consumed liquids, dosed according to the liver's performance so that the alcohol level doesn't exceed the legal limits you can drive a vehicle with, perhaps even significantly lower than that.  If poison microdosing builds up immunity to poison, and I am only assuming that it is being metabolized by the liver and thus improves its ability to metabolize poison, wouldn't alcohol microdosing too make up for a stronger liver?  I've also read about studies which show conflicting results, while some appear do indicate there are some benefits to drinking a little alcohol (but not microdosing), others claim that drinking any amount of alcohol is detrimental to the health, but again, that means drinking recreationally, not microdosing.  EDIT:  Now that the question gets input, it mandates a clarification be made, that I am specifically interested in liver performance and ability to metabolize toxins, in case it wasn't clean enough. And to clarify the need for this clarification:  There is a problem with mortality rates, due to the extremely uneven distribution of causes of death. When the bulk of deaths are not liver function related, it just doesn't seem like an indicative metric. Not that liver function related deaths are necessarily indicative. Just that mortality rate is a rather rough metric, and when less than 2% of deaths seem to be liver function related, and liver failure related deaths not really being indicative of the effects on ""strengthening"" the function of healthy liver, mortality rates don't really answer a question on ""effects of micro-dosing alcohol"", but a rather specific yet deprived of specific information question on ""effects on microdosing alcohol on mortality rates"".  It seems to me that such a metric would completely stifle say a 10% improvement of metabolism of toxins if the bulk of the test subjects die of unrelated conditions or even already deteriorated liver function, and that is such a case, mortality rates are about as indicative as the effects of microdosing alcohol on the chance of getting struck by lightning.  Maybe there are more isolated and focused studies that have tested liver samples from test subjects, or a study involving the introduction of toxins to the body and measuring the speed and efficiency at which they are being handled?

1467,Does eyesight significantly vary from day-to-day?,"I think I need glasses and my visit to the optometrist has confirmed this. I've never worn glasses, and I'm new to all this, so I don't completely understand how things work.  These past few weeks, I find that on some days my eyesight is nearly perfect. Everything is sharp, no matter the size (such as text). However, on other days, my eyesight is really bad. Things are really blurry, and although I can read text on my computer or far away, it is a bit more difficult to do so. Although not super blurry, the difference is quite significant.  Has anyone had these experiences before? Is this normal?  "
1468,Is it safe and beneficial to eat poached and cut fish bones?,"I have allergies to many foods such as dairy, nuts etc so having a difficult time getting enough calcium from natural food sources. I have realised that fish bones are a good source of calcium, perhaps even my only alternative to supplements.   I know that it is not a good idea to frequently eat long fish bones as these may get stuck in the digestive system and cause complications. I believe an alternative would be to fry or pressure cook the bones and crunch them down.  Assume frying or pressure cooking is not available to me and instead I boil fish bones in water for 5 minutes, cut them with scissors and swallow them with food, would this be digestible and safe to do frequently? My concerns are: - as the bones are cooked with water the bones will not be soft and hence indigestable? - even though the bones may have been cut small they may still have hard sharp edges, could these edges not cause complications in the digestive system e.g. slice/pinch tissue?  Basically I want to know if it is safe(for digestive system) and beneficial(nutritionally) to eat poached and cut fish bones frequently? "
1469,Is being deficient in vitamin D a possible cause or factor for muscle tension?,"[website]  It has been found that people who suffer from excessive muscle tension, spasms and pain may be deficient in vitamin D.    Why would being deficient in vitamin D be a possible cause or factor for muscle tension? Alternatively, has any scientific study confirm that claim?  I am mostly interested in forearm muscles. My goal in preventing muscles tightness is to avoid perturbing the tendons that attach to the epicondyles at the elbow end of the humerus. "

1471,(Why) does hot water dry our skin more?,"So I'm still trying to figure out whether it matters if you take a hot or cold or lukewarm or something-in-between shower.  All the answers I found around the web were like ""Yes, hot water does dry your skin more than cold water"" but none backed up with any reason or scientific evidence behind it. It only says ""hot water strips oils from your skin"" but water of really any temperature does that if I'm not mistaken and still a lot of people stress the ""hot"" aspect here.  But why is it that hot water dries the skin more or is it even true?  And in which other kind of ways does water temperature affect our skin? "

All situations I am asking about are with a fully informed consensual adult and with legal substances and proper procedures and materials. "
1473,What layer of skin and approximate depth would this be?,"So this for a school thing and I am completely stuck on working out what it is. I'm thinking reticular dermis but thats just a guess.   ""It is a clean wound positioned just below the elbow crease that bleeds slowly but consistently for about 10 minutes, when the blood is washed away white can be seen inside, is about a 1.2mm in width and 1cm in length. It takes about 3 weeks to heal (wounds similar to cat scratches usually heal in 5 days on this subject) and leaves a purple scar to begin with. What layer and sublayer of skin is this likely to be in, what depth range too?""    I figure that the white must be collagen and the fact that it bleeds slowly but consistently would suggest it was through the surface capillaries and long healing time a decent depth. This is what makes me think reticular dermis but I am really not sure. What do you guys think, it would be great if you could approximate the depth too?   Thanks "
1474,How scientists determine how much sleep every particular individual needs?,"Is it determined the same way as ""healthy"" weight?  Someone told me that for weight, they do it by measuring a large number of people and see who gets sick and who doesn't and correlate that weight.    Then I was in a forum where someone was saying the requirements are different and some can have 6 hours and be okay and some need 9 hours and I been googling for a few hours but can't find out how doctors would determine that, like is there a list of studies where they looked at different ages, men vs women, different personalities, race, etc, and how much sleep they need?  I read in a couple of places that women need more sleep but couldn't find the study that proved that.  One site mentioned Duke university but no link to the study.   "

When a person look at the sun or a strong light, Then the vision in a normal lighted room becomes unclear. This is how I feel too.  I think I have a problem with the brightness of the right eye. I don't have issue with colours or resolution. I do NOT see a blurry image. My problem is with light I think. I also see kind of floaters.  Soon, I will go to a doctor. What is the best way to describe my problem? so that he checks me correctly?  "

1479,RSI mostly due to keyboard or mouse?,"As I am in the software industry, I am in a higher risk group to develop RSI (Repetitive strain injury), and thus I am taking measures to prevent this from happening. I keep a relatively good measure and a good keyboard, but one thing that I have some questions about is that on several websites, one of the recommendations to prevent RSI is to use keyboard shortcuts more and use the mouse less.  From this it would seem that using the mouse makes the risk of RSI higher than the keyboard does. But is there any evidence backing this up? Is RSI mainly due to mouse usage rather than keyboard usage? "
1480,Addiction to thinking hard,"According to Wikipedia,     Behavioral addiction is a form of addiction that involves a compulsion to engage in a rewarding non-drug-related behavior despite any negative consequences to the person's physical, mental, social or financial well-being.   Now, this friend I have (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) finds thinking long and hard about difficult problems intrinsically rewarding and he sometimes finds it hard to resist it despite certain negative consequences:   At work, he tends to prefer tasks that require him to think over tasks that don't, but create actual value. When he has a particuarly interesting problem to think about, he may be distracted in social situations by the urge to sit and brood over it. Most seriously, maybe, he wastes opportunities to relax and unwind thinking about theoretical problems.   Not that he would change a thing if he could&mdash;the negative consequences aren't really serious and they're outweighed by the reward, both material and immaterial.  But he's been thinking if anyone ever seriously studied the possibility of a sort of benign addiction to thinking long and hard.  Is such an addiction documented?  Does it make sense at all? "

1483,Immunity after a GI bug,"Common wisdom is that once you've been infected with a cold virus, you are then immune to that specific virus. Obviously there are hundreds of cold viruses, so you can keep getting colds.  Does the same hold true for GI bugs? And if so, does that immunity mean you likely won't suffer many/any symptoms on subsequent exposure? Or will you still get the vomiting and/or diarrhea as that's how your body expels the bacteria/virus? "
1484,Would doing Kegel exercise by hanging weight to penis is really effective?,"An advertisement of a Kegel equipment for men claims that hanging more weight to the erected penis while contracting the pubococcygeus muscle will help make it stronger. Superficially, this makes sense to me, since to make any muscle stronger, forcing it work more intense than everyday is necessary. Here is their visualization:    But is there any scientific paper research on this method?   The only article that the advertisement refers to is Pelvic Exercises for Men, Too, which 1) seems to promote the aforementioned company, and 2) doesn't actually cite any paper that seems to answer the efficiency of the product. WebMD and Mayo Clinic do not specially mention about adding more weight to the penis.  "

1487,Decrease in mathematical creativity due to weed,"I had been smoking cannabis since last year and I think I've undergone a decrease in mathematical creativity.  I used to get a lot of ideas about how to tackle a math problem and was a somewhat good problem solver.  But now, after 8-9 months of cannabis usage, I get stuck at the most basic problems and am unable to solve if I haven't solved it before.  Is this just my anxiety that's causing it or is this for real?  Can quitting cannabis restore my abilities to some extent?  P.s - This is not some anti-weed propaganda. I'm really feeling like this for some time now. "
1488,Hearing some kind of screeching sound. Is it (not) normal?,"Once in a while I hear some sort of screeching sound, sort of like that unpleasant sound heard when you scratch a sharp object against a chalkboard. Whenever I hear the sound, its sort of in a low tone, so it's as if the sound is either on my head or it's coming from somewhere very far away. Whenever I ask those beside me, they say that their not heating anything. So my question is:  Is the sound coming from my head or I'm just the only one that could hear it?  Is such scenario normal or abnormal?  Is the sound simply produced by the wind passing by my ear? "

I went to other two oculists, They said I've an issue with eye pressure and I've to check my field of vision.  Now, I would like you to send my some picture about how a person who have an issue with eye pressure see the world?  It would be very very useful for me to describe my issue?

Would one need to look at the back of every product supplement out there and try to match each species or is there a better way to find the right probiotic with desired species?  Are there classes or categories of probiotcs?  Are there certain standards or certifications to look for?  Are there trusted studies on which brands work best? 
1491,Why do we sleep more in certain countries than in others?,"I moved to Canada 6 months ago and as soon as I got here I noticed that my sleeping habits had changed dramatically. Indeed, I sleep much more than I used to. I've always been insomniac and so I used to get around 6 to 7 hours of sleep per night, but now I get at least 8 to 9 hours. However, I always feel tired whereas I used to not feel tired at all on a 6-hour sleep.  I thought it may not have any connection with me moving abroad but at least 5 friends of mine who also recently moved from France to Canada told me they experience the exact same thing. They all reported sleeping at least 1 to 2 hours more per night since they got here.   So I was wondering, why is it that we sleep more in certain countries than in others? I don't believe it has anything to do with language since we all have been attending international schools where we would hear and speak more than just 2 languages daily. Any other plausible explanation ?   Thanks  "
1492,X is related posteriorly to Y,"I asked this question in the English language section but was advised to repost this question in this section instead.  So, if ""X is posterior to Y"" means ""X is behind Y"".  Then, if the statement is ""X is related posteriorly to Y"", does it mean:  ""X is behind Y"" or  ""Y is behind X""?  As for ""Posteriorly, X is related to Y"", does it mean:  ""X is behind Y"" or  ""Y is behind X""?  These sentences were written as such in several anatomy textbooks.  Eg 1 ""The iliopsoas is related anteriorly to the fascia lata and the femoral artery, and posteriorly to the capsule of the hip joint.""  Eg 2 ""Sigmoid and rectum are related anteriorly to the bladder.""  Eg 3 ""Medially, this muscle is related to the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae and vessels."" (My interpretation: The muscle is on the outer/lateral side whereas the vertebrae/vessels are on the inner/medial side).  In Eg 1, the usage of ""related anteriorly to"" in this sentence seems to imply that the iliopsoas is in between the fascia lata/femoral artery and the hip joint, whereas, in Eg 2, the sentence seems to mean that the bladder is in front of the sigmoid and rectum.  However, if ""related anteriorly to"" means the same as ""anterior to""/""in front of"", then these sentences would be wrong, wouldn't they? Eg 1 would instead mean the iliopsoas is in front of the fascia lata/femoral artery but behind the hip joint. Eg 2 would instead mean sigmoid/rectum are in front of the bladder.  Thank you for your explanation. "
1493,Colorectal Examinations,"This question was sparked by the question on X is related posteriorly to Y where it was talking about the sigmoid and rectum.  When looking at the colorectal medical examination techniques, for want of a better term, there are the sopical examinations (those named with the suffix -scopy - involving the use of in instrument for viewing).  From what I understand, you have colonoscopy (examination  of the entire colon with an endoscope) and sigmoidoscopy (examination of the sigmoid colon with an endoscope).  Is there such an examination as anusoscopy or rectumoscopy?  What about colorectoscopy? "
1494,Nasal congestion or fever as a mechanism to combat infection,"As far as I know, nasal congestion and fever are generally regarded as symptoms of many illnesses (e.g. flu), not as mechanisms that the body uses to fight an infection. Nonetheless, a lot of people still seem to abide by the rule that you should ""tough it out"" and not take medicine to reduce these symptoms. Some people seem to express the belief that they will actually get through there illness faster if they suffer through it.   Is there any evidence to support that belief? It seems to me that such an argument would only be valid if one could show that the body is actually using the fever or nasal congestion to eradicate the infection. I could imagine that there might be instances like the following:    a certain type of microbe dies at a few degrees above body temperature, or the higher temperature significantly slows down reproduction nasal congestion restricts the ability of the microbe to get to XYZ in the body, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the infection.    Are there any examples where this might be the case? Or are there some common cases in which fever or congestion can be shown to actually help fight the infection? "
1495,Might there be symptom-less cell damage from rapid hydration?,From time to time an athlete dies from guzzling water right after a race. From what I understand the rapid influx of water overwhelms the cells and causes them to burst.  For those of us who have guzzled after a race but did NOT die is it possible/likely that we have sustained significant cell damage but because it didn't kill us we don't realize it?  And if that is the case (which seems like it might be) then what systems would be the most likely to be affected? 
1496,Is high blood pressure ever a symptom attributable solely to dehydration?,"In other words, if someone doesn't have hypertension and they become dehydrated does, or can dehydration (not radical dehydration, just poor hydration practices) in and of itself cause high blood pressure? IE: Where once you are hydrated, all is well again?  I have read that it is implicated in rapid pulse in many cases.  "
1497,What is the correct way to use the pinch test for dehydration?,"My understanding is that the test works by pinching the back of your own hand for two seconds, then letting go. If the pinch ""immediately"" returns flat you are not dehydrated but if it doesn't, you are dehydrated.  How long is ""immediately""?  Do I need to be sitting and relaxed or anything? "
1498,How often is a microscope used,"I am planning on studying Graduate Entry into Medicine (4 years instead of 6 for people that already have a degree) in the UK.  Microscopes really irritate my eyes. I think in the UK we still have to look into the bright light, whereas in other countries they display it on a screen?  I was wondering how often I would have to use one in medical school, as a junior doctor, and which specialities would use one less often? My intention is to avoid it as much as possible. "
1499,When leaded gasoline was prevalent why did more people not show acute lead poisoning?,"My understanding is that, for example, there are places where the surface soil was 5% lead (like on the sides of busy roads) so the amount of lead was significant.  So why did children in particular not develop signs like blue lines in their gums? And why was leaded paint considered (I think) a greater danger than leaded gasoline?  EDIT: One thought is, blue line in gums as I now understand it is not from systemic lead poisoning but from the action of bacteria on lead in the mouth. So eating lead paint or drinking from lead-glazed cups can cause this symptom; breathing fine particulate lead would not. (But eating contaminated soil might cause it.)  However, there are other acute lead poisoning symptoms that could have been seen. I don't know, maybe they were and were attributed to paint when in fact they came from gasoline or a combination of the two. There was also lead in newsprint (colored and kids who used Silly Putty to capture funny pages images and subsequently chewed on the Putty could have gotten lead exposure that way) -- let's face it, there was a lot of lead around and the powerful fossil fuel industry as well as the equally powerful car manufacturing industry plus the makers of the gasoline additive definitely fought for tetra-ethyl lead and would have argued that acute lead poisoning cases came from other kinds of exposure than car exhaust.  What a frigging tragedy that billions of people were exposed to lead unnecessarily for so many decades. "
1500,Does the iliofemoral ligament prevent the hips from tilting during walking?,"I'm reading about the actions of iliofemoral ligament (pic related)     I know that it prevents overextension, does it play any role during the motion of walking? I.e. does it prevent the hips from tilting during walking (like the gluteal muscles)?  "
1501,Would an operating theater ringed with green plants increase infection risk or reduce it?,"I believe that the filtering and oxygen production of green plants is well established. Do those plants NASA approves for air filtration ""emit"" anything other than clean oxygen and perhaps benign esters (?) that would be a concern in an operating theater or are they environmentally benign?   My thought is that a well selected set of plants throughout the hospital might give the facility an edge in cleansing the environment that continues to elude hospitals using a more ""clean room"" approach.  Naive? Do these plants help eliminate airborne disease or would they contribute more filth to the environment? "
1502,Have replacement anatomical parts with silver electroplating hit the market and do they eliminate infection concerns?,"According to this study from 2005 of the viability of silver plated replacement anatomical devices there appeared to be great promise. Has this promise come true? Are they available now and are they the proverbial ""silver bullet"" for eliminating infection of replacement anatomical parts?   "
1503,How would a newborn infant reflexively breathing react to rescue breaths administered correctly after birth?,"In the specific fictional case, one that takes place in my novel, a baby is born medically unassisted at home, with only the mother and father present (so no midwife, doula, no EMS, etc.)  The baby had a nuchal cord, wrapped tightly, twice around their neck. Unable to move the cord, the father clamped and cut the cord - assuming less than a minute before the rest of the baby's body was born.   Immediately following the delivery, there is no cry. Baby is either taking shallow breaths or is reflexive breathing - otherwise needing assistance.   Assume any rubbing/tapping/flicking/spanking do not successfully stimulate the newborn to breathe properly and cry so another method of intervention is needed.   With no ventilation equipment (such as a bulb syringe or nasal/throat aspirator available) at hand, the father gives the child one or two small ""rescue breaths"" by means of pushing the air already in his cheeks into the mouth and nose of the child struggling to breathe.  Assume the breaths are effective and the baby begins to respond.   What is the MOST REALISTIC OR COMMON reaction that the newborn would exhibit after receiving successful rescue breaths?   Would two breaths suffice in most typical cases? How instantly would baby react - within seconds? Would the baby cough? Would a finger swipe in the mouth result in removing mucus/fluids? Would cries be initially faint/weak and crescendo or could it be strong?   Obviously, I know not all babies would react the same, I understand this, but there must be a textbook or typical reaction.  "
1504,"Are Drug toxicity, Infectious toxic disease, Hypoxia & Malignancy all Acquired Metabolic Diseases?","Commonly when we talk about Acquired metabolic diseases, we refer to endocrine diseases (like Diabetic ketoacidosis, HONK, etc), electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, etc), acid-base disorders (metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, etc), hyperammonemia (causing hepatic encephalopathy), hyperuricemia, nutritional deficiencies (vit def, etc), etc.   As for inherited metabolic disease, we have Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM).   I understand metabolic disease is any disease in which metabolic pathways inside a cell are affected. So I have questions as to whether some diseases are metabolic diseases or not.   Does drug toxicity/overdose or even drug side effect due to action at cell surface receptor come under this category? (for instance in belladonna/atropine poisoning, the toxin/drug acts at muscarinic receptors in various organs). Logic tells that action at a cell receptor affects obviously chemical reactions inside a cell. And so drug/food poisoning are acquired metabolic diseases. But I need second opinion.  Is Toxin disease due to infection (eg: clostridium difficile infection) a metabolic disease? Is hypoxia a metabolic disease? (as in shock) Is malignancy/cancer a metabolic disease? (because I know a lot of intracellular metabolic pathways are activated abnormally inside a cancer cell)   While logic tells me to include these disorders under metabolic disease, we don't commonly refer to them as metabolic diseases. Why is it so?  Is it true that inflammatory disease can not cause metabolic disease but metabolic disease can cause inflammatory disease (eg: hemochromatosis causing hepatitis &amp; steatosis)? "
1505,"When internal hemorrhage occurs in an enclosed body cavity, is it possible to build up enough pressure to erupt through the skin?","I am a writer and want to understand a concept so that I can portray elements of injury realistically.    There are areas of the body (such as within the GI tract or urinary tract) where an internal hemorrhage would be able to exit the body (mouth, anus, urethra, etc).  This happens in bleeding ulcers, diverticular bleeding, bleeding from kidneys, etc.  However, there are other body areas (such as the chest cavity, abdominal cavity) where there is no natural ""outlet"" for a hemorrhage to exit.  Therefore, in the case of massive internal hemorrhages within those cavities, it seems an enormous amount of pressure would build up.  Is the pressure ever sufficient to erupt through the skin or another body orifice?  If not, what happens to the blood as it builds up? "
1506,Why aren't other vaccines combined (like the MMR)?,"From Public Health England:     With single vaccines, children would need 6 separate injections:         3 primary doses - 1 measles, 1 mumps, 1 rubella   3 pre-school boosters         Each injection can be uncomfortable and the act of immunisation is sometimes distressing for children.      Single vaccines are less safe than MMR because they leave children vulnerable to dangerous diseases for longer. Giving 3 separate doses at spaced out intervals would mean that, after the first injection, the child still has no immunity to the other 2 diseases.   Given the benefits of combining the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines into a single MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, why don't we see similar packaging more often? Why aren't other vaccines similarly combined? "
1507,Can/should environmental factors be assessed/exploited by geographic prevalence of disease for diagnosing/treating mysterious diseases?,"""Environmental factors"" are sometimes implicated in mysterious diseases. I think that probably goes without saying but in case that is not to be presumed I point to this study as an example.  Is it possible that if a patient for a mysterious disease lives in a location where that disease is statistically prevalent might it be a plausible and warranted step in the diagnosis of the disease to move the patient from a geographic location where the disease is prevalent to one where it is unknown, even without understanding what are the relevant differences between the two environments? Would that not go a long way to ""ruling out"" environmental factors?  Environmental things ""we know that we don't know"":   air water radon pollens   etc.  But I think this approach would be more important for the things that ""we don't know that we don't know"", which are always more elusive and abundant. "
1508,What could explain that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are not more efficient than Autologous Blood injections to treat a tendinopathy?,"A number of RCT studies have shown that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are not more efficient than autologous blood injections to treat a tendinopathy.  Example: Krogh, T., E. M. Bartels, T. Ellingsen, K. Stengaard-Pedersen, R. Buchbinder, U. Fredberg, H. Bliddal, and R. Christensen. ""OP0072 Comparative effectiveness of injection therapies in lateral epicondylitis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials."" Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 71, no. Suppl 3 (2013): 77-78. link reports:    What could explain that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are not more efficient than Autologous Blood injections to treat a tendinopathy?  Is that because Autologous Blood injections already maxed out the potential benefit of growth-factors?  I am mostly interested in epicondylitis (epicondylopathy). "
1509,Ice vs Massage for swelling,"I recently sprained my ankle causing impressive/alarming swelling.  Dispite the swelling it was not significantly painful i.e I could bear weight with out problem and had reasonable movement without pain.  The ""standard"" approach seemed to suggest immediate treatment with ice.  My wife pratices Tranditional Chinese Medicine and suggested that massage would be more effective in place of ice and I ran with that.  With just a few minutes of massage the swelling reduced DRAMATICALLY - from really bloated alarmingly swollen to just swollen. I have never seen a reduction in swelling of this magnitude with ice.  The injury took a long time to heal completely but was not a massive discomfort.    Ive subsequently looked around the web and ice (in the context or RICE) is the most recommended treatment for swelling with some advice clearly stating DONT massage.  In my particular experience the massage was impressive in its effect.  What gives?  I come from a science background and have swung around from a view of Traditional Chinese Medicine as hocuspocus to being a well constructed extreemly detailed take on treatment and prevention.  It has survived thousands of years and continues to be used because it gets results (sometimes where other approaches have failed).  Why if massage appeared so effective in my case is it not more widely recommended? "
1510,What keyboard put the least strain on the epicondyles (elbow tendons)?,"I wonder what keyboard put the least strain on the epicondyles (elbow tendons).   There exist many keyboards that advertise themselves as being ergonomic, but often fail to provide more details as to which tendon overuse do they prevent, and rarely give any point out to independent, scientific evaluation.  (I am aware that speech recognition software are great for many situations)    Here are some examples of ergonomic keyboards:  Specific Keyboards:   Kinesis Advantage (Cherry Brown/Red)) Maltron (Cherry Black) Ergodox (Cherry) example Truly Ergonomic (Cherry) ÂµTron (Topre) Goldtouch (Rubber Dome) Kinesis Freestyle (Rubber Dome) MS Ergo/Sculpt   Keyboards in Development   Ergoduck Matias Ergo Pro (Alps) Keyboard.IO CombiMouse Nexus   Extinct Keyboards:   Datahand (Optical/Magnetic) (video) IBM M15 (Buckling Spring) Cherry MX5000 (Cherry Brown/Black) Kinesis Evolution (Alps)  "
1511,Does the number of teslas matter when evaluating a tendinopathy with an MRI scanner?,"The number of teslas in MRI scanners vary between 0.2 and 7 teslas, and sometimes even up to 10.5 Teslas (Siemens MAGNETOM 10.5T) and 11.7 teslas (Siemens MAGNETOM 11.7T).   Does the number of teslas matter when evaluating a tendinopathy with an MRI scanner?  I am mostly interested in epicondylitis (epicondylopathy).    Overall, 7T MRI show some promising results, but I couldn't find any study focusing on tendinopathies:  (1) seems to say that 7T MRI have some interesting potentials, but the study is quite old (2011) and focuses on the brain:     This review illustrates current applications and possible future directions of 7 Tesla (7 T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the field of brain MRI, in clinical studies as well as clinical practice. With its higher signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) compared to lower field strengths, high resolution, contrast-rich images can be obtained of diverse pathologies, like multiple sclerosis (MS), brain tumours, aging-related changes and cerebrovascular diseases. In some of these diseases, additional pathophysiological information can be gained compared to lower field strengths. Because of clear depiction of small anatomical details, and higher lesion conspicuousness, earlier diagnosis and start of treatment of brain diseases may become possible. Furthermore, additional insight into the pathogenesis of brain diseases obtained with 7 T MRI could be the basis for new treatment developments. However, imaging at high field comes with several limitations, like inhomogeneous transmit fields, a higher specific absorption rate (SAR) and, currently, extensive contraindications for patient scanning. Future studies will be aimed at assessing the advantages and disadvantages of 7 T MRI over lower field strengths in light of clinical applications, specifically the additional diagnostic and prognostic value of 7 T MRI.   [website]  The sweet spot of 7T likely will fall in the few gaps left by its 1.5T and 3T siblings. For example, surgical planning for temporal lobe epilepsy seems to be an unmet need. âCurrent clinical imaging, 1.5T and 3T MRI, is pretty good at finding the most common pathology for temporal lobe epilepsy in a general way, but not at showing the exact extent of pathology,â says Thomas R. Henry, MD, a neurologist at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.   [website]  An ultra-high-field 7-tesla MRI scanner capable of detecting subtle abnormalities that are not detectable by conventional MRI   (2):     As is evidenced by the images presented   here, unique information relevant to   various disease processes is currently   available at 7T. There has been some   hesitation in the past about clinical use   of 7T, given concerns about whether   traditional clinical information remained   available despite changes in contrast,   signal inhomogeneity, SAR limitations,   etc. Here we demonstrate for a neuroimaging   protocol that, with appropriate RF   coils, pulse sequence modifications, and   imaging protocol optimizations, 7T scanners   may be used without losing most   of the key clinical information content   present in traditional imaging protocols   at lower field strengths. This means that   unique information of new clinical value   may now be accessed without sacrificing   routine clinical information. After a   period of exploratory development, a   portfolio of robust commercially-avalaible coils is now available for 7T use.   Availability of self-shielded 7T scanner   designs should facilitate incorporation   into hospital settings, and ongoing work   on 7T body imaging should continue   to expand the list of indications for 7T   imaging.   In summary, the tool of 7T MRI has been   carefully tuned over the past several   years. And increasingly, when we are   asked the question âWhen will 7 Tesla   scanners be ready for clinical use?â we   may finally respond: âBring on the   patients!â   mri-magnetom-7t-product_brochure-00277270.pdf:    (3) is also quite old (2007):     High-field (3T) and ultra-high-field (UHF, 7T and above) systems are increasingly being used to explore potential musculoskeletal applications because they provide a high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), potentially higher resolution (spatial and temporal), and improved contrast. However, imaging at 7T and above presents certain challenges, such as homogeneous radiofrequency (RF) coil design, increased chemical shift artifacts, susceptibility artifacts, RF energy deposition, and changes in relaxation times compared to more typical clinical scanners (1.5 and 3T). Despite these issues, MRI at 7T likely will provide some excellent opportunities for high-resolution morphologic imaging and forays into functional imaging of musculoskeletal systems. In this review we address some of these issues and also demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring high-resolution in vivo images of the musculoskeletal system in healthy human volunteers at 7.0T. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2007.   (4) does mention the usefulness of high teslas for tendon analysis:     MRI of tendons and ligaments benefits from high spatial resolution. Stronger magnetic fields lead to higher signal-to-noise ratios and improvements in image resolution; for this reason, 3-T MRI may be more sensitive than 1.5 T for detection of partial thickness tears [26]. Alternatively, higher resolution may be achieved by using a local surface coil [27]. Imaging with shorter echo times improves sensitivity to tendon changes, although this may come at the expense of specificity [28,29]. T2 weighted images are helpful for identifying fluid signal in tendon or ligament tears (Figure 5) as well as for demonstrating changes in the surrounding tissues [30]. If the orientation of a tendon changes over its course, magic angle effects may be problematic; it may therefore be helpful to acquire images with a sufficiently long echo time to avoid these artefacts.

Should you go for tartar control? Fluoride? or Both? And don't forget to think about whitening toothpastes or formulas with all-natural and Herbal ingredients.  This article says following:     With so many options and combinations available, you can try different   brands, varieties, and flavors to find the best toothpaste for you.   What will happen if someone tries new and different brand of toothpastes, say after every month?  Or it is better to stick to only a specific brand? "
1513,Why does tendon overuse sometimes evolve into a tendinitis and sometimes evolve into a tendinosis?,"From what I read, tendon overuse sometimes evolves into a tendinitis and sometimes it evolves into a tendinosis.  [website]  Individual variation in frequency and severity of tendinitis will vary depending on the type, frequency and severity of exercise or use.   [website]  The general opinion is that tennis elbow tendinosis is due to tendon overuse, and failed healing of the tendon. In addition, the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle plays a key role.[4][5]         [4] du Toit, C; Stieler, M; Saunders, R; Bisset, L; Vicenzino, B (2008). ""Diagnostic accuracy of power Doppler ultrasound in patients   with chronic tennis elbow"". British Journal of Sports Medicine 42   (11): 572â576. doi:10.1136/bjsm.2007.043901. ISSN 0306-3674.   [5] Nirschl RP, Ashman ES (2004). ""Tennis elbow tendinosis (epicondylitis)"". Instr Course Lect 53: 587â98. PMID 15116648.      How comes the same cause leads to two different injuries? What factors come into play?    The incidence of tendinitis seems to be much lower than the incidence of tendinosis:  [website]  Cases of tendonitis are actually very rare and pain goes away completely in several days to six weeks with simple treatments such as taking Advil (Ibuprofen) or Alleve (Naproxen).    [website]  Tendonitis is actually very rare; the tendon is more likely to have a condition known as tendonosis  "

1515,Suboccipital Muscle Strain Migraine Solutions,"I frequently lay on my stomach in bed to watch my TV. Because of this, my head is usually held ""backwards"". Lately this has been causing pounding, migraine-like tension headaches stemming from serious neck muscle pain. I'm looking for two solutions: 1.) Is there a quick way to relieve this? I'm trying 3-4x200mg ibuprofen and hot compresses from a microwaveable heat pack filled with some kind of straw. I also just tried adding a 200mg caffeine pill as well, as I read that can quicken the effects of the ibuprofen.  2.) Can anyone with working knowledge of the musculoskeletal system suggest a less physically demanding way to handle this activity? I've tried laying on my side, but that usually stresses one side or the other on my neck (either too many or too few pillows, I'm 6'4"" with broad shoulders), and I can't seem to find a comfortable way to lay on my stomach.  I'm very concerned the effect that either the high ibuprofen dosage or painful laying position could have on my long term health. "
1516,Healthy sitting while doing computer work,"What are the most important things to look out for concerning regular sitting in front of a desktop computer?  Frankly, I don't know what's important and what I should prioritize.   What chair should I choose? How much does it matter? Is it true that actively stabilizing one's posture, as opposed to using back-rests, arm-rests, or similar is healthier once you got used to it? How important is it to get up frequently; how often should I? Are there important tricks or routines I should apply to improve posture/health or encourage movement while sitting?   I'm interested in the first few points to know that make the biggest difference.  Before tagging this as a duplicate, please note that it is not about a single posture or chair type, such as this question on a single best posture or this one on exercise balls. My question isn't this narrow. If a great method were something like switching chair type halfway through the day, or to do a certain exercise every now and then, it would still be a valid answer.  I'd be happy if answers include scientific evidence, or hints on how to search for it. "

Once healthy food (vegetables, fruits, healthy oil's etc.) reaches the stomach the acids kick's in to break the food further. Is the stomach acid combined with healthy food the same as stomach acid combined with unhealthy food?   The endpoint is that I'm trying to find out will stomach acid combined with healthy food make less damage to the esophagus than the stomach acid combined with unhealthy food or is stomach acid just stomach acid no matter which type of food  it interacts with?

1519,Are patients with hidradenitis suppurativa overweight due to the disease itself?,"After reading about 5 journals on the disease, I noticed they all mention that HS sufferers are usually overweight. They also say that losing weight could mitigate the effects of the disease. I have not found any experimental data recording the condition before and after weight loss for a particular group, so my understanding is that the conclusion was drawn from the fact that many sufferers are overweight.  My question is how can this conclusion be empirically deduced from the observation that many HS sufferers are overweight? Could it not be that they are overweight due to the discomfort of exercise due to the condition? Or even due to eating because they're depressed (chronic depression is a known co-morbidity) "
1520,Is it unhealthy to eat too much proteins?,"I've heard body builders take a lot of proteins so that they can build their muscles.  Since taking too much certain nutrition can generally cause health problem (e.g. carbo-hydrates, salts, etc...), I thought the same goes for proteins too.  So here comes my question:   Can eating a lot of proteins cause damage to your health? Does this mean body builders who take a lot of proteins risk their health to build their muscles? Or, does the threshold of amount of eaten proteins which can be a risk for health depends on how much they are consumed to build muscles?  "

It also says that ""Diphenhydramine may cause dizziness or drowsiness.""  Question: why is it that diphenhydramine ""may"" cause dizziness or drowsiness? Are our bodies so different that it can cause dizziness/drowsiness in one person but not in another? And if it's indeed the case that our bodies are different, can it also be the case that diphenhydramine ""may"" treat sneezing, runny nose etc in some people but not in others? "
1522,Does a higher IQ influence the 'high' of weed?,"I'm not sure if this is the best place for the question, but it seemed like the appropriate board to ask on..  So, I'm not asking if Higher IQ= Smoking more weed or anything like that.  I was just wondering, from my understanding, a higher IQ basically means more connections in the brain. So does a Higher IQ influence how people react to cannabis?  Does that mean you get high faster? Slower? Or does a higher IQ change the 'high' completely? Has any research been done on this?  P.S- I tried to google the topic, but all i found were studies on the correlation of IQ and cannabis use. "

1527,What is an allergy?,"Is an allergy a negative response to a molecule that the majority of the population doesn't have?  I've heard that people can be allergic to lactose, which the majority of people aren't, while people aren't considered ""allergic"" to poisons like bleach, which affect everyone.  Is the point of an allergy that it's unusual for people in that population to have that reaction? "
1528,Digestion and absorption of large scale protein structures,"In school we learned that all ingested proteins are digested via denaturation and breaking up the larger macro-structure into peptides and amino-acids so small that they can be absorbed and which are then re-used by the body for what ever it needs these basic building blocks. This is supposedly the fate of all larger protein blocks and necessary as only small peptides and amino-acids can enter the blood stream.  While this may be the normal case for normal protein digestion, this model may turn out to be too generalised. For example, if we look at certain prion-diseases it seems possible that the causative agent for these diseases are infectious proteins.   If these proteins that cause kuru, Creuzfeldt-Jakob, BSE can be spread via ingestion of infected material then they seem to 'survive' the digestion process.     Scrapie modes of transmission have been debated for many years. Although experimental transmission can take several forms, the natural transmission of scrapie horizontally between individuals occurs through direct contact between animals and through contact with environmental contamination (reviewed in Schneider et al., 2008). Scrapie is predominantly acquired through the oral route, and the placenta and amniotic fluid are the most common sources of oral infection, although fetal parts, feces, and milk have all shown infectivity (see Schneider et al., 2008).   From: K.S. MacLea: ""What Makes a Prion: Infectious Proteins From Animals to Yeast"", International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology, Volume 329, 2017, p227-276.    That large proteins are active via the oral route seems to contradict the basic principles of protein digestion. Questions that arise here:  Do some proteins survive human digestion? Which proteins survive? How or why do they survive?  To boil that down: is the general model of protein digestion and absorption incomplete with regard to larger protein structures? Wikipedia simply states that      PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins.  "

Unfortunately, my friend forgot about that for a while and drank a bottle of beer today. Now he's worried about complications.  Is it known what complications could arise from drinking alcohol shortly after TBE vaccination, if any?  Could the vaccine be ineffective because of that? Could he get encephalitis? "
1531,"How much would a man 9'6"" (3m) tall likely weigh?","There are NBA players 7 feet (2.15m) tall who appear relatively slim and yet weigh 300 pounds (136kg) and more.  Is there a ""rule of thumb"" for estimating how much a man of greater height would weigh? I'm sure there isn't much empirical evidence about someone 8' tall, and even less of people taller yet, but what would be a ""good guess"" regarding the weight of a man 9'6"" (3m) tall? That is, someone who was not skinny as the proverbial rail nor as corpulent as a Sumo wrestler (IOW, a ""good average"").  I'm sure it's not just a certain amount of weight per inch, because the taller a person is, the wider they would also tend to be, so any rule of thumb would probably be a graduated scale (the taller the person, the greater the weight gain per inch).  I'm guessing a 9'6"" man would be at the very least 500 pounds (227kg), quite possibly 600 (273kg) or more.  Am I right? "
1532,Does FPIES ever present with widespread non-specific intolerance?,"FPIES (Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome) is a non-IgE mediated response to proteins. We have an infant that has had classic severe acute FPIES reaction to poultry. In addition, every food and oral medicine has provoked some reaction (ranging from inconsolable crying to violent vomiting and persistent diarrhea). Some vomiting (outside the 2-4h typical FPIES) occurred immediately and some was as delayed as 12 h. Are these symptoms consistent with chronic FPIES? or is FPIES only part of the answer? "
1533,What are the possible causes of heat-induced prickling pain?,"Miliaria (""sweat rash"", ""heat rash"" or ""prickly heat"") is a skin disease marked by small and itchy rashes. Miliaria is a common ailment in hot and humid conditions, such as in the tropics and during the summer season. The most commonly encountered form of the illness is miliaria rubra, in which obstruction causes leakage of sweat into the deeper layers of the epidermis, provoking a local inflammatory reaction and giving rise to the typical appearance of redness (hence rubra) and larger (but still only a few millimetres), blister-like lesions. This form of the illness is often accompanied by the typical symptomsâintense itching or ""pins and needles"" with a lack of sweating (anhidrosis) to affected areas.  Besides occlusion of sweat ducts, what are other possible causes of heat-induced, non-itchy, needle-prickling sensation all over the body that does not produce any visible rashes? And how can they be treated? "

Can it be prevented?  "
1535,Severe asthma and autoimmune skin reactions with no relief,"I have lived almost my entire life in Ross County, Ohio, which is quite polluted. I remember smelling the paper mill when I was young, I don't even smell it anymore, but people comment about it when they are in Chillicothe. Much of my childhood involved using wood stoves or kerosene heating in the winter. I remember the year 2000 when my father had plastic wrap up instead of a wall and used kerosene for heating. When I was young, I was never able to run like everyone else, and my breathing bothered me from time to time. By the time I was in high school I no longer participated in any sports. But it wasn't until a few years ago, when I joined the Army, that I was diagnosed with asthma. It meant I could never meet the physical requirements and I was sent home from basic half way through, since the inhaler didn't help enough. But since then, it seems to be getting even worse. Two years ago we partially heated the house with a clothes drier, since it was very cold and the heater wasn't working at low temperatures, and I ended up in the emergency room a few times for my breathing difficulties, I could hardly stand at times. The doctor believed the clothes drier caused it because of the extra particulate matter.   Last year I moved to Warsaw, Poland, to attend a university (it is far, far cheaper and the cost of living is extremely low, so I was able to afford it), but my breathing got so bad I had to return to the US. While in Poland, a skin issue started to appear. It appeared on my legs, arms, and especially on my hands. I just realized it is only the areas that are generally exposed (below the knees, near the elbow and lower). I saw numerous dermatologists, which proscribed me multiple fungal creams, antibiotics, and finally steroids. It seems to get better and worse, but it has never gone away. At its absolute worse, it would randomly bleed, appear red, and itch. The skin remains dry. I now have a powerful steroid (âHalcinonide Cream, USP 0.1%â). I have been using it for 5 or 6 months, off and on (when it gets better and worse), but it never goes completely away. Recently it has covered almost the entire top part of my arms, from a bit above the elbow, to my knuckles, and the front of my legs, from the knees to my ankles. I also have a lot of dandruff now, which I never had before.   I returned to Warsaw for the summer, arriving in early may, and I am about to fly back to the US. With the lower cost of living, and the very low cost of medical care, it actually saved me to come here for the summer. I also met the woman I love here, and we got married this summer, which is the primary reason I came back! I plan to come back in December and have two teeth removed (with airline tickets, it is still cheaper than in the US). In the US, I live with my mother, close to a busy road. In Poland, the road isn't too busy, but pollution is high, and there is a bus terminal along the building, and a lot of buses come and go (which I'm sure releases a lot of DPM).  My wife was recently told that our pet guinea pig likely exacerbates my asthma and caused my skin problem. We got him when it started getting cold (my breathing always gets worse at that time) and this is when my skin problems and breathing began to get worse. I ended up on strong steroid inhalers but it didn't help much. I constantly felt like I was drowning. In the spring, I stopped using the steroid inhaler because it wasn't helping all that much and I was back to my almost normal state. But I hate this normal state. I honestly can't remember the last time I didn't feel like something is stuck in my throat, like peanutbutter that won't go down. Sometimes I can't sleep and I feel tired for days. In the winters, I can hardly walk to my car without feeling like I'm suffocating. I didn't have heat in my car for awhile, which made things even more difficult.   I can't afford to move out of my mom's house. I don't know what else I can do about my breathing and my skin. I thought about buying a HEPA air filter, but they are very expensive, and I don't know how much that can help. I really don't know what more I can do, the doctors I have seen haven't helped much, and it is expensive and takes a lot of time I don't have. What options do I have? What should I try to do to help with my asthma and skin? (I almost never use the ""rescue inhaler"" unless I really really need to, but recently I need it more) Would the HEPA filter help me with this?   I just wish I could sleep and breathe "
1536,Psychosis while using prednisone: how long will it last?,"I am 29 years old, male, and for about a year I have been treated with prednisone for an Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemy; I started with 50mg/day; the dose was sistematically reduced (now I am at 5 mg/day), since the anemy got better and since the following things happened.  Already a few days (now I notice: I felt ""normal"" in that period) I was extremely agitated, I had few outburst and then I started to feel very confused, my head was blank and I also developed a maniacal behavoir (mostly of a political kind), but (and this is what really bugs me), when my mind was blank (on the bus, at the groceries store, in the office,..) images of sexual kind appeared in front of me and I had to describe the whole thing loud (I was somehow forced to do so by it; I am sorry: it is very difficult to explain, and I am not sure I understand it either).   I consulted a psychiatrist: his opinion is that the psychotic symptoms are a side effect of the prednisone; the hematologist confirmed and reduced the dose.   Now I can almost control it: when my mind goes blank I try to focus really hard on something till that feeling goes away. It doesn't work all the times, especially when I am tired, and it also gives me horrible head-aches.   Confusion, on the other side doesn't seem to get any better: sometimes I fell kind of lost, I barely understand what happens around me and what people are saying. So I wonder: how long will this torture last? If I stop taking the prednisone, will everything be solved?  Neither the psychiastrist, nor the hematologist could answer me (they warned me about the problem of stopping abrouptly the cure with prednisone).   I am worried that the prednisone triggered something that was hidden in my mind, something with which I have to learn to live, and it scares me. "
1537,Why fish is said to pose no risk despite the mercury on it?,"From Wikipedia :     According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern for most people.   Also :     Mercury is known to bioaccumulate in humans.   So why eating fish regularly is not a health concern? I'm talking even for lifetime time, imagine someone who's been eating a lot of fish for 30,50,70 years. All this mercury must cause some effect.   They want us to eat fish twice a week for Omega-3. That's 8 fish for month,96 a year. After 30 years following this advice you would have ate 2880 fish. How is this mercury not stacking up? "
1538,Salt as a treatment to gum inflammation,"I had strong pains in the gum. After several months I went to a periodontist. He said I had inflammation in my gums, and then gave me a complex treatment, but the pains remained.  After several more months, I followed advice from my wife, and started treating my mouth with salt. After several days of salting, the pains disappeared!  However, the periodontist still says I have inflammation, and have to go through the treatment again.  Now, I am not sure who to believe... the dentist, or my mouth (and my wife)?  So my question is: can regular salt-washing be a good cure for gum inflammation? "

1540,Can Helicobacter pylori affect the body outside of the digestive system?,"I had a discussion with a friend who's going through some medical issues as of lately. She underwent a few tests and met a few doctors which inquired about her medical history. She has frequent migraines and heartburn, trouble with her digestion quite often as well.   A doctor mentioned Helicobacter pylori as a possible culprit for both of those symptoms. He said that many people carried the bacteria without ever knowing, more in some countries than others.   I had already heard of H. pylori before, mostly in instances of stomach ulcers, but never thought that it could be responsible for other illnesses.  Are these phenomenon well known? Are there any efficient tests to determine if one is in fact ""infected"" with the bacteria? Are treatments required when there's no presence of stomach ulcers? "
1541,Optimal office chair for levator scapulae problems,"I am suffering from chronical neck pain caused by tension in the right levator scapulae. It does not matter how I sit on my chair, it hurts after a few minutes.   I tried chairs with a head rest and they help. However, in order to be pain free I need to sit in a very unnatural way with the head basically almost bend back into the neck resting on the head rest permanently and not moving.

1543,Is general anesthesia safe for critical patients?,Take the example of a trauma patient who has lost a lot of blood and slipping into unconsciousness.  Is giving him general anesthesia during surgery risky? or is it has no real impact on the outcome?  Is the reason behind anesthesia only to avoid discomfort to the patient from operation even in critical cases? 
1544,How does sleep affect anesthesia?,"Before surgery that requires anesthesia the patient is told stuff like don't eat. Some people cannot sleep well prior to surgery.

1545,Why does the USDA not examine aliments for weighted mean nutrient reduction potential and weighted mean fat viscocity and divulge such information?,"So I get that antioxidants are really important to combat free radicals, aging, stress, e.t.c. This information is quantified by the reduction potential. Would the value of the information be less than the costs incurred?  [website]Moreover I appreciate that the fluidity(multiplicative inverse of viscocity) of fats is really important for the endocrinous system, the digestive system and primarilly for the circulatory. The greater the saturation degree, the state of it being trans and the size of the fat the more viscous the fat and it clogs the circulatory system. Viscocity quantifies fluidity.  Would it be too expensive to comprehensively examine the aliments compared to the value of such information? "
1546,"Frequency of drug side effect listed as ""unknown""","I'm looking at the side effects of Madopar, and all of them are listed as ""unknown frequency"".  How can frequency be unknown? Even if just one of a million patients got a certain side effect, that just means that frequency is 1 millionth, right?  The only reason I can think of, is that zero side effects occurred in the drug's clinical test, AND people contacted the company about their side effects AFTER the drug was already on the market. That seems unlikely, though.  I found this link but it's a bit of a wall of text. "
1547,What are the minimum specifications for a dermascope?,"In addition to professionally sourced dermascopes that tend to be expensive are several low end devices that connect wirelessly to a smartphone. What would be the minimum specifications of a device to produce a picture that could then be sent to a dermatologist for analysis? IE: magnification (IE: 1000x vs 200x, etc.?), lighting (number of LEDs?), megapixels (minimum?), what have you?  For example, would the ""Basic"" low end version (currently $99 at Amazon) be ""a joke""? Or would it be adequate for a yes/no analysis for melanoma?  If it is inadequate, at what point do the specs become acceptable to a pro for analysis?  Note:  I expect to spend some time in a country largely dependent on telemedecine. "
1548,Emergent gastric ischemia,"I saw a news item today that said this:     The state medical examinerâs office ruled Tuesday that the death of a   Trinity student in November was accidental and caused by a rare   stomach disorder that was exacerbated by cocaine use.      Chief Medical Examiner James Gill said that Chase Hyde died of gastric   ischemia that was complicated by recent cocaine use.   Okay, so the cocaine caused vascular constriction that exacerbated his undiagnosed preexisting condition and led to the ischemia. I get that, but that's not my question.   He was an apparently healthy young man experiencing protracted nausea and vomiting and he assumed it was due to food poisoning, which isn't an unreasonable assumption. Any physician would likely have assumed the same (or a viral infection) and treated it symptomatically, which would not have saved him.  My question is how might he have been successfully diagnosed and treated if he had sought treatment immediately? Is there any scenario in which an astute physician would have identified the actual cause and treated it given the emergent nature and short time frame available? If so, how? "

See clip: [website]What determines the direction the blood flows? How does she ensure it the blood flows to her rather than away? My guess is that because she's lost a lot of blood due to a gun shot, her blood pressure would be lower. Since his blood pressure would be higher, it pushes the blood to her accordingly. Once she receives a decent amount of blood, her pressure will increase until there's an equilibrium. Is that an accurate assumption or is there something else going on?  "

1553,What does the prevalence of low potassium (hypokalemia) in 21% of hospital patients really tell us and how is it being addressed?,"According to the National Institute of Health, more than 1 in 5 hospital patients has hypokalemia (low potassium) and often this is the result of a side effect of heart related medications (ibid.):     ...Insufficient potassium intakes can increase blood pressure, kidney stone risk, bone turnover, urinary calcium excretion, and salt sensitivity (meaning that changes in sodium intakes affect blood pressure to a greater than normal extent) 1.      Severe potassium deficiency can cause hypokalemia, (serum potassium level less than about 3.6 mmol/L) [3,7,8]. Hypokalemia affects up to 21% of hospitalized patients, usually because of the use of diuretics and other medications [30,31], but it is rare among healthy people with normal kidney function.      Mild hypokalemia is characterized by constipation, fatigue, muscle weakness, and malaise [3]. Moderate to severe hypokalemia (serum potassium level less than about 2.5 mmol/L) can cause polyuria (large volume of dilute urine); encephalopathy in patients with kidney disease; glucose intolerance; muscular paralysis; poor respiration; and cardiac arrhythmias, especially in individuals with underlying heart disease [1,3,7]. Severe hypokalemia can be life threatening because of its effects on muscle contraction and, hence, cardiac function [5].      ...Hypokalemia is rarely caused by low dietary potassium intake alone, but it can result from diarrhea due to potassium losses in the stool. It can also result from vomiting, which produces metabolic alkalosis, leading to potassium losses in the kidneys. Hypokalemia can also be caused by refeeding syndrome (the metabolic response to initial refeeding after a starvation period) because of potassiumâs movement into cells; laxative abuse; diuretic use; eating clay (a type of pica); heavy sweating; or dialysis [3,5,7,32,33]...      Magnesium depletion can contribute to hypokalemia by increasing urinary potassium losses [1,34,35]. It can also increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias by decreasing intracellular potassium concentrations. More than 50% of individuals with clinically significant hypokalemia might have magnesium deficiency [35]. In people with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, both should be treated concurrently [7]...   From what I understand from the article, though, this measurement is somewhat limited in that most of the potassium is stored in the cells of the body, not in the blood (ibid.) and that measurement is rarely taken because of the difficulty. If so then:   is this percentage really a meaningful indicator of hypokalemia? if so, is this addressed by doctors or hospital nutritionists? if so, how? if not, why not? What should be done?   "
1554,Is a CT scan specific to an organ?,"Is a CT Scan specific to an organ?   What I mean by that question is the following: if you google a bit you will often find list with radiation exposure due to the CT scan, see for example here. In these lists the dose varies depending on what exactly gets scanned. But its not unusual to find lists that are divided by bodyparts, rather than organs (the examples for this would be in German, so I'm not sure if linking them is alright). What I now would like to know is if one scan of a body part can be used to evaluate different organs.  For example, if your urologist sends you to a CT scan of your kidneys can the same CT scan be used to evaluate your gastrointestinal tract, or your colon, etc.? What are the limitations of this and does it make a difference if contrast material was used or not?    Note: I am not interested in answers about the radiation dose due to CT scans! "
1555,Do antibiotic-resistant bacteria present greater danger than related strains prior to development of antibiotics?,"Are antibiotic-resistant bacteria more dangerous besides their resistance?  I am aware of the way things were before the first antibiotics: people died from infections often and diseases like syphilis were protracted death sentences.   My question is motivated by the following ideas:   Is it possible that antibiotic resistance also means that some bacteria will be harder for the immune system (without effective antibiotics) to combat? That in a general sense, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are ""stronger"" or more aggressive? If there is a genetic component to fighting off bacterial infections, do the generations since antibiotics have a higher percentage of members who are not going to be as good as people were on average 90 or so years ago at dealing with infections?

1556,Which hormonal treatments have been shown to be useful to prevent or treat tendinopathies?,"Which hormonal treatments have been shown to be useful to prevent or treat tendinopathies?  {1} surveyed the links between hormones and tendinopathies but their main conclusion is:     The influence of hormones on tendon structure and metabolism needs to be further investigated. If found to be significant, multidisciplinary preventive and therapeutic strategies should then be developed.   {2} is a good example of what kind of hormonal treatment recommendations there could be: they showed that oral contraceptives provide protection against anterior cruciate ligament tears based on a national database study of 165,748 female patients.

1557,What is the medical consensus regarding the effect sugar consumption has on health?,"""Sugar"" here means commonly consumed sugars: glucose, fructose, sucrose and HFCS.  Is eating sugar always bad? Can it be eaten in moderation and present no risk to diabetes and other issues? Or should ideally all food be completely without any sugar? Even in a healthy adult of average weight, with no health issues, an otherwise healthy diet and exercise regimen?  I'm aware that the human adult doesn't appear to require glucose consumption, since it can be synthesized within the body: [website]I'm also aware that the media might promote sugar as a bad thing to consume. However, this seems to be often correlated with people that have other health issues, such as obesity or lack of physical activity.  To answer this I'd like to see a survey paper which presents a summary of the available research on the topic.  I've attempted to figure this out myself, is this paper any good? Does it represent the consensus in the field (if there even is a consensus!)?  [website]The available research appears to be weak in some areas. Consider e.g. regarding cognitive performance deterioration:  ""Studies performed ranging in duration from 10 weeks to 24 weeks and employing average levels of consumption of fructose containing sugars have not found any evidence of cognitive change [123,124].""  This wouldn't say anything about changes that might happen over 10 or 20 years of added sugar.  Is there a better survey paper, or perhaps a collection of papers that are interesting? "

His statement is supported by this paper.  What is the Antidepressant response post MAOI tachyphylaxis? Does the treatment resistance and exacerbation of underlying depression apply to all MAOIs regardless of reversibility (e.g.: the older MAOIs that covalently bond to the MAO such tranylcypromine and phenelzine vs. moclobemide) and selectivity (e.g.: the MAO-B selective selegiline vs. the MOA-A selective moclobemide)?

Googling, I've noticed that ""activated carbon"" may be useful for this purpose, in some contexts, but frankly I have no idea whether that makes sense or whether what works for water filters is relevant for air filtration.  PS - I'm not in Houston myself, but my home town also has a refinery which emits some Benzene. "
1565,Why are airplane pilots more likely to have skin cancer?,"I read on [website]  âPilots do have a higher incidence of skin cancer,â said Dr. James M. Spencer, a member of the board of directors of the American Academy of Dermatology and an expert in skin cancer treatment and cosmetic surgery in St. Petersburg, Fla., referring to several studies about skin cancers among airline pilots.      Why exactly more pilots have skin cancer is not known (for instance it could be from cosmic radiation, changing circadian rhythms or from, say, spending a lot of time outdoors in the places they fly to). And to complicate matters, no one has done a scientific comparison of instances of skin cancer in frequent fliers versus non-frequent fliers, Dr. Spencer said.   The article was written in 2012. Since then, have we understood why airplane pilots are more likely to have skin cancer? "
1566,What are long term complications of mild to moderate leg length discrepancy?,"A leg-length discrepancy (from femur fracture or any other etiology) obviously causes an imbalance in gait, and therefore the entire kinetic chain.  This often happens at a young age and therefore they face an entire lifetime of gait imbalance.  A large discrepancy is sometimes treated surgically (but it is not a minor procedure).  Moderate, with a shoe lift.  Mild, with an insole.  But when not wearing a lift or insole (e.g. walking barefoot at home), your kinetic chain is still imbalanced.  Which leads me to ask:   What are the long term MSK complications resulting from this imbalance?   Are there physical therapy techniques that aid in minimizing harm to joints etc?   (This was an interesting case in my ortho rotation; I was not satisfied with the answers from 2 orthopedic surgeon attendings, who refer to orthotics but don't regularly refer to PT for this.  My reading has yielded mixed opinions.) "

A Google search brings up plenty of results.  However, few of them cite any concrete evidence. In fact, even those that mention sources point to circumstantial evidence at best. For instance Livestrong.com states     A 2012 study published in the International Journal of Preventative   Medicine investigated the effects of cinnamon in people with type 2   diabetes. One group took cinnamon supplements every day, while the   other group took a placebo. After eight weeks, the cinnamon group lost   more weight and body fat than the group taking the placebo, even   though the cinnamon group did not make any changes to their usual   eating habits.   Similarly, all 12minuteathlete.com put forth to back their claim is     If youâve ever read the 4-Hour Body by Tim Ferris (and if you havenât,   I highly recommend it), you probably remember the section on his   cinnamon experiments. Basically, he found that eating about one and a   half teaspoons of cinnamon a day can help regulate glucose levels,   which in turn helps control weight gain.   Idealbite.com goes into more detail about the purported effects of cinnamon on the body and mentions two studies but doesn't give links or any information with which to find either of them.  So basically, my question is how much evidence is there really for the metabolism-accelerating effects of cinnamon intake and how conclusive is it? "
1570,How long should one wait to eat after exercise,"I read some articles which claim that after each workout, we should have at least one hour's rest before meal; others suggest half an hour. Otherwise, it will do damage to one's stomach. These were in Chinese; I haven't found any English articles talking about this.   Does having a meal shortly after workout cause any harm to one's stomach? If so, what is the time period one should wait before eating?  "

1572,Do periodontal exams spread infection?,"When a dentist is measuring how far gums have receded and looking for infection below the gum line they use a probe which they insert below the gum line and record how far it goes before hitting healthy tissue (or at least that is my understanding). They record the depth measurement of a tooth and then move onto the next using the same probe and without washing it in between.   It seems to me that this would be a great way to spread infection from one gum to the next. I asked my hygienist why this isn't considered unsafe. She started to explain to me why it wasn't dangerous and then caught herself and said ""I don't know"".  So am I right to be concerned? Might they be unwittingly spreading infection throughout the mouth by this seemingly unsanitary exam practice? "
1573,Is there a service that translates medical reports into everyday language?,"Medical reports can be quite long and may contain complicated vocabulary that is difficult or impossible for patients to understand.  In Germany, thereâs a website called Was habâ ich? (âWhat do I have?â) to which a patient may submit their medical report. Students of medicine (8th term upwards) and MDs who participate in the project translate said report into everyday language. They explain the concepts behind symptoms and prescriptions in a way that is easy to understand.  This is a lot of work: I have seen people work twenty hours on a single, complicated letter, and a medical report of two pages may very well translate into a document of twenty pages. This work is done in their spare time and is not paid.  This service is offered to patients free of charge because it should be absolutely independent of a patientâs income. The platform is funded through donations.  Is there an English service where patients can get their medical reports explained / translated into everyday language? If so, is it gratuitous? "
1574,Link between combat sports and mental health,"Is there evidence to suggest a link between exercising of combat sports and mental health problems (in the later future). For example is there any (reaffirmed) study that shows a higher risk for alzheimer, etc. when the patient done x hours/week of sparring in a full contact combat sport? Professional vs Amateurs?  "

1576,Taking Blood Pressure Bilaterally -- Why?,There's a physician that always takes blood pressures bilaterally for EVERY patient he sees.

Assuming there is a difference -- what would that even mean?  
1577,Why do tennis elbow (epicondylitis) mostly affect the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB)?,"It has been shown (1, 2) that tennis elbows (epicondylitis) mostly affect the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB). Why does it mostly affect this muscle, and rarely the other muscles attached to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus?  Here is an excerpt from (1):     In lateral tennis elbow, the tissue most commonly involved,   based on the experience of the senior author, is the origin of the ECRB (100% of the   time), the anterior edge of the EDC (50% of the time), and occasionally the   underside of the extensor carpi radialis longus. Radiographic identification of bony   exostosis of the lateral epicondyle occurs in 20% of cases, but has no significance   regarding indications for tendon surgery per se. If, however, the exostosis is   prominent, or tender to palpation, removal of the exostosis is recommended as   adjunctive treatment at the time of surgery. In this instance it should be noted that   the majority of the lateral epicondyle and the origin of the extensor aponeurosis is   not resected, only the exostosis.     [â¦]   The senior authorâs experience with the described surgical techniques now   exceeds 1300 cases (1000 lateral and 300 medial).

1578,How long will it take for pink skin after the falling of the scab to return to normal colouration?,"About two weeks ago, I had a (minor) accident which thankfully did not result in any major damage to my bones or my joints, but which did leave me with a rather large wound near and below my elbow. It was after 9 days that the dark brown scab covering it fell off, some two days after a liberal dabbing of Soframycin (framycetin sulphate).Though the region looks and also feels infinitely healthier, the skin where the scab once was has turned pink and in some places is even almost reddish.   So I have three questions:  1) Is the pink pigmentation any cause for alarm or is it natural in skin after scabs?  2) Is the colour going to return to normal naturally or I get it treated (if there is a treatment) by a dermatologist?  3) Is there any cream/lotion/other medication that could encourage and/or speed up the process?  Also, I have shown the pink patch of skin to my closest friend, and upon his advice, I apply palm oil to it twice each day. Is that a good idea or should I discontinue it? "
1579,Is it safe to swim during the healing period of a nipple piercing?,"I am a male and I am considering to get one of my nipples pierced. I swim regularly (4-5 times a week) in a swimming pool and I was wondering if there is any problem with swimming during the healing period of the piercing.   Is it possible or should it be avoided? In case it is possible, should any special precautions be taken?  P.S. I haven't still decided if I am going to get the piercing or not, that's the reason why I haven't still asked a professional about it. "
1580,Does neovascularization help or hinder healing in a tendinopathy?,"Many studies have shown that tendinopathies often come with neovascularization in the injured area. Does neovascularization help or hinder healing in a tendinopathy?    From [website]  HORNER: We call it tennis elbow. What do you call it?      DR. CONGENI: You want the medical term? Itâs called tendinopathy or   tendinosis. It means now itâs not just tendinitis anymore. If you   looked under a microscope at your tendon, instead of being a nice   shock-absorbing tendon tissue, itâs got all this junkie scar tissue as   the body tries to heal this overload injury.      HORNER: Once you have it, do you always have it?      DR. CONGENI: No. The good news about it is thereâs this thing called neovascularization, and what that means is new blood vessels go into the area and repair the tendon. It repairs itself, but it takes a long time.   However, (1) hypothesized that eccentric exercises are effective to heal a tendinopathy as they reduce the neovascularization.     (1) Ãhberg, Lars, and HÃ¥kan Alfredson. ""Effects on neovascularisation behind the good results with eccentric training in chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinosis?."" Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy 12, no. 5 (2004): 465-470. [website]  The occurrence of a neovascularisation in the area with   tendon changes, demonstrated with colour Doppler examination   simultaneously with ultrasonography, has been   shown to possibly be correlated with pain in chronic midportion   Achilles tendinosis[13]. In that study, it was demonstrated   that passive dorsiflexion of the ankle stopped   the flow in these vessels (area with neo-vascularisation)   (Fig. 1a, b)      [â¦]      In a recent pilot study on patients with chronic midportion   Achilles tendinosis, sclerosing the area with neovascularisation   outside the ventral part of the tendon cured   the pain in the majority of patients [14]. The results of this   study indicate that the area with neovascularisation (neovessels   and accompanying nerves) might be the source of   pain in the chronic stage of this condition      [â¦]      Four patients (four tendons) did not wanted to participate   in the follow-up.   At follow-up after treatment (mean 28 months, range   3â48), there was a good clinical result (no tendon pain   during loading) in 36/41 tendons, and a poor result in 5/41   tendons.   In 34/36 tendons with a good clinical result of treatment   there was an ultrasonographically more normal tendon   structure, and in 32/36 tendons there was no remaining   neovascularisation (Fig. 2a, b). In 4/36 tendons with a   good clinical result from treatment a minor neovascularisation   remained, and in 2/36 tendons there were remaining   structural abnormalities. In 5/5 tendons with a poor   clinical result there was a remaining neovascularisation in   the tendon, and in 2/5 tendons there were remaining structural   abnormalities.      [â¦]      The results from the current study indicate that there   might be something in the eccentric training regimen that   affects the area with neovascularisation. It is difficult to   explain exactly how the eccentric exercises have influence   on the area with neovessels, but using dynamic ultrasound   and colour Doppler examination we have demonstrated   that during the heel-drop the flow in the neovessels   is stopped, whilst in the resting position there is flow   again (Fig. 1a, b). Theoretically, if the flow is stopped 180   times/day (the eccentric program consists of 180 repetitions/   day), this might, directly or indirectly, hurt the neovessels   and accompanying nerves.

[website]vessel, which results in sclerosis of that vessel):     Sclerotherapy involves injecting a chemical into a blood   vessel, which results in sclerosis of that vessel. Polidocanol   was used as the sclerosing agent in all of the studies.   Polidocanol is not FDA-approved although other sclerosing   agents are. The rationale behind using sclerotherapy in   tendinopathy is based on the finding that there is a proliferation   of small blood vessels in areas of tendinopathy.   Nerve fibers appear to travel in close proximity to these   areas of neovascularization [24, 95, 97]. It is possible these   nerve fibers are the pain generators in tendinopathy. In   theory, injecting a sclerosing agent into the areas of   neovascularization could not only sclerose the vessels, but   also may eradicate the pain-generating nerve fibers.       [â¦]Although polidocanol injections appear to provide   pain relief, it is unclear what role they may play in   tendon healing in tendinopathy. Intuitively, one would   think sclerosing the neovessels of a damaged tendon   would be detrimental to tendon healing and could possibly   even cause more damage. Polidocanol injections do   appear safe, however.  "
1581,"Formula for true Glycaemic index (GI) with varibles (mixing foods, cooking and portion size)","Nowadays its considered good advice to inform people whom are tempting to lose weight to avoid high Glycaemic index (GI) foods as these cause the Insulin hormone to be produced at greater amounts and stall weight loss, and promote weight gain, which isn't something people want, or need for a healthier life style, unless your attempting to build muscle mass and strength then sometimes these spikes may be desirable at certain times of the day... pretty common knowledge nowadays.  It really sounds straight forward until you dive deeper and start to consider all the variables, for example:   Oats rolled have lower GI than Instant Oats  Oats have a lower GI when mixed with milk than water   Other variables to be taken into consideration is:   Fibre, fat and other nutritions can lower GI. Cooked and processed foods can make the GI higher. Mixing foods with others foods can either lower or make the GI higher. Even the size of the portion can effect the GI.   So, its clear that GI is very complex and you need to consider all the factors, generally balancing high GI with low GI will offset the total GI, but what isn't clear is how they calculate this all.  Question(s):  Ideally, I'm looking for the formulas to be able to work out the true GI myself, Knowing the stand-alone GI is pretty useless for most people eating proper meals and not snacks.   How do you calculate GI when mixing food? for example oats with milk vs water. How is the GI portion size also calculated? this may already be on the site, please link How is the GI calculated for foods that are raw, or cooked?  "
1582,Do tendinopathies have the same pathogenesis regardless of where they occur in the human body?,"Tendinopathies may appear in many areas of the body, such as the rotator cuff, the Achilles tendon, the patellar ligament, the adductors of the hip, the triceps, the flexors and extensors of the elbow, and the plantar fascia (1). Do tendinopathies have the same pathogenesis regardless of where they occur in the human body?     (1) Kraushaar, Barry S., and Robert P. Nirschl.

1584,Will food allergy rashes eventually stop appearing?,"I've recently noticed that after eating certain food, I develop a minor allergic reaction in form of a small red rash or two, anywhere on my body.  The allergic reaction is in my opinion very minor, developing almost mosquito-byte sized rashes. Besides being annoying visually, they do not irritate me.  Since these dishes are a big part of my diet, and a big part of my culture in general, I do not want to give up this diet.  My question is is it possible that body will eventually get used to this diet again, stopping the rashes from appearing? Is there any research on this? "
1585,"The ""gay bomb"" and medical aphrodisiacs","Former Nobel laureates and other researchers at Harvard awarded the 2007 Ig Nobel Peace Prize to the creators of the ""gay bomb"" -- a non-lethal military weapon under development intended to induce demoralizing homosexual behavior with aphrodisiacs. The Ig Nobel Peace Prize being a high profile award for a serious scientific development that makes you ""laugh and think"".  It seemed to me that, as ideas are truly a ""dime a dozen"", they must have conducted at least some research indicating promising candidate aphrodisiacs to use as the active ingredient of this weapon (?). However, this seems to conflict with what I know about the state of R&amp;D on medical aphrodisiacs.  To my knowledge, PT-141 is the only substance that has shown any promise in increasing libido, and that's only in the case of women with depressed sexual response. I have only been able to find a few brief scattered references in to copulins / pheromones and androstenone in conjunction with the ""gay bomb"".   Does anyone know either what may have been the candidate aphrodisiacs or if there's any evidence to suggest that copulins and pheromones increase sexual desire in men?  It's just a matter of curiosity. If some pheromone were effective in increasing libido in men then I would've expected to see a huge market for it and perhaps big pharma creating products that combine PDE5 inhibitors like ""Viagra"" with pheromones.

1587,What are the long-term side effects of glyceryl trinitrate patches used to treat a tendinopathy?,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to help tendon healing [1,3]. One common way to deliver NO is via glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches. In the short run, glyceryl trinitrate can cause severe headaches, skin rashes, hypertension, and more rarely bradycardia [1,2].  What are the long-term side effects of glyceryl trinitrate patches used to treat a tendinopathy?   I am especially interested in the long-term impact on the tendon and its surroundings. I am mostly interested in epicondylitis (epicondylopathy).    References (in references 1 and 3, one of the authors, George A. C. Murrell, has a conflict of interest, as indicated in the article (1) ""George A. C. Murrell receives or has the potential to receive royalties from a patent on nitric oxide and tendon healing."", and as (3) says, ""As the majority of the work in the area of NO in the treatment of tendinopathy has come from one group, larger multicenter trials would be useful in validating this treatment modality.""):   1 Bokhari, Ali R., and George AC Murrell. ""The role of nitric oxide in tendon healing."" Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery 21, no. 2 (2012): 238-244. [website]  Nitric oxide (NO) is a small free radical that is generated by a family of enzymes called the nitric oxide synthases (NOS). There are 3 isoforms of NOS: endothelial NOS (eNOS), brain or neuronal NOS (bNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). In experiments performed during the last 20 years, we have shown that NO is induced by all 3 isoforms of NOS after tendon injury and that NOS activity is upregulated in tendinopathy. In normal uninjured tendons, there is very little NOS activity. In injured rat and human tendons, NOS activity was found in healing fibroblasts in a temporal fashion. In animal models, competitive inhibition of NOS resulted in reduced tendon healing, whereas the addition of NO resulted in enhanced tendon healing. In cultured human cells, the addition of NO via chemical means and adenovirus transfection resulted in enhanced collagen synthesis. We performed 3 randomized, double-blinded clinical trials that demonstrated a significant positive beneficial effect of NO treatment on clinical symptoms and function in patients with Achilles tendinopathy, tennis elbow, and supraspinatus tendonitis. NO was delivered via glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches. We also conducted a 3-year prospective follow-up that demonstrated significant long-term efficacy of GTN patches in treating noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy. In a 5-year prospective comparison treating lateral epicondylitis, we found no additional benefits of GTN vs placebo at 5 years. The use of a new GTN patch, OrthoDerm, demonstrated no evidence for efficacy in treating chronic lateral epicondylitis.        2 [website][3] Andres, Brett M., and George AC Murrell. ""Treatment of tendinopathy: what works, what does not, and what is on the horizon."" Clinical orthopaedics and related research 466, no. 7 (2008): 1539-1554. [website]  Tendinopathy is a broad term encompassing painful conditions occurring in and around tendons in response to overuse. Recent basic science research suggests little or no inflammation is present in these conditions. Thus, traditional treatment modalities aimed at controlling inflammation such as corticosteroid injections and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDS) may not be the most effective options. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the best treatment options for tendinopathy. We evaluated the effectiveness of NSAIDS, corticosteroid injections, exercise-based physical therapy, physical therapy modalities, shock wave therapy, sclerotherapy, nitric oxide patches, surgery, growth factors, and stem cell treatment. NSAIDS and corticosteroids appear to provide pain relief in the short term, but their effectiveness in the long term has not been demonstrated. We identified inconsistent results with shock wave therapy and physical therapy modalities such as ultrasound, iontophoresis and low-level laser therapy. Current data support the use of eccentric strengthening protocols, sclerotherapy, and nitric oxide patches, but larger, multicenter trials are needed to confirm the early results with these treatments. Preliminary work with growth factors and stem cells is promising, but further study is required in these fields. Surgery remains the last option due to the morbidity and inconsistent outcomes. The ideal treatment for tendinopathy remains unclear.  "

1589,Interpreting DXA results myself,"I want to determine my body fat percentage.   Every hospital here in Bangkok offers me the InBody method, which is based on Bio Electrical Impedance and highly sensitive to my hydration levels in the measurements. According to some, measuring my circumference will give me a reading that is of comparable accuracy and significantly cheaper.  Bod Pods or other systems using Air Displacement Plethysmography are nowhere to be found in Bangkok.   I'd much rather use Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA, previously DEXA), a technology used for bone density readings but increasingly used for body composition readings. Hospitals here do have these machines, but seem unaware of this alternative use for them.   So I'm wondering ... what kind of data does such a machine produce? Are they standard readouts that even a non-expert could interpret, would a physician used to InBody readings be able to interpret the results, or would it need to be someone who is used to using the DXA machines for body composition readings?

1590,How to schedule bowel movements?,"I've had trouble sleeping for nearly 6 years now. I have had this lingering suspicion that maybe my sleep issues might have something to do with digestion but only recently confirmed it by keeping a sleep log. Every day I couldn't sleep, I ended up having a bowel movement within 2 hours. I guess there's some kind of nerve in the intestines that tells the body to wake up when it nears the exit.  I tried eating more fiber but it kind of exacerbated the problem because it increases the frequency of bowel movements, making it more likely that I'll wake up before I've had enough sleep. (Unless I'm doing it wrong? I eat a big bowl of lentils in the morning)  What can I do to make sure that my bowel movements are well into the afternoon and not during the nighttime or morning? "
1591,Shadowing a Doctor,"My doctor has allowed me to shadow him. As an aspiring med student, I'd no doubt relish the opportunity. I've obtained his availability from the secretary (for simplicity let's say: May 15-19 and June 12-17).   Should I request to shadow him for all of these shifts or would that be overboard? I'm asking because I don't want to be too much of a burden.  To all doctors and medical staff out there: what would be the optimal amount of time for a student to shadow you? how willing are you to take on a student? "
1592,Does hyperthermia help treating a tendinopathy?,"I have read a series of randomized control trials and case studies by the same research group (1,2,3) that seem to indicate that hyperthermia helps treat tendinopathies. The hyperthermia machines they used combine a superficial cooling system and a deep-heating source with a microwave power generator at 434 MHz (to be precise, 433.92-MHz microwaves generator with a maximum output power of 100 W). They used a ALBA Hyperthermia System (Restek SRL, Rome, Italy).  However, I couldn't find RCTs from other research groups confirming or infirming these results. (4) seems to show on tenocytes that were isolated from rabbit Achilles tendon that hyperthermia upregulates tenocyte catabolism and downregulates anabolism:    and (5) indicate that tendon hyperthermia could be a potential cause of tendon injury.

1596,Maximizing breathing: one long breath or two short breaths?,"As a general rule for physical exertion, continuous, rhythmic, and controlled breathing is essential. This includes short ""sprint"" type bursts of activity as well as long ""endurance"" periods of activity.  When it comes to ensuring or maximizing your oxygen intake, it seems more natural to take one long breath, although many athletes and depictions of athletes (entertainment) often end up using two shorter breaths to constitute a single intake of air.  Which method provides the most efficient/maximum oxygen intake during physical exertion? Is there a better, alternative method?     Method 1:      innnnnnnnnnnn (one long, deep breath in)      outttttttttttttt (one long, pushing breath out)      Method 2:      innnn innnn (two short, staccato breaths in)      outtttt (one short, quick breath out... although could be two, but I find typically one is enough)   Note: the two methods seem to be at odds. One long breath feels like more intake, but takes longer and this can be difficult to maintain in some circumstances as exhaustion sets in. Two short breaths feels quicker, tends to encourage a rhythm, and seems to get the job done, but does it really give you as much intake? "

My question is: how can I avoid or reduce the risks of having my health deteriorated because of a bad quality of air?  For example:    does leave open the window of my room all day is dangerous for me ?  should I avoid walking or running along traffic queues ? does having indoor plants can benefit me ?

I naturally worry about this sort of stuff as obviously, I don't want it to be anything heart related. I have booked an appointment with my GP but the earliest date they had for me was 1st June, which I've agreed to.  Should I dial it down a notch or two for the time being?  Andy "
1600,Does antibiotics weaken immune system or causes Fever,"If your popping antibiotics everyday, prescribed by your doctor though he asked you to revisit after two months and warned you to ignore any fever symptoms during these two months. I'm just wondering if Fever (with chill) is expected while taking antibiotics? I have read somewhere that antibiotics kill good as well as bad bacteria, so does it mean that it weakens my immune system if I keep taking it for two months? Any advice/precautions while taking antibiotics?  Thanks.  "
1601,Why should one avoid icing the ulnar nerve directly when icing the elbow?,"I read on [website]  Ice is an important element in the healing process and should be used any time signs of inflammation or intense pain are present, no matter how soon or long after the injury. Post exercises ice is also recommended and may be done in conjunction with sensory level electrical stimulation to promote pain and inflammation control. The benefits of ice include a reduction in pain, inflammation, and muscle spasm. Time of ice application ranges from 15-30 minutes. Icing over 30 minutes may cause frost bite. To protect the skin a thin layer of cloth between the skin and ice is worthwhile. Avoid icing the ulnar nerve directly when icing the elbow.

1602,Why do burn wounds benefit from cooling (beyond the first few seconds of actually lowering the temperature back to regular skin level)?,"As in the title: why do burn wounds benefit from cooling (beyond the first few seconds of actually lowering the temperature back to regular skin level)? Advice for burn wounds always include cooling afterwards because of some 'afterburn', but what does that mean and what are the mechanisms at play here?  As for type of burns, just assume a hot water burn. I am not a medical specialist and don't know the differences. "
1603,"What's caused by the chemicals, and what's caused by the smoke","The great many downsides of smoking are certainly well-documented by now (to say the least), but something I've struggled to find an answer to is the following:  When looking at health risks of smoking, what's caused by the substance in question being absorbed and interacting negatively with the body, and what's caused simply by the act of inhaling smoke?  My assumption would be that most of the damage is caused by the inhalation of the smoke itself, especially any damage to the mouth, oesophagus, and lungs, smoke (any kind) simply being dangerously irritating to these parts of the body. Then, damage to the brain and/or other parts of the body are mostly caused by the specific substance being smoked... How much of this assumption is correct?  Perhaps it's misleading to try and separate the smoke from what's causing the smoke at all, as what's creating the smoke dictates how bad it is. However, if that's the case, doesn't that imply that some products for smoking, while still bad, may create smoke which is ""less damaging"" than others?  For ease of answering, feel free to just concentrate on tobacco products (possibly including any additional chemicals added to the final product) if you feel it's necessary to keep your answer from not being too long.

1604,How do I opt out my details from Google-owned artificial intelligence?,"Recently it was revealed that Googleâs London-based company DeepMind artificial intelligence would be able to access the NHS records of 1.6 million patients who use three London hospitals.  Supposedly I don't want my health details shared with some AI program, especially moving my medical records (along with other 1.6 million patients) to 3rd party database for some processing purposes over concerns of my medical confidentiality.  How can I opt out my details from being harvested by Google-owned artificial intelligence? Is there any procedure of that? "
1605,"During the GMEP of 1955-1968: ""malaria had been eliminated in 35 countries"" versus ""15 countries and one territory eliminated malaria""","In one source, it is claimed that, during the Global Malaria Eradication Program (GMEP) of 1955-1968 ""malaria had been eliminated in 35 countries"".  In another source, it is claimed that, during this period ""15 countries and one territory eliminated malaria"".    === SOURCE 1: ===  The MOOC ""HarvardX: MalariaX: Defeating Malaria from the Genes to the Globe"", namely in the video of the MOOC's ""Module 1, Chapter 1: The Past: A Historical Overview"".  From the subtitles (at timecode 6:46) of that video:     PEDRO L. ALONSO: First one, just to recognize as wasn't good, wasn't   bad -- by 1948 when the call for eradication 55, 148 countries -- or   what are now countries, at that time they weren't -- were considered   malarious. By the end of the first attempt, malaria had been   eliminated in 35 countries. So is that success or failure?   From the accompanying presentation of that video (cf. in video), the particular timespan that is talked about, is clarified. From the title of the presentation slide at the mentioned timecode:     Global Malaria Eradication Program (1955-1968).   And underneath the title:   By 1967:  Of 148 countries with malaria in 1948:   Eradication in 35.      === SOURCE 2: ===  Eliminating Malaria, WHO:  In 1955, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP), an ambitious plan to eradicate malaria worldwide. The Programme relied heavily on two tools: the drug chloroquine for prevention and treatment of malaria and the chemical DDT for mosquito control. Over the course of the GMEP era, 15 countries and one territory eliminated malaria (Table 1). A number of other countries succeeded in greatly reducing their malaria burden. But no major success occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and, in many settings, a failure to sustain the Programme resulted in resurgences of malaria. In 1969, GMEP was discontinued, but the longer-term objective remained unchanged.    === DISCUSSION / QUESTION: ===  In the first source, there is mention of the year 1948. The second source only mentions 1955 as the beginning of the GMEP-period. My question is (35 minus 16 = 19), which 19 countries and/or territories became malaria-free during the period 1948-1955, or (what I hypothesize) which one of these sources is wrong? "
1606,STI vs STD vs Sexually Transmitted Virus,"I am very confused as in my answer to Why is HIV singled out from other STIs? I agreed with the OP that HIV is an STI.  I have been led to believe the following definitions:  STI  Stands for Sexually Transmitted Infection â an infection caused by bacteria or virus which has been transmitted through sexual contact.  STD  Stands for Sexually Transmitted Disease â a disease caused by the infection of a bacteria or virus transmitted through sexual contact.  With regard to HIV  These definitions class HIV as an infection.  This is a fact to me because:  (bold emphasis mine)     Over time, HIV can destroy so many of these cells that the body canât fight off [other] infections and disease. These opportunistic infections or cancers take advantage of a very weak immune system and signal that the person has AIDS, the last stage of HIV infection (HIV.gov, 2017)**&nbsp;Website managed by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services and supported by theSecretaryâs Minority AIDS Initiative Fund (SMAIF).   HIV is a retrovirus, which is:     a family of viruses that are grouped together based on how they are structured and how they replicate within a host. Besides human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, there a two other retroviruses that can cause human illness. One is called human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and the other is called human T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-II) (Minnesota Department of Health, n.d.).   Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is primarily transmitted through sexual intercourse or from mother to child (Paiva &amp; Casseb, 2014) making HTLV-1 an STI in definitions I have been led to believe, and AIDS is an STD due to the fact that it is caused by HIV infection which in many circumstances is transmitted through sexual contact, although HIV can be transmitted through other means (see my answer).  It cannot be an STI as AIDS is not transmitted.  It is a disease as a result of HIV infection.  What creates a confusion?  In the comments to my answer, @Jan stated that HIV is not an STI, but just a virus.  To make matters worse, when trying to confirm or deny his responses I have been trying to look up a definitive definition and found that in the key points of this factsheet, it states that:     HIV is an STD. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and syphilis are examples of other STDs. (National Institutes of Health, n.d.)   So the question is: What is the difference between STIs, STD and ""just a virus transmitted through sexual contact""?

1607,Does elevated potassium lead to elevated cortisol?,"I came across this statement on Selfhacked:      If you have high cortisol, you will do worse with a high salt diet and you will be potassium deficient in the long term (few people as it is get the RDA). But taking potassium supplements is not simple, because the deficiency is in your cells, not your blood.  Also, potassium raises cortisol, which isnât good if you already have high levels. Cortisol is anti-inflammatory, but it can also cause arthritis by inhibiting collagen formation and also by lowering cell potassium. Cell potassium is always low in rheumatoid arthritis (R). The answer is to reduce stress.   I tried searching for any proof of this, but haven't been able to find. Is this true? Does potassium really raise cortisol? Are there any published research articles confirming this?   Does it follow from this (if true) that a constant overdose of potassium-rich foods may cause a Cushing-like state? This sounds doubtful to me. "
1608,I am confused about this hot sauce nutrition label,"So I know calorie rounding is a thing. Although I don't know how it really works. Something like if it's under 5 calories you can put it as zero, correct?  Regardless why is it, in the per 100 grams section, it says it contains 2 calories but 20 grams of carbs/sugar? How does that work?   "
1609,Is it known how often unvaccinated children are contagious with symptom free diseases?,"I was looking at the CDC Vaccine Schedule for children, and it says that many of the things kids are vaccinated for may show no symptoms.    Do any of those diseases ââ mainly haemophilus influenzae, Hepatitis A, Polio and Pneumococcal ââ stay in a persons system with no symptoms for a long time? Does getting a vaccine later in life, but after they've been contracted, without exhibiting symptoms, cure the diseases? And is it known how kids can be carriers for these diseases (i.e. would every sneeze be riddled with these germs)?  "
1610,Thumb RCL reconstruction - Abductor Pollicis Brevis vs Palmaris Longus,"Tearing the Radial Collateral Ligament in the thumb seems to be way less common than tearing the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in the thumb and so I'm having trouble finding relevant information on Google.  I found the following journals suggesting that the Abductor Pollicis Brevis Tendon can be used for RCL reconstruction:  Iba, Kousuke: Reconstruction of Chronic Thumb Metacarpophalangeal Joint Radial Collateral Ligament Injuries With a Half-Slip of the Abductor Pollicis Brevis Tendon; Journal of Hand Surgery  Horche: Radial collateral ligament repair of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint using the abductor pollicis brevis tendon. Plastic Reconstruction Surgery.  Another options seems to be using the Palmaris Longus for the reconstruction. I haven't been able to find any literature on how this compares to using the APB in terms of success rate, expected recovery time etc. I found a procedure called Camitz Transfer but I gather this is for carpal tunnel rather than ligament injuries of the thumb.  Are both procedures established reconstructions of the RCL? Which is preferable in what cases? "
1611,Why are certain drugs prescribed more often to either males or females?,"I have some original data on prescription frequencies of certain common drugs and I have calculated the gender ratio of patients for each. The list below contains Top 15 of the most commonly prescribed drugs in a major Western country.    I am more of a data analyst than a medic, so the reasons for this are not obvious to me. I have used Google/Wikipedia to find the main reason for the prescription of each drug, but my list is by no means exhaustive and I understand it some cases it can be quite nuanced. Could someone with a medical background shed some more light?  My broad generalisations are that men appear to be more often prescribed blood pressure and cholesterol lowering drugs (with a couple of exceptions).  An asthma treatment and an antidepressant are more often prescribed to women. And obviously a thyroid hormone supplement, which is used during pregnancy, is also prescribed much more to women.  Of the two commonest over-the-counter drugs, why is aspirin is prescribed more often to men and paracetamol to women? "
1612,Vitamin supplements with a balanced diet,"It is always said that with a balanced diet, all important vitamins and trace elements are supplied. It is also said that the body only uses the vitamins inside the fruit when its needed. But what would happen if vitamin supplements were added to a fully balanced diet where all vitamins and trace elements are already fully supplied?   Would the body only use the vitamins from the supplements? Would the body use both and overdose? Would the timing of the supplement intake play a role? (On an empty stomach in the morning or in the evening after dinner)  "
1613,Intermittent Fasting: Why is exactly *zero* calories special?,"Is there something special about exactly 0 calories vs 1 calorie?  When researching Intermittent Fasting, the ""magic"" seems to come from the body's response to insulin dropping and its response to secrete glucagon, causing glyconeolysis, catabolism, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis - the latter three becomes dominant once the liver runs out of glycogen.  One thing that's mentioned several times by online articles and books (such as The Obesity Code) is that ""reduced calorie"" diets do not cause the same effects. However, they rarely go into what effects specifically they're talking about, or how reduced is ""reduced.""  If you are fasting at 0 calories, does the addition of one calorie somehow cause the glycogen to stop causing the lipolysis, gluconeogenesis, and catabolism? What about 100 calories? 500 calories?  What happens in the transitional region between 0 calories (""fasting"") and 1500 calories (""reduced calories"")? If you're fasting for 16 hours, eat 100 calories, then fast 16 more, how significantly different is that from fasting 32 hours? "
1614,Snomed codes vs ICD Codes,"I know ICD 10 codes are used to describe Granular Level diagnosis on a patient.  Do SNOMED codes do the same?  If Yes, why two set of terminologies to describe diagnosis?   Is it because SNOMed Codes are more Provider Friendly while ICD 10 codes are more billing friendly? "
1615,Is benzoyl peroxide as body wash less effective than creams?,"For severe acne, wouldn't it be most effective to contact and subject the affected areas to Benzoyl Peroxide (BPO) for as long as possible? If yes, then ought it not be applied as a cream?  As a body wash, it'd be washed off the skin after 2 minutes. How can 2 minutes suffice for definitively killing bacteria?  "
1616,Should we always eat something before taking pain killers?,"When buying pain killers in the pharmacy (no doctor prescription), sometimes I'm told to take the pain killers only after eating something, sometimes they say it doesn't matter, and most of the times they say nothing at all.   Is there a global recommendation about this? Should we eat before taking pain killers, or not? And more importantly, why should we consume painkillers on an empty stomach or vice versa? Many times when in pain, there's also no appetite so it's not trivial task to eat before taking them. "
1617,How much body fluid required to actually transmit a sexually transmitted disease (STD)?,"While reading about sexually transmitted disease, I always wonder how much body fluid is actually required to transmit some diseases, specially in the case of other kinds of sex (masturbation, hand job, fingering and genital contact).  For example, this website list chances of getting STDs: Know your chances - Smart Sex Resource. Specially the table about other kinds of sex mentions that you can get gonorrhea and chlamydia from genital to genital contact, with sharing of body fluids. But exactly how much? Is there any literature on that?  I'm thinking in a scenario like: person A is fingering person B. Person B is infected with chlamydia/gonorrhea (easy to transmit). Person A has person's B fluid on his fingers/hands. Person A uses a towel to dry their hands a bit before engaging in ""self"" masturbation. What's the risk of person A getting infected?  I'm asking because anal/vaginal/oral sex without condom poses a clear risk, but sex isn't mechanical. People will kiss, finger and masturbate each other during sex and a tiny bit of fluid may be swapped. "
1618,Is it advisable to wear UV protected swimsuit that covers arms and legs for skin protection to an outdoor swimming pool?,"Is it advisable to wear UV protected swimsuit that covers arms and legs for skin protection to ward off skin cancer or is it too paranoid, given that most men and women wear swimming trunks / bikinis / swimsuits? The sun provides benefits such as vitamin D. Is swimming in trunks alone actually healthier for the men's body? "
1619,What is the current status of cancer-related research?,"Cancer might be the most studied medical condition of all (I don't know if it's actually true, but it sure sounds like it), as it is such a complex and diverse disease. Scientists all over the world are studying different aspects of cancer for years and years, papers are published daily, and new treatments for all types of cancers are constantly being developed.  Considering all this, how close are we to actually be able to control and treat cancer (in general) in such a way that it would be considered a treatable disease (like bacterial infections for example)?  I guess we can measure our progress in fighting cancer by how well do we understand its mechanisms and how efficient are our drugs and treatments. Is there any official and general statement about these things? "

1621,General Population Low Vitamin D Levels,"In the answer to Is it advisable to wear UV protected swimsuit that covers arms and legs for skin protection to an outdoor swimming pool? by @Anko, it was stated that you can get enough vitamin D from a few minutes sunlight and this is supported by Cancer Research UK (2010)  Yet in a British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition Bulletin (Spiro &amp; Buttriss, 2014), it is pointed out that there are reports of inadequate vitamin D status in Europe and this may be a problem elsewhere because:     In the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than around 40Â°N (north of Madrid, see Tableâ1), sunlight is not strong enough to trigger synthesis of vitamin D in the skin from October to March.   You could say that this can be reflected in the southern hemisphere at latitudes South of 40Â°S in possibly the April to September months, due to the seasonal differences North and South of the equator.  The thing with that is that in the Southern hemisphere, it wouldn't affect a great deal of people in  comparison, as 40Â°S is between the islands of New Zealand and cuts off a small tip of South America.  What I am wondering is, that if Cancer Research UK has adequately proved that you can get enough vitamin D from a few minutes sunlight, has there been definitive evidence to suggest why there is an inadequate vitamin D status in Europe?

1622,Does calculus also prevent caries?,"Calculus is a mix of minerals (calcium and phosphate) and organic material. This organic material consists of bacteria which cause caries, due to their acid waste products.  Is it possible that in calculus these bacteria can be fossilated by adoption/exchange of minerals?  If that is the case could this calculus form a layer around the teeth so that it prevents the bacteria in the dental plaque from causing caries? "
1623,How to reduce the side effects of wearing contact lens?,"This explains a lot of side effect of wearing contact lens. The type of contact lens Iam talking about is silicon hydrogel lenses.  Questions:  1) Till how many hours can lens be worn continuously?  2) How many minutes of break should be given to the eyes?  3) Will washing the eyes with water or inducing crying will help to reduce corneal scarring, etc as it helps in lubrication.  4) Can looking at the computer while wearing the lens have any potential side effects? "
1624,Why do I feel more tired when I sleep in?,"I almost always feel more tired after sleeping in.   For example, If I go to bed at 12:00am and wake up at 6:00am to an alarm, I feel somewhat tired, but after showering and eating breakfast, I usually do not feel tired at all.  If I go to bed at 12:00am and do not set an alarm, I usually wake up naturally, 8-9 hours later. I tend to feel much more tired when this happens, and for a much longer amount of time (usually until mid day/afternoon) even if I shower and eat right away like I would when waking up early.   I sometimes think that it is purely mental. Am I subconsciously forcing myself not to be tired on days that I must wake up early, but not when I am free to sleep in?  How is it possible that I consistently feel more rested after getting less sleep? "

However, I personally never feel the presence of acid reflux if I lie down after eating. What are the other negative effects? Are there any serious long-term potential side effects aside from some possible heartburn (which I personally never experience)? "
1627,How did I not get Mono?,"Two months ago I hooked up with a girl who said she had a cold (let's ignore the stupidity on my part there). The next day she said she went to the doctor and told me she had mono. Naturally, I prepared for the worst because I heard that mono has a 5-6 week incubation period. About 6 weeks later, I was still feeling fine and went to the doctor to get tested. Mono tests came back negative. How is it possible that I didn't get it?   Is mono always inevitable or is it possible to beat it with a solid immune system and not become infected even if one is directly exposed? "
1628,The sugar/glucose is one point too high,"I am 60 and I got my first blood test in a few years. The glucose is 101. the range is 65-100. My doctor wrote this:     The sugar/glucose is one point too high.   You should try to eat fewer   carbs (rice and pasta) and less sugar to help keep this down.   Can I eat potato instead?  Also, any danger associated with high glucose?  Thanks "

1633,What is the mechanism by which paracetamol improves sleep?,"45+ old male sleep maintenance issues for couple of years resolved by fixing the basics- blacked out room, avoiding alcohol and coffee having the biggest effect.  Still even if I am able to sleep 8 hours the sleep is not as restorative as I would expect.   Recently I have noted that 500mg paracetamol (tylenol, acetaminophen ) result in truly excellent restorative sleep.   My question is: what could be the mechanism involved?  What hormones are affected by paracetamol that have relevance to sleep?    I would like to modify my diet/lifestyle further to get this type of sleep without the drug.   Normal weight, fighting mild gastrointestinal and dermatological issues that indicate autoimmunity and allergies, on paleo diet since 6 years if that is in any way relevant. I have no pain the drug would help me with. "

1637,UK - Doctor's access to family info,"Situation:  My NHS doctor asks me ""Do you have any history of X in the family?""  (X can be anything you like: cancer, insanity, arthritis, sarcasm etc, doesn't matter, I'm more interested in the availability of information).  I was baffled by this question.  Surely my medical records tell him who my parents/grandparents are, and therefore what my medical history is.  Why is he asking me directly if he has the database at his fingertips?  It's not like he's just making conversation.  My parent's sure don't tell me what ails them and I'm sure their parents didn't encumber them likewise.  My own personal knowledge is certainly out-of-date, incomplete and unreliable at best!  If anyone knows the answer to his question, then it's his computer screen, right?  Is he just too damn lazy to look it up?  Or doesn't he have access to my family information?  Either way seems very worrying.  I've been attending this practice for my whole life, I've never transferred and have never requested new doctors, they have always been good, but now I'm really concerned that there is a disconnect that might leave me vulnerable to uninformed diagnosis.  Why doesn't he know my medical background? "
1638,Is there any medical value when a care provider talk to his trauma patient?,"Is there any medical value when a care provider talks to a trauma patient to keep the patient conscious?  It's well known that in cases of trauma (in physical medicine) always the paramedic or physician would try to talk to the patient in order to keep him or her conscious. It's known also from movies as the sentence ""Stay with me, man!"" etc.  Is there any medical value to do that? While it doesn't seem to matter to talk someone that lost a lot of blood, if the patient will lose consciousness, they will lose it with or without conversation. The only medical value that I can think about, is just to observe and monitor the patient but not as a tool to keep them conscious. Is that right?   I would like to see any scientific reference that supports the claim that it helps actively to keep the patient conscious, if any.  "
1639,To what extent can modern medicine heal this scarring?,"Here is some rather extensive scarring on the forearm from 15 years ago.  Can it be healed by modern medicine (even if it is expensive), and to what extent?  What methods are there to deal with it (skin grafts, etc.)?  Please note that this is not a request for personal medical advice, but on the state of modern medicine in dealing with scar removal.   "
1640,Are end-of-life wishes perceived differently by children?,I understand more care and caution are needed in fulfilling end-of-life wishes of children under palliative care.  Are there any studies on how the fulfillment of such wishes affect children differently from adults who are terminally ill? Or is there no difference? 
1641,Can herpes spread if an infected (nonactive) person takes a bite of your burger?,"A friend of mine suffers from Herpes (HSV) infection.  He only told me about the same about 2 months back when we last met. Yesterday, at a restaurant he took a bite out of my burger twice. when I realized that he has told me about his condition and I confronted him, he told me that he has been actively taking medications as prescribed by his physician for the past 1 year so far and he was not having any active mouth sore at that time and the last time he had an outbreak was about a month ago so there is no need for me to worry. But, I'm worried now that by being careless, I may have contracted oral herpes. Just wanted to know:   What are the chances of my contracting herpes from the above encounter? Are there any tests available using which there is a way to make sure?  How long does it take from an infection to show actual symptoms and should I go for lab tests upfront or wait for symptoms?  "
1642,Long term effects of an allergy pill? Loratadine,Are there any studies/effects of long term use of an allergy pill? I use Loratadine to help control my environmental allergies but I'm concerned about it being an every-day thing. Am I facing any risks by taking an allergy pill every day?  
1643,Aspirin for prevention of heart attacks?,Aspirin is commonly given to patients with heart disease (angina or heart attack). It has been mentioned that it may also prevent heart attacks. Should normal healthy middle aged or older people also take aspirin to prevent heart attacks? Does it prolong life? Thanks for your insight. 
1644,In what order should ointment and lotion be applied?,"I apply both moisturizing cream and a medicinal ointment/lotion on some recovering injuries. The skin is unbroken, and the medicinal lotion is primarily for the entry point of a titanium rod in my previously broken leg.   Since I want the ointment to penetrate more deeply, which do I apply first?  Logical answer 1: Ointment first, as the lotion will displace it from the uppermost layers, ""pushing"" it deeper down.   Logical answer 2: Lotion first, since it will occupy the space in the upper layers, allowing the ointment to more easily bypass them.  What does the medical science say? "
1645,Does being optimistic help me to age more slowly?,I read an article that says that the superyoung (people who look at least 10 years younger than they are) are really optimistic and happy people. Is this true? Is there any cause and effect relationship between mental health and biological age?  
1646,Laptops in the dark and miscalculating bats: how dangerous is that for rabies?,"A few nights ago, I was using my laptop outside in the dark. Some moths and other insects were flying around in the light it was emitting, but unfortunately I didn't think anything about this from a bat's perspective.   Suddenly (and incredibly silently) something flew into my face, completely blocking my vision momentarily. I thought at first that it was a giant moth, but it was too fast for a moth, and besides, it flew away immediately. But it took a few moments to realize that it was the wing of a flying bat that had basically hit me in the face. I had no scratches, no blood, didn't feel any fluid when it hit me, and I washed myself well.  About 15 years ago, I was exposed to the saliva of a known rabid animal and had completed a post-exposure prophylaxis series of 5 vaccines as well as getting a rabies immune globulin shot, so I wasn't overly concerned.  I know that any significant first exposure to a potentially rabid animal, or a possible rabies-vector (bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, etc.) merits a visit to an emergency room and immunization. But what about this situation? Are there clear guidelines about post-exposure prevention in people who have been previously immunized? "
1647,Can a giant gummy bear (approx. 5 x 2 in.) give me diabetes?,"I was given a giant gummy bear for my birthday. I ate it in one sitting, just a few days ago. And then, I searched Google about diabetes.  Now, there are three things troubling me.  Soon after I ate the giant gummy bear, I felt very tired - a symptom of diabetes.  From the day after I ate the gummy bear, I noticed my breath was slightly sweet. It usually smells really bad before I brush teeth in the morning. It stayed like that, which got me worried.  Today, my cough worsened. I had a drink. After brushing teeth, I coughed in the sink, which caused the drink to go up my nose and mouth - basically, I threw up. It could a symptom of diabetes, or just an effect of coughing with my head down like that.  Now, those three are symptoms of diabetes and I'm getting seriously worried. Should I tell my parents or my doctor? If so, how would I explain it to them?  "

1650,How do you monitor possible Lyme disease after a treated infection?,"A patient was diagnosed (through blood tests) with Lyme Disease after a tick bite and treated with first oral and then intravenous antibiotics, apparently successfully.  The patient saw the physician the day after the rash appeared; diagnosis took about a week.  The date of the bite was not known; the patient never saw the tick.  Treatment started with oral antibiotics but symptoms (joint pain, primarily) remained and the physician followed with a month-long course of IV antibiotics.  I do not know which specific drugs were used.  Total time from first visit to the end of the IV treatment was about five months.  At the time the patient was told by the physician that the blood test for Lyme looks for antibodies, which would ""always be there now"", which is why it was not possible to say with certainty that the disease had been treated.  The patient was also told that the characteristic bull's-eye rash only appears in about 25% of cases.  Years have passed since this happened.  If this patient were to be bitten by another tick in the future, would it be possible to make a determination of Lyme Disease?  If so, how?  (The patient takes appropriate precautions but knows that nothing is ever 100% effective.) "

What could be an alternative meaning for the abbreviation sib here?   "
1654,Are blood pressure numbers recorded during an office visit really meaningful?,"On a recent visit to my primary care doctor the staff did the perfunctory BP reading. I had just sat down a few seconds prior. The reading was done only once.  Is such a reading at all meaningful?  I found this article which seems to suggest that the common practice of measuring too quickly skews the numbers:     âCurrently, most patients get called back for their appointment, sit on the table, and immediately get their blood pressure measured,â Turner said. âOur study reaffirmed the American Heart Associationâs technique that patients should sit in a calm environment with feet flat on the floor, resting their back against the chair for at least five minutes before taking a blood pressure measurement on a bare arm at heart level. All too often, this doesnât happen. â   Isn't this a form of malpractice? "
1655,What is the likelihood of effective repair of septal perforations greater than 2 cm?,"With septal perforations >2 cm that have clear borders what is the likelihood of establishing blood supply over the inserted cartilage after septal repair?   How much of the existing mucosa can be grafted and are there alternative sources if nasal (likely turbinate) mucosa is insufficient to cover the repaired perforation?  There are several studies outlining patient outcomes with a success rate of 90-97% but procedures and complications are not provided in detail. Tissue is harvested from the hairline and ear but this does not serve the same function as nasal mucosa. These studies appear to be inconsistent with surgical statistics and hospital records.  The alternative methods (provided by the Mayo Clinic) of replacing tissue by growing it from patient stem cells is costly, impractical, and not a commonly recognized approach. "
1656,Is cannabidiol safe to treat depression of a patient with a schizoaffective disorder?,"According to wikipedia CBD might be useful as an antidepresant:     ""CBD has been shown to act as a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial   agonist,[33] and this action may be involved in its   antidepressant,[34][35] anxiolytic,[35][36] and neuroprotective   effects.""      Cannabidiol, Wikipedia   Could it be harmful for a schizoaffective or a schizophrenic?  Does it interact negatively at dopamine or other routes that can worsen such a condition?   "
1657,Does diffusion MRI (DWI & DTI) measure diffusion or osmosis?,"I am trying to understand the physical property which is measured in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). I read that these methods estimate the apparent diffusion coefficient (in DWI) or the diffusion tensor (in DTI).   My understanding is that diffusion usually refers to the net movement of a solute (e.g. salt) dissolved in a solvent (e.g. water) from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration.   My understanding is that osmosis usually refers to the net movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane from a region of low solute concentration to region of higher solute concentration.   I read that DWI and DTI measure the ""diffusion of water"". For example, in the white matter tracts of the brain, ""water diffuses at a higher rate along the tract direction than perpendicular to the tract direction"". What physical process is this referring to? Is this referring to a net flow of water along the white matter tracts (osmosis?), or the rate at which some solute dissolved in this water could diffuse?  I am struggling to phrase this question clearly, but the main thing I am trying to understand is the physical significance of the quantities measured by DWI and DTI -- the phrase ""diffusion of water"" does not mean much to me. "
1658,Does the morphology of the insertion of the gluteus minimus to the greater trochanter impact the likelihood of being affected by a tendinopathy?,"{1} noted two different  morphologies for the  insertion of the gluteus minimus to the greater trochanter:     Two morphologies noted: The majority (11/14) were long, thin, and crescent shaped and ran medial to lateral and concave facing inferiorly, while a few (3/14) were bowtie in shape.

1659,How does one determine which textbook to start with when wanting to build knowledge in medical sciences?,"The medical field is vast and there is a great deal of literature, including textbooks.

For example, in the topics of physiology and biochemistry, how does one determine where to start? "
1660,How does someone get an STI if it has to be transmitted in the first place?,"As far as I've heard, you can only get an STI if it is transmitted to you by someone who is infected with one.   Then the following questions arise:   How can anyone ever get an STI if it has to be transmitted in the first place?  How does the originator of the STI become infected? It would have to be transmitted by someone with an STI.    I don't understand how you can become infected if that requires you to have sexual relations with someone who's already infected.  I'm stuck in a vicious loop on this one.  "
1661,Is PCV13 effective if the suspension is not shaken prior to administration?,"PCV13, like other vaccines which are suspensions, should be shaken vigorously to obtain a homogenous, white suspension in the vaccine container immediately prior to use.   If this is not done and the vaccine is administered as a clear liquid, will it still evoke an adequate immune response in the patient?      Edit: I am not questioning the necessity of 'shaking well before use' if it is explicitly mentioned on the label. What I want to know is whether the vaccine is rendered ineffective if this instruction is neglected. Would it necessitate re-immunization?  I ask this because I recently witnessed a health professional fail to shake the PCV13 prefilled syringe before use. When I brought this to her attention, she said that she was not aware of this and hadn't been doing it for any of the suspension/adjuvant vaccines. I wonder if there might be other health professionals who are unaware of this requirement. If so, how protected are the recipients of this important vaccine? Should they be re-immunized?         "
1662,Why do gene therapies so often target rare disease?,"I read on {1}:     At the time of writing, clinicaltrials.gov has well over 100 open gene therapy clinical trials and many of these are for rare diseases.   Why do gene therapies so often target rare disease? Economically it would seems to make more sense to first address common diseases. Do rare diseases tend to have some properties that make them more inclined to be treated via gene therapy?    References:   {1} Ekins, Sean.

1663,Does longer oil pulling than recommended 20 minutes bring any benefits?,"EDIT.  I am looking for references to serious research articles on the subject, whether confirming or refuting. (Or articles referring to such, but not articles without peer refereed references.)  To avoid any confusion, by ""serious"" I only mean reputable peer refereed journals.  Here are some examples of such articles, taken from [website][website][website][website][website][website][website][website]Many sources recommend to spend 15-20 minutes for oil pulling, however those numbers look randomly chosen with no justification provided. It is conceivable that 15-20 minutes have been chosen by popular practitioners for reasons of their personal comfort, while other sources have simply repeated the figure. It is also conceivable that longer pulling may increase the benefits, even if it feels less comfortable to some practitioners. Or, conversely, are there side effects of any prolonged oil pulling?  My question is, where is the science and where are people's personal convenience choices? Has any research been conducted to study effects of the oil pulling over different periods? "
1664,Any randomized prospective trials to determine the efficacy of brushing (vs not) to prevent conditions such as dental caries?,"Brushing teeth appears to be commonly recommended, but the evidence appears to be anecdotal.  Have any randomized prospective trials been done to determine the efficacy of brushing to prevent conditions such as dental caries?  I am interested in research that measures dental disease, not merely plaque removal.     A Google Scholar search for ""brush teeth"" returns articles that:   Compare toothbrushes (eg, traditional vs electronic) Compare toothpastes Test pre-brush mouth washes Editorials/Opinions about brushing Survey attitudes toward brushing Test new vs old toothbrushes Test brush strokes against each other Test different electric toothbrush heads Etc.   Within the first 20 pages, no articles test the efficacy of brushing.âAround page 16, results became less relevant to brushing.    I have looked through the list of ADA references that JonMark Perry refers to.âThey don't address brushing vs not or the prevention of dental conditions, such as caries.âFor instance:   The first article, and a few others, are about plaque or biofilm removal, which may or may not be related to dental caries.âSince approximately 100% of the population has dental plaque, it's not a useful predictor of dental disease. Second article is about fluoride levels, not dental caries, or other dental conditions.âIt also tests brushing duration, rather than brushing vs not brushing. Several about brush design. Some about brush contamination and sanitation. Some about gingival abrasion and recession.  "
1665,"Is being ""healthy"" an actual, overall provable term? Or is ""healthy"" just a loose assumption?","Say you go to a doctor and they say -- more or less -- that you are ""healthy.""  What does this mean? Under what circumstances does one fall within these supposed confines?  And what would falling under these confines mean in a more deeper outlook? Like if I am ""healthy,"" does that mean I can't be healthier? If I am not healthy enough, could I get healthier then?  Many people vaguely use the term healthiness to define a set of rules that must apply to someone, like if someone is disease free or not overweight or etc. But is this just vague?  A doctor saying you are healthy doesn't mean you are of utmost health, because how would you know each individual's maximum healthiness potential, if it even exists?  I always strive to be as healthy as possible with being on the lookout for new supplements and solutions to any health signs of stresses and such. But what really makes me ponder is how we can confidently dish the term healthy around in an overall manner that isn't particularly individualized.  No two different people are necessarily as equally healthy as one another in all possible respects if they're both meeting a particular set of observable standards or tests/procedures/etc.  So it makes me think that one can envision health as a perpetually tested standard one must always be working to achieve or progress towards. I don't think anyone can be perfectly healthy or the inverse, but how healthy one can become is the big question. Many people have demonstrated massive differences in their feelings/well being from supplementation, homeopathy, herbs, antioxidants and many other potential undertakings not necessarily relating to consumption. I realize you can feel healthy and not be sometimes, but usually feeling really good and strong is a symbol of good health more often than not.  In a sense, does the term ""healthy"" mean that much? Is there always theoretical improvement of our health regardless, because there is no one size fits all or perfect health analysis? "
1666,Where can I find information about the 16:8 diet?,"It was recommended by my doctor that I lose weight, and he suggested I research the 16:8 diet, which is a fasting diet.  I have found a ton of web sites on the internets, but most of them feel wonky or they only talk about the time.  What I'm trying to figure out is the calorie intake for the 8 hour period?  Is it your standard 2000? 1200?  2000 seems like a lot of calories, a 1200 (600 per meal) seems acceptable but I don't want to starve myself.    I am doing this for weight loss. "
1667,How to publish a new orthodontic technique/device?,"I am not an orthodontist but a physicist. But while discussing a certain orthodontic technique with an experienced board-certified orthodontist (who graduated and practice in the US), it became apparent to me that the technique he was taught (and uses) is quite over-optimistic in its ignorance of the effects of elementary physical principles, which is why it almost always results in a much-less-than-ideal outcome, and it also greatly disturbs and compromises the other satisfactory elements of the bite.  After thinking about the situation, I came up with a quite simple alternative technique to fully control the desired movement, without disturbing the satisfactory areas of the bite.  It might be implemented with existing orthodontic devices which I am familiar with; however it may be enhanced and slightly simplified with a new auxiliary device that I have (conceptually) invented.  Not being a physician, how do I publish this technique under my name? How can I patent this auxiliary device, when I did not actually built it, but only drew a sketch? Not that I try to become a millionaire, I just want to prevent others from taking over this idea and charging orthodontists/patients for using it. "
1668,Can you cure an allergy by repeatedly consuming the allergen?,"I've been reading about immunotherapy, and in particular, allergy drops.  My understanding is that by taking small amounts of an allergen by any route of administration, you restore tolerance to that allergen, and eventually cease to have an allergic reaction.  Is that true?  If so, why is something similar to allergy drops not used in the home?  E.g. If you have a mild nut allergy, why not eat small, gradually increasing amounts of nuts every day until the nut allergy ceases? "
1669,Where I can find infomation about ALL diseases of human beings?,"Is there any book or website about ALL diseases were officially registered ever?  I doubt that there is some book that has information about all diseases. I think that one book can hold only some diseases for instance A, B, C, D and another one C, D, E, F and it can always miss some of diseases.   In order not to read all books I just want to know is there any main source in internet which most doctors use?  I need this for filtering and finding disease according its symptoms.  P.S. I have not medical education, I am just curious about it, and I want always be sure that doctors not making mistake when diagnosing. "

1677,"Why do some people get purple stains on teeth from red wine, and some donât?","Drinking red wine, some peopleâs teeth, gums or lips will get a very distinct purple stain, while this does not happen at all for other people.  I have a few guesses as to why:   The smoothness of the outer layer of the teeth varies from person to person, and that leads to more âshadowâ or surface for purple color. It happens to everybody, but some skin tones provide a sharper contrast to the color. It depends on how long the wine touches the lips and teeth: it would happen to everybody if the same amount of wine stayed in the mouth the same amount of time. It actually happens to everybody, but it becomes more visible as some people open their mouths wider when speaking.   The questions are: Why and on which part of the mouth (lips, gums, teeth) do the stains appear? Why does it happen more for some than for others?  This question has been asked elsewhere (e. g. on Yahoo Answers) without satisfying answers. "
1678,Pregnancy and flying,I've heard that flying can harm a developing baby when the mother is pregnant.  What happened to my partner is that she missed her period and took a flight after being one and a half months pregnant. Only after the flight did we meet and take a pregnancy test which resulted positive.   My partner did not know flying could harm the baby. What is the truth about possible impacts that flying can have on your baby and what kind of damage can result? Am I getting too worried or do I have reasons to be worried? 
1679,Why should I avoid milk when on antibiotics?,"I'm taking antibiotics (specifically, amoxicillin clavulanate) to fight off an ear infection. As she prescribed my antibiotics, my doctor told me not to eat milk products for a few days, then only eat yogurt until I was off the antibiotics altogether.  To be honest, I'm thinking about ignoring this advice and just reducing the milk products I eat. On a typical day, I drink multiple glasses of milk, eat of bowl of oatmeal with milk, eat meals with lots of cheese, and eat ice cream at night. Cutting all of this out for a few days leaves me without much to eat!  What are the downsides to eating milk products while on antibiotics? Is it just that, since my gut bacteria will be weakened, I risk digestional problems? Or can the consequences be more severe? "

Can I somehow contribute (assist) to the skin and constitution (after stitches removal) to prevent excessive formation of scar tissue and the appearance of a scar?    What are recommendations for correct healing of the wound of the skin after removing the stitches and preventing excessive formation of scar (healing) tissue and scars? "
1681,Are minerals in salts (e.g. Himalayan) overrated?,"I have heard that health experts recommend Himalayan or Celtic or generally salts that contain more minerals than the usual table salt.     However... keep in mind that these really are tiny amounts. For example, the 0.3% content of Magnesium for celtic salt implies that you would need to eat 100 grams of salt to reach the recommended daily amount.   Source  Although it is true that these salts contain other important minerals, how could they make any significant difference, even in the long term?  The only reason I see for taking these more complete salts would be the lack of processing or because of sea pollution. So, are the more complete salts any more worth it than normal table salt, why? "
1682,The difference between ticks & fleas?,"My mother went to a campsite near a lake and came back with reddish-brown dots all over her pant legs.   She's not sure whether they are ticks or fleas.  Her pants sat in her room for two days before she realized.   I browsed the internet, saw several people said fleas are reddish-brown so thought that was it, but then found a few posts where people said ticks are also reddish-brown.  So now we're right where we started - nowhere.  I told her to see a small-animal veterinarian because they would likely be knowledgeable about ticks &amp; fleas.  In the meantime (they're closed today):   Q: Are they ticks or fleas? Q: Do both the vehicle and house need to be treated?  If so, what product is recommended?     Since she has been bitten:   Q: Does she need to be treated with anything?  "

1684,Complications and risks for combining multiple procedures,"How do the risks and potential complications change when multiple procedures are performed at the same time? For example both wisdom tooth extraction and LASIK eye surgery have relatively minor risks associated with them. There are some factors that increase the risks associated with LASIK surgery, but nothing that seems directly related to wisdom tooth extraction.   There are clinics that do both procedures (different surgeons). Is there a reason to advise a patient against having both procedures done on the same day? Are there benefits of having both procedures done on the same visit? "
1685,Could rectal prolapse and bloody masturbation in 4 year-old happen absent abuse?,"Disclaimer: I'm trying to find out more about some symptoms that could be signs of child sexual abuse - or could be naturally occuring. The case that brings the questions up has been reported to all proper authorities (including the police and the states child protective service). I'm not asking what to do in a case of child abuse. I just want more information on the symptoms.  The question is what are the naturally occurring prevalence rates of these symptoms?  The physical symptoms are:   Frequent masturbation (with full erection) Masturbation to the point of pain Bloody penis (foreskin prematurely pulled back) Rectal prolapse     Why I'm asking the question:  All authorities involved (police, child protective services, court appointed child attorney - aka guardian ad litem, and a judge) have determined that the symptoms are not indicative of abuse. This seems crazy to me - but I realize these symptoms (eg. a 4 year old masturbating) may not be as rare as I thought, so I'd like to understand for myself where they're coming from.    Here's what little I've found and estimated:   Frequent masturbation in 4 years old seems to occur less than 5% of male population. See here and here (or full-text). I have no idea how many of that 5% are also related to abuse vs. naturally occurring. Excessive/Painful masturbation: Less than 1%. Prematurely forcing back foreskin: no idea. Rectal prolapse: Not sure at his age, but this is supposedly most common in 0-2 years or 65+. Otherwise it appears to be about 2.5/100,000 based on this study.    Joint probability Experiencing symptoms (1) and (3) at some point would be 5/100 * 2.5/100,000 = 12.5/10,000,000 - it is likely that fewer than 1 in 1 million children would experience both of these symptoms at some point. Factor in the probability of them happening simultaneously and the odds sky rocket from there. Am I missing something here?  I'd particularly like links to reference-able studies if available. I've had trouble finding reliable sources myself, so the above estimates are based off some surveys and online information I could find.  EDIT: I've completely reformatted the question to try and keep discussion on topic.  EDIT 2: Added some sources.  "
1686,Could a nerve agent be used recreationally?,Many drugs that will kill you in high quantities are used recreationally in low doses. (e.g. alcohol or heroine).  I wonder if you diluted a military grade nerve agent in a lot of water. Would the resultant drink be pleasant? Sort of like alcohol?  Obviously this is a hypothetical question. But hypothetically could you create a drink with a tiny amount of nerve agent in it and say a mixer to make a pleasant after dinner drink? What would be the effects do you imagine? 
1687,"Can ""face pulling"" or ""bone pulling"" really move/remodel bones in adults?","Face pulling is a technique some people use to try and move their maxillas/cheekbones/etc. more forward. It's basically biting on some object and slowly and steadily pulling with tension forward and upwards for long periods of time. Basically the teeth are like an anchor and are obviously part of the maxilla bone, which is connected to zygoma/etc.  So basically, is there any reason to believe this can work (non-surgically)? That the bones will remodel or something and will actually give the desired results these people seek? I mean they have these reverse pull headgear devices and other stuff for children (dentistry, orthodontics, etc.). Is it theoretically possible this can work in adults too?  Or in other words, can constant, steady, mechanical tension/force make bones adapt/remodel to pressure and give desired results (i.e., more tautness in face/bone projection in, say, people with bone recession or not so ideal bone structure in their faces for various other reasons)? This is related to bone biology. It would be amazing if this could be elaborated on.  Many people suffer from recession/bad facial bone structure and orthodontics are out of a handful of people's budgets. These techniques -- if proven useful -- can dramatically change a person's appearance and confidence + life quality.. "
1688,How can a significant increase in survival not be interpreted as a significant decrease in mortality?,"Link to paper  In this paper they explain in their results that they were unable to show a significant link between terlipressin and mortality, however, they were able to show a significant link between terlipressin and HRS reversal...But they also showed a significant link between HRS reversal and 180 day survival? How can increased 180 day survival not mean less mortality? "
1689,Need advice in whether to get a crown on my tooth...?,"Well, two weeks ago my upper front tooth came completely out when I slipped. I went to a dentist who put the tooth back in place and told me to wait two weeks to see if my body rejects it or not. I went in today and he told me my body accepted the tooth and that he would do a root canal and put a crown on. My question is, since my tooth is getting stronger and healing on its own, do I need a crown? I really don't want my tooth ground down and put in something that might fall off in a couple of years. What do ya'll think?? "
1690,Why are inflammatory arthritides worse at night and in the morning?,"In general, inflammatory arthritides tend to be worse at night and in the morning. For example, the morning stiffness associated with rheumatoid arthritis is classically worse in the morning. This is also true of many other inflammatory conditions that cause arthritis (e.g. psoriatic arthritis, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis, etc.)  What makes the joint symptoms worse at night and in the morning? Is this related to mechanical factors (i.e. inactivity of the involved joints at night) - and if so why would that lead to worsening of symptoms? Or is it due to a circadian rhythm in systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines, cortisol, other hormones)? Or some other factors?  I could not find much to address this question. Further references are also appreciated. "
1691,Can a mosquito bite transmit STD's?,"STDs include just about every kind of infection. Bacterial STDs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Viral STDs include HIV, genital herpes, genital warts (HPV), and hepatitis B. Trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite. The germs that cause STDs hide in semen, blood, vaginal secretions, and sometimes saliva. source  Mosquitoes can of course transmit malaria, yellow fever and several other serious diseases.  According to this source (from 2008) there's no scientific evidence to support the claim that a mosquitoes bite can transmit the HIV/AIDS virus.  There is some limited theoretical evidence which suggests it might be possible for mosquitoes to transmit hepatitis B or C, although there have been no known cases ever, worldwide. source  I've also came across an article titled, ""Guy Gets First Ever Mosquito-Borne STD (Zika), Gives it to Wife"" source  Diseases spread by mosquitoes only if they can replicate within the mosquito. The amount of disease agent that a mosquito takes in from infected blood is very tiny, and only a tiny fragment of that will be transferred to the next victim. source    Aside from all these sources I would like to get a little more insight on this topic. Can a mosquito bite transmit STD's?  If so  ""what std and how""? If not ""why?""?  Also.. What STD's are possible for a mosquito to transmit?... If so ""what and how""? "
1692,Is Wi-Fi harmful to one's health?,"Is Wi-Fi harmful to one's health, so much so that we should live without it? There are different sides to this debate - why should I believe one side more than the other? Indeed, we live with Wi-Fi every day and this is acceptable according to regulations, so it must be fine for our health to be exposed to it. But I know somebody who lives without Wi-Fi because she thinks that it serves as a potential threat to her health, and she claims that she is more sensitive to it than other people. Is this possible?

1695,"Can Manual External Defibrillators ""restart"" a heart?","On TV it appears that every time a heartbeat monitor flat-lines they pull out the paddles of a manual external defibrillator (MED) and give a few shocks, often explicitly cranking up the output when an initial charge doesn't restore a heartbeat.  My technical understanding of this is that a MED is only indicated when the cause of the heart ""stopping"" is some form of fibrillation or arrhythmia.  Granted, maybe ""off-screen"" is an electrocardiograph the EMT is referencing.  But if not, would an EMT ever use a MED if the only thing he knew was that a person had no pulse?  Or, is it the case that a heart will only stop due to either fibrillation or arrhythmias that a MED can reverse?  What if a subject does have a steady heartbeat: Can a MED stop a beating heart?  I suppose that if a subject has no pulse one might argue that the MED can't hurt.  But is a MED a substitute for CPR?  E.g., if you had a MED and no better information on the patient would you apply both MED shocks and CPR, or what is the current best practice?  Back to TV depictions: They almost always show the subject of MED arching his back for roughly a full second when the charge is applied.  I've never seen a real MED application, but my understanding is the pulse is only supposed to last 12ms.  Also, since it is applied across the chest, the skeletal muscles most prone to contract would presumably be the chest and upper abdominals, which would (if anything) cause the exact opposite contraction, and only for an instant. "
1696,Can a person die of hunger while still being severely obese?,"A severely overweight American is imprisoned in some country XYZ after accusations of spying. Whilst in prison the XYZ people put him on a diet of just plain water. He is not placed on any kind of hard labor however, and the location where he is imprisoned is clean so there is no risk of illnesses from pests or other prisoners.  So in this scenario, the only things he would directly suffer from are lack of freedom and possibly boredom. As could be expected, he would eventually start loosing weight due to his body using the fat reserves.  The questions I wanted to ask are what would happen if this scenario continued for some extended time.   Would it be possible for the prisoner to die of hunger while still being overweight? Or would the body first use up most of the fat reserves before the person dies of hunger?  "
1697,Does protein lower the glycemic load? Please explain,Let's say you eat 50 grams of potato chips which have a glycemic load of 12 (according to Harvard.edu) and you eat it with 1 oz. Of sunflower seeds with have a GI load of 2.5. So is the total GI load then 14.5 ?  Does the protein have any affect or lower the glycemic load?   If yes please explain. What is the calculation by which you can know how much the glycemic load is lowered? 
1698,Mechanical cardio resuscitation for asystole,"We have great machines for shocking a heart out of various malfunctions.  But my understanding is that the only ""machine"" indicated for restarting a heart that has completely stopped (i.e., ""flat-lined"") is manual compression.  I.e., even if you're a patient in a Level 1 trauma center, if you flat-line then all the machines get pushed aside and one person is going to start pushing on your chest above your heart to try to get it started.  (And you might get a does of epinephrine.  Oh, and if you're really ""lucky"" and they have your chest torn open then they'll reach in and compress the heart directly.)  Is this accurate?  If so, isn't this weird?  Pushing on the heart through the rib cage to get it to spontaneously start seems like trying to rescue someone drowning by standing on the shore and poking them with a stick.  We can electrically stimulate every muscle to contract.  I understand that a functional heartbeat requires a coordinated series of contractions.  An electrocardiogram can monitor the sequence of contractions in a functional heartbeat.  Why can't it (or something like it) pump current back through its electrodes to stimulate a perfect heartbeat?  Or, if one could place arbitrary electrodes directly on a heart, could an electronic device force it to beat &ndash; indefinitely &ndash; when it has flat-lined?  Or is there some reason that is not technically or medically feasible?  Again, it just seems weird that when the heart stops the current best practice is basically to just try ""nudging"" it to start. "
1699,What is difference between loprox and antifungal cream?,"To get loprox (cicloprox), you need a doctors prescription. It's used to cure fungal infections.   But you can buy some antifungal creams without prescriptions.  Can't you just replace one with another?  Or does loprox have some features, which are absent in other antifungal creams? "
1700,Elbow Ligament/Tendon Injury Diagnosis-Aid?,"When a patient comes into the office with what seems like an injury to the ligaments/tendons around the elbow, what are the ""exercises"" that the physician uses in order to identify or pinpoint the injured tissue structure? What are these ""exercises"" called? What are the actual individual exercises/tests that are used called? What is the method of diagnosis using this type of method called?   e.g. I go into the doctor's office with an injury to the medial collateral ligament, so the physician has me apply pressure to his arms in certain directions/angles with my arms placed in certain positions in order to see which ""exercise"" triggers pain/discomfort or reveals weaknesses. There seemed to be around ~3-5 of them.  Please help me make this question better in any way possible. "
1701,Microwaving veggies/fish and nutrients,"I usually just put a bowl of frozen veggies in the microwave for dinner, without adding any water. When it's done, there's a considerable amount water in the bowl. Some of that comes from small pieces of molten ice, sure, but some is certainly also from within the veggies. It is slightly colored (mostly green-ish). Doesn't look or taste too great. I've always just poured it in the drain, but am I missing out on nutrients here? Am I literally throwing them away? Similar thing with fish. Put it dry/frozen in the microwave, take it out in a giant puddle. Again, the liquid is colored/turbid (white-ish). Don't want to lose all those precious nutrients, but it doesn't taste that good, so how much exactly may be in there? "
1702,Can walking barefoot on cold floors cause kidney problems?,"If a toddler goes barefoot most of the day on cold floors, can that lead to a kidney infection?

Her concerned grandma always thought it was obvious that by walking on cold surfaces barefoot, chills from underfoot could enhance kidney problems? "
1703,4-Hour Body caloric intake,"I'm about to start the 4-hour body diet (slow carb diet) to lose about 14 pounds. I'm excited and curious to see how well it works. It's the first I'm trying a real diet!  Here is one thing I'm confused about in the book. Tim writes that I can eat as much as I want of the ""Allowed Foods"" but then later writes about how eating ""domino foods"" is not advisable.   My questions:   Am I really allowed to eat as much lentils (for example) as I want, or should I stick to the generally recommended 2300 kcal for my age? Tim hammers on about making sure I eat enough, eating as much as I want, etc. and it sends a confusing message. Should I be counting calories or not?  As one of the common mistake he lists people eating too much almonds, peanuts, etc. But none of these ""domino foods"" are in the list of allowed foods. So I should not be eating them anyway, no!?   Much appreciate any comments!  "
1704,Orthotic inserts + athletes foot,"With athletes foot, it's important to keep the feet dry.  However, when wearing sandals, I can't use the ""super feet"" orthotic inserts that keep my feet from developing pain issues when I walk.    I think this is a temporary need, so I would rather not buy special footwear just for this.  At work, I need to at least slip off my shoes while at my desk, but putting my shoes back on whenever I need to stand up for a meeting to to chat with a coworker seems silly.    Sandals just aren't cutting it, though.  I have nice, gel-footed sandals, but I am still getting some pain issues in my feet because I am not using the best inserts I know about.  Any suggestions?  For example, is there a way to tie my shoes that would make them super easy to slip on and yet still provide enough support?  One idea I am considering is keeping an alternate pair of shoes at my desk which are tied extremely loosely and slipping them on when I need shoes--but I still feel a bit awkward about it all.  Any other ideas or suggestions?  Tags I can't create/add: podiatry, shoes, othotics, fungal-infections, etc... "
1705,Drinking water from glass instead of plastic,"I recently learnt that it's healthier to store drinking water in glass objects instead of plastic ones.

1707,How to celebrate christmas with MS?,"One week ago, I knew I have multiple sclerosis. My right eye is affected and I can not see well. This question is about what should I eat to overcome MS.   I googled about beans and found controversy. I still don't know wither it is useful or harmful for me?  Also, Which one of these food is useful and which one is harmful? coriander - latency - Bee's honey - Tahini -  fried potatoes (fingers) -  lentils -  chickpeas -  soybean - boiled liver of chicken - fried fish - boiled chicken without skin.  Christmas is coming and my family will celebrate by serving different types of food that contains fats, butter, meat, gateau and so on.  Should I refuse to eat any of these? Or should I eat small amounts of meat and one piece of gateau? How do I know when I reach the maximum amount? "
1708,Hemeatology vs Hematology,"Is there a difference between ""Hemeatology"" and ""Hematology"" as physician medical specialties?  Or are these spelling variants, like ""Haematology"" vs ""Hematology""? "
1709,What could be the reason for difference in adverse effects profile between original and generic Clopidogrel?,"I was consulted on the following clinical case:  An elderly woman (over 65 years old) on Plavix due to 2 CVAs in the last few years. Six months ago treatment was changed to a generic Clopidogrel product, and during this period she developed diffuse hematomas. With Aspirin she also had hematomas, but not with the original Plavix. Therefore, her doctor recommended putting her back on Plavix. This, of course, seems like the right thing to do, and I'm not asking about that.  My question is: What could be the reason for developing hematomas on a generic formulation of Clopidogrel and not on the brand formulation?  A few points should be taken into consideration:   As a generic drug, the manufacturer obviously proved bioequivalence, so we won't go there. The dosage with both formulations was the same. The inactive ingredients are very similar in both formulations. I won't elaborate about them right now, unless you ask for it in the comments. I found two articles on that topic, without much help:   This article says that ""The innovator product of clopidogrel (Plavix/Iscover*) is a hydrogen sulfate salt. [...] Following the expiration of the above name-brandsâ patent, a number of generic clopidogrel salt formulations were developed and approved for the treatment of CVD patients. [...] it should be stated that even minor differences in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of various generic clopidogrel salts could have serious clinical consequences..."" The active ingredient in Plavix is formally stated as Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate, whereas the generic is stated as Clopidogrel bisulphate. After some online research I found that these are two names for the same chemical composition. It did leave me with some confusion - are these two descriptions truly identical, or do we have here two different salts? This article is a systematic review about branded against generic Clopidogrel in CVD. The conclusions section states that: ""There are a limited number of small studies comparing Plavix and generic clopidogrel in nonhealthy volunteers, reporting hard clinical end points. Taking these limitations into account, the available data did not suggest any difference in cardiovascular events, adverse events, and withdrawals among patients receiving branded and generic clopidogrel.""    Any thoughts will be much appreciated.  edit: After some further research I found two more points that should be considered:   I stated that the generic formulation of Clopidogrel I found was essentially identical to the brand name in terms of active ingredient, since Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and Clopidogrel bisulphate are two names for the same compound. However, I realized today that we have another generic formulation which contains a different salt, Clopidogrel besylate. According to the study I cited above, different salt formulations can affect the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the drug, so that's a new lead. This study attempted to compare the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and clopidogrel besylate. According to its conclusion ""no overall significant difference in the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate as compared to clopidogrel besylate [was observed]. However, it is important to note that besides high interindividual there is also high intraindividual variability between the two different clopidogrel formulas"".     Regarding the clinical case, I have yet to find out which generic formulation the patient received, but I wanted to update the question with this new information and ask if anyone witnessed this kind of clinical difference with different salts of Clopidogrel (sharing experiences with different reactions to different salts of other drugs is also welcome).

1713,What can you observe from MRI noises?,"While in an MRI you hear a lot of different noises. The pitch changes, as does the pattern and rhythm. Sometimes there's one long noise, sometimes a beep-beep-beep then a pause and the same set of beeps again, and so on. At times a pattern repeats without change for many minutes, while at other times the noises vary more frequently. CBC Spark had an item comparing it to electronic music.  What do these noises tell you? And what about the pauses between them? Is it, for example, safe to move a tiny bit if there is no noise? I sometimes find that I have tensed up and lifted a leg off the surface a tiny bit and I want to relax and put it back down. Is doing that in a silent part better than doing that during noises?  I'm just curious I suppose, but knowledge is always reassuring. Just like understanding the bell noises on an airplane, I want to understand the MRI noises. "
1714,Performing Valsalva maneuver with partly open airway?,"The Valsalva maneuver is defined as ""attempted exhalation against a closed airway"" or ""The effort to breathe out forcibly while the mouth and nose are firmly closed or the vocal cords pressed together"".   Some breathing practices involve pushing air out against resistance, such as ujjayi breath in yoga or the slow, controlled exhale recommended by some weightlifting coaches. This can be done by partly closing the glottis while exhaling, or by firmly exhaling through the mouth with lips slightly open, as if one were whistling. Unlike the definitions above, the patient does not have a fully closed airway and is still taking in oxygen. But subjectively, this kind of breathing feels like it's raising intrathoracic and eustachian pressure in the same way as Valsalva.   Does forcefully exhaling against resistance have similar physiological effects to the Valsalva maneuver? Are there differences caused by the fact that the patient is still breathing, or by the fact that this maneuver can be maintained and repeated for much longer than a ""strict"" Valsalva? "
1715,How many people have been instantly killed by smoking?,"We all know that cigarettes have killed millions of people, to the extent that just about everyone knows someone who has died from it. Smoking deaths are overwhelmingly medium to long term effects of smoke inhalation and exposure (citation?). I am looking for short term effects leading to death. So anything from extreme allergic reaction (is that even possible?) to dropping the cigarette into gasoline, you name it as long as it's fatal. There are news stories disseminating statistics on deaths caused by all sorts of animals or even types of furniture. Are there comparable statistics collected on deaths due to cigarettes?   This could also apply to tobacco in general but I am asking about cigarettes specifically. "

1717,Are fat drippings accounted for in the nutritional labels of meat?,"When I roast my chicken quarters, a ton of drippings come out.  The nutritional content is roughly 220 calories per 4 oz.  If I don't eat those drippings, does that mean that I am actually eating less than 220 calories for every 4 oz. of chicken quarters I eat?  I do eat the skin btw.  The fat portion of the drippings --as opposed to the stock portion--looks almost identical, and has the same consistency of cooking oil, and according to MyFitnessPal, has 115 calories per tablespoon.  So, if I eat 8 oz of chicken quarters, and this yields one tablespoon of chicken fat, this would be (220 kcal/4 oz * 2 - 115) 325 kcal net total? "
1718,Should we stop using aluminium foil in food preparation and storage?,"In view of the findings reported in [strong-evidence-linking-aluminium-alzheimers][2] should we stop using aluminium containers to store food and aluminium foil to wrap food? I am 85 years old, is it going to make any difference to me now?     Thanks for the comments. I though the link above would be sufficient, but the original source appears to be this one  which reports a high concentration of aluminium in the brain tissue of sufferers.   My own view is that this is not enough evidence of a causal link between the disease and the use of aluminium foil in contact with food, so I am not going to stop using it. It could be for instance that these individuals have a higher propensity to concentrate aluminium in this way, as is suggested in the end of the discussion in the second article referred to above.  "
1719,I'm OK with chilis and any kind of oil. But I can't take any chili oil. Why?,"I started eating Asian food rather frequently about 3 years ago. I like hot and spicy dishes. I have no problem eating for example a Vietnamese Pho with lots of chilis in it. Also, I love to prepare my own food (of any origin) using lots of different types of oil.  However, if I only get to eat one drop of chili oil, my body starts to take it seriously. It started when I first made chili oil myself and put a good amount of it in my meal. A few hours afterwards, my heart started beating fast and strong and that did not stop until about 60 hours later! It felt like it was pounding during an adrenalin rush, maybe not as strong but without end. I could hardly sleep. No relaxation technique helped. Also, my stomach didn't do too good, but it was not bad. The problem was my heart and the unrest it caused me.  This was as bad as it ever got. Since then I got the occasional unintentional load of chili oil in restaurants. The symptoms are the same, but weaker and shorter (12-20 hours maybe). I assume in those cases it is just not as much chili oil as it was at the first time.  Maybe a quick explanation of how chili oil is made. It is really simple. You put several sliced red chilis (with seeds) into olive oil and let it steep for a few weeks. That's all. Afterwards you use the oil directly from the container it was made in.  What can cause this? What is different with the oil compared to the single ingredients? "

1721,Permanent saline-injection breast augmentation?,"One of my close friends recently underwent minor breast augmentation (up like a half size). She was telling me about the procedure and explained that that the doctor gave her an injection of something into both breasts which somehow stimulates growth of natural breast tissue? I don't know much about physiology or biology, and I couldn't find anything about it online. She insisted that it's not any kind of implant, but rather it's basically just saline. However the information I've found online about saline injections is that they only provide enlargement for a day or two. Her results are permanent (well long term at least...she says that after child birth they may return to a sort of ""normal"").  What exactly is this method? It's not saline or silicon implants, nor is it fat injection--that much is clear. It also wasn't some sort of low-key cheap or experimental surgery. It was done by a respected plastic surgeon in a major US city. Has anyone heard of this type of work before and can explain it? "
1722,Mosquito repellent using vaporized camphor - Health Issues,"I live in a tropical region and have mosquito problems in the evening. We normally use the commercial mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers. But these are said to be toxic in long term usage. So I was searching for alternatives and found these two videos:  [website][website]I'm wondering if this has any serious side affects like the commercial mosquito repellents. Or is this also another untested home remedy tip? Sorry if this question is trivial.  I was confused whether to post this in Life Hacks or here, but decided to do it here since the question is more related to health. "
1723,Are systemwide treatment statistics collected in any countries?,"It would seem that constant universal aggregation of treatment data, including all diagnoses made (and how they were made) and all treatments used (drugs, amounts, therapies, even diet) would offer continual validation of treatments, highlight developing problems quickly, and help us spot any unnoticed useful treatment vectors.  Immediately privacy leaps to mind as the concern.  But couldn't such a system be setup to automatically aggregate this data while maintaining privacy?  Or allow waivers?  All I know is that here in America, we're obviously far from such a system.  In recent visits, it does seem many large health networks are now moving towards electronic information keeping, but the systems don't sound like they are completely built out, such that practitioners could quickly pull up current statistics or comparisons on any situations/drugs combination options they are looking to use.  Indeed the US is mostly considered behind in certain practices.  So do such widespread national data systems exist in other parts of the world? "

1726,What STDs can be transmitted if both parties have no open sores/cuts?,"If I recall correctly, Chlamydia, HPV, Gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV require both parties to have cuts/sores for transmission.  More specific questions, assuming no cuts/sores:   Possible transmitted diseases if saliva/semen/pre-cum/etc is swallowed? Possible transmitted diseases if fluids (pre-cum/semen/saliva/etc) are spilled on the vagina, or the head of the penis?  "
1727,Preemptive treatment for alcohol,"It's commonly accepted that most treatments for enteral poisons aren't very useful for alcohol, because it is absorbed so rapidly. For example, by the time a hospital could administer activated charcoal, most likely nearly all of the alcohol would already have passed into the blood. But what about preemptive treatment? If one were to expect a night of heavy drinking, what could be done in advance to decrease absorption and/or limit effects? "
1728,Added sugar RDI for a performing athlete,"What is the recommended DI of glucose/added sugars for a performing athlete, say, participating in a high intensity sport?

How much do these values vary in comparison to a performing athlete? "
1729,Are ear infections more likely when visiting high altitudes?,"We recently took our toddler to the Alps, and I was surprised when multiple people asked me if I was worried about her getting an ear infection due to the high altitude (the highest point was 2770 m). We checked with her pediatrician last year before visiting high altitudes when she was 7 months old, and he made no mention of possible ear infections due to altitude (slow acclimatization to prevent altitude sickness and lots of sunscreen, yes, but no other concerns).   In the end, she got an ear infection during our trip. Was it a coincidence? Is increased likelihood of an ear infection when visiting high altitude an old wives tale or is there some truth to it? "
1730,What is the term used for stronger heart beats at average bpm?,"Some people after drinking energy drinks, coffee and/or some mental illness medication feel their hearts beating stronger or louder but at the same bpm as without stimulants.  What is the term used to describe this? Palpitation? I've always thought that was for faster beats. "
1731,How much space should be in between taking an antidepressant and drinking coffee?,"For stimulants such as Methylphenidate and coffee, it is at least an hour, so I read:     Stimulant + Stimulant = Stimulated.

1732,Would testicular cancer have been detected before?,"It's been about 9 months since I have had ultrasound, MRI, and blood tests performed on me AFTER I was diagnosed with hydrocele and varicocele in my scrotum by the emergency center. I, of course, went to the urologist, and they're the one's who ordered all of these tests on me. They said my varicocele wasn't significant enough to be uncommon. They found nothing abnormal after all these tests. So, I just let it go.   The symptoms of dull ache and pain persisted, which became aggravated when I did physical activity, especially anything involving my legs.   About 2 months ago, I played very intense basketball after a while, and it's been on elevated pain since then. I scheduled a trip to the urologist.   I feel a scrotal mass or lump on one of my testicles. I looked it up, and it's possible that it's a lot of things.   My question is, is it possible that I have testicular cancer if all those tests were performed on me 9 months ago? Would they not have caught it back then? "
1733,How much sucralose does Powerade Zero contain? Why does that information not appear to be provided?,"I recently discovered Powerade Zero, which apparently has zero sugar / zero calories and is artificially sweetened by sucralose.  Normally when I'm concerned about sugar content (which is basically all the time, because nearly everything has loads of sugar in it nowadays) I check the nutritional information, and it's always there, Sugars ... x grams.  But with sucralose, there's no line for it in the nutrition label. I can find it in the ingredients list of course, but there's no indication of quantity.  I have three questions:   How much sucralose does Powerade Zero contain? Why isn't the quantity provided in the nutrition label (for sucralose as well as many other ingredients)? Does the absence of quantity information mean that it's not significant / shouldn't be a concern? Is there any way for a random ignoramus like me to get this information without having to ask this question on Stack Exchange and wait/hope for an expert to answer?  "

1739,Fainted history in both myself and my father. Can it be related?,"I am a twenty five year old male, pretty fit, no known conditions. I fainted last night for a few seconds and although I will get it checked out, it has to wait for a week or two so I thought I'd get an opinion here.   A very similar incident also happened a year and a half ago.  In both cases, I was sitting on the floor/lying down for twenty or more minutes. I got up and within about ten seconds, I felt dizzy and lost consciousness and fell down. I regained it within ten seconds and was completely okay. I remembered everything upto the feeling dizzy part.   The thing that worries me is that my dad has also had fainting spells of about one every year for the last three years (although not due to standing up suddenly). I'm not sure what his diagnosis is.   Given a fainting history on standing in a young, otherwise healthy male, and a fainting history in his father, can the two be related? What might be the causes? "
1740,What is the ideal oxygen air percentage for longterm health?,"I'm working on a science-fiction story, and a recent scene deals with someone tampering with the O2 levels of a ship's recycled atmosphere.  I find myself wondering, what is the ideal oxygen level for longterm health in humans?  In other words, what were the ship's O2 levels set to before they were changed?  According to my research Earth's air generally runs around 20.8-21% oxygen, and can be dangerous if it dips below 19.5% or so.  The ISS, for example, uses a basic sea-level air mixture of about 21%.  On the flip side, many athletes spend time in oxygen-rich environments to improve their training, and I know many scuba divers who use Nitrox tanks with up to 40% oxygen to give them energy and increase their focus, etc.  However, I also know that using enriched air like that can lead to long-term issues and oxygen toxicity at certain levels.  So my question is, are there oxygen mixtures more beneficial to longterm human life than the Earth-standard 21%?  If you could control the air mixture of a ship, would it be more beneficial to set it at 25%, or 30%, etc?  And just to be clear: I'm looking only for the longterm effects of the oxygen mixture on human health, and not other practical considerations (like chance of combustion, decompression, etc). "

1746,Does walking after eating really help with gas and constipation?,"Does it really make any difference? If yes, then by what mechanism?  I pass gas frequently and have hard stools. I've read that walking helps with both these problems.  For example, on the Mayo Clinic site, one of the recommendations is     Get moving. It may help to take a short walk after eating.   That's all of it; there's no explanation why. I've seen similar advice on other sites as well.  Is there any truth to this? And how does exercise affect constipation? "

I know some of them which use it as a preventive method.  My doubt arises when thinking that it's just a protein molecule, so as far as I know it will be subdivided into amino acids before reaching our bloodstream.  Since these amino acids are so ordinary and can be found in so many nutrients aside from collagen molecules, what's the point of ingesting pure collagen? Would it be really useful or completely unnecessary?  PD: Since the comment where I said it has ""disappeared"" I want to thank here @Nate Barbettini his appropriate help. "
1748,Why would a junkie have a grand mal seizure during withdrawal?,"On the television show Fear the Walking Dead, one of the main characters is a heroin addict. After a couple of days without heroin, he goes into intense withdrawal, and either has a grand mal seizure or pretends to.  His family is used to his addiction, and when his mother returns home from an errand, his sister says, rather matter-of-factly, ""He went grand mal"".    According to this website, heroin withdrawal alone doesn't cause seizures:      Heroin withdrawal on its own does not produce seizures, heart attacks, strokes, or delirium tremens.   So why would a person in this situation have a seizure?  Is it more likely to be the result of his sudden withdrawal (contradicting the quote above), or is it more likely to be a side effect of the use of heroin itself, or is it more likely that he has a medical condition that causes seizures, but which is totally unrelated to his addiction?

1750,Why are antibiotics and ear tubes the primary treatment for chronic ear infections rather than improving normal drainage through the Eustachian tube?,"Ear infections are not contagious, and most resolve without antibiotics. There are risks inherent with excessive antibiotic use as well as many allergies and negative side effects. Ear tubes require cutting into a healthy membrane, leave scars, have multiple side effects, and frequently don't solve the problem of chronic infections. The anesthesia required for the procedure carries its own risks. With these negatives in mind and knowing that the body already has a tube designed to do the same thing without the risks why are more efforts not made to improve their function?  Why is our current treatment standard despite the known risks, when other options are obviously still unexplored. There is not enough research done on many treatments such as balloon inflation as cited by the chochrane review ([website]Here are some of the many sites that I have already visited that did not answer the question, but raised more, if there is better or further information I would like to see it: [website][website][website][website][website][website][website][website]"
1751,Any studies on the tradeoff between losing weight and being less stressful?,"It is being constantly claimed, upheld and emphasized that being overweight or, even worse, obese, possesses many and severe health hazards. Overweight and obese people are being repeatedly urged to lose weight. That not losing excess weight is harmful for health seems certain.  However, there seems to be one more factor, which, admittedly, comes from my experience in the form of the observation of people surrounding me. Namely, I'd put a hypothesis that working to lose weight causes considerable strain on the psyche. I know a person who had been calm and happyâ¦ before she started dieting frantically to lose weight. She managed to lose most of her excess weight and works very hard to keep it that way, nonetheless seeing her as nervous and tired and humorless as she is now and comparing to how I remember her before makes me question if her efforts are worth it. Another example comes from a newspaper article (which, again, I can't now find to link it) about a talk-show host. The article snidely remarked that with her excess weight the host lost all of her funniness she had been esteemed for. Finally: I also read a newspaper article (which I, again, can't find now...) that seemed to confirm my anecdotal and intuitive observations: namely, it claimed that both hunger itself and conscious attempts to suppress hunger and restraining the urge to eat cause considerable stress and lower one's mood.  Still, in cases when both weight and stress are discussed together, it seems that it is usually in the context of excess weight causing stress because overweight people tend to have low self-esteem and they tend to be ostracized by their peers. I would, however, ask about this relationship from a different angle:   Can working to lose weight, as opposed to neglecting this, cause considerable stress? Since chronic stress is also widely recognized to be a health hazard, can the costs of being more stressed outweigh the costs of not losing weight? Assume absence of other egregious lifestyle-related risks â that is, our overweight person does not smoke, has some moderate physical activity, is not being bullied for being overweight, does not mostly eat junk food, etc etc.  "
1752,Why are the estimates of obesity prevalence in England wildly different?,"I am not a health professional and am a little bit puzzled by this. There appear to be two ranges of obesity prevalence estimates (I am particularly interested in the rate in adults in England):   Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) survey (link), which reports the prevalence of obesity among adults in England at 9.8%. This underpins the reports published by NHS Digital and Public Health England. There is another set of figures which are in a different league.   This government website reports the prevalence of obesity at 26.9% in men and 26.8% in women in 2015 in England. This is more in line with this 2014 estimate of 19.2% (although this is for the whole of UK, not just England). This 2014 WHO report (p. 109) reports 26.9% and 29.2% in men and women, respectively. This newspaper article ranks the UK the third most obese country in Europe with the rate of obesity at 27.8%, citing another WHO report. The Eurostat reports the 2014 data showing obesity rates in UK adults between 29.0% and 64.0%, depending on age-group; while this Eurostat tool shows the 2014 average for UK adults at 20.1%, which agrees with this table showing a close 2017 estimate of 21.0%.    If the estimates are so variable, are any of them reliable? Which would be the ultimate, most official and most reliable estimate? Particularly, the QOF estimates reported by NHS &amp; PHE (1) appear to be less than half those reported elsewhere (2). Why would that be the case? "
1753,Vitamin Supplements Frequency,"Most daily multivitamins have close to 100% of the RDA for each element in the vitamin, and I believe that the nutrients get into your blood in a short time frame.  Does this daily spike in vitamins have any known health consequences? It would seem more natural to have them split up into smaller doses and be taken with meals each day.  For example, in Japan many vitamins are smaller and designed to be taken a few times over the course of a day. The one-a-day approach most Americans use seems arbitrary and makes me wonder, for example, why we don't take one bigger vitamin every three days (let me ignore the problem of forgetting the day on which we last took vitamins even though it is important here).  So are there any health consequences to taking a single multivitamin once a day? Or is a split approach more conducive to absorption and utilization? At what frequency will vitamin blood concentrations start to have unhealthy spikes? "

1755,How to differentially diagnose continuing sciatic pain given this existing information?,"Pains along the sciatic nerve apparently have numerous possible causes (18 of them according to this article).  Now, given the following facts, what would be appropriate differential-diagnostic measures/procedures/tests to determine the exact cause (or combination of causes) of such pains?  Relevant qualifying facts:   Adult, but not elderly, male subject. Pain manifests only on one side of the body (the left side). Pain centered around the gluteal muscles (Piriformis?), occasionally shooting upwards or downwards. Pain intensity varies with time and posture; usually low intensity. Symptoms persist for over a year (but do not worsen). No relevant impact trauma. Regime of relevant physical exercise has little (and no lasting) effect.   Notes:   I've tried to follow the guidelines in this answer and keep this question on-topic; if you believe it isn't, please comment and help me edit it accordingly. If you believe the cause(s) are obvious based merely on the facts above, an explanation why that is would be a valid answer of course.  "

1757,Are contraception effectiveness percentages per-user or per-use?,"The efficacy of contraception methods is typically given as two percentages: typical use, and perfect use.  For both of these, is the denominator of the percentage the number of couples who used the contraception method, or the number of instances of sexual intercourse during which it was used?  In other words, if a contraceptive is 98% effective, does that mean:   2% of couples who used this method (any number of times) got pregnant, or Of all the individual instances of sexual intercourse during which this method was used, 2% of them resulted in pregnancy?  "
1758,"In contraceptive effectiveness ratings, are âtypical use,â and âperfect useâ self-reported?","The effectiveness of contraception methods is typically reported as two percentages: typical use and perfect use.  Typical use is the measure of how the average couple is likely to use the method, and takes into account incorrect or inadequate application. For example: an inside-out condom, or a missed day of birth control pills.  Perfect use assumes the couples being studies used the contraceptive method exactly as directed, without errors.  How are participants partitioned into these two groups?  Is there typically one large study, and participants self-report if they did not meet perfect use?

1761,Why canât we just transplant donor organs into pigs to preserve them?,"Iâm a newbie and utterly unfamiliar with biomedicine, but Iâve been reading a few scientific articles recently and a question has been nagging me ever since.   So apparently preserving donor organs long enough for transplant is a huge challenge. If cryopreservation or ex vivo perfusion can, at best, prolong organ survival by a few hours/days, why not just put them into host animals such as pigs? Xenotransplantation has become really successful in recent years, with graft survival for over 100 days, so why canât we just put the human donor organs inside genetically-engineered immunodeficient pigs to preserve their function?   Iâve read about this guy who did something similar: [website]But he was using fetal organs harvested from aborted fetuses, rather than adult donor organs.  "

1763,Can an individual further aggravate a full tear of the gluteus minimus tendon (trochanter insertion)?,"Can an individual further aggravate a full tear of the gluteus minimus tendon  (trochanter insertion)?  I would tend to think that if the gluteus minimus tendon is fully torn, then no force can be exercised on the gluteus minimus muscle anymore, and as a result  an individual cannot further aggravate a full tear of the gluteus minimus tendon. Is my reasoning correct? "
1764,How to explain the theory of the influence of purine and alcohol on the incidence of risk for gout in light of contradictory evidence?,"A common thought is that  dietary restrictions are recommended for people susceptible to gout.  These restrictions often focus on fructose, purines and alcohol: if a food or beverage is 'high' in these, they should be avoided, but that theory seems to not really translate into empirical evidence when looking at actual levels of substances to avoid in food and beverages and the effect of actual food on the observable incidences.  Different sources may recommend different things, just following their 'school of thought'? But in the following text all these discrepancies are combined into one:     Several facets of the diet are important to the reduction of the risks of a gouty episode: meat and seafood intake, alcohol use, and obesity. Although many physicians still advise patients to reduce their dietary intake of purines, purine-restricted diets only reduce mean serum urate levels by 0.6 mM/l, and such diets are relatively unpalatable.      For the moment, the best data related to diet comes from a recent study of 47,150 men over a 12-year period that shows meat and seafood increase the risk of gout. In contrast, dairy products, especially low-fat dairy products, are able to decrease the risk of gout in men. In addition to food, alcohol is another significant risk factor for gout. The relationship between gout and alcohol is more complex. Acute alcohol intoxication in individuals documents a higher plasma urate concentration when urate levels are measured after individuals have become sober. Such urate alterations may also occur as a result of not eating and the presence of ketosis. The latter state and its circulating ketones and lactate block urate excretion causing hyperuricemia. In normal individuals, elevated plasma levels of ethanol (> 200 mg/dl) cause a reduction in urinary urate levels [869, 870]. When moonshine whiskey was produced from lead-soldered stills, saturnine gout or lead-induced gout was a common occurrence in the southern part of the United States.       Finally, beer contains a purine (guanosine) that can be metabolized to uric acid. Recent studies of 14,809 individuals in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examined the role of beer, wine, and hard liquor in relation to uric acid. In this study, beer and hard liquor intake were positively correlated with hyperuricemia. It has been proposed that a glass of wine as a replacement for beer or hard liquor might reduce the incidence of gout. Both alcohol intake and obesity can cause an increase in urate production and a decrease in its elimination by the kidney.       Although medications are usually the means by which recurrent gouty episodes are controlled, there are certain dietary restrictions that may be useful as well. It has been shown that meat and seafood intake are associated with an increased risk of gout. Meat including beef, lamb, and pork as well as bologna, sausage, salami, bacon, hot dogs, chicken, turkey, hamburger, chicken liver, and beef liver are the most well-characterized offenders as inducers of gouty episodes. Seafood associated with an increase risk of gout include tuna, dark fish, shrimp, lobster, clams, and scallops. There are also some purine-rich vegetables like peas, lentils, spinach, mushrooms, oatmeal, and cauliflower, but they do not appear to increase the risk of gout.      Alcohol ingestion in excess and its association with gout has been known since antiquity. Beer has a special capacity to raise the serum uric acid levels and put patients at risk for gouty episodes since it contains guanosine, a purine that is easily converted enzymatically to uric acid. Finally, many patients will tell their physician that particular foods or alcoholic beverages will trigger an attack of gout. In these cases, physicians should heed the patientâs information and ask the patient to restrict their intake of the offending agent.   How to properly explain the associations between diet and gout that is at the same time theory guided, simple and accurate?  It seems that 'purine-rich' is too simple, as purine-rich vegetables don't seem to count?  It seems that 'alcohol' isn't a factor at all, as since antiquity beer is known to be bad, but wine with a much higher alcohol content is noted as not being bad?  The practical guideline is just that:     In general, the three foods/beverages that place patients at risk for gout are red meat, beer, and fructose, a sugar commonly found in sugar- sweetened soft drinks. Finally, patients with gout should decrease their use of hard liquor and beer with a substitution of wine if necessary.      Quotes from David S. Newcombe: ""Gout. Basic Science and Clinical Practice"", Springer: London, Heidelberg, 2013. (9 Management of Hyperuricemia and Gout, 291â385, DOI.)   Specifically for alcohol, which is sometimes even thought to be preventative if taken as wine in low doses:     In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of individual alcoholic beverages on serum uric acid levels varies substantially: beer confers a larger increase than liquor, whereas moderate wine drinking does not increase serum uric acid levels.

Choi  &amp; Gary Curhan: ""Beer, liquor, and wine consumption and serum uric acid level: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey"", Athritis Care and Research, Volume 51, Issue 6, 15 December 2004, Pages 1023-1029. DOI   How does one explain 'avoid purines in food' if purine-rich plant food isn't counting? How does one explain 'avoid alcohol' if alcoholic wine seems fine?  Is the above interpreted correctly? Is the theory wrong, incomplete or in need of modification? "
1765,Must one take anticoagulants lifelong after stenting of deep veins with a non-thrombotic lesion?,"Must one take anticoagulants lifelong after stenting of deep veins with a non-thrombotic lesion, for example, aorto-venous conflict (May-Thurner syndrome)?  Or is it enough to take anticoagulants only in the first 6 months, until the stent grows into the vein?  [website]  Platelet aggregation is known to be important in high-flow, high-shear   environment, such as in the coronary arteries, whereas coagulation may   be more important in the fibrin-rich thrombi characteristic of the   low-flow, low-shear venous circulation [42]. The relative importance   of antiplatelet agents versus anticoagulants has never been evaluated   in clinical trials and is largely based on extrapolation from the   arterial system and an understanding of the venous system. Based on   clinical data on stenting of chronic iliocaval occlusions, long-term   warfarin is recommended in patients with long occlusions, underlying   thrombophilia, suprarenal occlusions, and previous long-term   anticoagulation and poor inflow on completion angiogram [43, 44]. With   postthrombotic lesions being more prone to restenosis, the use of   anticoagulants appears to be useful in this subgroup. Thus, although   the use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants has not been studied   systematically, there seems to be a role for these drugs.  "

1771,Why is it a bad idea to use uppers and downers simulatenously?,"In the Requiem For A Dream (2000) which is based on a novel written in '78, The grandma uses rainbow pills for weight loss and after overdosing on them. She loses Her sanity and ends up getting ECT.  According to some internet resource I have read. ""As any first year pharmacist (or seasoned drug user) can tell you: mixing uppers with downers is a very, very bad idea. (Think pharmaceutical grade speedball.) ""So what exactly are uppers and downers? Why is it a bad idea to mix them? "
1772,4 Electrode vs 5 Electrode ECG,"I see that in a 4 electrode ECG (LA, RA, LL, RL) we can measure upto 6 Leads (LeadI, LeadII, LeadIII, AvR, AvL, AvF). What increase in value does adding an additional chest electrode like V2 provide?  What percentage of the heart activity is captured with a 4 electrode system vs a 5 electrode system? "
1773,Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range,"[website]I found some papers suggesting AMDR is not the optimum and it is too high on carbohydrates in particular.  Is it generally safe to undergo a  27.1% Protein 40% Fat and 32.9% Carbohydrate diet?  How about neoglucogenesis from amino-acids?  Which would be the side effects from Reduced Carbs and Increased Fats even if it doesn't reach ketosis?  Would there be any systematic(systemic) damage(damage to the systems) Digestive(mainly thinking of the specific organs liver and pancreas), Endocrine(thinking of growth hormone and kids), Urinary. Circulatory?  Fats mainly from Fish(Cod and Pollock), Strawberries, Spinach, Almond Milk, Walnuts.  Which people should be exluded from such a modified diet for safety reasons? "
1774,Supplementing Iron: Everyday or Every other day?,"Recent studies and guidelines are suggesting iron supplements every other day is better for absorption:   [website]I think this study has looked a the incorrect variable though.  It seems like time, rather than doses, should be studied if the goal is to increase iron.  In my view, the study should have compared the difference between taking iron everyday for 28 days vs every other day for 28 days (not 14 days with 1 does vs 28 days with dose every other day).  Is my line of thinking off?  Unless access to the number of pills is an issue, I am failing to see why taking every other day is being advised above taking daily.   "
1775,What would a map of all possible diets look like?,"As I understand it, a diet can be broadly described in term of macronutrient ratiosâi.e., the proportions of energy received from carbohydrate, protein and fat sources.  In that case, presumably the range of all possible diets can be plotted on a ternary graph, ranging from (33,33,33) (i.e., a completely balanced diet) to (100,0,0) / (0,100,0) / (0,0,100) (i.e., a diet in which all energy comes from a single type of source).  What would such a map of the âdietspaceâ look like? Where would the healthy and unhealthy regions be? What regions would come with unexpected side-effects, positive or negative (such as ketosis maybe helping to treat epilepsy)?  I've had a go at making a rough version, but as you can probably tell I am neither an artist nor a dietician (the dashed lines show overlap, which is difficult to get across in Paint):   "
1776,Why does body movement still affect fractured bone when it is immobilized?,"Let's assume we have a type 1 closed fracture in the coronoid process:        The treatment is to immobilize that joint in plaster. However, the patient should also limit their movement.  I wonder why is that, when by definition the joint is immobilized? As long as there is no pressure on the surrounding bones (e.g. carrying objects with that arm) I though movement of irrelevant bones (e.g. walking) will not affect the healing process. Yes, there are swinging if the arm is hung before chest, but it's the movement of the whole arm, and the joint is still fixed.  Is there any factor that affect the healing process, beside immobilizing the fractured location?    A minor question: if arm swinging is the problem, then would eliminating that swing by attaching the whole arm to the body be fine? "
1777,Is Intestinal or oral myiasis persistent?,"I apologize in advance if my question is unclear, as I don't have a formal education in medicine. I have checked various forum and medical articles, and they have not been very clear on this topic, as they state the existing methods of dealing with the condition, but not whether the condition will persist or not.   Will intestinal myiasis resolve itself eventually, or will it be chronic if left untreated? Could the fly larvae grow to maturity and reproduce perpetually in a patient's stomach? "
1778,How to share a cure?,"How does a person share a cure for a disease? Through trial and error a normal Joe or Jane Smoe finds a cure to a disease that has no other cure what is the best way to get it validated?   For example, if someone says that they found a treatment for diagnosed psoriatic rash on the legs and it cured it, but that treatment has not been previously known as a treatment for psoriasis, how can one validate it's a real treatment and not a chance? "
1779,Bone Demineralization in Situ,"Very often, people need a surgery for lengthening, shortertening bones.  Surgeons can perform osteotomy and place bone fragments in corrent position, or can place a distractor for further steps. Most resistance in bones located in outer cortex, sometimes surgeon can remove this cortex(corticotomy). Bone rigid because of hydroxyapatite crystals,demineralized bone matrix have diminished resistance for deformation.  We have a chemical compouds such as EDTA,EGTA. It's chelating agents, that can destroy hydroxyapatite by chelating calcium. It's low mutagenic, low cytotoxic.   Why we can't perform ""chemical corticotomy"" by subperiosteally injecting  EDTA, or it can be by sustained-release drug delivery(hydrogels,polymers)?  Can we inject EDTA, wait for demineralization, and after place distractor on bone?  "
1780,How does alcoholism technically (chemically) kill you?,"   Moreover, chronic excessive alcohol use is the single most important cause of illness and death from liver disease (alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis) in the United States (1).   Furthermore:     The three alcohol-induced liver conditions are fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis.   While I can find information about what is exactly a fatty liver or cirrhosis (liver scars), I can't find any information, what and how exactly things react inside of your body and what kind of damage alcohol does to your body.  From high school I still know, that alcohol is ethanol with the formula  C2H6O, so my question is, simply put - what kinds of molecules from your own body react in which way with C2H6O?  I mean if I drink 1 litre water daily I certainly won't die any time soon, but if I do drink 1 litre alcohol daily I will die pretty soon. So what's the different reaction between H2O and C2H6O inside of your body? "
1781,How does a herniated spinal disk correct itself?,"Looking at the picture below, nothing in the herniated disc seems to be able to correct itself over time. Yet, the article I took the picture from says that surgical treatment is used only if the pain is not resolved within a few weeks.  My question is: How exactly can this condition be resolved within a few weeks, with drugs only? What happens to the mechanical deformation - the root cause?   "
1782,Differences between MD vs DO regarding computational research?,"I'm nearing graduation from university, at which point I'll have a degree in computer science (bioinformatics) with a minor in mathematics. My intention is to specialize in computational medical research, perhaps applying various A.I. techniques to studying/modeling medical data.  My question is, is there an inherent difference between MD vs. DO regarding the ability to perform research? Are there more resources available for one more than the other? Does the industry, in general, promote/value research of DO more than MD? Other way around?  Any insight is greatly appreciated, as I need to start thinking about MCAT and applying to programs.  "
1783,Is pasteurized or non-pasteurized milk healthier for an adult male in his early 40s?,Taste is irrelevant. Health effects is the more important consideration. Which is a healthier choice for an adult male in his early 40s? Pasteurized or non-pasteurized milk? How much should he drink if he is an office worker who does not work out a lot? 
1784,Is nurse prescribing limited to PGD medication?,Are nurse prescribers limited to giving PGD medication only?  Or are there non-PGD medications they are permitted to prescribe?  This question relates to NHS general hospitals in the UK. 
1785,Are canned/bottled foods acidified?,"Two popular books (""Dropping Acid"" by Dr. Jamie Koufman and ""The Acid Watcher Diet"" by Dr. Jonathan Aviv) claim that Title 21 of the FDA regulations require that all low-acid foods be acidified to inhibit bacterial growth.  Looking at the regulation, it appears that section 114 describes the use of acidification to preserve foods, but section 113 describes and permits the use of thermal processing as an alternative.  This would contradict the books' claim that ""all"" preserved foods are acidified, and it's consistent with my subjective impression that many canned foods (e.g. beans) don't seem acidic at all.  Is there a blanket regulation that I'm missing?  If not, what methods (such as using a pH tester or reading labels to see if they mention citric acid or similar preservatives) can be used to determine whether a particular food has been acidified? "
1786,How common are tics as a side-effect when taking Lamotrigine?,"I am on Lamotrogine (specifically in the form Epitec). Last week my dose was raised by 25mg (from 200mg/day to 225mg/day). Over the last couple of days I have developed a tic in my eyes. At first it was intermittent, but compulsive blinking spasms. Now it has settled onto the right side of my face, but have become constant.  The best way I can describe the sensation is it feels like something has hold of the muscle in my cheek (Zygomaticus?) and is pulling it, causing my upper lip the rise on that side and my right eyelid to flutter down to the point of completely obscuring my vision.  I have seen mentions of a couple of case studies (can't find them!) of people reporting tics. But it seems to only be a few out of the thousands who take the medication. But I know that that can not be a good representation, because often these things can go unreported. I have also checked my package insert and it mentioned nothing. But that is the only thing that has recently changed.  What I want to know is: How common are facial tics REALLY with Lamotrigine? "
1787,Why stomach ulcer need more than one antibiotic at the same time?,"Almost all treatment recommendation for gastritis, duodenitis or peptic ulcer that has Helicobacter pylori, calls for 2 or 3 antibiotic at the same time, why is that ?  Why not use a single effective antibiotic? "
1788,What is the life expectancy of a sperm in dried semen?,"How long can sperm survive when semen dries?  Can dead sperm cause pregnancy?  For example, if semen were left to dry on the toilet seat for 2 hours, and a woman were to use the toilet, is there ANY scenario in which she could get pregnant? Please answer,I am really paranoid over this one. "
1789,Is it unhealthy to steam my eyes in order to cure Blepharitis?,"In order to treat my Blepharitis, I put a towel over my head and allow steam from a bowl of water to clear the sebaceous glands between my eye lashes, which glands deliver oil to the surface of the eye.   The surface of the eye needs not only moisture, but a small amount of oil in order to form a film across the eyeball. If the oil is not properly delivered, the water in the eye forms a droplet and dribbles out, causing, paradoxically, not only a leaking eye but a dry eye.  My question is, am I damaging my eye by steaming it ?  See my video on Youtube describing Blepharitis and describing the treatment [website]"
1790,Does it matter for metabolism at what time of day we eat?,"In many popular media that discuss fat loss and dieting, a common idea is that eating at the ""wrong"" time of the day, say a meal at dinner time, is supposedly better from a weight loss perspective than eating that same meal at another time of day, say around midnight.  Is there any research to back up statements like that? I.e., does it make a difference when in the day we eat the same food? "
1791,"Saturated and unsaturated fats, same compound in blood/cells?","I'm trying to self-studying a bit of biochemistry.  When carbs enter the blood, it seems to have understood that they enter with the same chemical compounds, called glucose.  I'm wondering if something similar happens for fat as well: I mean, do unsaturated and saturated fats become the same chemical compound when entering the blood and/or cells? If not, what are the differences? "
1792,Can posture affect the jaw position?,"How are jaw, teeth and other related part of body ( more precisely, head ) affected by bad posture?  Can a bad jaw position be solved in 'nature' way, by exercise, correction of posture of neck, so head even when relaxed can't get in 'down' position where teeth are closed? Should one go to physical practioner to examine oneâs overall posture? "
1793,What is the effect of sound frequency on hearing?,"We all know that humans can tolerate lower frequencies at high volumes better than higher frequencies. In fact, for particularly low frequencies, high SPL is needed just for it to be audible.   Whatâs the difference between low and high frequencies for the ear?   If the decibels are equal, does low frequency sound cause the same amount of total hearing damage as other frequencies? If not, how much less damage does it cause? What is the maximum safe threshold for lower frequencies?   By low frequency, I am referring to the range of 16-100Hz, which is the range of most commercial subwoofers.   I am aware of people with 150db+ car audio systems, who are not deaf or hearing impaired. With regular sound, this would be as loud as a gunshot and constant exposure will surely cause significant damage. Many people in those communities seem to think bass is safe at loud volumes. However, I have not found any research to support or counter this argument.    Clearly, low frequency sound affects hearing differently than high frequency sound.    This is different from [website]"

1795,What are the differences between Stratamed and Strataderm gels?,"Recently some man had injured my eyes and eyelid skin. My lower eyelid skin was ripped. Lacrimal channel was ripped as well. In the hospital, my wound on the inferior eyelid was stitched. A week ago the stitches were removed.  I want to contribute to the skin to prevent excessive formation of scar tissue.    Which is more suitable for the treatment of fresh scar? Stratamed gel or Strataderm. Or is there no difference? "
1796,What happens in an emergency room in this situation?,"A patient is taken to a hospital's emergency department (the closest one to them) with major trauma and urgently needs surgery for internal bleeding. However, there are no surgeons (for whatever specialty) on call. What will happen here? Is there any way the patient can be stabilized, and then transferred to a facility where surgery can be performed? "

What is better to use for a scar that is 1 month old? I want to use a silicone tape (for prevention of excessive formation of scars). Mepiderm is more expensive. Does this mean that it copes better with scars?

1800,Can too much potassium from sports drinks be dangerous/lethal?,I have always been aware that sports drinks help you replace potassium lost from exercise. But I also know that too much potassium in your bloodstream is not a good thing and bad for your heart. So can drinking too many sports drinks be dangerous for you? What would happen if a person drank a gallon of a sports drink a day for a month?  
1801,What is the reason you can only take flucloxacillin on an empty stomach?,Is there a specific type of food that causes flucloxacillin to not be abosrbed more so than other kinds of food?  Specifically could somebody eat for example a handful of almonds or peanuts as a small snack without it causing the flucloxacillin to lose effectiveness? 
1802,Is a hyperventilation+hypoventilation breathing exercise (Wim Hof Method) more likely to prevent or promote cancer?,"Apart from exposure to cold, the core element of the Wim Hof Method is a breathing technique, which alternates between hyperventilation and hypoventilation (apparently similar to Tummo meditation). It consists of repeating the following steps for 3-4 times:   Hyperventilation for 30 deep, strong breaths. Breath hold after an exhalation for as long as possible. Inhalation followed by another breath hold for ~10 seconds.   The exercise seems to have a profound effect on human physiology, which has been discovered in  Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans. The focus of the experiment was to study the immune response after administration of an endotoxin while performing the breathing exercise. The study revealed the following physiological reactions (see also videos in the supplementary material):   Increases epinephrine levels. Suppresses immune response, i.e., decreased pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-8) and increased anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10). Blood pH: Increases from ~7.4 to over ~7.7 during hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis); falls back to ~ baseline during breath retention. Oxygen saturation: At 100% during hyperventilation; temporarily drops to ~50% during the breath hold. Arterial pCO2: Decreases from a baseline of ~4.5 kPa to below 2 kPa during hyperventilation. The breath hold recovers pCO2 but not fully to baseline level, which is why the minimum pCO2 seems to decrease with each hyperventilation. Arterial pO2: Increases from a baseline of ~16.5 to kPa over 22 kPa during hyperventilation. During the breath hold pO2 can fall below 4 kPa, and the minimum seems to become lower with each repetition. pO2 stays slightly elevated post exercise.   Looking at these physiologic reactions, I'm wondering how performing this exercise on a daily basis would affect the development of cancer? I am a scientist, but not in the field of medicine or health, so it is difficult to make sense these effects. Naively, I would think that some of the reactions like the more alkaline blood pH and a more efficient immune system should be beneficial for preventing cancer. Also, a 2017 study has found positive effects of breath training on respiratory cancer. On the other hand, the exercise involves states of low oxygenation during both:   Hyperventilation: As a result of the low carbon dioxide levels, haemoglobin binds oxygen (Bohr effect), leading to reduced tissue oxygenation. Breath hold: The low oxygen saturation and arterial pO2 probably means that the body is in a temporary state of generalized hypoxia at the end of the breath hold.   A quick research on the connection between oxygenation/hypoxia and cancer seems to indicate that hypoxia is something that should be avoided by all means, because it promotes malignant progression and metastasis, and increases resistance to therapy and mortality (Wikipedia, 2004 article, 2007 article, 2016 article).  Is it possible for an experienced health scientist to put these observations into perspective? I.e., would you recommend (or advise against) a cancer-prone person to do such an exercise from a purely theoretical point of view? "
1803,Prepare tea directly in water boiler - dangerous?,Is it dangerous to prepare tea directly in a water boiler? If I prepare green tea in a water boiler there is some discoloring of the container.

1805,How to assist an epilepsy sufferer in convulsion?,"I look after vulnerable people as a Security Warden supervising Homeless Hostels at night. We sometimes have persons prone to epileptic seizure. My First Aid course just told me to clear the area around them, then speak to them reassuringly.  I was told that if they fit for longer than 5 mins, call an ambulance or if, after the fit ceases, they do not recover within another 5 mins [10 mins total]; again, call an ambulance.  Is this all there is to know ? Is there any more I can do for them ?  [Addition After Posting: I have since spoken to an epilepsy sufferer and she has told me that during seizure her worst problem is a sense that the convulsion will never end, that she is stuck in it and cannot get out. She describes fighting against it to try and control it. She told me all she needs is for someone to touch her lightly on the shoulders, to look into her eyes and just to speak her name and reassure her that it will all soon be over. I know that in some cases seizures can be quite a physical thing but I am not aware they are ever 'violent' as such, so what she requests sounds, to me, quite reasonable.] "
1806,What (if any) are the measurement units for neurotransmitters?,"I've searched through the web for how to measure neurotransmitters (such as dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin), but could not find any. Could someone please specify if there is a unit of measurement, like micrograms, for neurotransmitters? And if there is, can you please tell me which one? My hunch is some form of mass. "
1807,Do growth hormone intakes help heal a tendinopathy?,"I wonder whether growth hormone intakes (e.g., through injections) help heal a tendinopathy.  What I have found so far is limited and somewhat contradictory:   (1) shows some positive results but has only 10 human participants  (2) shows some negative results but was performed on rats, and focus on acute tendon injuries (3) shows some negative results (a higher stimulation of type III collagen production and a lower stimulation of type I collagen production in CTS cells as compared with control cells)   I am mostly interested in epicondylopathy (either lateral or medial, a.k.a. tennis elbow or golfer elbow).    References:   (1) Doessing, Simon, Katja M. Heinemeier, Lars Holm, Abigail L. Mackey, Peter Schjerling, Michael Rennie, Kenneth Smith et al. ""Growth hormone stimulates the collagen synthesis in human tendon and skeletal muscle without affecting myofibrillar protein synthesis."" The Journal of physiology 588, no. 2 (2010): 341-351. [website]  In skeletal muscle and tendon the extracellular matrix confers important tensile properties and is crucially important for tissue regeneration after injury. Musculoskeletal tissue adaptation is influenced by mechanical loading, which modulates the availability of growth factors, including growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which may be of key importance. To test the hypothesis that GH promotes matrix collagen synthesis in musculotendinous tissue, we investigated the effects of 14 day administration of 33â50 Î¼g kgâ1 dayâ1 recombinant human GH (rhGH) in healthy young individuals. rhGH administration caused an increase in serum GH, serum IGF-I, and IGF-I mRNA expression in tendon and muscle. Tendon collagen I mRNA expression and tendon collagen protein synthesis increased by 3.9-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively (P &lt; 0.01 and P= 0.02), and muscle collagen I mRNA expression and muscle collagen protein synthesis increased by 2.3-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively (P &lt; 0.01 and P= 0.06). Myofibrillar protein synthesis was unaffected by elevation of GH and IGF-I. Moderate exercise did not enhance the effects of GH manipulation. Thus, increased GH availability stimulates matrix collagen synthesis in skeletal muscle and tendon, but without any effect upon myofibrillar protein synthesis. The results suggest that GH is more important in strengthening the matrix tissue than for muscle cell hypertrophy in adult human musculotendinous tissue.    (2) Baumgarten, Keith M., Harvey A.

Journal of occupational and environmental medicine 42, no. 3 (2000): 251-259. ; [website]  The effects of ascorbic acid and various growth factors on the proliferation rate and collagen metabolism were studied in cells from the flexor retinaculum of individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome (FR-CTS) and without carpal tunnel syndrome (FR control) and in human dermal fibroblasts. Ascorbic acid and four growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factors, were used. Ascorbic acid stimulates type I collagen production more in FR control than in FR-CTS. Growth factor treatment resulted in the following responses by the cells: (1) a higher mitogenic response than in the control cells; (2) a higher stimulation of type III collagen production and a lower stimulation of type I collagen production in CTS cells as compared with control cells; and (3) more Î±2(I) than Î±1(I) collagen production in CTS cells, unlike in control cells. We concluded that cells of the FR from individuals with CTS are physiologically altered.  "
1808,Does vaccination weaken the immune system ? Studies?,"A friend recognizes value in vaccinating in general - against major diseases - but with a caveat that they are opposed to the flu vaccine specifically.    They claim that vaccines weaken the immune system, and reasoned that (in conjunction with the fact that flu vaccines may only offer ~40% (random example) efficacy against some strains, some given flu season) this weakening of the immune system actually increases occurrence and/or chance of illness.   Is it true that vaccines ""weaken the immune system"" ? Whether flu vaccines specifically, or vaccines in general.   I tried Googling this, but most results pertain to vaccination for those who are already immunocompromised ?  One source writes :      Is there any evidence that vaccines do cause illness and immune   system dysfunction?      One answer came in a careful study of illness patterns observed in   babies before and after vaccination, published in Clinical Pediatrics   in 1988. If vaccines cause a weakened immune system, then we would   expect to see a higher incidence of illness following vaccination. In   that study conducted in Israel, the incidence of acute illnesses in   the 30 day period following DTP vaccine was compared to the incidence   in the same children for the 30 day period prior to vaccine. The   three-day period immediately following vaccine was excluded because   children frequently develop fever as a direct response to vaccine   toxins. A total of 82 healthy infants received DTP, and their symptoms   were reported by parents and observed by a pediatrician at weekly   intervals. Those babies experienced a dramatic increase in fever,   diarrhea, and cough in the month following DTP vaccine compared to   their health before the shot.   [website]But that article's subsequent anti-vaccine extremism makes me disregard that claim, without significant research towards proper debunking of its source, if it exists.   Are there any legitimate studies that support / oppose the notion that vaccination weakens the immune system in otherwise healthy people ? "

So, let's say that I take more than required on a given day and less than required on an another day -- is that okay? I'm not asking about eating all the protein you need one day and nothing at all for the rest of week, but what about tiny fluctuations? What if you meet 50% of your daily recommendation one day but compensate for it the next couple of days?  How does that work for other nutrients such as vitamins and minerals? Does our body somehow 'store' these nutrients when you take in more than what is necessary? "
1813,Health risk associated with living close to a power line: Cancer risk & exposure to electromagnetic field,"Is there reason to be concerned about living in a home/apartment that is directly facing a power line?  A google search (general and google scholar) seems to suggest that there is minimal risk but I have also come across some information indicating ""mixed evidence""   1) brief summary: [website]2) example: 4th response at: [website]For instance, some have argued that power lines very close to the living space have the potential to have a greater impact on the ""ambient field"" than larger towers that are usually located further away from homes. Is there any scientific merit to this argument?  In sum, is it a bad idea to get an apartment unit that directly overlooks a power line (like an arm's length away from the window), strictly from a health-related point of view? If so, who are at greatest risk for what types of health problems? (childhood leukemia, birth defects, etc)   EDIT: There is a clear lack of research looking at dose-response relationship between EMF exposure and a range of health outcomes. My question has more to do with how much ELF magnetic field exposure one might get living in so close proximity to a wooden pole. Surely, this will likely vary across circumstances. It's hard to find this type of information on the web, esp given such limited research that tends to focus narrowly on specific set of outcomes.

And I saw in Wikipedia and other places that food fortification is considred as a very possitive measure helping to reduce population deffiniencies so with the main risk is to have a surplus of a nutrient why not add any nutrient to create a ""super food""?  And why when fortifying food with certain nutrient companies sometimes keep the predecesor product? Recently a dairy company introduced a yogurt fortified with 10 g proteins,and they kept the original yogurt. Why? Is there some danger in fortification that some people afraid of and refrain from buying? Because other than exceeding the advised quantity of a nutrient I didn't read in Wikipedia anything. So why keep both lines when one is simply better? And how ecactly a food fortification is done? Thanks "
1815,What is the velocity of ejaculated semen and does it influence likelihood of fertilisation?,"During male orgasm, the smooth muscle of the penis must contract with sufficient force to ejaculate semen from the penis.   Is the mean velocity of ejaculation known? I do not find scientific sources. I only found 17 km/h in the media without further elaboration.  Moreover, in some species, males must compete with other males for egg fertilisation. Presumably, evolutionary forces would favour those who had a greater ejaculation velocity. Is there a relationship between the velocity of male ejaculation and fertility? "
1816,"Why are dogs only vaccinated once for rabies, while humans need follow-up treatment after being bitten, even with a previous vaccination?","As stated in the title, why are dogs only vaccinated pre-exposure for rabies, while humans need follow-up treatment after being bitten, even with a pre-exposure vaccination?  What is causing the difference in approach? Does the dog vaccine work in a fundamentally different way, making them perfectly immune after the vaccine, or is this simply a matter of risk/reward? Would it be wise to give a dog a follow-up treatment if the odds of having been bitten by an animal with rabies were high? Similarly, would a human require a follow-up treatment after being bitten by a vaccinated dog that may have been bitten by an animal with rabies? "
1817,Bacteria location in food poisoning?,"Where is the majority of bacteria located in food that leads to food poisoning? I.E in most cases is it on the surface, or deep within the food (i.e in the case of ""cooked"" meat, or balanced? "
1818,Are there any ways to check my water for Arsenic?,I've been found to have a large amount of Arsenic in my blood. Is there a way to check my food and water for Arsenic? Are there testing kits available? 
1819,Menstruation and emergency contraceptives,"I would like to know whether emergency contraceptive (such as postinor2) can make you skip a period completely in the menstural cycle it was taken in? Especially after a pregnancy test (taken 3 days after the contraceptive was taken) returned to be negative. I would also like to know whether emergency contraceptives can potentially cause periods to permanently stop? And if so why?  There is not much data or reading materials available on this apart from the one that the contraceptive pill companies have published themselves, so I would appreciate some other inputs and explanations.  Thanks.  "
1820,How are the parameters of an astigmatic lens prescription related to the geometry?,"Given is spherical optical power, cylindrical optical power in diopters and cylindrical angle in degrees. Also given is the base curve in millimeters, and the contact lens diameter in millimeters. Also given  is the refractive index of the lens (and the outside medium). How do I figure out the shape of the lens from this?  My best guess so far, is that the base curve is the radius of curvature of the inner surface of the lens, shaped like a sphere. My other guess is that the outer surface of the lens is taken from a torus, that has been tilted according to the angle (like holding a donut in front of you and changing its roll).  I am not sure how to relate the optical powers to geometry. I think they might be deltas between the diopters of the two surfaces? Or maybe they are not in units of diopters, but ""keratometer readings""(?)?  I am nearsighted so am mostly interested in that case. Would be interesting to understand my prescription in full detail :-) "
1821,Alcohol NMDAR antagonism,"If alcohol is an NMDA receptor antagonist, why doesn't it produce dissociative effects? As far as I am aware, all other drugs that antagonize NMDA receptors function as dissociatives, such as ketamine, PCP, nitrous oxide, DXM, and memantine. Why doesn't alcohol? Is it that its effects on NMDA receptors are too weak? Does it just affect different specific receptors? Or does its effect of GABA somehow counteract NMDA antagonism? "
1822,Are raw eggs dangerous?,"I have two raw eggs every morning with / for breakfast. I have chickens and only eat raw eggs from our chickens, never store-bought.  I have been told that raw eggs can be dangerous, including the risk of salmonella.  Are raw eggs dangerous? What are the risks / benefits? "
1823,Why might excessive drinking produce a false hypercortisolism reading in a urinary free cortisol (UFC) test?,"From ""Diagnosis of Cushing's Syndrome in the Modern Era"" by L.K. Nieman, 2018:     A urine free cortisol (UFC) result may incorrectly exclude hypercortisolism in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min but might falsely diagnose hypercortisolism in individuals drinking more than 5 L of fluid daily. In the former situation, UFC should not be chosen as a screening test.""  In the latter group of individuals, urinary cortisone and cortisol both increase, so that the effect may be more accentuated in immunoassays in which cortisone cross-reacts with the antibody. Thus, 2 ways of addressing this are to use tandem mass spectroscopy assays (or immunoassays with minimal cross-reactivity) and to ask patients to restrict fluids to 2 L/d.   Why is that so? Is it because the body would naturally need to produce more cortisol in order to expel all this water?  "
1824,Where are less painful self-injection sites for sub-cutaneous injections?,"If a sub-cutaneous injection is to be given, where is the least painful site?  Injection into the thigh muscle is suggested for some unknown reason, and the instructions advise simply to avoid muscle and veins. Concerning since I have no medical training!  The thigh seems like it would be painful, so I've been doing my shoulder/upper arm area since I used to lift a lot, I thought they'd be a good target, but all but one so far have been a bit more painful than I'd have expected.  So what ""sub-cutaneous"" injection sites would be least painful?  "
1825,Can gynecomastia breast tissues be dissolved?,If one takes zinc and vitamin D then the T levels increase.  So oestrogen must decrease and thus gynecomastia goes away.  But this site says that the breast tissues can never be dissolved even if the hormones are balanced. Is it true? 
1826,Why can glyceryl trinitrate (a.k.a. nitroglycerin) patches cause severe headaches?,"Glyceryl trinitrate (a.k.a. nitroglycerin) patches can cause severe headaches [1,2]. Why?

1827,can I mix cool water with hot water,"My workplace have very hot water and very cool water which is not drinkable,  can I mix both, is it good for health?Are there any ill effects if you drink a hot and cold water mixture? "
1828,What does sodium content on food items indicate?,"Generally I find that packed food items that would probably be laced with heavy doses of preservatives contain high amount of sodium (as high as 45% DV, I saw this on one item in Walmart). Is higher sodium content an indicator of unhealthy food? I am confused because natural foods like chicken are also shown very high amount of sodium. Even fruit drinks contain high amount of sodium. Is it good or bad for our body? "
1829,How much music listening is harmless using earphones?,"With Smart phones, we can always be connected and can consume media both Audio and video, almost all day without any interruption.  Generally, when people listen to music, its always with earphones plugged-into ears. A common use case is when commuting we always listen to music with earphones.  My Question is: How much music one should listen with plugged-in earphones in a day, without causing ear/organ damage? Looking for a general medical advice here for healthy ear functioning yet consuming favorite music?  "
1830,Identifying the right caloric intake for weight loss,"So far I've lost 30 pounds, and I did it all with caloric restriction. I have gotten to where I can keep my caloric intake between 1500 and 1700 daily. However, since I started exercising regularly I'm not moving the scale much, and I'm not weight training, it's all cardio.  Cardio Breakdown  I've been using the bike, going 60 minutes, at level 10, and burning (according to the machine) somewhere between 600 and 700 calories per day. Prior to that I was walking on the treadmill for 60 minutes at about 3 to 3.5 mph and an incline of 6 and burning about 400 per day.  Is it possible I'm still consuming too many calories? Or am I not consuming enough now, for weight loss? How do I know either way? "
1831,Is there any risk from eating meals before/after HGH shots?,"I'm undergoing HGH therapy, and I see a lot of conflicting information on the internet another whether or not it's truly bad to eat meals after/before the shots -- supposedly, it can increase the risk of diabetes because of the insulin spikes.  Is there any scientific evidence regarding this? Is an insulin spike(from food) after/before taking HGH shots a risk factor for diabetes?  "
1832,Nutrient loss upon throwing away water used to boil a food product,"If I boil a food product, say, chickpeas or corn in water- can I potentially lose any nutrients besides carbohydrates by throwing away the water as opposed to not throwing away the water? In what cases should I be careful (and in what cases can I throw away water without thinking)? I'm looking for the guiding principle (and not an exhaustive list).  "
1833,Why does overuse of antibiotics cause resistance?,"The way I see it there are 2 cases:  1. The patient uses antibiotics and has an infection. 2. The patient does not have an infection and uses the antibiotics.   For case 1, this is a legitimate use.  No one seems to be arguing against this.  For case 2, if the patient is not infected, then how could using the antibiotics cause resistance?  There's no selective pressure for the bacteria to evolve resistance.  What am I missing? "
1834,How do hospitals know who is family?,"When a person is hospitalized, family members are legally allowed certain rights, especially if the hospitalized individual is unable to make his or her own medical decisions. But how does the hospital know who is family, and who is not?  For example, if Billy Jones were to be hospitalized and unconscious, and I were to want access to his medical records and control over his treatment, I could arrive at the hospital, provide state-issued ID identifying myself as Steve Jones, claim to be his parent, sibling or child, and have almost-legal access to his medical care. How does the hospital confirm that I am (not) indeed related to Billy Jones, and therefore (not) entitled to his medical information? "
1835,Do compounds absorbed through the skin bypass the liver?,"A friend of mine posted this on social media:     90% of what you put into your mouth is detoxed by your liver. What you put on your skin bypasses liver detoxification.   They mentioned that there was a study that confirmed this, but didn't link to it.  Is there any research that can back up this claim? It seemed strange to me - wouldn't anything in the bloodstream eventually get filtered through the liver? "
1836,"What does it mean for a medication to be ""hard for the liver"" or ""hard on the kidneys""?","We often hear that a medication is ""hard for the liver"" or ""hard on the kidneys"".  What does that really mean?  What about when a person takes vitamin pills?  Is that also hard on the liver or kidneys?  If not, why is that different?  Does it matter if the urine color changes dramatically like when a person takes a large B-complex vitamin capsule? "
1837,"Aged care, sensors and machine learning","What would be valuable to monitor for an aged individual. In order to be able to care for them better.  Im working on a open source project to provide remote monitoring of senior population.  The idea is to detect anomalies in behaviour and generate alerts if needed.  This is an implementation of the latest buzz word IoT [Internet of things].  Basically Im using AWS IoT platform, and a combination of arduinos and raspberry pis for sensors boxes.  The data collected is analysed searching for patterns and anomalies, That after anonymization can be shared for data science and research purposes.  So basically a bunch of wireless sensors can be used to measure different things like: . movement . temperature, humidity, barometric pressure . Gas, air quality . object temperature [like a stove/heater]  So one example is that after the system learns what is the normal time a person goes in and out of bed, it can detect an abnormal time staying in bed, and alert if necessary.  What things would be useful to measure in the aged care environment?  What insights about routines/behaviour are valuable for a carer, doctor/nurse, family member?  Thanks! "
1838,Can unruptured brain aneurysm symptoms come and go?,"Lets say a person has many symptoms of a unruptured brain aneurysm, but they're rather subtle, and seem to change from one symptom to another. They come and go. Is that possible? Or, if they were legit, would they all stay the same, with the same level of intensity? Lets say, the only constant thus far is a slight weakness in the left leg, and arm (which is always differing and fluctuating). "
1839,"If sphygmomanometer literally cuts off the blood flow, is it gonna kill the patient if pressure is not released?","As the title says. I just learnt how sphygmomanometer works. If it cuts off the blood till I decrease the pressure to the highest blood pressure, then shouldn't it cause serious problems? Even in simole words, heart attack is caused by the blockage of blood flow, isn't it? So is there any possibility that the measuring tool can be injurious? I am not a medical student, just a curious learner. I just thought it would be wise to know everything about it before I actually measure someone's pressure with it "
1840,Are medical risks memoryless?,"In determining your current health risk, does it matter what your past medical statistics were, or only your current medical statistics matter?  Thought experiment 1 (TE1): If there are two twins A and B, A has high blood sugar his whole life and B has had low blood sugar for the first half of his life and high blood sugar for the second half of his life, do they currently have the same risk of getting diabetes?  Thought experiment 2 (TE2): If there are two twins C and D, C has had high cholesterol for his whole life but recently got it down to normal levels, whereas D has always had normal levels, who has higher risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) currently?  Followup question:  If past medical statistics matter, is it the accumulation or trend that matters? For example, in TE2, if trend matters, C has a better trend and hence lower risk of CHD. If accumulation matters instead, then C has a higher risk of CHD because of past unhealthy statistics. "
1841,What criteria should I pay attention to when choosing a place to perform an MRI?,"What criteria should I pay attention to when choosing a place to perform an MRI? The MRI is done to diagnose the source of pain in an articulation (e.g., elbow tendinopathy).  One criterion is the number of teslas the MRI scanner has, as it might impact the quality of the diagnosis. What else should I consider?  I am only interested in criteria that could affect the quality of medical care the patient receives (e.g., one can ignore health insurance considerations). "
1842,Leg tightens/hurts when stretching in bed,"You ever wake up from a deep sleep, give your body a good stretch and think to yourself ""man that felt good!""? Well unfortunately for me, I've had the exact opposite happen a couple times in less than a week. This has also happened in the past but didn't think much of it, that maybe it was just a cramp.  The other night I awoke, stretched out my legs and my lower RIGHT leg tensed up so bad to the point it felt like the muscle just locked up. I tried to move my leg and foot around to alleviate the pain, which helped a little, but was hard to do so.  When I did get up a couple hours later for work, my lower leg was still very sore and hurt to put a lot of pressure down on it. Very similar experience this morning but it didn't happen as bad, I was able to feel the pain before it got too bad and stop myself from stretching. (You ever try to stop yourself mid-stretch in the morning? It's not fun...)  Anyways, I do have RLS so I don't know if that is adding to the situation. Although last night wasn't as bad as some nights. As well as an issue with my lower back with the muscle above my left hip. So I'm a little concerned on why this would happen. Do I maybe have a damaged muscle in my leg? It's never happened to my left leg, only my right.  "
1843,Why lower gauge needles aren't used to draw blood for blood tests?,"I am told that lower gauge needles (broader needles) are used during blood donation to minimize the damage to the RBCs. If the probability of damaging the drawn RBCs is greater with Higher gauge needles, then why are they used to draw blood for blood tests? Aren't RBCs checked during blood tests? "
1844,Questions about the use of Vitamin-E to prevent scar formation after blood donation,"I am told that applying Vitamin-E before donating blood prevents permanent scar formation. But won't it's effect be nullified when the Phlebotomist applies the disinfectant before drawing my blood? Is there any time prescription that it should be applied this many minutes before donating blood so that it may be fully effective?  Also, I hear that regular hair oils (such as almond hair oil) also have Vitamin E. Can they be used to prevent scar formation?? "
1845,How does variance in pH affect Candida Albicans?,"This is a topic on which I have observed similar arguments lead to precisely opposite conclusions.  Some people (health professionals/enthusiasts) claim that Candida Albicans (and similar species) changes from its yeast form into its harmful fungal form as a result of its environment becoming more acidic (lower pH), while others claim that it changes from yeast form into fungal form as a result of its environment becoming more alkaline (higher pH).  I am interested in knowing how changes in pH actually affect Candida and similar fungus.  What does the highest level scientific data have to say?  Have there been any systemic reviews/meta-analyses outlining a high level view of what we know about this subject? "
1846,Fructose from the Seminal Vesicles,"I have been contemplating how chronic gut-originating infestations such as Candida overgrowth and Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth (SIBO) link to symptoms in the male reproductive system, i.e., prostatitis, low libido, and poor orgasm quality (low ejaculation volume, low level of pleasure, etc.) (ED is not one of the symptoms in the picture).  I recently learned that the seminal vesicles produce fructose on a routine basis.  Obviously if bacteria or fungus are entering the reproductive system through large or small intestinal permeability, and are coming into contact with fructose, one would expect them to feed on it and become even harder to kill.  Is this a sensible hypothesis?  What is the intended purpose of the fructose produced by the seminal vesicles?  If the reproductive system was ""starved"" of this fructose due to bacteria and/or fungus competing for it, what symptoms would be expected (analogous to how, i.e., malnutrition can occur in SIBO patients due to bacteria stealing nutrients)? "
1847,How long of no salt diet before sodium levels return to normal and water retention stops decreasing?,"Adult male, 47, 77 kilos, 169 cm   I lost about 2 kilos in about 15 days from a daily 1500 calories healthy diet of fruits, veggies, lean meats, lots of water and no processed foods. I run 10 km a day and swim 20 minutes on off days.  That sounds too fast to be true...  So I suspect I had water retention, I used to eat tons of salt, like over 6000 mg a day.  Now I have cut down to absolutely no salt added.  Are the 2 kilos attributed to water retention?  Would it be ok for me to go back on a 500mg to 1500mg daily sodium intake or will the water retention come back?  Long question, but confused why I lost so much weight so fast! "
1848,Can i do pranayama when i am suffering from asthma?,"I have asthma. I heard that Pranayama is a remedy for asthma. So, what type of  precautions would I need to take? And in how many days would you see expect to see the results? "
1849,Magnesium in Cow's Milk,"I have read online that cow's milk is a good source of Magnesium.  Example: [website]However, the nutrition labels for various brands that I buy seem to never list Magnesium on the nutrition facts label.  Example: [website]Is the magnesium somehow lost in processing, or is the nutrition label simply incomplete, or what other reasons could explain the difference? "
1850,What effects would aspheric contact lenses have on eyes without astigmatism?,Aspheric lenses are used for treatment of astigmatism.  I am curious what effects might happen if they were used by someone without an astigmatism.   What effects would it have on visual acuity?   Would there be any image distortion?   Could it cause harm to the eye?  
1851,Do dietary potassium and sodium interact with eachother?,"I've read on some blogs that potassium helps lower blood pressure for people that have a high sodium intake. I've also read that these two nutrients interact with each other, so if you have more potassium, you have less sodium in the blood and vice versa. A few places tout that it 'balances out' your electrolytes.  If this is true, can a person with very high potassium levels (hyperkalemia) experience the symptoms of having low sodium levels (hyponatremia?) Or is it more complex than that? "
1852,Focus on breathing vs on heart beats,I do yoga and meditation since about two years.  Breathing is a very important according to all books and teachers I met.  During the last days I discovered that there is something with helps me much more than focusing on breathing:     Focus on your heart beat.   Listening to my heart beat (for example counting the beats) brings me much faster to the easy and relaxed feeling.  Does some know if there are scientific reports which analyse how counting heart beats help you to relax?  .... or what do you think? I guess a lot of readers already did listen to their breathing. How does listening to the heart beats help you to relax? 
1853,Who can release my medical records if I'm temporarily disabled?,"Say I have a severe allergic reaction, or cardiac event, or poisoning, or any of a billion other conditions that would require urgent medical care, but might leave me unconscious or otherwise unable to provide authorization to release my medical records to healthcare professionals. If I'm not a minor, can my parents authorize said release? Siblings? Spouses? Other family? Friends? "
1854,What does the highest level science have to say about vegetarianism/veganism?,"In her 2010 book GAPS Gut and Psychology Syndrome, Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride offers a very strong criticism of the health impacts of vegetarianism (and to an even greater degree, veganism, hereafter implied).  [website]Highlights include the claims that:   Vegetarian children are more prone to health problems than children who eat meat, particularly to psychomotor impairment and diseases of the blood. Vegetarians are prone to muscle loss and bone damage. They, on average, have lower muscle strength. Misguided vegetarianism is rapidly becoming a major cause of mental illness in our young people. What these young people do not know is that plant foods are generally hard to digest and they are low in useful nutrition. Foods from animal origin are easy for the human gut to digest and assimilate and animal foods provide concentrated amounts of all essential nutrients for human physiology. As plant foods are hard to digest and as they contain a list of anti-nutrients, which can damage the gut, digestive problems are the first symptoms which appear in those beginner vegetarians. They usually develop IBS symptoms, such as bloating, indigestion, constipation, diarrhoea and flatulence. If the person already has a weak digestion, moving to a plant-based diet is positively dangerous. As the digestive system becomes more and more damaged, it is less able to nourish the person, and so nutritional deficiencies develop quite soon. Vitamins B12, B6, B1, B2, niacin, essential amino acids, zinc and proteins are the first nutritional deficiencies a beginner vegetarian usually develops. Apart from causing malnutrition through the damage to the digestive system, plant foods are a very poor source of nutrients to start with. In a laboratory we can use all sorts of methods and chemicals for extracting nutrients from plants: methods which our human digestive system does not possess. Human gut has a very limited ability to digest plants and to extract anything useful from them. Nature has created herbivorous animals (ruminants) to eat plants and in order for them to be able to digest these plants, Nature has equipped them with a very special digestive system: it is very long with several stomachs full of special plant-breaking bacteria. The human digestive system is similar to the gut of predatory animals, such as wolves and lions: our digestive system is fairly short and we have only one stomach with virtually no bacteria in it. In fact, our human stomach is designed to produce acid and pepsin, which are only able to break down meat, fish and eggs. In short, our digestive systems have been designed to cope best with animal foods.   She references the book, The Vegetarian Myth by Lierre Keith.  She also goes on later in the book to list additional health concerns resulting from vegetarianism.  Needless to say, this contention is extremely controversial.  Many people still believe that vegetarianism, and even veganism, are healthy lifestyle choices if executed properly.  My question is, what does the highest level science have to say about vegetarianism/veganism?  Presumably individual studies have shown conflicting results, offering firepower for people on both sides of the debate.  Have there been any systemic reviews/meta-analyses outlining a high level picture of what we know about this subject from a scientific perspective, which would be more credible than a single study?  If there is a healthy protocol for vegetarianism/veganism, how does it address each of Dr. Campbell-McBride's concerns (psychomotor impairment, diseases of the blood, lower muscle strength, prone to bone damage, digestive problems such as IBS, lack of human-usable nutrients)? "
1855,Different reference ranges of thyroid antobodies,"This is related to the following thread:  [website]I have a question regarding the reference ranges of THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODIES and THYROID PEROXIDASE ANTIBODIES. A recent test of a one of my friend's gave:   THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODIES 3 IU/mL reference range less than 1 IU/mL THYROID PEROXIDASE ANTIBODIES 19 IU/mL reference range less than 9 IU/mL    I have found conflicting info about the reference ranges for the two antibodies, for example, Medscape  shows the reference ranges are 20 IU/mL and 35 IU/mL respectively.   Let me take THYROID PEROXIDASE ANTIBODIES to ask the question: if the same blood sample is sent to two labs the same day with different reference ranges, one is 35 IU/mL, one is 9 IU/mL. 35 is about 4 times of 9, can I say that the result value of the THYROID PEROXIDASE antibody in the lab with range 35 will be roughly 4 times of the result value at the lab of reference range 9? For example, the result value of the antibody at the lab of reference range 9 IU/mL turns out to be 19 IU/mL, then the same blood sample tested in the lab with range 35 should be roughly 4 times of 19, which is about 76 IU/mL? That way, the ratio of the result value to the reference range will be roughly 2 for both labs, i.e. 19/9, 76/35 are both roughly 2.   Or, I am completely wrong, the result value at the two labs should be roughly the same value, in the above mentioned example, both should be approximately 19 IU/mL? But then there is a problem for diagnosis, because one lab says it is within normal range, one says it is beyond normal range. "
1856,Interactions with Resalor (Prucalopride),"Resalor (Prucalopride) is not available in the United States, and thus no information for it is available on WebMD.  Is it safe to take both Resalor and Diflucan (Fluconazole)?  Is there anything one must avoid while taking Resalor (sunlight, etc.)? "
1857,Teenagers sleeping patterns and parents actions (force or let-go),"My daughter (15 years old) is very active and full of energy until she hits the sac. After five minutes she's out. This represents the perfect behaviour for bedtime process. But, she does this at 1:00 AM and sometimes even 2:30 AM and pretty much every night. The fact that she has school the morning after does not change that behaviour. Her overall productivity is not impaired. She can study math at 11:00 at night with very good concentration. She does not feel the fatigue.   She plays competitive Basketball, Volleyball, does ballet and pretty much every activity school offers. She's a pretty busy bee and feels great about it. In the morning, she a bit grumpy and her overall respect for her parents is declining. But I would say, this is a general pattern in teenagers.   Studies are clear, living this way for all her life will hurt her overall health.   Now what?   Should I force her to go to bed earlier? I have tried both, forcing and let-go and she won't change her strange habit. I like the let-go approach because my relationship with her is way better. If I force her to go to bed earlier, she fights back and argues...I loose every time. So the let-go choice is better but I feel very bad because she might be arming herself.    Is there any scientific studies explaining how to deal with this type of teenager? I think forcing brings so much frustrations on both parts that it may impair our overall health in the long run; even more than bad sleeping patterns. "

1863,Effects of eating too much salt,"I have been reading up on the effects of eating too much salt as I have literally been addicted to salt. I found out few side effects and it all matches up with my body. For example:   High blood pressure  Facial bloating  Frequent urge to urinate. Calcium deficiency  Hypertension    However, I found conflicting theories about urination. My question is if too much sodium makes your kidneys retains water, then what explains frequent urination?

1864,Late taking birth control pill,"I've been taking the combined birth control pill for the past two months, but I've been away (in another country) for Christmas and I forgot to take the third batch with me. When I got home, I took it immediately. Ideally, I should have taken it on Tuesday at lunch, but this time I started the batch on Wednesday at dinner.  I know I was only one day late, but can I get pregnant if I have sex now without a condom? How long should I wait until the pill takes effect? "

1866,Can optic neuritis be recovered 100%?,"I had inflammation in the optic nerve. There was deficiency in my field of vision. That's because of multiple sclerosis (ms).  Now,  I'm cured. My field of vision is good. I can see everything but the image that I see is a little bit darker. I find it is hard to read small text and I can't distinguish between a bright white color and a darker white color. I can't describe well because of my English but there are still some remaining issues with my right eye.   Will these issues remain for ever? If no, how long will it take to be fully cured?  I don't know if I should use my eye or relax it?    Should I close my eyes for 10 min per day or something like that to relax it and not to stress it? Or should I close the healthy eye and use the weak eye to activate my brain and the optic nerve?    "
1867,"Septic shock versus ordinary shock, symptoms?","Doctors seem to draw a distinction between ""septic shock"" and ""shock""?  From a symptomatic point of view, is there a way to tell the difference? "
1868,Why do I wake up so many times in the middle of the night,"I am 31 years old and for many years I wake up between 5-8 times at night and I have to switch from one side to another. I don't have any issue of falling back to sleep.   For me it feels that I am very agitated, other persons that slept with me told me this also (because I move a lot in bed)   Is this a sleeping issue ? If yes, what can I do about it ? What I want is just fall asleep and when I wake up is morning.    And I must say I am not stressed at all with anything and I am a very chill and relaxing person. "

1874,"Does ""Hot soup on a hot day keep you cool""?","I don't know if I should ask this question on skeptics.se first, but I guess I'll try here first:  When I was a kid in summer camp, they served hot soup every day during lunch, even during a heat wave, with temps in the 100s. The head counselor would announce ""Hot soup on a hot day keeps you cool"". Was he just trying to get us to eat or is it true? And, my main question is, how does it work? "
1875,"If someone has a bacterial throat infection (tonsillitis), can it be transmitted sexually (penetration)?","If there is an infection in the throat such as tonsillitis, where transmission is through the air ""in droplets when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes"", then does this imply that sexual penetration does not cause contagion? Why or why not?  "
1876,Is my ENT specialist ripping me off?,"I have been to an ENT specialist regarding my tinnitus problem several times, but each time she just insists on doing a hearing test, which appears to be the standard one where you put on headphones to listen to a range of sounds in a soundproof room.  After the test, she will just quickly scan the results, tell me that the results are fine, there is no cure for tinnitus, and then give me generic advice like ""try turning on the fan when you sleep to mask the noise"". My actual consultation time (not counting the hearing test time) is probably 15 mins or less, and I am charged $200+ for this (which is the standard rate in Australia apparently).  I have no clue what this test is supposed to show in the first place (the specialist claims it can detect whether my ears are damaged, is this true?). Isn't there a more indepth test to find out what is causing the tinnitus exactly? I can't believe that I am being charged $200+ just to be told to ""try turning on the fan"". Is there anything i can do at all, or should i stop seeing doctors about it since ""there is no cure""?  Can any medical professionals confirm if this is what a normal consultation with a specialist is supposed to look like?  Edit : Nobody has any clue? "
1877,Does drinking water increase the risk of shock with an open wound?,"First let me explain the scenario: Someone received an open wound, lets assume from a cut so no blunt-forced trauma meaning no reason to suspect internal injuries. The wound is bad enough that serious blood loss occurs. This happens in a remote place, so medevac and professional health care, are if at all available, delayed by days. A good first aid kit is available, but nothing like IVs. Initial wound care has been done (this is not the part I am interested in here, assume it has been done correctly).  Obviously the patient will need hydration. The question is whether hydration should be delayed or not? Broken down: Does drinking water have any detrimental effect in terms of stopping the bleeding and chances to get into a state of shock?    Typical unspecific first aid recommendations state to not give a patient anything to drink. If a reason is given for this, it is usually that the patient might need surgery. This is not an issue in this case. Also with food it is clear that it is a bad idea, as digestion ""needs blood"", same for water? There is a (seemingly dubious) discussion on Nairaland Forum where someone states that it will ""only dilute the blood"" and it is again more directed at internal injuries. And AFAIK it is a normal procedure to give a trauma victim fluids over IV before blood transfusions are available, so this seems wrong to me. "
1878,Sensitization and Energy Crisis in Myofascial Pain Syndrome,"In Travell and Simons' Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual, an energy crisis within a muscle is said to entail the release of sensitizing substances that could interact with local sensory and autonomic nerves. The following sketch from the publication depicts the situation as constituent of a larger, vicious cycle:    Which substances are those? Why does the body release them as a result of an energy crisis? "
1879,Diagnose angina (chest pain) by taking Nitroglycerin,"Since nitroglycerin relieves the symptoms of angina (chest tightness, heavy feeling), why not to diagnose angina with Nitroglycerin?   If the pain goes away upon taking Nitroglycerin then you have angina, if not - something else, right?  Sure, if taken by a healthy person, even a small dose can cause dizziness and a big headache, but it still less expensive then a stress test (which costs about $700).  Why do doctors test angina with a stress test? "
1880,How does a skull mend after a surgery?,"After a craniotomy, a large piece of a man's skull may be removed.  That bone piece has to be put back, right?  How to fix it and the bone piece can join the skull normally as it used to be?  There may be different methods as the bone piece's size may be different. "
1881,What can I do to minimize the chance of tooth pain?,"A tooth in the rear left of my mouth (I think it's my wisdom tooth) has temperature sensitivity; if I eat something very cold and I chew it with that tooth, it begins to hurt.   Due to some problems with my insurance, I can only get an appointment in mid February. From experience, I know that eventually the tooth will start to hurt by itself witouth any stimulus. My question is, what can I do to delay this stage of pain as much as possible? Should I brush my teeth an excessive number of times a day? Should I floss around that tooth often? Should I use mouthwash? Of course this is generally good advice, but I am afraid that since the cavity is so close to the nerve already, excessive brushing of teeth may help the bacteria dig towards the nerve faster.  EDIT: Perhaps I should mention, my tooth has had temperature sensitivity for 3-4 weeks already. "
1882,Is unsealed meat unacceptable?,"My question is really simple:   Is completely (vacuum) sealing leftover meat in the freezer absolutely necessary? I would always just use a plastic bag to cover the meat and fold it around couple of times so it's almost as good as sealed (usually grocery plastic bag is much bigger than the piece of meat) and have never had a problem with it last a decade or so I have been cooking.   But recently I got this new roommate who insists on me using special small plastic bags with sealers to use and he is being very paranoid, obsessive about it.   So my question is: Is he right?  "
1883,Eating egg shells: advantages v.s. disadvantages?,"I am an engineer and a scientist, but not in the field of medicine or health. Partial answers/comments are welcome.    Some of my family members start eating egg shells for the sake of obtaining nutrition like Calcium and minerals, once one egg a day before noon. By boiling the egg and microwaving the egg shells. Here are my questions:  1) Does eating egg help the consumption of Calcium and Minerals? And are they digestible in our body?  2) Is it clean, hygiene and healthy to eat egg shells? Concern that the Hen produces the egg and its metabolic waste through the same Anus? Can we get sick eating the egg shells, even if it has been boiled?  3)The egg shells are sharp, buy we can try to crush the shells through our teeth as much as possible. Once we consume the egg shells in the Esophagus and the stomach and intestines, more generally, in the Gastrointestinal tract, would the egg shells hurt or cut the organs by any chance? Would it be healed by itself, or would it potentially cause the cancer for any gastrointestinal tract? Also how likely it is a dangerous source of Salmonella / harmful bacterias?  4) How likely consuming the egg shells causes Kidney Stone and Renal Calculus? Say, if I am a young adult, or someone is a senior person?  5) There are known advantages of eating egg shells: [website]Again, Partial answers/comments are welcome. Thank you. "
1884,How can blood pressure be high but my pulse low?,"Someone whose blood pressure reads 188/134 with a pulse of 62. Read a few more times even after she woke up it stays in that area. Calm, not taking any drugs, normal weight, good health and not sick as far as she knows. What could cause this? Is it possible this can be her norm?  I was checking my vittles while sitting in a chair int he first paragraph as the diagram showed, but when I laid down they read 134/90 pulse 72 and stayed in that range. Second question would be can there be something that would effect the reading so differently just by sitting up?  Let me add a friend also used it and she was in the normal range while sitting. "
1885,"Are medical units pertaining to blood-tests, etc. standard/universal? Or vary from country to country?","Are medical measurements/units pertaining to blood-tests and urine-tests standardized across the globe? Or are they different?   (I thought the metric system was standard in science, but when I was talking to my French friend about a test result from a blood-test in Canada, he asked me to explain which unit it was because he was fairly sure it was different?). "
1886,Nociceptor sensitization and ACh release,"As a component of the Myofascial Trigger Point Pain Syndrome vicious cycle, sensitization of nociceptive nerve fibers leads to excessive acetylcholine release from nerve terminals, entailing sarcomere contraction by means of sustained depolarization of the postjunctional membrane. The entire syndrome loop is sketched below, as extracted from Simmons et al. (1999):  []  What benefit is the organism trying to reap by releasing ACh when nociceptors are sensitized? Does muscle contracture protects fibers from painful situations such as tearing?  Bibliography:  Simons, D. G., Travell, J. G., Simons, L. S., Cummings, B. D., Abeloff, D., &amp; Lee, J. (1998).

Is there some specific signs or nobody can say that?  Is there any statistic data about it (succesfully recovered patients etc)?  UPD (30.01.2017)  As for me, for today  I still got mydriasis.  Was trying treatment with pylocarpine eye drops, seems like it's not effective  UPD (07.02.2017)  Used more than a week pilocarpine 1%.  No effect  UPD (16.02.2017)  Noticed that appeared weak pupil reaction on light (used my phone flashlight to checking it).  In the dark pupil approximately 6 mm in diameter, when I turn light and set it close to eye - It shrinks to like 4 - 4.5 mm  UPD (10.03.2017)  No futher improvement. As I assume it won't get better for now, so. Take care of your eyes, guys, wear protection and be aware of the fireworks/party-poppers etc "
1889,Are color-blind and blind individuals able to dream in color?,"I know that individuals who have color-blindness or complete blindness, are not able to see as vast an array of colors as most. I do understand that they can distinguish shading (dark vs. light), but I'm curious if in their dreams if they are able to experience the vibrancy of colors (since it's not delivered via the optic nerve, but rather the hippocampus)?? Would they be able to recognize color if they did (if they had blindness or colorblindness their entire lives?)  I am by no means an expert in vision or dreams so I maybe misunderstanding this completely. Please feel free to correct me, and explain how color is perceived both through physical vision and then internally as in dreams.  "

For example, let's take a few common medications: acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.  Using these as examples, how would someone determine where in the body these medications are processed? "
1892,Do people from sunnier parts of the world show accelerated aging?,"A lot of medical evidence seems to point to there being a link between sun exposure and skin aging. Would this mean that on average, a 30-year-old from Arizona would have more wrinkles and uneven skin tone than a 30-year-old from Canada?  Is there evidence to back accelerated aging, or at least skin aging, in sunnier parts of the globe? "
1893,Medical professionals referring to 'left' and 'right': are they referring to my relative directions or theirs?,Given that they're facing me and I'm facing them.  Excerpt from radiologist report:     ... there is narrowing of the left neural foramen in comparison to the right ...   but whose?  Additionally:   Is there an international standard for this?

1894,How about afterwork jogging after drinking a lot of caffee?,"I drink many caffee in a workday to boost my work performance (normally 3-4 cups of middle strong arabica).  After work, I would like to do some jogging (maybe around 5 km) to boost my health.  Isn't it unhealthy? Isn't it even dangerous?  There weren't heart problems in my family in the last 3 generations. "
1895,How exact do I need to be for Penicillin every 12 hours?,"I have strep group A. My doctor gave me Penicillin V Potassium 500 MG to take once every 12 hours. It's 3 pm in my time zone, which means the next dose would be 3 AM. Does it make sense to take the next dose at like 11 PM or Midnight, and then again in the late morning, or should I take the next dose first thing in the morning (like 8 AM)? Or should I set an alarm and take it in the middle of the night (I'd rather NOT do that for the full course!)  Is there a general way to know whether to err on the side of slightly more or less often, or whether it should be very exact? "
1896,Research paper on living in areas with fresh air after living for more than 20 years in polluted area and impact on health,Are there any reasearch paper which shows impact on health for the person which is moving from the city with high air pollution to the areas with more fresh air (like countryside)?  Below are 2 main questions which I would like to know from the paper :  Can if affect health negatively/positively? Can our body get used to the polluted air and can such drastic change have negative impact on one's health? 
1897,Is regular water incursion into the ear considered beneficial or harmful?,"I've never been terribly comfortable getting water in my ear.  Others swear part of a proper bathing is rinsing ears out.  I can imagine cleansing could be important, I can also envision that water would alter wax chemistry/effectiveness.  What is the medical/scientific stance on this?  Are there common significant health issues that weigh it one way or the other, or is it generally shown to be of minimal difference... or alternatively considered an unanswered question as of yet?  I see this question got no firm responses, but hope that by limiting it to one specific detail, it would be something people can give more clear information about. "

1901,Are these eyeglass prescriptions the same?,"I recently had two eye exams done at two different facilities (one ophthalmologist and one optometrist). I received a prescription from each, and I'm curious if they agree with each other.  One prescription says (for each eye):  -4.00 : +0.75 x 180Â°   and the other prescription says (for each eye):  -3.25 : -0.75 x 90Â°   I know enough about the numbers to know that the first number is my main vision correction (for nearsightedness) and the second set of numbers is for an astigmatism, but are these two prescriptions equivalent? If they are equivalent, is one form ""preferred"" over the other by eyeglass labs? "
1902,How exactly can/do antidepressants treat ADHD?,"According to Wikipedia, antidepressants can treat ADHD, not just depression. How exactly?  So far I know, ADHD is caused partly (primarily?) by a dopamine deficiency. Do antidepressants do something to address the dopamine deficiency? What is it? Is it in the same way that stimulants or methylphenidate address the dopamine deficiency?  Wikipedia describes how methylphenidate treats ADHD:     Methylphenidate's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of   catecholamine reuptake, primarily as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.   Methylphenidate acts by blocking the dopamine transporter and   norepinephrine transporter, leading to increased concentrations of   dopamine and norepinephrine within the synaptic cleft. This effect in   turn leads to increased neurotransmission of dopamine and   norepinephrine. Methylphenidate is also a 5HT1A receptor agonist.[11]   Wikipedia describes antidepressants:     most antidepressants function by inhibiting the reuptake of   neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinepherine   Okay so both methylphenidate and most antidepressants inhibit reuptake of dopamine, but do those antidepressants also block the dopamine transporter, leading to an increased concentration of dopamine within the synaptic cleft leading to an increased neurotransmission of dopamine? "

How? It doesn't say anything like that on Wikipedia.  So far I know, ADHD is caused partly (primarily?) by a dopamine deficiency.  Vortioxetine/Brintellix is apparently a Serotonin modulator and stimulator. So what? How does this address the dopamine deficiency? "
1905,What causes incessant scrotal sac movements?,"According to Wikipedia, scrotal sac movements are to serve the purpose of regulating the temperature of the testicles. They are at slightly lower temperature than the human body, so the scrotal sac moves away when the temperature of the sac needs to be reduced, and move close to the body when it needs to be increased.   But do incessant scrotal sac movements denote that this thermo-regulation mechanism has collapsed? One of my friends is experiencing incessant movements of the scrotal sac, both in the above manner (close to and away from the body), as well as laterally. The same hasn't stopped for >48 hrs at least, and is not accompanied by discomfort of any kind at all. Is this normal, or does this denote some ailment?  (Since there is no discomfort involved, I though it was better to ask here first before advising him to visit a doctor.)  What causes these incessant movements? And, if there is an abnormality here, even then, what causes these incessant movements? "
1906,Does flu vaccine contain aluminium hydroxide adjuvant?,"I know that some vaccines contain aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant.   Do common flu vaccines contain aluminium hydroxide too? If yes, are there flu vaccines without aluminium hydroxide? "
1907,Do light boxes effectively mimic the effects of natural sunlight to produce vitamin D?,"Since moving to Seattle a few years ago, I'm wondering if I get vitamin D deficiency during the dark rainy months of the year. There are available light boxes that are used for treated seasonal affective disorder. Iâm wondering if these are also effective to prevent vitamin D deficiency when there is inadequate natural UV exposure.  Are artificial lamps able to substitute for natural sunlight to produce vitamin D in the skin? Or can this be replaced effectively by oral supplementation? "
1908,What's involved in an extraction of palatally impacted teeth?,"I have two impacted teeth (some combination of premolars and molars) that are on my palate. They are fairly close to my ""normal"" teeth: generally, the only impact of them on my everyday life is a slight pressure I sometimes feel on the sides of my tongue.  However, my dentist has suggested that I get these teeth extracted, as the gap between them and my ""normal"" teeth is difficult to clean and they serve no real positive purpose, and if they decay, they may affect the function of my ""normal"" teeth. I am partly hesitant to agree to this because of memories of painful tooth extractions in my childhood. That's a personal issue, but I also don't know how much such a procedure would involve (and cannot ask my dentist at the moment), and having more knowledge might ease some of the distress about possibly getting the procedure done. Thus:   Would such an extraction be done in a fashion similar to extractions of teeth grown in ""normal"" areas of the mouth? If not, what would be different? I found this on WebMD, but it only refers to impacted teeth:     If the tooth is impacted, the dentist will cut away gum and bone tissue that cover the tooth and then, using forceps, grasp the tooth and gently rock it back and forth to loosen it from the jaw bone and ligaments that hold it in place.  How much time would it take for the space in my palate to recover? Would I expect there to be any long-term ""scarring"" or similar side-effects, or would the tissue be able to grow back smoothly?  "
1909,Coworker regularly takes 30-45 minutes on the toilet - is this normal?,"I have a coworker who is known - behind his back - for taking excessively long in the bathroom. It's not unusual for our department to have to delay a meeting 10, 20, even 30 minutes waiting for him to return from the bathroom. He hasn't mentioned any health issues that would cause this. He claims that it simply takes him that long - he's not staring at his phone or reading a magazine or somesuch. He seems convinced that there's nothing out of the ordinary. Yet he regularly takes 30-45 minutes in the bathroom at a time.  Now, I know everyone uses the restroom a little differently. Some people wipe standing, others wipe sitting, et cetera. But the rest of our department agrees that the amount of time he spends is excessive.  So I have two related questions:   Is it within the range of normal for someone to regularly take upwards of half an hour or more in the bathroom, without a distraction being the cause? Is there/are there digestive health problem(s) which my coworker may have that could cause this, which he might not be aware of?   I guess the real question I'm trying to get an answer to is, is my coworker suffering from some health condition that he might not know about? "
1910,What makes Cialis cure Erectile Dysfunction permanently?,"Referring to this published paper Efficacy and safety of once-daily tadalafil in men with erectile dysfunction who reported no successful intercourse attempts at baseline.     The posttreatment intercourse success rate was 32% and 46% for   tadalafil 2.5 mg and 5 mg, respectively, in men with no successful   intercourse attempts at baseline.   My question is,   Is the above result believable? If yes, what makes Cialis cure Erectile Dysfunction permanently?  "
1911,Off-label prescribing of drugs,"Is off-label prescribing completely prohibited? Can a drug be prescribed by doctors for a disease or condition for which FDA has not approved it and hence this condition is not listed on the label? It is presumed that this disease or condition is not explicitly listed as a contra-indication, i.e. when the drug is clearly stated to be avoided since it may be harmful. "
1912,Can knowledge act as a trigger?,"I watched House Season 1, Episode 2 and it mentions a myoclonic jerk, I looked it up online and a couple weeks later, I started having one just before sleep. It's irregular, that is, not every night but it got me thinking. I've never had any myoclonic jerks before now.  Can knowing of a psychological/physiological condition cause it?   Or am I suffering from a suffer case of post hoc ergo propter hoc? Is there such common a thing as sudden-onset adolescent myoclonic jerks? "
1913,Time needed for vitamin B6 to reach the brain,"If you  take 250 mg of vitamin B6 orally as film-coated tablets, how long does it take until the greatest portion of it reaches the brain? When does the peak occur and how does the substance spread? Are there easy ways to extend this time by one hour by e.g. eating or drinking?  EDIT: Some words on my motivation. I'm trying to do the experiment described at the  Wiki page on Vitamin B6, which says that B6 increases the ability for dream recall.  "
1914,Does menthol have therapeutic effect on sore or inflamed muscles and tendons?,I use a gel for muscle pain after sport. Its active ingredients are listed as ibuprofen and levomenthol. The amount of menthol is sufficient to feel quite a lot of numbbness/burning for maybe half an hour after application.   The ibuprofen is clear. But I was wondering about the menthol. Does it have any direct physiological effect on the sore muscles and tendons? Is there evidence that it has synergies with the ibuprofen or that it is helpful for the same complaints? Is there a medical indication for having this combination instead of making a gel with ibuprofen only?  
1915,Can basil affected by Fusarium wilt be eaten safely?,I have a Basil plant that appears to be affected by Fusarium wilt. Let's assume my diagnosis of the plant's issue is correct. Can I safely harvest the whole plant and eat the leaves that haven't wilted yet? Does the fungus that causes Fusarium wilt affect humans at all? Sources are preferred.  
1916,Blood pressure in aorta vs. blood pressure in brachial artery,"Second year medical student asking.  Does the blood pressure at the root of aorta equal the blood pressure in the brachial artery?  I've heard it does but it doesn't quite seem to make sense as I'd think the blood pressure would be lowered the further it travels? Research indicates[1] that there is not the same pressure but I can't seem to find a ""why"".   [website]"
1917,What happens to the brain after a hemispherectomy?,"When one half of the brain is removed, what happens regarding the space? Does it fill with CSF? Is something man-made put in there to stop the other hemisphere from moving? Is the other hemisphere centred or does it stay where it normally is? "
1918,Astigmatism eyeglass lenses -- how much distortion is normal?,"I've been wearing glasses for near-sightedness for almost my entire life but only yesterday got glasses to correct my astigmatism. The world now looks rather distorted. To name two examples, my computer monitor appears to be a trapezoid (long side on the left) and table and desks appear to be tilted at nearly a 30 degree angle. Covering one eye or the other provides a view not subject to this distortion; everything is very clear.  I've been wearing these glasses about 3 hours now (on and off with my old ones as I feel eye strain and headache) and the distortion has not lessened.  Is this normal to this degree? Should I return to my optometrist immediately or should I wait a few days? "
1919,Are football (soccer) players more likely to have bow legs (genu varum)? What can be done to alleviate it if that's the case,"I play association football since a very young age. Now I notice that when I stand my knees don't really touch each other, which seems to be a typical symptom of bow legs (Genu Varum). Also, I'm a right-footed player, and I notice that now I tend to walk on the outside of my right foot/walk with my right foot pointing outwards with an angle larger than that of my left foot. When I watch football matches, I notice that this situation seems to be even more extreme in some professional players, i.e. when they're lying naturally on the ground they have their playing foot pointing outward much more than the other foot.  Has there been any study/research on this topic? Because when I search the web I find surprisingly little information on it. I suspect maybe my bow legs also have a genetic component to it but I'm not sure how much my football activities have had an influence on it. If it's true that football exacerbates bow legs, should I stop playing football? Or is there some other advice to alleviate the situation. "
1920,Maintain lactase while dairy free,"My 2-month old daughter has a cow's milk intolerance, so my wife has stopped consuming dairy. Ideally she'll be breastfeeding until 12+ months, so if it persists it could be a year before she has dairy again.  We have a friend who was dairy free with her son, and since she stopped breastfeeding and could consume dairy again she's had trouble with dairy products.  Is there any way to maintain lactase production while going dairy free, without having to consume dairy? Or a proven way to restore lactase production back to original levels when she does start consuming dairy? "

1924,What is the mechanism of action of Alphosol dandruff treatment?,"For around two years I have been using Alphosol 2 in 1, which is a coal tar extract based shampoo, to treat my dandruff which I believe is caused mostly by my Psoriasis.  Each application would leave me 90% flake free for up to 2 days.  Around 4 months ago it suddenly stopped working with no change in routine, amount used, or lifestyle.  What is the mechanism of action of Alphosol? Are there any studies to show that this treatment can suddenly stop giving results and what are the possible reasons for this, without the change in lifestyle or manner of application? "
1925,Benefit of closing atrial septal defect in adults,"Atrial septal defect is the most common type of hole in the heart encountered in adults. In many cases, the patients do not have any symptoms or difficulties. Are there any studies to show that there is an advantage of closing such defects (either surgically or using devices inserted through the skin) when incidentally found in adults? Does closure improves longevity or reduces future heart-related illnesses? Thanks for your insight.  "
1926,Can stem cell (msc) injections regrow damaged (articular / hyaline) cartilage if injected to joint?,"I have read that fixated stem cells (mixed with glue, growth factor and fixated in the cartilage defect under low oxygen conditions) will regrow into articular and hyaline cartilage with type II collagen. This type of cartilage is naturally present in joints and is very resistant.   ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149861  But what about stem cell injections? The stem cells with growth factor is injected into joint space and just let to float around.  Naturally cartilage defects in joints will heal with fibrocartilage and type I collagen, which is a lot weaker. So will stem cell injections (with growth factor) just promote the growth of more fibrocartilage and type I collagen in the damaged joint? Or the the very resistant articular cartilage? "

1928,What happens when you swallow larger chunks of food?,We're advised to chew our food many times before swallowing which breaks the food down into small chunks before we swallow and send it off down to our stomachs. What happens if we were to swallow larger chunks of food?  Does it take longer to digest because it will take longer for your stomach to break down?   Does this mean that you will feel fuller for longer?

1930,What is the current view on snacking,"Obviously performance athletes need to take on the calories, but is there any justification for snacking other than a missed meal?  If there is a need for a regular snack, doesn't this just indicate that meals should be larger or taken more regularly? "
1931,The effectiveness of Tongkat Ali in curing Erectile Dysfunction,"Tongkat Ali (EURYCOMA LONGIFOLIA) is a well-known supplement (especially) in Southeast Asia region, mainly by man to improve his sexual performance and desire.   Tongkat Ali is a kind of traditional medicine, which means that it is not rigorously tested on clinical side. So one would naturally be skeptical about the whatever magical claims Tongkat Ali sellers try to sell us.  My questions:   From my 5 minute Google search, Tongkat Ali is quite helpful in raising testosterone and libido level. But is this study conclusive? Is it a ""proven"" fact that Tongkat can really raise testosterone and libido level? What about Erectile Dysfunction? Is there any evidence that apart from boosting testosterone level, Tongkat Ali can also help to combat Erectile Dysfunction, and one can use as it a replacement for Viagra/Cialis over the long term?  "
1932,Can mold in a building cause fatigue?,"Pretty much what the title says, can mold in a building cause fatigue?   I've been working with the same company for almost 11 years. The first 2 and a half years I was at another building until they moved my department to another one. My health at that building was never in question, didn't seem like anything effected me at all.  I know ever since coming into this building my allergies started getting worse and my sinuses would bother me really bad as well. Literally I could walk into the building and my eyes would turn bloodshot red because of whatever is in the building.  Lately when I've been coming into work, I feel so tired/fatigued after being in the building for about 10-15 minutes or so, and it doesn't go away. I know they found mold in the building before when they stripped down the wallpaper.   Can mold in a building cause fatigue? "

Can I spread the virus to other parts of my own body (for example, to my nasal mucosa) by scratching?  I've googled and found contradictory information. Some sites say ""it can be spread to any part of the body""....so I'm confused.  I know shingles can be spread to other people, but can shingles on one part of my body be spread to another? "
1934,restoring a live tooth,"I just recently have had an amalgam filling fall out from a tooth after it has been in there for at least half my life and now there is a large hole in the tooth. I don't trust dentists because I read they have done bad things to patients such as give root canals which kills the nerve and/or crowns which prevents nutrients from entering the tooth.   What I want to do is repair the hole myself through diet since others have been (at least partially) successful. Some healed their cavities up and some claimed to have almost restored their teeth.  Since the hole began, I opted for more of a raw diet. I go for things like grass-fed butter, cocoa, water, vegetable juice, and I'm starting to now go on goats milk instead of regular cows milk.  I read that some things (like grains and legumes) have phytic acid which is supposed to deplete minerals from your body.   I also read that an acidic diet helps bacteria cause cavities.  Because of this, I'm lost. Am I doing the right thing with consuming what I mentioned? and how do I successfully incorporate vitamin C and regular meals into all this without making my mouth acidic enough for bacteria to make cavities? or will I just have to go with just a raw diet?  Any advice?  All the better if whoever responds has successfully regrown a tooth in the past. "

1936,Understanding cancer,"I am a lay person who wants a broad technical understanding of cancer including a survey of types, their etiologies, epidemiology, treatment modalities, prognoses, and current state of the art research.  I have spent hours searching but to my surprise I cannot find a book or documentary or other resource that surveys these topics in spite of the ubiquitous impact of this family of disease.  The best I have found is ""The Emperor of All Maladies"" which is really an historical account, and a few TED talks.  Popular books on cancer tend to be aimed at sufferers and an endless litany of miracle cures involving vitamins and diets.  I must be overlooking something.  How did you get up to speed on these diseases?  Surely I don't need to go to med school? "
1937,How often do I need to eat water-soluble vitamins?,"Preciser phrasing of the question: Do I need to consume the daily recommended dose of water-soluble vitamins every single day? Or is it sufficient if my consumption averages to the daily dose over a longer timeframe (and what timeframe would that be)?  I am aware that:   fat-soluble vitamins can be stored for a long time (months, possibly even years in some cases). water-soluble vitamins can (with the exception of B12) only be stored for a short time.   However, I have not found any clear answer to how short the ""short time"" for water-soluble vitamins is (a single day? A week? Not at all?). Answers I found are usually vague or inconsistent with each other (and also not sourced):     ""it is recommended that you replenish your stores of water-soluble   vitamins every few days"" [1]      ""you should try to get them regularly from your diet."" [2]      ""water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are not stored by the body. Since they are eliminated in urine, we require a continuous daily supply in our diet."" [3]   Background: I am currently trying to eat healthier than I used to. One thing I want to track is my vitamin intake to ensure that I do not develop deficiencies.  However, I am not sure how granularly I have to keep up with daily recommended doses.  Example: The German Nutrition Society recommends 110mg of Vitamin C daily for me [4]. Does this mean that I actualy need 110mg every single day in order to not develop a deficiency long-term? Or is it sufficient if I track my intake, e.g., on a weekly basis (requiring 770mg per week)?  I am aware that there are also differing opinions about the actual amount per day that is needed (e.g., 110mg in Germany, 90mg in the US [5]) but this is out-of-scope of my question. "
1938,What is the situation with CBD mixed with alcohol?,"CBD-infused shots, beers, and other alcoholic drinks have started to be produced and I have seen claims online that mixing CBD and alcohol can intensify each otherâs effects, resulting in changes in mood and behaviour, yet it can help with alcohol addictions.  One study of 10 people found that when participants took 200mg of CBD with alcohol, they had significantly lower blood alcohol levels than when they consumed alcohol with a placebo (Consroe et al. 1979), however, combining alcohol with CBD caused significant impairments in motor performance and alterations in the perception of time.     Compared to placebo, alcohol and alcohol plus CBD, but not CBD alone, produced significant impairments of motor and psychomotor performances, overestimations of time production and subjective responses indicating an accurate self-perception of their intoxication and deficits. The combination of alcohol plus CBD resulted in significantly lower blood alcohol levels compared to alcohol given alone, however, there were few differences observed between the pharmacological effects of the two alcohol conditions.   The point I am making is that the study found that although CBD being added to alcohol lowers blood alcohol levels the pharmacological effects of the alcohol remain the same as without CBD.  Although CBD does not have psychoactive effects on its own, it appears to me if I am interpreting the results correctly, that CBD speeds up the metabolization of alcohol, hense lower blood alcohol levels, yet the potency of lower blood alcohol levels is elevated too.  Which if you think about it could affect driver blood alcohol testing limits?  The last point I made about driver testing is beside the point (in a way), but what I am wondering is What is the scientific stance on addiction therapy with CBD?  References  Consroe, P., Carlini, E. A., Zwicker, A. P., &amp; Lacerda, L. A. (1979). Interaction of cannabidiol and alcohol in humans. Psychopharmacology, 66(1), 45-50. pmid: 120541 "

1941,Can a radiology technician spot an emergency?,"When medical imaging is performed, such as MRI, the results are usually relayed to the patient by the doctor who ordered it.  This is usually hours, days, or even weeks later.  But what if something emergently wrong is found on the imaging?  Would the radiology technician (the guy actually doing the CT scan or the MRI) be qualified/certified to notice anything off in the scan and send the patient to the ER? "
1942,Can there be advantages to polydactyly?,"I have been reading about polydactyly and found that surgery is only necessary in certain cases.  It depends on way the extra digit on the hand or foot is attached.  For example, central polydactyly (a very rare situation, in which the extra digit is on the ring, middle or index finger) requires early osteotomy and ligament reconstructions to prevent deformities, such as angular growth deformities.  What I am wondering about is the most common type which is ulnar polydactyly also called postaxial polydactyly (the extra digit is on the ulnar side of the hand, thus the side of the little finger).  Can there be advantages to having the extra finger? I am thinking of dexterity advantages for example.  This may sound a bit elementary, but with the fact that the extra fingers are generally removed in early years, I am wondering whether the person could be put at a disadvantage, or does having the extra finger cause problems with dexterity etc.? "
1943,Why aspirin dose is reduced in gastric achlorydia?,"Aspirin remains in unionised form in acidic [tex] but this unionised form is a diffusible form which is helpful in absorption across lipid membrane.    My reasoning almost tries to contradict the statement and find a suitable answer to the question as to Why aspirin doses are reduced in gastric achlorydia ? Here are some issues I need to resolve.     In gastric achlorydia there must be more ionic form of aspirin inside stomach so shouldn't we increase the dose to get more diffusible form i.e unionised form of aspirin for absorption to reach a specific plasma concentrations level considering that absorption also occurs from stomach?   Somewhere it was also mentioned (in my textbook) that solubility of aspirin increases at higher [tex] but I am not sure whether this is the reason for why the dose of aspirin should be reduced in achlorydia? cause some people suggested me that it was because of no ion trapping and hence more of the aspirin is available for absorption from intestine so dose must be reduced. In fact this question has got in my nerves and I don't know which is the correct answer/more significant one. The [tex] of intestine is basic which might give more ionisable form so decrease in absorption according to me but still I am not pretty confident to rule out the reason (related to ion trapping).     Background    I am adding this to tell how I came up with this question and ended up using this website. After I googled there was no such direct question mentioned above why aspirin dose are reduced in hgastric achlorydia?. This question was asked to us in practical classes and the answer given to us was that '...since in gastric achlorydia there is more ionisation of aspirin and hence no ion trapping so more of drug is available for absorption through intestine hence we reduce the dose of aspirin to get a specific plasma concentration level.' Ionic form of aspirin is more better absorbed in intestine than in stomach relatively as given here. But on the other hand our book states       Aspirin is absorbed from the stomach and small intestine. It's poor water solubility is limiting factor in absorption: microfilming there drug-particles and inclusion of an alkali(solubility is more at higher pH) enhances absorption. However, higher pH also favors ionisation, this decreasing the diffusible form.   - Essentials of Medical pharmacology 7th edition, NSAIDS and antipyretic analgesics, Pharmacokinetics, page no. 196.    Now here it mentions that the solubility is limiting factor so possibly it may increase available small aspirin particles for absorption at high pH in gastric achlorydia therefore enough to counter the effect of increased ionic form which decrease absorption.    I don't know which is correct explanation or if both correct, which one is more significant. "
1944,Do people with higher metabolism walk faster?,"I once came across a claim that people naturally walk at a speed that results in the least energy expenditure per distance travelled. Walking too slow would result in burning more energy for basic body processes, but running too quickly would burn extra energy in skeletal muscles.  If this claim is correct, then it should follow that people with higher metabolism would walk faster. Is this true? Have there been any studies on this subject? "

1946,Risk of HIV transmission during blood test?,"If I as an healthy individual get my blood work done for preventative reasons (health checkup etc...) at mass testing labs (Labcorp) or smaller local internal medicine practices - what are the chances of  having HIV transmission?  I know they take due care, but there are two concerns that come to my mind:   At mass testing corporations (like Labcorp). they have solid process and quality assurance, but the enmasse nature increases the chances of accident. At local internal medicine practices the situation is reverse. The statistics is low in number, which hopefully reduces the chance of accidents happening, but their process may really not be upto the mark.   What are your thoughts on this? "
1947,How much do our bodies heat up when we shiver?,"I think that this question is on topic for this site as it states human physiology and pathophysiology is allowed. If not then please let me know in the comments  and I shall delete this Question. Please let me know where this question would be better suited if possible.    A google for an answer to this mainly comes up with answers to why we shiver, and not to how much we heat up and what the different factors that affect this are.  For instance does height, weight, and/or body fat percentage affect this? How much energy do we use to shiver and does it burn fat?   I'm asking in relation to when we shiver randomly, quickly, not continuously, as well as when we are cold and when we our body goes under rapid change in temperature (i.e an emergency blood transfusion with cold blood).

1948,Are all Type 2 diabetes effects caused by sugar levels?,"I am trying to understand the various effects of Type 2, but I cannot seem to find a direct statement about this:  Are all the various symptoms/problems of Type 2 - neuropathy, heart health problems, etc. - caused specifically by the high blood sugar that results from Type 2, or are there some effects that are caused independent of sugar levels simply because you have this condition?  The base of what I'm trying to get as is whether or not a properly controlled sugar level will eliminate all problems from developing, or are there effects that occur over time that are caused simply by having Type 2, even if it is ""perfectly controlled""?

1950,"Does the special kind of diet really matter, when making a radical change?","Ok, so this might not be the most medically sound question, since I am a mathematician by training, but please bear with me.  The question originates from an observation I made from being confronted with many advocates for different types of diets (vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, paleo, gluten-free, sugar-free etc) and what baffles me is that no matter what the special type of diet is, there seem to be individuals that have very good success with less depression, less overweight, more vitality, less pills to take and so forth. These individuals are often presented by the respective advocates as good rolemodels.  This really struck me, since it indicates that it might not be the actual diet itself, but maybe something else. The only thing I could make out to be present across all individuals is the fact that these individuals got their life together at least with respect to their food intake. So could the correlation between a consequent and dedicated change of diet and the overall improvement of the individual be caused by psychological phenomena that stem from the new approach / mindest these successful individuals all share?  Is there any research on that? How could one even figure out something like this? "
1951,"Are homeopathy treated patients really experiencing ""Placebo""?","Today my mother told that a person who has heart disease is sound with an expensive homeopathic treatment. And I stopped explaining her that it's a placebo. I hear this claim a lot. In fact it worked for me!  Kurzgesagt talks about homeopathy, and says it doesn't work properly.  HRI says that homeopathy works for animals, who don't know what's placebo!  I once asked my homeopathy doctor that if it does do any harm. He said that yes, something that can cure a disease does do a lot of damage if overdosed. He also said that just the effect isn't as rapid as allopathy!   So let's reveal the truth. Is homeopathy really worth it?. What's homeopathy? Why placebo works for so many people? Does homeopathy really work? "

1953,does eating beans cold modifies their nutritional profile?,"I read here that if we prepare dried beans this way:  soak overnight. boil. put them in the refrigerator. eat them cold.   They would be digested in the intestines rather than in the stomach, acting as  resistant starch. If is this indeed the case, in which way would this alter the nutritional profile of beans in terms of calories and nutrient absorption?

Since they were going slow, I had to pass them but since one machine was throwing particles of macadam in the back of a truck, I'm wondering about the risk my daughter went through, breathing this air (probably full of small particles?).

1961,Can the active release technique help prevent or treat tendon injuries?,"Can the active release technique help prevent or treat tendon injuries?  I have read some pilot studies with small samples sizes (see below), I wonder whether there are more extensive studies, ideally RCTs or SRs.    {1} George, James W., Andrew C. Tunstall, Rodger E.

[website]  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if active release   technique (ART) significantly increases hamstring flexibility in   healthy male participants.      METHODS: Twenty physically active male participants with no current or   previous history of lower extremity injury received ART on the origins   and insertions of the hamstrings and dorsal sacral ligament. The   sit-and-reach test was used before and after treatment to determine   hamstring flexibility. Summary statistics were calculated, and pre and   post hamstring flexibility scores were compared using a related   samples t test.      RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the pre- and   posttest groups (mean pre = 35.5 cm, df = 19, SD = 7.56; mean post =   48.3 cm, df = 19, SD = 7.07; P = .0015). All 20 participants increased their sit-and-reach scores following the application of ART.      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a single ART treatment   increased hamstring flexibility in a group of healthy, active male   participants.   {2} Drover, Janice M., Dominique R.

Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics 27, no. 6 (2004): 408-413. [website]  Objective      To determine if Active Release Technique (ART) protocols could be used   as an effective way to influence strength and muscle inhibition in the   quadriceps muscles of athletes with anterior knee pain.      Design      Pilot clinical outcome study.      Methods      The sample consisted of 9 athletes (4 male athletes, 5 female   athletes) who were identified as suffering from unilateral anterior   knee pain. A Biodex dynamometer and the interpolated twitch technique   were used to determine isometric strength and inhibition in the   quadriceps muscles, respectively. The treatment intervention consisted   of the Active Release Technique treatment protocols for anterior knee   pain. The experimental leg and contralateral leg were tested   pretreatment and posttreatment, and the experimental leg was tested a   third time approximately 20 minutes posttreatment.      Results      Knee extensor moments were calculated by multiplying the moment arm by   the forces measured by the Biodex dynamometer. Percentage of muscle   inhibition was calculated by dividing the interpolated twitch torque   (ITT) by the resting twitch torque (RTT), that is (ITT/RTT*100). A   repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare   pretreatment and posttreatment values for strength and muscle   inhibition for the experimental and contralateral knees. The results   showed no statistical significance.      Conclusion      ART protocols did not reduce inhibition or increase strength in the quadriceps muscles of athletes with anterior knee pain. Further   study is required.  "

1964,Is exceeding the recommended time for ice application detrimental (delay healing) for soft tissue injuries?,"I read on [website]  RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation) is considered a first-aid treatment, rather than a cure for soft tissue injuries. [â¦] Exceeding the recommended time for ice application may be detrimental, as it has been shown to delay healing.[citation needed]   Is there any study that confirmed or infirmed that claim?  I am mostly interested in tendinopathies. "
1965,What if you blocked every sweat gland in your body?,"I have really sweaty hands, so I decided to put Driclor on it. However, once my hands got dry, my armpits started sweating like crazy. My doctor said this is due to compensatory sweating. So I was wondering, what would happen if you completely blocked every sweat gland on your body(not that I'm going to)? Would you explode or something? "
1966,Effects of hypophosphatemia on DNA,"There is a lot of supportive evidence that its role in ATP results in much of the clinical manifestation of hypophosphatemia, but I was wondering about the other roles where Phosphate is an important part of nucleic acids in DNA, and RNA so what happens to these in hypophosphatemia?  How is cell membrane or critical component of cell signaling (phospyrlation or component of cAMP affected?) "
1967,Is combining silicone plasters and silicone gels for scars effective?,"I have a question. As far as I know, silicone gels and silicone plasters (aka sheets or patches) are used to optimize wound healing and minimize scarring. I purchased a silicone plaster Mepiform and silicone gel Strataderm against the scars.     Can they be used simultaneously to enhance their positive effect? That is, first you put the silicone gel on skin, let it dry and then on top of the dried gel you attach silicone plaster.   Will it be more effective? "
1968,Are there detrimental health effects to drinking old tea?,"I've come upon a box of teabags which is kind of old - it says ""Best Used before June 6th 2014"" - so maybe 4 or 5 years old. The ingredient list only says ""black tea leaves"", nothing else. It was sitting on some cabinet shelf and is still half-full.   Does old tea ""go bad""? Is there an actual problem drinking it? "
1969,Chagas disease: stages,"As far as I understand the stages of Chagas disease are three: acute, indeterminate and cronic.   Question  Supposing someone is on third stage, does it mean that he/she has previously go through indeterminate stage?   In other words: Is indeterminate stage a necessary condition to cronic stage? "
1970,Should I tolerate passive smoking?,"I have a phobia against tabaco smoke. I constantly try to avoid smoke by holding my breath or distancing myself from smokers. It's a significant stress to me. As well as an inconvenience in social situations and daily routine. I am considering trying to tolerate it in crowded areas and while talking to friends. As an amusing anecdote, I love winter as it's too cold around here to hold a cigarette :) In tram stations, I'd have to tolerate being within 1meter of a smoker for 20min a day. My friends take smoke breaks a few times a day, depending on our schedule. They smoke 1 cigarette or more. I am either on a crowded balcony where most students take smoke breaks, usually taking a leave of abscence from the conversation after a few minutes. Or in a yard trying to make myself heard without shouting.Perhaps I can eliminate the stress and still avoid passive smoking. In which situations can I tolerate passive smoking, such that I avoid health risks? Also can you point me to any relevant scientific articles or government recommendations? I'm looking for an argument against passive smoking outdoors, if any. I am not satisfied with the answers I found as they are too general. I'm looking for an answer to my particular case. Certainly passive smoking is harmful in a closed space, but what about open space? My point is, risk varies by exposure. "
1971,Sensation of something tingling on head-hair - not itchy,"I occasionally have this sensation that feels like something is crawling on a specific place on my head hair (left side about 2"" above ear). It comes and goes, no certain time or periods to forecast when it will take place or leave.  It's also very subtle, so I can sense it when I'm relaxed in a quite environment. I have been experiencing this for months.  It's not itching or hurting, just a bit of tingling. Merely feels that something is doing its business in there. But it's always in the exact location.  Can my scalp be inhabited by parasites or lice? How can I really inspect what is going on in there? "

1974,Probiotic doses - comparing CFU measurements,I have a probiotic that says it has 8 billion CFU (colony forming units) per capsule.   I'm reading a paper on this same probiotic that discusses a study where the participants took 11.8 log CFU per day.  How do I compare these two dosages? How many CFU is 11.8 log? 
1975,About contraception pills efficacy,"It is supposed to take ""placebo pills"" when a woman is on her menstruation and just only the first time she start taking contraception pills is mandatory to consume a pill on the first day of the period, vice she was always taking 21 pills, the new period started and she consumed the first pill of the new box every month, when it is advisable to take a rest or utilize the placebo pills (the seven other pills).  What could happen if the girl is taking contraception pills during her period time? Would the efficacy of them be diminished? "
1976,Is taking x-rays during a dental check-up harmful?,"Usually, I take x-rays once a year with my dentist.  Is this harmful?  Am I at risk of getting cancer?  Sometimes, I have to see a dental specialist, such as an periodontist, and the assistant to the periodontist would proceed to take ""full-mouth x-rays"", so that instead of taking an x-ray from each side of the jaw, they take about 15-18 x-rays from many different angles of my jaw.  I feel it's dangerous / gratuitous -- and that those excessive amount of x-rays is just used to train the assistant, and that it's unnecessary for the periodontist to make an evaluation of my teeth and gums.  Are ""full-mouth x-rays"" harmful?  Thanks, "
1977,Which website's calorie intake threshold to believe?,"I'm 5'10 (178cm) male who is lightly active and weigh 55kg (122 lbs), and want to maintain this weight, thus have consulted some websites out there that have got 'calorie calculators' to determine the calorie intake per day required to maintain weight. However, the results have varied.  www.caloriecalculator.net and www.cancer.org say 2159 calories per day  www.calorieking.com says between 1800 and 2000 calories per day  www.livestrong.com says 1890 calories a day  The range seems pretty large. Which figure seems most accurate? "
1978,"How often is ""X times a day""?","Some pills which say to ""take every X hours"", and others say to take ""X times a day"".  How long should the break be between administrations of pill #2?  For example, ""take 4 times a day"" means to take it every 6 hours, or every (24-8)/4 = 4 hours? "
1979,Getting rid of white spots on front teeth,"Wearing braces can lead to some very visible color changes.  Very often some parts are darker than others and ""white spots"" appear.  Heavy brushing of the teeth is not a good idea since this will not work well and also erodes too much of the enamel.  If a professional teeth whitening performed by a dentist is not preferred or not an option then other remedies that are often recommended include special toothpastes, sodium bicarbonate or over the counter whitening strips.  These options may be unsafe or ineffective.  What options do exist to improve the aesthetics of the teeth in such a situation? Mainly this means: how were these spots formed and how to get rid of the white spots safely? "
1980,What causes some lacerations to form hypertrophic scars?,"What feature of a skin injury (for example, depth of laceration?) determines whether scars will form as hypertrophic or not?  For this question, I am differentiating hypertrophic from keloids, which is a different process.  An example is below of the same individual with both regular and hypertrophic scars.   "
1981,Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity,"Ulcerative colitis can be endoscopically assessed and characterized as 'active' or 'inactive'. I was wondering how those disease states are related. Do patients with UC regularly alternate between active and inactive states? Or are there periods of activity flaring up, etc?   Context: Researcher looking at a dataset: GSE59071 from Vanhove et al. 2015. They have both of those states, but they don't mention the process behind the original diagnosis/significance of disease activity.

1982,"Does it make sense to apply bio-oil products such as vitamin E (oil), Aloe vera, etc. on the scar to minimize scarring?","I have 1-month old scar on my face. Now I am using silicone gel against scars. On the internet I found that in such cases, it will also be useful to apply such products as vitamin E (liquid form), aloe vera gel, petroleum jelly, coconut oil, lavender oil, linseed oil, honey and other products containing bio-oil.     I have a question. Does it make sense to apply these substances on the scar to minimize the scarring? Does it actually work against scars? Some sources write about a significant positive effect against scarring while others state that such products have not been shown to be of much benefit.  "
1983,What causes Diabetes mellitus type 2?,"We have questions on how to prevent or on how to reverse diabetes type 2. There are also some minor details about isolated potential causes.  No question to the overall causal explanation.  Our friendly neighbours at the wikipedia write about Diabetes mellitus type 2:     Diabetes mellitus type 2 (also known as type 2 diabetes) is a long-term metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin.   But looking at the section for causes there are just listings of contributing factors: lifestyle, genetics, and medical conditions.     Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting almost 18 million Americans. While most of these cases can be prevented, it remains for adults the leading cause of diabetes-related complications such as blindness, non-traumatic amputations, and chronic kidney failure requiring dialysis. Type 2 diabetes usually occurs in people over age 40 who are overweight, but can occur in people who are not overweight.    That leaves one wondering:  Is this wikipedia definition exhaustive? What is the main cause of diabetes type 2? Is this even the right way to phrase this question? Are their multiple main causes? If yes, how are they related to one another?   What causes Diabetes mellitus type 2? "
1984,Farts coming out of the mouth?,"I have read in this link that farts can come out of your mouth. But I don't know how much I can trust the internet, and I am no expert in medicine or human health whatsoever.  Is this true? And if so, can someone explain it a bit better? How can the gas go all the way up to the mouth again? "
1985,"After a dog bite, why are vaccines given in multiple injections rather than a single injection containing multiple vaccines?","When a dog bites a person, why is it necessary to take about 5 injections or needles? Why not just one big injection?  Do they all have the same medicine? Or does each one have its own medicine?   Is the time between them important? I see on the internet different periods such as (the first one should be taken immediately, the second one is after 3 days, then once per week) and you can find other different sequences.  My research is:   The immediate vaccine is human rabies-specific immunoglobulin (HRIG) and this explains the first shot. Vaccination is also for Rabies, Tetanus, and maybe some other bacteria. For me, this means one or two more injections. One for Rabies and Tetanus and One for the other bacteria or whatever the combination is. This is a total of 3 injections including the immediate one. So why the 5 injections? I mean what could be the other diseases/bacteria?  Is it possible to take all the vaccines through one big shot? I know it depends on the amount/size of each vaccine. Or maybe it is required to wait for a few days to reduce the side effects or whatever the reason is, right? This source compares dog vaccine to human vaccine so it's not that related and I can't find useful sources.  I'm not talking about inventing new techniques like this one. I just wonder why don't we combine/mix the 5 or 6 injections together. The number of injections vary from one case to another. That's why I think that only the first injection has a different solution but the other successive injections have the same solution/medicine, right? At the same time, some sources say these successive injections are different because they are for different medicines like Tetanus...etc. So I got confused. I knew the answer to the third question. Yes, the time is important and a delay of 1 to 2 days is considered acceptable as your antibody levels will still be high enough to fight off an infection.   "
1986,Is menstruation manageable?,"For individuals with heavy flow, menstruation can be extremely taxing.   Are there ways of managing duration and heaviness of the menstruation?  I know that ibuprofen is prescribed, but how about other medication?  If there's a finite amount of tissue to shed within the uterus, then it would seem that speeding up the sloughing or shedding process would reduce the menstruation period.  But I am not sure how hormones play a role in this and if they purely dictate the process or if perhaps the hormones respond to the uterine waste that needs to be removed.  (Chicken and egg scenario.)  Can the menstrual cycle be managed? "

1989,Reheated pasta GI difference,"I've read a couple of things claiming that allowing your pasta to cool and then reheating it significantly changes its glycemic index resulting in a much lower blood sugar spike after eating.  This sounds too good to be true to me, I enjoy eating pasta and would choose to eat it on a more regular basis if it was less likely to result in that 'post-lunch tiredness' due to no sugar crash. Also, considering my day job is sitting at a desk all day, would this likely aid weight loss (or rather, reduce weight gain)? Is this a big deal?  Source article: [website]"
1990,Is Kiwi low or high fructose?,It's ridiculous: on some websites I see info that it is low fructose and on the other it is high fructose (not even moderate). Here for example it goes as high in fructose. And here it goes as low. Are there known reliable source ? 
1991,Different types of nociceptors in muscle vs connective tissue?,"TL;DR  I'm wondering if there is any difference in the types of receptors that exist for muscles vs connective tissue. I ask because I compete in sports where I definitely strain/injure muscle, and I also occasionally strain/injure tendons, and the pain feels completely different.  Muscle pain is sharp, immediate and activates when I move the injured muscle, and makes the area sore to the touch (e.g. I try to massage it). As soon as I stop moving or touching the muscle the pain is gone.  Tendon pain is radiating, burning ""toothache-like"" throbbing pain that sets in and becomes inflammed about 2 or 3 minutes after I move the area that is injured and sustains for several minutes thereafter.    I'm an armwrestler (yes its a real thing :-) ). Before that I played racquetball very competitively, and before that I was a gym rat/wannabe powerlifter, and in high school I was an alpine ski racer. I've also played soccer, baseball, football and for a short while wrestled in junior high. I've been in the gym pretty much my whole life.  I can say that no sport inflicts as much unique pain on the body as armwrestling. With armwrestling, after a single practice, your arms are throbbing; we call it the ""toothache pain"" because it feels just like the stabbing, throbbing pain you get from a bad toothache. Except instead of just a single, localized area (like a single tooth), its a deep, burning throbbing that starts in your shoulders and goes all the way down to your wrists. On both arms. For about 2 hours. Then it takes about 7 - 10 days to heal and not flare up again, and then you can go back to practice again.  This is a much different type of pain than the typical muscle soreness you get from gym lifting or even intense powerlifting. With gym lifts, even if you go extremely hard (1 rep maxes or just a few reps at very heavy weight) you'll get DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) about 48 hours later, and you'll be very sore, but no throbbing burning aching pain. It's very different.  I'm looking to understand why.    After talking to some more educated armwrestlers in the community, the predominant theory is this:   Gym lifting, even lifting heavy, is still a positive exercise for your muscles. They contract, you lift the weight (quickly if its easy, slowly if its difficult), but your muscles are working and doing all the heavy lifting/work the entire time, throughout the entire range of motion for the exercise Armwrestling, on the other hand, is mostly either a static or a negative exercise. If you're armwrestling someone who's near your level or capability, it may take up to a minute or longer to ping them. That means your arm and wrist aren't really moving all that much: they're static/isometric and holding on for dear life, all the while your muscles are under 100% maximum strain. Watch an armwrestling video like this one and you'll understand why! Or, if you're going up against someone who's better than you, its a ""negative"" movement: your arm and wrist will fail against them as they pull your arm towards the pad, despite your muscles again working at 100% maximum effort.   In all cases, with armwrestling, your muscles are at 100%. They can't do any more work. They cannot contract, they're simply either holding in a locked position (static) or they are slowly failing as you begin to lose (negative).  The theory is that this is when your connective tissue (primarily tendons) takes over. Tendons hold muscle to bone. If a force is being exerted on the bone and the muscle is already at 100%, the force will start being applied moreso to the tendons that are no desperately trying to hold that muscle onto the bone and to not detach. This places enormous stress on the tendons, causing them to stretch and tear, just like muscles do when you lift weights at the gym like a normal human being. As such the theory is that armwrestling aggravates both muscle and tendons. Since no other sport is really like this, none of us walk into the sport with tendons that are well-conditioned for it. Tendons take longer to health then muscles, which is why most armwrestlers can take up to 2 weeks to fully recover from a single practice.   So first, before I get onto the real core of my questions, I ask for either clarification or confirmation that my assumptions/theories are either correct, greatly misled, or somewhere in between!  But assuming I'm more or less correct so far:  My Question  Again, I'm looking to understand the fundamental difference in the type of pain between armwrestling and normal gym lifting. When you exercise in a gym, your muscles get sore for a few days, heal and then you're good to go. While they're sore, it hurts to move them or exert them a lot, they can be sore or tender to the touch, etc.  With armwrestling, its literally a burning, radiating, throbbing toothache pain up and down your whole arm for several hours after practice. And then, for the next 7 - 10 days, if you try to exert your arms by any real amount (you have to shovel snow, mow your lawn, go swimming, etc.) the throbbing comes right back.  My theory is that there might be different types of pain receptors (""nociceptor""?) in the tendons and ligaments in your arms that are activated when injuries to your connective tissue occurs, and that perhaps the brain is just trained to interpret these receptors firing as a throbbing pain. Whatever pain you feel when you get a bad toothache might also be activated by similar receptors.  Is there any medical credence to this theory? If so, can someone explain it more in depth or point me to some decent reading? And if my theories are total junk, can you offer anything to replace it with? Thanks in advance! "
1992,Is it ineffective to drink cold water to cool down when you are warm?,I have heard many times that drinking cold water when you are warm is not an effective way to cool down.   The most common supposed reason that I have heard is that the body needs to spend a considerable amount of energy to warm up the water because the cold water initially cools down your body very locally. The net effect should therefore be that your body gets cooler from room temperature water than cold water.  Is this true or just bogus? Is cold or warm water best when you are hot? 
1993,How does breastfeeding protect the mother's bones?,"Every time that I look up breastfeeding benefits for the mom I get these main 3 along with others:   Decreased chance of breast cancer Decreased chance of ovarian cancer Decreased chance of osteoporosis(put another way, increased bone density)   This seems counter intuitive though, not the cancer protection but the osteoporosis protection. Your body takes calcium from your bones when calcium is in increased demand. Typically a mom won't eat enough calcium to prevent this bone breakdown. In pregnant women this is significant because you have an unborn baby inside you whose bones are being ossified.   But it would seem to me that breastfeeding would also increase the bodily demand for calcium because an ounce of breastmilk contains 10 mg of calcium and a breastfeeding woman can produce up to a liter of breastmilk a day. That is 33.814 ounces or 338 mg of calcium for enough breastmilk to feed the mom's baby/babies. That is a lot of calcium just for breastfeeding. Not to mention that the needed intake for anyone between 18-50 is 1000 mg of calcium. This means with the calcium needed for breastmilk production, you get a net intake of around 750 mg of calcium. That is a net deficiency so you get bone breakdown.  So it would make sense then that the ideal calcium intake for a breastfeeding woman would be 1350 mg of calcium due to the amount of calcium in breastmilk and the fact that a woman can produce up to a liter of breastmilk in 1 day. That way you don't end up with bone breakdown.  So if up to 338 mg of calcium goes into making breastmilk, why do breastfeeding women with an intake of 1000 mg of calcium which is what is needed for the average 18-50 year old human, not get osteoporosis but instead increased bone density? Do oxytocin and prolactin somehow divert more calcium towards bone(like do they increase active vitamin D levels) to offset the fact that about a third of the calcium that is needed is diverted to the breasts for milk production?  Because I don't see how you could possibly end up with an increase in bone density when 1/3 of your required calcium is diverted into breastmilk for the baby. "
1994,Why do skin calluses not heal sometimes and remain tough until they fall off?,"Bar exercises such as pull-ups, toes-to-bar etc. usually cause skin calluses on one's hand, just below the place where the fingers are connected to the hand, e.g.:.  So the skin in these areas hardens, but if you let it rest for a few days, these calluses disappear and the skin returns (more or less) to its original softness and flexibility.  However, I've noticed that if the tough skin is torn in such a way that it becomes sort of ""skin flap"" (i.e. attached to the palm only on one side of the callus), then it remains hard and does not revert to its original softness, until it falls off. Why is that? What makes a flap of skin to toughen irreversibly? "
1995,Is the Zimnitsky Urine Test used in the West at all? What tests are used instead?,"The Zimnitsky Urine Test (ÐÑÐ¾Ð±Ð° Ð¿Ð¾ ÐÐ¸Ð¼Ð½Ð¸ÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼Ñ) is a test used in Russia to assess the kidneys' capacity for concentration of urine.   Here's one English-language description (choose ""select all"" because some of the text is the same color with the background). Here's another English-language description.   The patient's urine is collected over a period of 24 hours in 8 different containers (one container for each 3-hour period), and then the samples from each of the containers are passed to the testing facility, along with the info on the amount of urine passed during each of these 3-hour periods, and the amount of liquid consumed over the day. As I understand, specific gravity is calculated for each period.   Is it used at all in the West? In Wikipedia, only the Russian-language article exists for this kind of test. Why is that so?     I recall that it was quite a chore to collect urine in these 8 jars when I was in a hospital with diabetes. Maybe some other test(s) are used instead of it in the West?    P.S. It is still used in Russia. I don't think it's used for blood sugar assessment, I think it's more for the assessment of kidney function. I don't know much about kidney function or its assessment, and a doctor recently advised me to take this test because my urine had an extremely low specific gravity, so I started reading up. I wanted to read up on this in English, because there's usually more in-depth info on tests and their interpretation in English, but to my amazement I only found information in Russian, so I asked this question here.

1996,Is it possible to get cancer after taking iron supplement of 100mg for 4 days,I took iron supplements of 100mg ferrous ascorbate for 4 days but since day 3 I experienced black stools and strange pain during bowel movement plus got hemorrhoids so I stopped it immediately after day 4. My hemorrhoids subsided after stopping the pills.  This was about a month ago but now when I google I read some linkage between iron supplement and cancer [website]Can I get colon cancer after taking supplements for just 4 days? I read symptoms of colon cancer and one of them is constipation I experience constipation once in a while but no blood in stools.  Screening for cancer is very expensive. From your experience do you think cancer could likely have happened during those 4 days? 
1997,health condition and chronic health conditions,"Are the two sentences in bold contradictory? (Specially caused health conditions should include chronic and acute conditions.)  Approximately 10 % â15 % of U.S. (between 10 and 20 million) children are estimated to have an ongoing physical health condition (Bramlett &amp; Blumberg, 2008)*. Although most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with a childâs usual activities, at least 10 % of children with physical illness have symptoms severe enough to have an impact on their daily lives (Bethell, Read, Blumberg, &amp; Newacheck, 2008)**.

1999,"How is moistness balanced with avoiding overgranulisation, in wound care?","Assuming that infection, bleeding are taken care of, and/or for the purposes of this question can be ignored:  I am trying to gain an understanding of an aspect of wound care I don't yet really understand fully. This is roughly what I know that is relevant:  In a moderately serious wound, say to a limb or extremity, where some tissue was lost below skin level, the current advice is that moist healing will be faster and better quality than dry healing. The damaged tissue regenerates, and part of this process is the growth and vascularisation of granular tissue. Granular tissue can overgrow and lie proud above skin level, and may in some cases need to be cauterised or reduced if it does, so that epithelial healing and new surface skin can grow appropriately.  What puzzles me is, there is clearly a balance in wound management, as the tissue begins to regrow. On one hand, it must be allowed to heal in a moist environment, for quality and speed; on the other hand a moist environment promotes granular tissue which may then overgrow.   Presumably therefore as the regrowing tissue approaches or reaches natural ""skin level"", the wound environment must be modified slightly, so it's still moist enough to heal nicely, but no longer promotes any further granular development.  At this point, however, the healing wound may still be open flesh and vulnerable to dryness, UV, infection, dressing adhesion, and damage, and may even still be weeping/exuding in some cases. Despite this, the dressing and treatment must start to ensure isn't unconditionally moist. Rather, it must remain moist enough to heal nicely, but ensure that the wound environment is no longer favourable to further granularisation, and instead begins to develop an epithelial layer.  But how is this change achieved? What is required in wound care, and what must be modified in the wound dressings/environment, from that point onward, to encourage this? "
2000,Is bmi a good indicator of health,"My BMI is 30.4  and it says I am obese. But I dont look obese. One doctor was surprised at my high BMI value.

If I have reason to think that someone I know has an immune system that is exceptionally good (they are very rarely sick, almost never get infections etc., rarely enough to think this is above average),  can they somehow test this, as it might be useful for immune system/genetic research (I have reason to believe this is genetic)?  How can I find someone that studies the immune system and will be interested in studying this person's immune system to see if it really is exceptional and if it can somehow help research in that field?  "
2002,What is asking patients whether they know the current day for?,"After a minor car collision (front airbags deployed), an ambulance arrived to see if I had sustained any injuries.   One of the questions they asked was 'What day is it?' as in Monday, Tuesday etc.  What is this testing for? Possible concussion? Shock? "
2003,What would cause a fat face but skinny body? Collagen?,"Trying to understand how this would occur - why would someone's face be fat (either in general or compared to body) when the rest of their body is toned/lean/skinny. Ive observed this personally for years and in others -  I read that excess sugar can cause excess collagen in face, thus causing the ""bloating"" look. What else might be the cause of a disproportionately fat face/neck when the person appears skinny everywhere else?   If they consume a high amount of one food (for example nuts)- could this be a permanent state of allergic reaction?   How would one narrow the factors to determine what is causing the ""face fat""? "
2004,Does applying ice patch to flea bites help heal faster?,"Applying ice patch is a command remedy against flea bites help heal faster?.  Example [website]  If you have a cold pack that you normally use on sprains or bruises, you can also put that on the area affected by the flea bites. Ice also works fairly well, although its a bit wet for my liking!   Does applying ice patch to flea bites help heal faster, or does it just temporary alleviate the pain? "
2005,What is Surya Namaskar Yoga?,Can we cure hormonal imbalance by doing Surya namaskar? and what is the best time and place to do it ? 
2006,What is the best way to recover from all-nighters?,"Basically I'm curious as to whether or not sleep loss or gain is purely additive. I'm not sure if this is even the right way to phrase this question, so I'll give an example. Say someone stays up to 3AM every day for a week. If they then get one or two days of normal rest (8-9 hours, say) will they be mostly functional again? Or would their bodies need to gain back all of the hours (likely through a day or two of a LOT of sleep), to flush out all of the toxins that have built up in their brain from staying up? (I have a very loose understanding of the importance of sleep.)  To summarize, after pulling many [close-to-]all-nighters, would a day of 15-hours of sleep be any more rejuvenating than a normal night of sleep, and why? "
2007,What would be an adequate patient involvement in cancer clinical trials?,"(1) complains about the low patient and physician involvement in cancer clinical trials:     Of the 1.4 million patients with a new diagnosis of cancer in 2008   (ACS, 2008), it is estimated that no more than 5 percent of patients enrolled   in clinical trials, with some estimates suggesting that less than 3 percent   of patients enrolled in clinical trials (reviewed by ENACCT-CCPH, 2008).   Likewise, reimbursement concerns, a lack of awareness of clinical trials, physician   or patient preference for standard therapies, excessive regulatory burdens,   and time constraints prevent many physicians from enrolling patients   in clinical trials (C-Change and Coalition of Cancer Cooperative Groups,   2006; Mansour, 1994; Somkin et al., 2005).   What would be an adequate patient involvement in cancer clinical trials? I.e., in an ideal world, what percentage of patients should be enrolled in clinical trials?

2008,"If I take probiotics and antibiotics at the same time, which one wins?","Okay, I couldn't resist that title.  Seriously though, since antibiotics can cause indigestion, many physicians recommend taking them with food (see How much food is necessary to buffer the stomach when taking medicine?).  Is it okay to take them with yogurt (aka yoghurt and yoghourt)?  Does that reduce (or intensify) the effectiveness of the antibiotic? "
2009,Can oversleeping be harmful to overall health?,"Is it worse than undersleeping, especially for healthy development? Does it have any benefits? I would like to know both physical and mental effects (or diseases?). "
2010,Treating gingivitis,"If you brush your teeth twice a day, and floss once a day (in the evening). Then your dentist tells you that you have gingivitis, because of bleeding gums. Why? The only thing I can think of is if you do not brush your teeth thoroughly enough (or long enough maybe)? Any suggestions? Is it possible to get gingivitis if you brush and floss every day? And what are some ways to avoid or improve it?  "
2011,Way to measure different degrees of a mental disorder?,"Is it possible to have a disorder that might only display some of the symptoms, is not as defined, or episodic, making it ""borderline""? Is there a way to measure, or at least express the severity of a mental disease? "

2014,What is the difference between the TDAP and DTAP vaccines?,"What is the difference between the TDAP and DTAP vaccines? Some nurses/pharmacists told me they are the same, but I am not convinced.   If they are the same then why would some organizations request for you to specifically have the TDAP vaccine and won't accept the DTAP? "
2015,What factors control how much water the bowel absorbs?,"The lower intestine absorbs water from faecal matter, and uses that as one source of hydration for your body. I assume the bowel has various reasons for deciding when not to do this...and diarrhoea is the result.  I would like to know whether any factors control the amount of water the bowel chooses to absorb, or is it merely an on/off choice?   For example, does the bowel 'drink' as much water as it can when a person is dehydrated? If I glug two litres of water will my bowel not bother to absorb quite as much as other days? Will different people have different levels of absorption, giving some harder stools every day, compared to others? "
2016,Is surgery recommended for a first time dislocated shoulder?,Is surgery recommended for a first time dislocated shoulder after the shoulder has been put back in place? How is it best to heal this?  
2017,Salt and bad sleep,"I've been having more and more problems with salt for a few years, especially late before I'm about to sleep. Eating out, beers at a pub with the associated salty nuts and food or a barbeque at home will render a night of bad sleep, nightmares and constipation the next day. Cutting down on salt is an obvious answer and I cook most meals from scratch with no or very little salt, bake my own bread (most recipes calls for 2 % salt, I find it salty enough at 0.5 %) but many ingredients come very salty as is, cheese and soy sauce to name a few which are too much work to make from scratch. Cooking myself usually solves the problem most of the time but eating out can't be avoided sometimes.  I can reduce the problem by drinking plenty of water before going to bed, but I will wake up to pee in the middle of the night and the urine is very diluted so I assume I drank more water than needed to keep the salt balance (I've read 0.6 % blood salt concentration), but I can still very much feel the effect.  Otherwise I'm slightly overweight but do cardio for 6-9 hours per week (cycling, skiing or running) so I'm definitely working on it and my stamina is better than most people my age, have no trouble sleeping and almost never constipated.  I'm thinking about seeing a professional about this, but what should I ask? What should I check up before to make it meaningful?  UPDATE: One and a half years since I posted this. Did see a physician who did take the time to do the blood work. Salt balance as in sodium to potassium balance was normal as was the overall salinity. He recommended me to keep eating less than 5 grams of salt per day. Still possible if I keep baking my own bread and cooking all meals from scratch. But still hell to pay if invited over for dinner or go out.  "
2018,Low Carb Diet Causing Peripheral Neuropathy Symptoms,"Can eating low (&lt;20g) of carbohydrates a day be related to causing symptoms that are that of Peripheral Neuropathy?        Pain areas: in the back, face, foot, hands, or thigh   Pain types: can be burning and tingling or sharp   Pain circumstances: can occur at night   Sensory: pins and needles, uncomfortable tingling and burning, over sensitivity, or sensitivity to pain   Also common: numbness, slow reflexes, tingling feet, or tingling fingers      This is for someone not having diabetes, and may be possibly missing some important vitamins and minerals from the reduced intake of certain foods (mostly consuming meat).   If so, what can be done to help relieve these symptoms, as generic pain killers don't seem to be doing the trick? "
2019,Can eating certain food cause appendicitis?,"When I was a little kid I loved garlic. But It was too tedious for me to peel it, so I ate it without peeling it first. My mom would always tell me that the peel is like garbage and that it does not get digested. And if it is not digested, part of it ends up in the appendix. And when there is too much stuff ends up there your appendix gets inflamed and you need a surgery to remove it. It's called appendicitis she would say.  Is this true, or is there some grain of truth in what she was claiming? Not the existence of appendicitis, obviously, but that person's eating habits can lead to appendicitis? "
2020,What are the actual symptoms of the common cold?,"Everyone knows (and passionately hates) the runny nose, coughing, sneezing, aching/sore joints, and the drowsiness associated with the cold. But these symptoms are just the body trying to get rid of the rhinovirus. What does the cold actually do to you, and what would happen if the body did not fight it? Would you just die? "
2021,What are non-human methods of medical diagnosis called?,"What are non-human methods of medical diagnosis called? For example, a cat scan or blood work vs a physician's verbal shot in the dark during a ten minute office visit? To narrow the question this is specifically for diseases. "
2022,"What are trustworthy food and nutrition information websites, without ties to food companies?","After watching the documentary Fed Up, I was inclined to look for trustworthy dietary advice online. Without getting into arguments about whether Fed Up makes a good argument about sugar consumption, one thing they did for sure was highlight the biases of some institutions like the USDA.  Now I'm trying to find (relatively) unbiased information about food and nutrition.  Some websites that seem popular:   eatright.org is run by Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which is sponsored by food companies. nutrition.gov is sponsored by the USDA, of which ""promotion of agriculture production"" is one of its stated goals. authoritynutrition.com which is ""based on studies and written by experts"" - this doesn't pass the trustworthiness test.   So, can anyone recommend websites which base their advice on peer-reviewed scientific literature, and which do not have ties with the food production industry?  PS. I asked this question over at Skeptics.SE, but it was deemed offtopic there. It was suggested I might ask here. It does fit with the topic ""Environmental or nutritional factors that affect health"", but I'm not certain it describes a specific enough problem. Nevertheless, I hope it is useful to the audience of this site to have an answer to my question. "
2023,Honey- Replacement of White Sugar?,Recently i have decided to switch from white sugar to Honey and i was wondering if there is any scenario in which using honey can be harmful? Like in baking or mixing with some other eatable thing? 
2024,Can temporomandibular joint disorder cause sensorineural hearing loss?,"Is the pain when walking or running with such a disorder an indicator that hearing loss is occuring or going to occur? Ear pain is considered a symptom for this disorder. Can that be an indicator of sensorineural hearing loss in this case?  It can also be called temporomandibular joint dysfunction and the most common acronyms I can find are TMJ, TMD and TMJD. "
2025,Are apples really better for the immune system than most fruit?,"""An apple a day keeps the doctor away"", the saying goes, implying that apples are somehow especially good for the immune system.  But does this idiom have any validity to it? Are apples high in certain nutrients that are key to immune function? Do they have a high nutrient-to-calorie ratio (which I assume is good for immune function?) Does their high fiber content contribute to this effect?  Or, are they really no better for the immune system than any other fruit/vegetable/nutritious food? "
2026,What is the effect of soap on a blister?,"Assume that you have a blister on a finger. It's open. Is there a problem if you wash your hands with soap (for instance liquid soap in a public toilet)? What could be the effect of soap on a blister?  For instance, will it get irritated? Can it produce a liquid? "
2027,Does wart treatment (such as freezing) kill the wart or only triger the bodies natural immune reaction?,"Iâve heard competing claims about (plantar) wart treatment. Some doctors say freezing it with liquid nitrogen is to kill the wart, while trying to minimize the damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Other doctors say it is just to irritate the body enough to stimulate the natural immune system response, and thatâs what gets rid of the wart. Can the bodyâs own immune system be enough to get rid of the wart?  The wikipedia article has a small note, in a confusing section, that reads     This last point implies that in the case of plantar warts it was   likely the patients own immune system responsible for resolution and   not the specific treatment.   To me this sounds like scientists don't really know which it is? "
2028,Is it necessary to take antibiotics after medical/dental treatment?,"Usually I don't take antibiotics when I take medicines according to a prescription.  Is it necessary to take antibiotics when I am bleeding in my body, for example, in my gum or teeth?  I thought I do not need to take it because I am healthy and have no disease now.  Is my thinking correct?  Thanks in advance for your help. "
2029,How carcinogenic are neoprene coated dumbbells?,"I have read in many places online that neoprene coated dumbbells may cause cancer. Just how carcinogenic are they? Would normal use of said dumbbells (say less than one hour per day) be of any risk?

2030,What is the coral-like structure in my nasal cavity?,"Through rigorous training and deep meditation (AKA prolonged bouts of boredom) I have acquired the ability to maneuver my tongue into my nasal cavity. I can feel the back of my nostrils, and above them, a weird slatted mass. After seeing some rough anatomy sketches on the internet I think is something to do with smell.  What is that coral shaped region? Can I damage it by poking it with my tongue?  By ""coral"" I mean this stuff: [website]"

2032,Which fish to choose for a good omega 6 to omega 3 ratio without other health drawbacks?,"Eating Fish seems to be a good option to improve your omega 6 to omega 3 ratio.   Now the problem is that many fishes contain pollutants, for example mercury, tin compounds, PCB, dioxins or antibiotics. In particular the fat fishs seem to be more pulluted, but that seem to be the best canditates to get some healthy omega 3 fatty acids without too much omega 6.   So what would be good fish choices to improve your omega 6 to omega 3 ratio without the health drawbacks described above?  Do you have some references about that? "
2033,Bread and acid reflux,I have been told that bread can cause acid reflux? What in the bread would cause this and is that found in other foods that are not usually associated with gerd? 
2034,"If fat cell number stays the same after adulthood, how can adults gain huge amounts of weight?","A lot of research indicates that after the start of adulthood, the number of adipocytes in the body remains basically constant for the remainder of one's life. And yet, it is still possible for a 160lb adult male to triple his or her body weight through fat gain. Considering existing adipocytes can only store so much additional fat through expansion, how is this possible?  Is it theoretically possible then to place a cap on weight gain in adulthood by minimizing weight throughout childhood, or removing adipose tissue, so that there simply are not enough cells to store more than a certain amount of fat? "
2035,Benefits of tea in weight loss,"I was prescribed green tea by my dietitian for weight loss. I tried it but I then switched to earl grey (with bergamot) black tea. I just wanted to know is earl grey also helpful in mobilizing excess fat and weight reduction? What about chamomile? Moreover, how many cups a day should I take for the weight loss effect to be substantial? "
2036,What are the long term risks/side-effects of nicotine consumption?,"when reading about the long term effects of nicotine, almost every source refers to the long term effects of tobacco smoking. But what part does nicotine by itself have? I mean apart from immediate side effects like sickness, etc. How does it affect the body long term?  e.g. When smoking tobacco you have a higher chance of heart-problems. As I understand, this is mainly due to the carbon-monoxide in the blood, increasing the load on your heart. But does nicotine play a role in this? Which tobacco smoking long-term-effects/risks are actually due to nicotine and which come from you inhaling any sort of smoke, containing a few thousand toxins?   "
2037,"How do ""Zero Calorie Energy Drinks"" work? (Or do they?)","I saw a can of ""Sugar Free (Energy Drink Brand)"" once and figured someone had done a fake product joke. Then I found it was a real product. ""Maybe it just tastes like (Energy Drink Brand) and isn't an energy drink."" I imagined to myself.  Much later, I'm now seeing energy drinks openly advertised as ""Zero Calories"".  An energy drink with zero calories? What is this perpetual motion substance that both gives you energy and has zero energy? Am I maybe just missing a joke?  (I've tried searching but I've only found discussion about if these drinks are good/bad for you, not how they work. I'm declining to name any brands as I don't want to get sued.) "
2038,How serious is the antibiotic resistance problem?,"I found figures and numbers on CDC and WHO, while the general public may have little idea about those numbers, such as how many people ""normally"" die from such disease.  Can anyone provide some easy-to-understand examples on the issue, like:   Can we still use the first generation Penicillin (Penicillin G) to treat normal pneumonia (the one often seen among children and elderly), not those never-heard-of, only-known-to-researchers pneumonia? What is the ""least-advanced"" but still effective antibiotics for common infection, e.g. bacterial upper respiratory infection?   If geographical factors (countries and regions) is going to influence the answer, please specify them in the answer. (I personally would like to know those about China and US). "
2039,Is there any test to identify bacteria?,"When I got some upper respiratory infection the doctor always prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics like amoxicillin. Is there any test to identify bacteria, and if so, why doesn't the doctor order one? Is it prohibitively expensive (or slow)?  Actually they always do some stupid blood test (just some cell count), which reveals nothing about the cause of infection (they told me they were not sure. I'm in China and correct me if I'm wrong).

2040,Should I wash dental floss pick before passing on the next teeth?,"Very simple question, which I checked is not answered here., so please, don't link that question.  I'm using a dental floss picklike this one, or this one. I use it normally, passing in between teeth and following normal guidelines. However, after passing it between two teeth, yellow residue of food and other things gets in the floss, should I wash it or remove it with my fingers before re-passing it over other teeth? "
2041,Looking for Bipolar Disorder treatment method,"My brother and me are ill with Bipolar Affective disorder. My brother's illness is in the severe stage, and we have no idea what to do, medications do not provide improvement. I hope that audio-psycho-phonology should help, I have felt its effects on myself and I trust in it. Also I understand in detail  how it works. We have tried several Tomatis audio courses (playlists) in Russia, but the result is not so good. Now I want to find the best place in the world for Tomatis listening. What Tomatis center do you recommend, where are the the best experts and the most high-tech equipment? As far as I know, the last Tomatis technology is based on 3-channels heaphones, not on 2, and also can provide a real-time voice processing. And what else Tomatis-based (audio-psycho-phonology) methods can you recommend? "
2042,Why patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time is considered difficult to be done?,"According to the internet, it's difficult to simultaneously patting your head and rubbing your belly. Really? I can.  There's another one. ""How smart is your right foot""?  Sit down, lift your right foot and do clockwise circles. While doing that, draw number 6 in the air with your right hand. Apparently it's impossible, but not for me.  They talk of them like a brain glitch, that it cannot be done no matter how hard you try.  "
2043,Do hearing-impaired individuals need more sleep?,"I'm a hearing-impaired individual, but because I was born with this disability, I never researched it because it was never ""new"" and ""exciting"" to me, but a friend recently informed me that hearing-impaired individuals actually require more sleep than most because their brains are constantly operating on a higher level as they have to work harder to interpret sounds, etc. For most of my life, I have been on the lethargic side of things, but I was wondering if this is a factually accurate statement. It makes logical sense to me, but can someone point me in the direction of research?   On average, what is the optimal amount of sleep a hearing-impaired individual needs? When was this discovered?  "
2044,How energizing/effective are Turmeric supplements? They are often advertised on energy drinks,"I've been studying for exams lately, and as much as I hate to admit (because I know how bad energy drinks are for people), I've been consuming some energy drinks, and I've noticed that quite a lot of them highlight that they contain turmeric.   How effective is turmeric in energy drinks?   Are there more natural ways to consume turmeric? Like do they exist in foods?  "
2045,One meal a day - meal planning,"I've recently come across the one meal a day (OMAD) diet where you essentially fast until a set time and then consume your days calories in a single meal. I know there are already questions related to this (e.g. Is eating a meal with 2000 Calories at once any different from eating 4 times at 500 Calories?) and I'm not here to debate whether OMAD is a worthwhile diet or not.  Rather, I'd like to get some input on what the makeup of that single meal should be. I've seen many people suggest the OMAD diet without recommending any specific meal plan/breakdown  I saw this video discussing how/why OMAD works. If I understand this correctly, by only eating a single meal glucose/insulin levels in your body are allowed to drop, and ketosis is allowed to start providing more stable energy release throughout the day and to use up energy stored in fat cells. Is that a correct understanding?  Given that, is it advisable to eat a carb heavy single meal? I would imagine that would cause glucose levels to spike - does that then get stored back into fat cells thus preventing weight loss?  In general, what is a recommended breakdown for the contents of that single meal? "
2046,What causes body temperature to rise drastically after being injured?,"I recently changed companies and started using a train for transport. In that time, I've sprained my ankle twice because of all the dreaded stairs at the train stations.  Each time this happened, my body temperature suddenly increased drastically, to the point that sweat starts dripping from me.  What is the cause and reason behind this sudden increase in temperature?  I've read that body temperature usually drops when severe injuries are experienced, but as painful as a sprained ankle is, I guess it doesn't meet that level of severity?  EDIT: I remember spraining my ankle far more severely in the past, and the same thing happened but I also became very dizzy soon after and I felt lightheaded for an hour or so. Does the dizziness perhaps mean nerve damage? And is it related to the increasing body temperature? "
2047,What are the functions of these parts of the brain (MRI)?,"This is an MRI images of my brain. There are three red arrows pointing at there parts of the brain.  I would like to the functions of these three parts, Please?  Are they control motion, speaking, hearing, smelling, emotions or something else?  I'm diagnosed with MS. I had optic neuritis. I don't feel anything else wrong. But they are three parts so I think there are three symptoms, not just one. So, would you help me discover what else I have?   I know that It is not allowed to diagnose people in this site. But this is not diagnoses. I just would like to know what the functions of these parts of the brain are.  Thank you very much,  "
2048,Is there ever a time when an appendicitis is not an emergency? Could it explain chronic pain in lower abdomen/pelvis?,"Is there ever a time when an appendicitis is not an emergency?

Could an appendicitis develop gradually and be the explanation for chronic pressurized pain in the lower abdomen/pelvis?  "
2049,Can microneedling damage the buccal nerve if your skin is thin?,I have an atrophic scar about 4cm to the right of my lip. I wanted to get subcision but the plastic surgeon said there's a risk of damaging the buccal nerve which would then mean I wouldn't be able to speak properly.  He said it's risky because I don't have much collagen in that area.   1) How deep is the dermis and epidermis in that region? 2) is the Buccal nerve right below the epidermis or is it protected by a muscle or another layer? 3) How deep would you need to go to hit the buccal nerve? 4) Would a dermapen that goes 2.5mm deep hit the buccal nerve if the skin in that area is not very thick due to collagen loss? 
2050,Why doctors have different opinions and diagnosis for the same patient?,"I really wonder why different doctors have different opinions or diagnosis!! I've experienced many situations. For example: I went to ten doctors to see what's wrong with my eye, Some of them said I'm OK. Some said its very dangerous and I should take specific medicines. Also, When I measure my blood pressure I get different results from different doctors within the same hour. Once, I nerves doctor said I've a serious disease and I should take Syringe immediately while another doctor said that I don't have this disease at all. My parents and grandparents tell me about situations like that. I just would like to figure out why there are great variations in doctors opinions?  As an electrical engineer, I can say devices in general can have error and It can produce unclear and sometimes wrong information. Is that the reason?  I live in Egypt where education is not good. Do not doctors know how to use these devices and how to treat people?  Are doctors make exaggerate to earn more money?  I just would like to know the real reason to be careful and to know how to behave.  All the best, "
2051,How/why is it possible for a body to produce gallstones -- yrs after gallbladder was removed?,"I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago because I developed pancreatitis out of the blue and my pancreas hemorrhaged... and they never figured it out... so they assumed it was probably a gallstone that perforated my pancreas.   But in the Urgent Care today -- the doctor was telling me that he still suspected that my pain was still caused by gallbladder complications? Like I still had stones in my bile-ducts?   How is that possible?? My gallbladder was removed 9 years ago.   Anyway, I am having an ultrasound to confirm the findings of gallstones (or kidney stones), but even if they found gallstones, what then do they do? Since the gallbladder was already removed?  "
2052,How can bee pollen be organic?,"Bee pollen is frequently referred to as a health supplement and sold as ""organic"" in organic supermarkets and stores.  I am wondering how pollen can be claimed to be organic and to what extent organic pollen sold differs from non-organic (as referred to the label) pollen.   From my common sense reasoning, I imagine it to be very difficult to restrict bees to only collect pollen from plants that were not treated with chemicals.   Lastly, are there any adverse health effects from eating non-organic pollen? Are they more likely to contain chemicals if collected directly from plants that were exposed to chemicals? "

But I still do it. Also I have a habit of licking my lips[2]  What I try to do to fix it.  I put some moisturizer, Cetaphil, and that only makes the skin dry and peel by itself.  I put on some Aquaphor and that makes me want to peel my skin off even more!  [2] I was wondering if I should stop putting lotion on my lips. Because I lick my lips and I get stomachaches, all the lotion getting to my stomach.  **My question **  Should I see a skin doctor? How do I prevent myself from picking the skin off?

My Rhematologist was telling me that he does not diagnose anyone with Lupus unless they eventually develop a ""Butterfly rash"" -- otherwise he just diagnoses people that have all the Lupus symptoms (except the Butterfly), even if they tested positive for Lupus in the blood-work, as ""fibromyalgia."" To him, the Butterfly rash is the single most important hinge that swings a fibromyalgia diagnosis to a lupus diagnosis.    But everywhere I look online, not everyone that is positive for Lupus will experience the ""Butterfly"" Rash. Right? Or am I wrong? Is there medical information that explains either way, and how paramount this ""Butterfly"" Rash is?   Thanks! "

2058,Is one more susceptible to chronic pancreatitis if one's pancreas hemorrhaged during a single inexplicable acute pancreatitis event?,"Is one more susceptible to chronic pancreatitis if one's pancreas hemorrhaged during a single inexplicable acute pancreatitis event?  About 9 years ago, I suffered from acute pancreatitis, and somehow my pancreas hemorrhaged, and I lost a lot of blood due to internal bleeding and required several blood transfusions... As I mentioned in other posts, the doctors were unable to find the source for the sudden acute pancreatitis nor what caused it to hemorrhaged (so they removed my gallbladder as a precautionary measure).    Anyway -- I was wondering if a single acute pancreatitis attack in the past that severely damaged your pancreas -- might develop into Chronic pancreatitis overtime? Is there a correlation to a one time incident to a chronic condition, which develops years later?   What are the symptoms of Chronic Pancreatitis?   (And... I've never actually even taken a sip of alcohol in my life). "
2059,Why/how does stress sometimes cause a spike in WBC or even a fever?,"I've noticed a direct correlation between a spike in my WBC (when I don't have an detection of a viral or bacterial infection) and sometimes (but pretty rare for me), an elevated body-temperature that becomes a fever.   Over a course of months, my doctors have been monitoring my WBC and I've been monitoring my temperature, and a pattern we have noticed is that everything elevates when I'm under academic stress -- I'm a PhD student taking Comprehensive Exams (not in a medical related field, obviously).  But -- Why/how does stress sometimes cause a spike in WBC or even a fever? Do either of these psychosomatic symptoms ever work in our benefit of calming us down under stress? "
2060,Are cell phones still prohibited from the ER or other medical facilities? Why or why not?,"A decade + ago, I've been told that cell phones disrupt the medical devices in medical facilities, especially in the ER; thus, cell phones have been prohibited from the ER or other designated areas where a cell phone's signal would interrupt with the medical equipment's' signals. (Similar to how we used to shut down -- or airplane mode -- our cellular devices while on an airplane). Do cell phones cause a significant degree of disruption with the medical equipment's' ability to function properly? Are they still prohibited from the ER?  I don't know if policy has changed, research has changed, human behavior has changed, or technologies changed, or a combo, or all of the above, but I have seen a dime a dozen of people brazenly using their cell phones in the ER in a close proximity to medical equipment. Are they no longer prohibited? Why or why not? "

2063,Upper body exercises in limited space,"I'm recovering from a serious COPD exacerbation, and want to start building my upper body strength; my goal is both to increase the strength of my chest muscles for breathing, as well as reduce my O2 needs for mundane activities.  Eventually I'm planning to go work at a facility (gym, possibly pulmonary rehab) with trainers and machines. At the moment, I'm hooked up to a stationary oxygen compressor with limited movement and mostly confined to my bed and desk. So, I have very limited range of movement or open space to exercise in. But I want to start building up my strength ASAP, especially since I'm working from home all day with plenty of free time to do it.  I have using small hand weights doing lateral raises (I think? arms lifting straight out at the shoulder), as I have plenty of room out to the side. But in front, I don't really have enough room to properly do curls. Instead I have been rotating my arms 180 degrees so they face outward, and doing curls up to my side instead of up to my chest.  My questions are:    Is this exercise as effective as ""proper"" curls in building the appropriate muscles? Is there any possible damage I might be doing by exercising in such an unusual position?  Is there a different type of exercise that has the same effect that would work better?   (I have almost no experience with exercise, so please use small words :) ) "
2064,long term effects of TB,"I contracted and suffered from TB when I was 3 years old and apparently it was an acute case because as my mother said they feared for my life. The disease was cured and I have had no sequels or long term effects that I know of, leading an active life, doing sports, yoga and so on. Now in my fifties I'm beginning to have issues of backpain. The medical tests put it down to ageing but (now the question) could it be long-term effects of  the childhood TB? Lastly, as I have some training as a paramedic, could you direct me to some bibliography? Thank you  "
2065,"Awkward: TWINS, but from DIFFERENT DADS? How rare is heteropaternal superfecundation (statistics)?","This is not a Jerry Springer headline -- despite all the sizzling, implicit drama involved -- heteropaternal superfecundation is a fertilization term when a woman is successfully impregnated by different/multiple men in the same ovulation cycle.   We all know that kitten and puppies from the same litter can be fathered by multiple males (yay for a variety of breeds!)... And we don't typically associate human pregnancies in the same boat because... to be fair... this is quite rare. But how rare is it? Statistics?   So the infants are fraternal twins AND half-siblings? Is there a term that comprises this relationship. What is the history behind identifying this fertilization process? When was it officially documented? Did they have any suspicions before DNA (like if children born different races)?   "
2066,If alcohol and coffee are both diuretics -- why do so many intoxicated ppl drink coffee to sober up? Dehydration concern.,"First off, I don't drink alcohol or coffee so I'm not familiar with the basics and can't speak to the effectiveness of coffee on alcohol, etc. But I have questions:    Is it even effective to ""sober-up"" an intoxicated/drunk person with coffee? Does their alertness level increase? Or is that just something people try because it's done on TV?  It would seem to me, seeing that alcohol and coffee are both diuretics, that this line of reasoning would only lead to dehydration -- so counter-intuitive to ""increasing alertness.""   But I don't know if there is an unsaid twist to this and everyone else adds something they're not mentioning that helps induce soberness without compromising hydration levels. "

2068,Studies on safety of different inert gases?,"Accidental exposure to high concentrations of inert gas results in annual deaths from asphyxiation due to accidental exposure. And, ""Hazards with inert gases and the risks of asphyxiation are well established. (Wikipedia)  It says that one danger is that a person does not sense the lack of oxygen. Yet this study showed rats to be ""aversive"" to argon exposure.   Are some inert gases considered safer than others? Maybe some are more noticeable, giving more warning. I'm sure industry would at least have some figures like ratios between deaths and accidental exposure?   Another study, Comparison of carbon dioxide, argon, and nitrogen for inducing unconsciousness or euthanasia of rats. shows decreased heart rate for CO2 compared to the others, which surprisingly contradicts what I find about the hypocapnic alarm response being triggered ""mostly by carbon dioxide levels rising"" "

2070,Risk level of formaldehyde inhalation,"How do I estimate the risk level of inhaling a certain level of formaldehyde in the air?  I looked up the EPA's assessment, and they list this summary report in their IRIS database.  (By risk, do they mean the risk of developing cancer, after a lifetime of exposure at that level?  Risk of death?  How would I tell?)  In Section II.C, it lists ""Inhalation Unit Risk â 1.3E-5 per (ug/cu.m)"" as the estimated cancer risk.  OSHA limits workers' exposure to an average of 0.75 ppm.    I'm trying to calculate the risk level that corresponds to, based on the model in the EPA report.  If I understand correctly, I first have to convert 0.75 ppm to ug/cu.m.  Wikipedia lists a formula for this conversion.  It appears the molecular mass of formaldehyde is about 30 g/mol, so at an ambient temperature of 72Â° F (22Â° C), 0.75 ppm apparently corresponds to 0.75 * 30 / (0.082 * 295) = 0.93 mg/mÂ³, or equivalently, 930 ug/mÂ³.  With the risk model listed above, this appears to correspond to a risk of 0.012.  So, if I understand everything correctly, it appears this model predicts a 1% risk of developing cancer over your lifetime, if exposed to formaldehyde at the OSHA's safe level continuously.  Did I do this calculation correctly?  Is that the correct interpretation?  This seems like a non-trivial risk level to accept, so I wonder if I'm interpreting everything correctly. "

2072,How can someone that is HIV positive not be contagious?,"According to [website]How can that be?  Obviously the viral load is not zero because then they wouldn't be HIV positive and isn't it enough with just one virus particle being transmitted to infect someone?  I (think I) understand the basic statistics behind this. Hypothetically, if someone that is HIV positive but not under treatment transfer 1000 virus particles during sex and that leads to a risk of 5 % to be infected, reducing the virus load with 98 % so that only 20 virus particles are transferred during sex the risk should be reduced a corresponding amount, that is the risk is 1 â°. Still 1 â° is not 0. And in the case with 1 â°, after 100 intercourses the risk is â 10 % while it after 1000 intercourses is â 73 %. None of these numbers are negligable. "
2073,Breath-holding induced hypoxia and brain damage,"I am currently researching the ""Wim Hof Method"" a big part of which is hyperventilation and breath-holding induced hypoxia.  In another answer on the topic on this site I saw the following study being mentioned:  [website]This study apparently demonstrates brain damage in free divers and the brain damage is proportional to breath-holding times.  Of course this study is small and has its limitations, but I am wondering what other data there is about voluntarily induced hypoxia and brain damage?  If done correctly, the Wim Hof Method should never cause you to faint, but doing it is on the edge of passing out. Some people suggest, that it is not possible to damage ones brain by breath holding, because before brain damage can occure the person faints and normal breathing resumes. However what data is there to support this claim? Surely, if you get yourself to pass out often enough it would lead to some kind of damage?  I have seen videos on youtube of people doing the excercise with an oximeter.  During the hyperventilation phase the saturation seems to be either stable or go up. At the retention (breath hold) phase the saturation sinks down to in some examples 50, which is right where one would expect to pass out.  What data is there, to help me understand if daily excercises like this are likely to cause brain damage? "
2074,What is this study on the efficacy of tenocyte therapy?,"I read on [website]  The future of non-surgical care for tendinosis is likely bioengineering. Ligament reconstruction is possible using mesenchymal stem cells and a silk scaffold.[37] These same stem cells were capable of seeding repair of damaged animal tendons.[38] Autologous tenocyte implantation is currently being tested for tendinosis. There is a large randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial being conducted in the Netherlands to test the safety and efficacy of tenocyte therapy. Results from the trial are expected by April 2013.   Which study are they talking about in the last sentence, and what was the outcome of the study? "
2075,What effect would a sperm containing XX have on a ovum and fetus?,"So this is just a random thought I had, while writing a story, but I assume this is likely impossible currently, and likely in the far future aswell, but let's assume a scenario where the body that the sperm came from, was XX, instead of XY. Let's just assume through science, there were no other issues related to a different chromosome. (Maybe the organ was printed) From what I understand, the sperm determines whether the resulting fetus is XX or XY, based on whether it carries X or Y from its creation in the original body.  Would a sperm producing body that has no Y, only XX (So no XXY or XYY), then essentially be incapable of producing XY children, with a XX ovum producing body?  Would there be other potential issues for the mother or the fetus/child?  I imagine with organ printing not being a impossible feat(at this level, and not yet anyway), this could be a hypothetical scenario for a FtM transgender in the future aswell, but mostly I was just curious on the conception of it.  TLDR: A XX sperm (whether possible or not), and a XX ovum, would only be able to create a XX fetus, and never a XY, yes? "
2076,"How to calculate my ""approximate"" mortality rate while in ICU?","To make a long story as short as possible for context, I was rushed to the ER while in cardiac arrest back in 2014. Heart stopped beating momentarily and lost oxygen to the part of my brain. None of the doctors were able to completely figure out the cause of what triggered the event, but I was ultimately diagnosed with two main illnesses which I want to focus on as they are the most significant to me in the calculation I want to get to, if that's possible.  I was primarily diagnosed with Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. When I was discharged from the ICU, the ER doctor who treated me told me that when I was admitted, my mortality rate was over 80% (thank you so much to the amazing staff at my hospital, forever grateful!!).  I know he factored in the cardiac arrest and other issues I had when initially admitted, but I would like to know my likely/average/rough estimate/I'm-not-sure-what-correct-term (if there is one) mortality rate was, factoring in only the sepsis and ARDs. I read on Wikipedia (not the best source, I know...) that the mortality rate for sepsis ranges from 30%-80%, and ARDs is anywhere from 35%-50%. Is there a way to calculate some form of mortality rate from these two ranges? Or would it not make sense? I was 18 at the time, smoked ~half a pack of cigarettes a day, tad bit underweight (I believe I was around 120ish at 5'9"", curse you ADHD medication!), but otherwise was a healthy male for being 18yo and stupid, if that makes any difference.  Thank you so much for your help, insight and expertise offered to a 23yo who is curious about what treatment, or combination of treatments, helped save my life 5 years ago!  P.S. For those wondering why I want to know some sort of figure for this, I'm writing a post asking those who are healthy and able to donate plasma to consider doing so, as I received a substantial amount of PRP treatments, as well as a multiple bags of donated plasma while in ICU. I knew I received this treatment, but I just read this research article by the American Thoracic Society, which was published on June 24, 2014 - less than 3 months before I got sick and was treated with this therapy. I wonder if my Pulmonologist who treated me in the ICU came across this article during his research, as he stayed up many nights during my stay reading case studies, and his first treatment he requested permission from my parents was therapeutic hypothermia, which I know is considered controversial/ineffective by certain medical professionals, so considering the fact he was trying everything he could to save me, I'm not sure if this PRP treatment for sepsis resulting in ARDs was also considered new (admittedly haven't read the entire paper!).  Thanks for your help! "
2077,Some clarity about HPV,"I have experienced two separate episodes of HPV as warts in my body; the fist one was on my foot sole, the second in my genital area. I had the one in my foot for months until it got inflamed due to too much standing and I had it removed in ten days with vinegar. I did the same treatment with the genital one, same outcome. I do not know how effective is acid on the virus. Certainly acid deteriorates the whole epithelial environment facilitating wart detachment. It would be interesting to extend this discussion also to the effects of acid on the virus. But this in not what I want to know. My questions are: is the virus limited to the area where it overtly manifest itself (warts) or once you get infected the virus spreads everywhere in your body? Was I free from the virus once I removed the wart?     HPV infection is limited to the basal cells of stratified epithelium, the only tissue in which they replicate.[95] The virus cannot bind to live tissue; instead, it infects epithelial tissues through micro-abrasions or other epithelial trauma that exposes segments of the basement membrane.[95]  (From [website]It seems the virus in limited to the skin. It is rarely heard of HPV manifesting in different areas other than hands, feet and genitalia. Any particular reason? Does the immune system keep it limited to those areas?   My next question would have been: is there a cure?     There is currently no specific treatment for HPV infection.[162][163][164] However, the viral infection, more often than not, clears to undetectable levels by itself.[165] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the body's immune system clears HPV naturally within two years for 90% of cases (see Clearance subsection in Virology for more detail).[162] However, experts do not agree on whether the virus is completely eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels, and it is difficult to know when it is contagious.[166] (From [website]I guess we have the answer...   Quick excerpt about effects of disinfectants. No acids are mentioned.     The virus is unusually hardy, and is immune to most common disinfectants. It is the first virus ever shown to be resistant to inactivation by glutaraldehyde, which is among the most common strong disinfectants used in hospitals.[156] Diluted sodium hypochlorite bleach is effective,[156] (From [website]What tests are used to detect HPV?

2078,Are there risks to long term use of IUSs?,"The IUS is similar to theÂ intrauterine device (IUD), but instead of releasing copper like the IUD, it releases the hormone progestogen into the womb (NHS 2018).  It thickens the cervical mucus, which makes it more difficult for sperm to move through the cervix, and thins the lining of the womb so an egg is less likely to be able to implant itself.  For some women, it can also prevent the release of an egg each month (ovulation), but most women continue to ovulate.  When looking at possible side effects of progestogen, WebMD states that:     The progesterone prescription products that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) areÂ LIKELY SAFEÂ for most people when used by mouth, applied to the skin, applied into vagina, or injected into the muscle with the advice and care of a healthcare professional. However, progesterone can cause many side effects including stomach upset, changes in appetite, weight gain, fluid retention and swelling (edema), fatigue, acne, drowsiness or insomnia, allergic skin rashes, hives, fever, headache, depression, breast discomfort or enlargement, premenstrual syndrome (PMS)-like symptoms, altered menstrual cycles, irregular bleeding, and other side effects (WebMD, n.d.)   But despite many websites indicating they are the same, Progestogen is not Progesterone (Gillson, 2007).     There is a concern that some progestogens cause adverse metabolic effects, including alterations inÂ lipoproteinÂ fractions andÂ carbohydrate intolerance. The choice of progestogen, the dose, and the number of days of administration appear to be important (Stanczyk, 2007).   What about bone metabolism?  Are there any other risks involved in long term use of IUSs?  References  Gillson, G. (2007). Clarifying hormone terminology. Canadian Family Physician, 53(1), 29-30. PMCID:Â PMC1952548  NHS (2018).

2081,Difference between mmol/l and mg/dl for blood glucose measurement,"I'm in the process of preparing a short lecture on hypoglycemia. In the process, I discovered that blood glucose levels can be expressed in the measurement of millimoles per liter or milligrams per deciliter.  I did find one question here on Medical Sciences S.E. that was related to this. However, it doesn't completely answer the question I'm about to ask. I have tried to research this using Google but didn't come across any resources that were helpful in answering the following...  Are there any countries that exclusively use mmol/l or mg/dl? If there are, what countries are these?   I'm wondering if this is a similar situation to the US vs most other countries. The US still uses the English units of measure - inches, pounds, Fahrenheit - while most other countries use the metric system.   The related question here on S.E. did answer my question about why this system is used at times. But I wasn't able to find anything there about what other countries do or don't use it. "

(p.91)  I am not a clinician, so to me this wording seems vague. In the first half it seems that clinicians may determine the presence of anaemia based on signs and symptoms elicited in the initial consultation, but in the second half it seems that clinical context includes the interpretation of bloodwork.   Can anyone clarify what is meant? Or instead tell me how one approaches anaemia?   Professional guidelines or medical references preferred above journal articles.  "

Basically at what point during such an exercise would you expect the risk of fainting to be significant or can it happen at any saturation level? Can I assume, that at 50% the danger of fainting is very high, like 90% and at 70% saturation it is extremely low? Is it possible to train to be able to withstand lower saturation levels and not faint? For example would an experienced breath holder be able to not faint at 40% saturation?  And finally, if you regularly do breath holding exercises, would you expect your red blood cell count to rise, similar to altitude exposure? "
2086,How has the research of the effects/benefits of yoga progressed since 2015?,"Four years ago, in 2015, Vox published this piece:  I read more than 50 scientific studies about yoga.

One of the bottom lines is that a lot of claims regarding the positive effects of yoga have not been established (nor refuted), and specifically regarding different schools of yoga or activities within yoga practice.  Have there been significant findings over the past several years (2015-2019), which change the picture painted in that piece?

2087,How well established is the connection between insulin resistance and CVD?,"I am trying and failing to understand the topic of good and bad cholesterol and how it relates to diet.  It is still common wisdom, that LDL is to blame for artery calcification and resulting coronary vascular diseases.  However in recent times, there have been opposing views to this concept, some of which lay the blame on carbs and insulin resistance, rather than LDL.  In a video I watched recently it is suggested, that insulin response to glucose is a very strong predictor of cardio vascular problems. It seems, with a stronger correlation than LDL.  How strong is the evidence to support this hypothesis and is this incompatible with the common ""house doctor"" wisdom, that not carbs, but dietary fat is the problem and not insulin response, but LDL is the relevant marker?

2088,Most probable causes of obesity,"I've read [website]More specifically, I'd like to get answers to these questions, based on scientific studies:   Out of 100 obese people how many eat more calories than the average healthy, non-obese person of their age and gender? Out of 100 obese people how many have a poorer diet than the average healthy, non-obese person of their age and gender? Out of 100 obese people how many do less physical activity than the average healthy, non-obese person of their age and gender?   By knowing these numbers governments would have a better idea how to fight obesity: e.g. should they promote food with fewer calories, or should they promote physical activity? (However, this is just an example, and in this question I'm interested in the numbers above rather than on the best ways for governments to fight obesity.)  I understand that obesity is caused by a combination of factors, and for helping a person become less obese, all factors should be considered personally for them. Nevertheless, I'm still interested in the numbers above.  I understand that even these numbers don't paint the full picture, because we don't know e.g. how many of them eat more calories and do less physical activity (at the same time).  I also understand that it's possible to eat (a bit) more and not become obese, e.g. if also doing more physical activity.  If there are similar factor breakdown numbers available publicly, I'm interested in them. "
2089,"Does the delivery of BMP-12,-13,-14 (either in form of a gene or a protein) into an injured tendon help improve healing in humans?","I have read that delivery of BMP-12,-13,-14 (either in form of a gene or a protein) into an injured tendon improved healing, but I haven't been able yet to find an in-vivo study in humans confirming it.  For example, the 2007 {1} study showed that BMP-14 gene therapy increases tendon tensile strength in a rat model of Achilles tendon injury:     The results of this animal study suggest that gene therapy with BMPs may improve the capacity of injured musculoskeletal tissue to heal.   The 2001 study {2} was tested on chickens:     We conclude that BMP-12 gene transfer is a promising procedure for improving the tendon repair process.   The 1999 study {3} was tested on rats:     The rats were killed after 2 weeks and the tensile strength of the tendon regenerate was found to be increased by both proteins in a seemingly dose-dependent manner.   The 2019 study {5} was tested on rabbits:     Rotator cuff regeneration achieved by BMP-12-overexpressing BM-MSCs-loaded PLGA scaffolds may represent a novel approach for the management of rotator cuff defect.   The 2017 study {4} was tested on humans but it  was in vitro:     BMP-12 activates tenogenic pathway in hASCs but also affects secretory activity and impairs immunomodulatory potential of this population that can influence the clinical outcome after cell transplantation.   Does the delivery of BMP-12,-13,-14 (either in form of a gene or a protein) into an injured tendon help improve healing in humans?

2090,What would a nearly-universal list of medical specialties look like,"I need to create easy to read universal list of medical specialties. This goal seems impossible if taking into account subspecialties - in most countries they are pretty different. Since there are no worldwide agreements on how to group specialties, I decided to group it by the medicine branch it belongs to.   I need help clarifying what specialties and subspecialties exist, and how they are related.  As a basis I took a list of medical branches from wikipedia:    Anesthesiology   Cardiology   Critical care medicine   Dentistry   Dermatology   Emergency medicine   Endocrinology   Epidemiology   First aid   Gastroenterology   General practice/Family medicine   Geriatrics   Gynaecology   Hematology   Hepatology   Infectious disease   Internal medicine   Neurology   Nephrology   Obstetrics   Oncology   Ophthalmology   Optometry   Orthopaedics   Otorhinolaryngology   Pathology   Pediatrics   Preventive medicine   Psychiatry   Pulmonology   Radiology   Sports medicine   Rheumatology   Surgery   Urology   Then I google a list of medical specialties and try to put it all together. This is the first link from google: [website]Lets take a look on how do they group Surgery:    They put Paediatric Surgery into Surgery. Fair enough.     Lets see Pediatrics group:    Almost all specialties constructed as two medical branches joined together:   Pediatric Cardiology, Pediatric Endocrinology. Are there any unique specialties in Pediatrics? Why we don't put it into Endocrinology, Cardiology groups? What brach of medicine has more weight when grouping specialties?   As I understand, if you are Cardiologist, you can perform Pediatric Cardiology procedures also, and it should be your subspecialty. So for Surgery they did right grouping, but for pediatrics, we should leave only those specialties that are unique for this branch of medicine only.    And the biggest issue. There are such branches as:  Internal medicine  General practice/Family medicine  Lets take a look at Internal Medicine    Almost all specialties just repeat existing medicine branches.  Aren't Internal Medicine doctors are more generic? Seems like oncology requires Oncologist, which can have also different areas of expertise, but not Internal Medicine doctor.   How can I better conceptualize how specialties and subspecialties are divided up? "
2091,Safety of low dose testosterone therapy on biologically female individuals?,"With the raising awareness about gender identity and specifically the recognition of non-binary identities, new challenges are faced by medicine. Specifically, there are individuals who don't feel comfortable with their own sexual characteristic but they don't desire a full transition to the opposite gender.  In this case, many patients seek a low dose hormone replacement therapy(or ""microdosing"").   Testosterone replacement therapy is considered safe in transgender men, but there isn't any study about long term effect of a low dose on non-binary biologically female individuals(reaching serum testosterone levels above female range but not in the normal male range and without hormonal suppression of the ovary function with GnRH analogs).  I wonder if anyone has experience with this. There are many questions that arise for example: will the ovary over time diminish permanently their estrogen production? Can this low dose therapy increase the risk of osteoporosis? Can it cause metabolic complications? etc. "
2092,Mortality and when a protocol becomes statistically significant,"A study has a placebo given to one group, GROUP P,  and a medication given to another group, GROUP M. This medication could be given to prevent colon cancer, anemia, or any other ailment that may cause death.  A follow up in 5 years is performed. 99% of GROUP M have survived. 98% of GROUP P have survived.   When does survival rates between groups become significant?  Any other information regarding how framing statistics alter the perceived significance also appreciated? In psychology, framing as a loss or a gain changes one perception.  "
2093,What things can trigger scintillating scotomas? Are they sometimes classified benign and not a reflection of a condition requiring further treatment?,"This is a different question than Are scintillating scotomas really caused by cortical spreading depression? If so, how is this known to be true? asked almost one year ago in Psychology and Neurology SE, but I have copied most of the supporting material here.  Question: What things can trigger scintillating scotomas? Can they sometimes be classified as benign and not a reflection of some condition requiring further treatment?    I have read about a visual effect called a scintillating scotoma.     Many variations occur, but scintillating scotoma usually begins as a spot of flickering light near or in the center of the visual field, which prevents vision within the scotoma area. The affected area flickers but is not dark. It then gradually expands outward from the initial spot. Vision remains normal beyond the borders of the expanding scotoma(s), with objects melting into the scotoma area background similarly to the physiological blind spot, which means that objects may be seen better by not looking directly at them in the early stages when the spot is in or near the center.       [...]The visual anomaly results from abnormal functioning of portions of the occipital cortex at the back of the brain, not in the eyes nor any component thereof, such as the retinas.3 This is a different disease from retinal migraine, which is monocular (only one eye).   It is a phenomenon that is believed to occur in the brain.      Scintillating scotomas are most commonly caused by cortical spreading depression, a pattern of changes in the behavior of nerves in the brain during a migraine.   That article is short and includes an impressive looking GIF of an optical image of the brain showing a wave-like pattern of blood volume which seems to come from the YouTube video Spreading Depolarization viewed using IOS. Santos et al. Neuroimage 2014 which links to Santos, E. et al. Radial, spiral and reverberating waves of spreading depolarization occur in the gyrencephalic brain NeuroImage, 99, 1 Oct. 2014, pp244-255.  The first Wikipedia article also says:     Symptoms typically appear gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and generally last fewer than 60 minutes, leading to the headache in classic migraine with aura, or resolving without consequence in acephalgic migraine. Many migraine sufferers change from scintillating scotoma as a prodrome to migraine to scintillating scotoma without migraine. Typically the scotoma resolves spontaneously within the stated time frame, leaving no subsequent symptoms, though some report fatigue, nausea, and dizziness as sequelae.   I don't completely understand the language there; I am not sure if it means that scintillating scotoma is always associated with some kind of migraine, or if they also occur as isolated events.

2095,Why would anyone use finasteride (propecia) over minoxidil (Rogaine) for hair loss?,"So as I understand it, there are two main solutions for male pattern baldness:  Finasteride and Minoxidil.   Finasteride works by reducing the production of some hormone that is damaging to the follicles, so already I am not a fan since it's a hormone treatment rather than an actual scalp treatment. On the other hand, Minoxidil is a pure scalp treatment. It actually is about your hair and helping it grow.  Finasteride is also quite expensive. Minoxidil is far cheaper, since you can buy 3 flasks that will last you several months, while 1 package of Finasteride pills only last 30 days.   Finasteride has many (serious) side-effects. There are sexual side-effects, possible risks of prostate cancer, and some men even get boobs. I know the last one is quite rare, but the sexual side-effects are worryingly common. I've read it happens to roughly 5 % of users ... that is a lot, in my honest opinion. On the other hand, Minoxidil's worst side-effect is probably some rash or something.   So with all this in mind, why in the world would anybody choose Finasteride over Minoxidil? At least one ought to try Minoxidil first, no, and then only go to Finasteride if Minoxidil don't work? "

2097,How does scientific community view traditional medicine?,"For a lot of the parts of the world ( especially the underdeveloped ones), traditional medicine is viewed as the alternative to ( and sometimes more superior than) modern medicine--western medicine, as it is called in China.  My question is, how does scientific community view traditional medicine? Does it view it as something to be shunned by the patients, because traditional medicine is not subjected to rigorous clinical test? Or does it view it as something that requires active research, but in the meantime, can be used by patients when all modern treatment fails? "
2098,Possible iron/protein defeciency in vegetarians," Is it possible for vegetarians who eat plenty of dairy food to have iron or protein deficiency? Are there other demonstrable health benefits from eating small amounts of shellfish? Or is there evidence it can be bad for health in the way red meat can be?

I am a biologist, and would appreciate some scientific explanation and references/evidence in answers if possible.  The questions [website]"
2099,How does a MRSA test work?,"Let's assume we have a patient with acute infection. The doctor suspects MRSA. A culture is taken, brought to the lab, and then what?   I'm interested to hear what are the usual steps a laboratory takes to determine the bacterial species and also the subtype. Do they only rely on the way the bacteria look under microscope, do they do some kind of antibody test, or something else? Is there a standard procedure at all, or are there different methods?   Also, the test can come back as ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""inconclusive"" for MRSA. What makes a test ""inconclusive""? Does it mean that they tried killing the culture with an antibiotic and only half of it died?  "

2106,Why do ~80% of children with autism appear to improve when they have a fever?,I read on this WebMD article (published in 2008) that children with autism appear to improve when they have a fever. What could explain it?  One hypothesis mentioned in the article is that:     fever may affect brain function at the cellular level by influencing the production of immune-system signaling proteins known as cytokines.   Is there evidence to support this hypothesis in newer studies? 
2107,Effects from changing up the type of carbohydrates consumed,"What change, if any, would the types of carbohydrate being consumed have on body composition and mental state?  For example, I have a 3100 calorie per day diet. Those 3100 calories are equally spread across fats/proteins/carbohydrates (33% each) and are consumed in 6 equally-sized meals. Around 440 of those calories are marked on the nutritional labeling as coming from ""Sugars"" (not exactly sure what carbohydrates ""Sugars"" includes, but I'm assuming that it's just sucrose/glucose/fructose).  If I were to replace half of my sugar intake (220cals/55g) with something more complex (e.g. oat starch), what type of effects should I expect it to have on my body composition and energy levels / mental state? Does it matter when those sugars are consumed?  Note that the overall calories being consumed are the same. "
2108,Estimating the blood circulation around the epicondyles of the humerus,"Decreased microcirculation has been shown to contribute to the lateral epicondylitis symptoms (1). Is there any home medical equipment that a patient suffering from epicondylitis could use to estimate the blood circulation around the lateral and medial epicondyles of the humerus? The article uses Laser Doppler Flowmetry, which is a non-invasive method to estimate the blood flow (2), but it doesn't look very affordable. The goal is for the patient to quantify to what extent some activities or food increases his blood circulation.    (1) Oskarsson, Eva, et al.

One specific drug I'm concerned about is bupivacine, which, I read affects me more powerfully than the typical person.   I have read the information from 23 and me about this condition.

2113,Is regular nightly usage of earplugs healthy?,"Should one avoid daily usage of earplugs?  SteadyHealth writes:     Regardless, wearing these earplugs in the long run may prove to have certain health risks as well. The long-term earplugs may lead to excessive accumulation of earwax and debris inside the ear, possibly leading to the occurrence of tinnitus, hearing loss, ear discharge, pain or infections in the area. In order to avoid this, keep the ear and the earplug clean.   SpecSavers writes:     Continued use of ear plugs may interfere with the wax migration process and lead to a build-up of wax, which can cause temporary ear pain or dulled hearing.      [...]      The second possible consequence of continuous use of ear plugs is an increased risk of ear infection.   Are those concerns something that the average person should care about, or are they overblown? If the average person should care about it, what risk mitigation strategies should they follow? "

Statins are one of the most widely prescribed agents. They are also often prescribed for prevention of these conditions.   My question is who should take statins for prevention? Persons with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking history, family history of heart disease or everyone above a certain age? Should both men and women take these agents? What are the exact indications of starting statins for prevention?  Thanks for your insight. "
2118,Is there any clinical evidence supporting or infirming the usefulness of stem cell therapy to treat a lateral epicondylopathy for humans?,"I have read some claims about the usefulness of stem cell therapy to treat a lateral epicondylopathy.  Example (mirror):     Innovative treatments that include stem cell therapy, supplements, growth factors and platelet rich plasma are injected into the injured area. These treatments have proven incredibly effective in reducing inflammation, easing pain and promoting the healing of the damaged tissues.   [website]  Race horses are especially prone to injuries of the tendon and ligaments. Conventional therapies are very unsuccessful in returning the horse to full functioning potential. Natural healing, guided by the conventional treatments, leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue that reduces flexibility and full joint movement. Traditional treatments prevented a large number of horses from returning to full activity and also have a high incidence of re-injury due to the stiff nature of the scarred tendon. Introduction of both bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, along with natural mechanical stimulus promoted the regeneration of tendon tissue. The natural movement promoted the alignment of the new fibers and tendocytes with the natural alignment found in uninjured tendons. Stem cell treatment not only allowed more horses to return to full duty and also greatly reduced the re-injury rate over a three-year period.[78]      The use of embryonic stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair. The embryonic stem cells were shown to have a better survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. The overall repair quality was also higher, with better tendon architecture and collagen formed. There was also no tumor formation seen during the three month experimental period. Long-term studies need to be carried out to examine the long-term efficacy and risks associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.[78] Similar results have been found in small animals.[78]   Is there any clinical evidence supporting or infirming the usefulness of stem cell therapy to treat a lateral epicondylopathy for humans?

2120,Disinfectant spray in first aid kit for cycling and hiking?,"On a recent bike trip I slipped on a gravel road and got abrasion around the knee. The wound was dirty with gravel dust and I instinctively cleaned it with water from my drinking bottle. Then I went to a pharmacy and got it disinfected (Octenisept, wound disinfectant) and then covered with a sterile patch. A few days later I want to my physician and she did the same thing again.  There are a lot of affordable first aid kits available in outdoor shops and I want to get one for the next trip. All of them contain various bandages and compresses. Disinfectant spray seems to be missing, though. My experience now is that the essentials for abrasions are spray and some bandage to keep out the dirt.  While trying to research this, I found a help page of the German Red Cross stating that it is forbidden to (a) touch, (b) clean, (c) apply powder, creams, sprays, disinfectants and (d) remove foreign matter. Exceptions are just thermal and acid burns as well as rabis bite wounds. Any wound must be treated by a doctor as soon as possible.  If I apply that to my case, I would have taken a bandage from my (to be purchased) first aid kit and wrap it around the wound with all the dust still in it. Then I would have to go to the ER of the next hospital.  In contrast, the manufacturer of the spray writes that it intended for small wounds like cuts and abrasions that happen during sports. And it gives instructions for usage, so this implies that a layperson should apply it to wounds.  Perhaps it is also a legal issue? The Red Cross addresses the general public which tries to help but sometimes overdoes it. So they just state that one should be very conservative when helping. Say one applies the wrong kind of disinfectant spray and it makes it just worse. In Germany you are not liable if you just try to help (to some extent). Perhaps this waiver stops right where you apply things and not just a sterile bandage? So even though in this particular situation it would be the right thing, a layperson would not know and therefore the general advice is conservative?  Please excuse my medical naivity, but isn't applying water and then desinfectant spray better than just wrapping up the dirt? "
2121,Checking nutrition balance,"I've just started to explore nutrition.  I assume that:  a1) A human body needs some minerals and vitamins, which can be delivered either in food or as supplements  a2) There's recommended daily amount of each mineral for an average-case healthy human.  What I'd like to know now, without digging deep into each topic:  1) Can a blood test show whether an amount of minerals and vitamins in my body is good for me? Do I need additional tests (bones? etc)?  2) Say, a blood test can show nutrition balance only for today. And I want to know if my nutrition-rich food is digested well. Can a blood test show me if my yesterday's diet was good? Or are that results weaker or not-actual?    I am interested in any opinion with proof-links.  Thanks in advance.           "
2122,What evidence is there that not taking bipolar medications can damage your brain?,"It is often stated serious metal illness if not treated can harm the brain development.  What basis is there for this?  Are there verifiable tests for such?    Example for this:      Usually, when we think âbrain changesâ we think it means something bad, like damage or stunting. But itâs important to remember that untreated mental illness can also harm brain development. Early medication can help prevent the illness from getting worse or becoming neurally entrenched.

2127,Link between shaving body hair and weaker scalp hair,"I suppose this question can be addressed to both males and females, but it would be interesting to know if it varies between the two genders (hormones, etc).  I want to know if shaving body hair (chest, legs, armpit, etc...) or even facial hair (beard) has an impact on the hair in your scalp? Will it deplete the body of nutrients like keratin and vitamins that are needed in keeping a strong, healthy head of  hair? Will it accelerate existing hair loss resulting from androgenic alopecia (Male pattern baldness)?  Here is my hypothesis:      Human hair needs nutrients from the blood to keep the follicle   healthy. If you shave body hair it will obviously  grow back, but this requires   nutrients. The same nutrients could have been used to go towards the   scalp hair and keeping it healthy and strong. But instead, more of the   body's resources are going towards other hairs and as a result will   deplete the scalp from nutrients and cause weak limp hair. And if you   are already predisposed to hair loss (via genetics), then this will   result in an accelerated rate of hair fall.   I am curious to see if anyone has done any research or if there are any studies on this. Obviously there are many swimmers or cyclists who shave their entire bodies and still have luscious strong hair which can only attributed to 'good' genetics and healthy active lifestyles. If anyone has done any research that either supports or disproves my hypothesis, do not hesitate to leave a response! "
2128,Why not getting rid of Toxoplasmosis pathogens completely?,"I read it that a high percentage of mammals, including humans, carry parasites that cause Toxoplasmosis. Through my reading, it appears that it isn't really a ""serious"" disease. Nevertheless, considering that it is caused by parasite, and it may alter human behavior and cause mental disorders, I want to know:  Is it possible to get rid of it completely? As in purge the body of the parasite.  Why it is being viewed in such a nonchalant manner, in most cases? Why isn't it tackled like some other infections? "

2133,Can one meet 100% of recommended daily intake without consuming too many calories?,"I'm a person who doesn't need much energy (maybe even 1500 calories is too much), this means that every calorie I consume is very precious.I've noticed that it's incredibly difficult to meet 100% of RDI without consuming too many calories (2000+).Every article I read about nutrient X rich foods, I find something weird like ""this food is very rich in that nutrient"" (but it actually contains only 3-15% of RDI per 100g), am I supposed to eat a kilogram of certain food just to get enough of 1 nutrient?For example, most articles on the internet say how broccoli are rich in calcium but 100g meets only 3-5% of RDI (why is there so much misinformation regarding nutrition?).When all of this is considered, does one even need to meet 100% of RDI every day?

2136,Why is there no toxoplasmosis vaccine?,"I assume there is some misunderstanding on my part about the vaccine-creation-process and which factors play a role in it. Below is my current understanding.  About toxoplasmosis:  Toxoplasmosis is a disease that can infect both humans and cats. It doesn't have a lot of symptoms, i.e. if you have it, you might not even notice. After you have had it, you are immune to further infection because your body has toxoplasmosis-antibodies now.  Toxoplasmosis is dangerous in one situation: if a pregnant woman gets it, it may cause disabilities in the baby (even at later ages when he/she grows up) or even abortion. This can only happen if the woman has not had the disease earlier in life, because then she would be immune. (It's also dangerous for people with a weakened immune system, such as hiv-patients, but you can't vaccinate them anyway so let's disregard them for this question.)  About vaccines:  Vaccines are weakened or dead virusses/microbes that cause a certain disease. The body recognises them as a threat, makes the appropriate antibodies and remembers these antibodies in case it encounters this disease again. When the non-weakened disease shows up, the body doesn't need the time to invent/create the antibodies anymore, so it can start to destroy the disease before it becomes too strong.  This only works for diseases for which your body can invent antibodies (given enough time), for which it will remember the antibodies and for which the pathogens don't evolve fast.  My question:  Why is there no toxoplasmosis-vaccine available? It seems toxoplasmosis is an ideal vaccine-candidate: the body can create antibodies and will remember them. The pathogen doesn't even need to be dead or weakened, since the symptoms for the disease are so low. It seems to me that this vaccine would be ""just"" inserting the toxoplasmosis-germs into the patients blood.  I'm thinking about a vaccine for women who are not pregnant. Obviously inserting toxoplasmosis into pregnant women is a bad idea.  Possibilities that I thought of:   The toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite, which may be too big of a difference with virusses/mirobes to create a vaccine out of? But why would that be harder? Toxoplasmosis may have annoying pathogens, that don't want to survive and reproduce in a lab, so you'd have to hunt the parasites down in ""the wild"" for every vaccine, which doesn't seem to be feasible. Something causes such a vaccine to be too expensive for the hasstle. Nobody wants to fund research to create such a vaccine, because other diseases are more dangerous.   Related question: [website]"
2137,Safety of radiation from baby monitor,"I have always assumed baby monitors and all wireless technology to be completely safe and have been informed by a 'friend' that I have been endangering my children by using them.  We used an RF detector to measure exposure and it amounted to a constant level of 10mw/m2 in the crib, whereas, for comparison, my cell phone at 30 cm distance measured occasional peaks of 1mw/m2. More advanced wifi monitors measure up to 100mw/m2.  She mentioned the following links as evidence of her fears:  [website]This site claims:  Well, guess what? Your kid may not be doing so great. The baby monitor next to their slumbering form is emitting radiation similar to the kind that is given off by a cordless phone and bombarding their not-yet-fully-formed skull with electromagnetic frequency radiation. These emissions are a known cause of childhood brain cancer...  Why introduce a known carcinogen into your home? Would you have a cigarette in your babyâs room and then blow the smoke in their face? I donât think soâ¦â¦.  [website]This site claims  There has been a 60-fold increase in ASD in recent years, which cannot be accounted for by improvements in diagnostic methods and can only be explained by changes in the environment. This increase corresponds in time to the proliferation of mobile telecommunications, Wi-Fi, and microwave ovens as well as extremely low frequency fields from household wiring and domestic appliances. We can now explain at least some of this in terms of electromagnetically-induced membrane leakage leading to brain hyperactivity and abnormal brain development. Dr. Andrew Goldsworthy, former lecturer Imperial College London [1] Andrew Goldsworthy, The Biological Effects of Weak Electromagnetic Fields, MCSA NEWS, VOLUME seven, ISSUE 7, JULY 2012  And also...  Wireless radiation emitted by baby monitors, mobile and cordless phones, wireless modems (Wi-Fi) etc.:inhibit the formation of abnormal electromagnetic activity of the brain, which is stabilized at around age 12, which explains the increasing incidence of hyperactivity and epilepsy in children ages according to Dr. Gerard Hyland, biophysicist at Warwick University and 2 times nominated for the Nobel Prize of Medicine [3] cause the creation of many random and useless neural connections, which explains the usually larger skull of autistic children, according to Dr. Andrew Goldsworthy, former assistant of Imperial College London [4] Detunes the initial calibration of the brain networks and the mirror-neuron system in newborns, leading to autistic behavior patterns (Thornton [5]) and are a possible cause of the contemporary increase in cases of autism (Kane [6]) ""The adverse effects of electrosmog may take decades to be appreciated, although some, like carcinogenicity, are already starting to surface. This gigantic experiment on our children and grandchildren could result in massive damage to mind and body with the potential to produce a disaster of unprecedented proportions, unless proper precautions are immediately implemented."" Paul Rosch, professor of medicine at New York Medical School [7]  These mainly rely on evidence as reviewed in the Bioititiative Report, which I know is widely critisized.  So, have I been endangering my children or is my friend just nuts? I fail to see how such miniscule emissions could have a measurable effect on anyone, thermal or otherwise. Is there any robust evidence that radiowaves have any negative impacts on the development of young children? "
2138,hair repigmentation and growth from secukinumab,I saw this study(link) about a patient who received a drug called secukinumab and experienced hair re-pigmentation from white to black and hair re-growth and as you can see the results are pretty amazing. It was noted in the study that the results had nothing to do with the patient's psoriasis and said that it happened cause the drug inhibits the Interleukin 17 cytokine which affects hair graying. So what does this study actually means? that secukinumab(with or without combination with other drugs) can be a potential cure for gray hair and hair loss?.

Usually a hangover takes some time to develop and after that amount of alcohol I do not have a hangover at all. I also drank a lot of water today. Recently I think I had this several times that the headaches started pretty soon after moderate consumption of alcohol. I drink once in a few weeks.  Is it plausible that his is actually a hangover? Is this not too soon? Could the headaches be caused by something else related to the consumption of alcohol like for example blood pressure? What would be the most plausible cause?

So is there any difference between the two? If yes, is this difference only limited in psychotherapy, or does this happen on other fields as well (e.g. physiotherapy)?     The integration of mindfulness into cognitive-behavioral therapy has led to new mindfulness exercises and multicomponent treatment protocols. These mindfulness-based psychotherapies involve teaching patients specific mindfulness skills, such as breath awareness, mindful eating, and other ways of regulating attention. The proliferation of treatment protocols is encouraging clinicians to experiment with mindfulness techniques, even if therapists do not implement the entire protocol.

2143,Can taking escitalopram produce a false-positive result in a urinary metanephrine/normetanephrine test?,"I'm wondering whether taking escitalopram (5 mg/day) might spoil the results of a 24-hour urinary metanephrine/normetanephrine analysis.   I googled and found this mention of escitalopram in Pheochromocytoma: pitfalls in the biochemical evaluation (Dobri et al., 2014):      Although tricyclic antidepressants are known to increase NE/NMN levels, newer classes of antidepressants which inhibit NE neuronal reuptake are potentially associated with falsepositive results. Clinicians need to inquire about the use of   serotonin NE reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, duloxetine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) and NE DA reuptake inhibitors (bupropion). Neary et al. reported a patient with plasma NMN > fourfolds ULN while on venlafaxine, which returned to normal 2 weeks after discontinuation of the drug [64].   However, this article cites only one case report, and that is not for escitalopram but for venlafaxine, which is not an SSRI but SNRI. Are there reports of escitalopram drastically affecting urinary metanephrine/normetanephrine levels?   "

According to the post the drug used is Scopolamine, which according to my research, can indeed cause dizziness, blurred speech and loss of muscle control. When taken in very high amounts it can cause someone to fall asleep for hours.  However, I have never heard of drugs like this working when being put in someones ear?

2145,"Beyond correlation, why is Frank's sign significant or not?","The Wikipedia lists Frank's sign as     Frank's sign is a diagonal crease in the ear lobe extending from the tragus across the lobule to the rear edge of the auricle. The sign is named after Sanders T. Frank. [â¦] It has been hypothesised that Frank's sign is indicative of cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes. Some studies have described Frank's sign as a marker of cardiovascular disease but not linked to the severity of the condition.    But going after the references provided there leads into inconclusive areas.  Frank's sign and coronary disease for example concludes just statistically     Frank's sign is therefore considered as a marker of the coronary disease, independent of risk factors but frequently associated with them. If its absence does not permit in any way to exclude the diagnosis of coronary disease, its presence corresponds in three quarters of the cases to an established coronary disease within a symptomatic population   Similarly unsatisfactory are the results dug up from reference material (Stanford Medicine: Frank's Sign - Diagonal earlobe crease (DELC)) as well as trying to follow this nice agglomeration of thematic papers (Joe Cannon: ""Earlobe Crease And Heart Disease: Is It Real? Review Of Evidence"").  While I would be more interested in the most likely explanation for its existence and relevance: Is it therefore even correct to consider this phenomenon as a purely correlative marker sign or is it as a whole so spurious as to be better left ignored?

2150,"Does eating/chewing honey help prevent gingivitis, periodontal disease and dental caries?","Does eating/chewing honey help prevent gingivitis, periodontal disease and dental caries?  The studies have found so far tend to say yes but it needs to be confirmed by other studies.  From {2}:     Abstract:   Research has shown that manuka honey has superior antimicrobial properties that can be used with success in the treatment of wound healing, peptic ulcers and bacterial gastro-enteritis. Studies have already shown that manuka honey with a high antibacterial activity is likely to be non-cariogenic. The current pilot study investigated whether or not manuka honey with an antibacterial activity rated UMF 15 could be used to reduce dental plaque and clinical levels of gingivitis. A chewable ""honey leather"" was produced for this trial. Thirty volunteers were randomly allocated to chew or suck either the manuka honey product, or sugarless chewing gum, for 10 minutes, three times a day, after each meal. Plaque and gingival bleeding scores were recorded before and after the 21-day trial period. Analysis of the results indicated that there were statistically highly significant reductions in the mean plaque scores (0.99 reduced to 0.65; p=0.001), and the percentage of bleeding sites (48% reduced to 17%; p=0.001), in the manuka honey group, with no significant changes in the control group.      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there may be a potential therapeutic role for manuka honey confectionery in the treatment of gingivitis and periodontal disease.   From {1}:     Within the limitations of the study it can be concluded that topical application of honey can modify the pH, reduce bacterial counts, and inhibit bacterial growth. These data suggested that topical application/chewing of honey might help prevent gingivitis and caries in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. Further studies will be required to substantiate these preliminary observations.   (it's unclear which honey they used. They indicate they got it from Imtenan Co.

2153,Peak effect of edible marijuana 11 hours after ingestion; how is it possible?1,"The chocolates I've been having currently typically take about 5 hours to peak, and the last time I used them, it was literally 11 HOURS later. I ate one dose of about 4mg (I think... I lost the label but it was from a dispensary). I am sure I did not eat any other edibles in between. There's also the factor that I now drink moderate alcohol throughout the high. But can alcohol really cause the high to be so much more delayed/prolonged? Or is it something else?   It's also very high percentage THC and almost no CBD if I remember correctly.   P.S. The amount of chocolate I eat is extremely small. I usually eat literal crumbs. And this time it was a solid 1/4th chunk of a chocolate square, but still very small. So right now my working hypothesis is that there's so much dosage in so little food that there's a high amount of randomness in how it passes through my body? Or maybe part of it got stuck on my throat for a long time? "
2154,"Sanity checking airplane advice re DVT: walk every hour, 2-3 hours? OK to sleep?","Long plane flights carry a risk of DVT. It is easy to find advice on preventing DVT by being active:   CDC says ""walk around every 2-3 hours"" and mentions that you should do this when traveling by car also. This article also mentions that you are at higher risk of DVT if you have active cancer or are receiving chemotherapy. It recommends compression socks, too.  Mayo clinic says ""If you're traveling a long distance by car, stop every hour or so and walk around. If you're on a plane, stand or walk occasionally."" WebMD says ""If you are traveling by car, stop every hour or so. Get out and walk around for a few minutes. If you are traveling by bus, train, or plane, get out of your seat and walk up and down the aisle every hour or so. ""   None of these mention the possibility of sleeping on the plane. Are they suggesting you should not sleep? We all lie down for 8 hours or so every night, and yes, we can toss and turn a little more freely in a real bed, but I find it hard to imagine this advice means ""don't sleep, stay awake so you can walk around a lot.""  Further, there is a big difference between ""every hour"" and ""every two or three hours"" - and that's not counting good old ""occasionally"". None indicate whether wearing compression socks means it's safer to go for a longer interval between walks.   So, if a person with at least some risk factor for DVT is going on a long (11 hrs) flight, wearing compression socks, in business with a lie-flat bed, is lying flat in that bed and sleeping actually as dangerous as sitting awake in economy? What about a 13 hour flight in economy, still with the socks, is sleeping for part of that flight dangerous? This is normal sleep without the aid of Ambien or even alcohol, and thus there will be tossing and turning.  Why I'm asking: I have those flights in my future and a doctor told me emphatically to get up ""every hour"" on the plane and walk around. I didn't think to ask about sleep time, and I have no problem getting up once an hour while awake. But this same doctor knows that I drive two to three hours to and from my appointments, and has never said to pull over the car and walk every hour during a drive. Yet DVT isn't related to altitude, just to sitting still. So I feel the ""every hour"" is probably a little overcareful. But I am interested in what the studies show, and specifically on the matter of sleeping, in business and in economy. I am not asking for a diagnosis or to override my doctor's advice. I just want to sanity check it since we didn't discuss economy vs business and lying down to sleep. A study showing the effects of following various advice regimens (and that includes overnight flights where people slept or stayed awake) would be great. "

2167,Are generics tested for side effects?,"I have been reading about generics vs brand-name drugs.  I've learned that generics go through extensive testing for bioequivalence (both rate of absorption and total absorption of the active ingredient).  The statistical testing regime sounds pretty substantial to me, as far as testing of effectiveness goes.  Are generic drugs tested to ensure their risk of side effects will be roughly equivalent?  Or, are there reasons to believe their side effects ought to be equivalent, in magnitude and likelihood?  I understand that generics may have different inactive ingredients.  Could this cause the risk of side effects to be materially different between versions of the same drug from two different manufacturers?  Or is that super-unlikely?  Should I discount/ignore concerns about the potential for variation in side effects between manufacturers?    (I do understand that there is a small risk that a patient is allergic to one particular inactive ingredient that's one formulation but not in another, but for purposes of this question, let's ignore that.  Apart from that, could there be noticeable, reproducible differences?  Or is this unlikely?)  (I have read What can the variability of strength be between different brands of supposedly identical medications?.  I know enough statistics to understand why claims that ""generics can be up to 45% different in effectiveness"" are highly misleading.  I've read about studies indicating that the average difference is more like 3% or so, and is probably similar to or smaller than the range of variation among different batches from the same manufacturer.  But those seem to be measured by absorption into the blood, and I'm not sure what that implies for the risk of side effects.) "
2168,Is there any downside of using ultrasound guidance when performing injections to treat a tendinopathy?,"The result of (1) published last week showed that when performing injections for tennis elbow, only 3 out of 10 were correctly localized (!). Is there any downside of using ultrasound guidance when performing injections to treat a tendinopathy? (aside from the cost of the ultrasound machine, which is actually pretty low, ~1kUSD)     (1) Keijsers, R et al. Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc (2016). Injection of tennis elbow: Hit and miss?

2170,Will smoking about 10 cigarettes per year over about 50 years virtually do anything to your health?,"So I don't smoke but I am wondering if someone were to say smoke about 10 cigarettes per year from about age 20 to age 70, would it affect their health in any way? Would they still be more prone to lung cancer, ventilators, diseases, chronic cough, etc.?  "
2171,The enamel of our teeth are softer/harder at various points in the day? Brushing after a meal harmful to enamel?,"Growing up, I was always taught to brush my teeth after eating breakfast, but should I be brushing my teeth before breakfast? The reason why I brushed afterwards was to remove the food bits/taste remaining in my mouth so it's fresh and clean for the rest of the day. But one of my friends, working on his degree to become a dentist, says that brushing teeth immediately following a meal is not the optimal time because that's when the enamel in our teeth is the softest... so we could, in fact, be harming our enamel by brushing away at it when it's so soft.   I had no idea that the softness-hardness degree of our teeth's enamel fluctuated in a day.    How/why does the soft/hardness of our enamel change in a day? Is it temperature? Saliva? Acid? How many times a day does the texture of our enamel change?  When is the optimal time to brush our teeth? An hour afterward brushing?  "
2172,"Can a woman tell which ovary, during ovulation, released the egg? Can she feel pain (due to follicle rupture) particular to one side?","During ovulation, one of the de-graaf-follicles in one of woman's ovaries will rupture and release a mature egg, which will then descend through the Fallopian tubes and into the uterus, where it will implant into the endometrium, until the endometrium's lining is shed (if it's not fertilized), correct?   I know every woman is different, but is it possible for a woman to feel the rupture of the follicle/release of the egg, and essentially know which ovary contributed to that month's ovulation/menstruation? Like can she tell if it was the right or left ovary? (The ovaries switch off each month, right?) Is it common or rare?  "
2173,What should be done if a person is stabbed?,"I have seen in almost all video-games and movies that when someone is stabbed by a sharp knife, the victim ""takes out"" the knife from his body. Does it help the victim in anyway? What should be the possible ""first-aid"" steps that can be taken to prevent death of the person? Can the knife stay in there till the medical help arrives? Or is there nothing constructive that can be done ? "
2174,Why does high blood pressure cause tinnitus?,"There are multiple reports on the internet where people state that they got tinnitus from high blood pressure. Usually it is related to exertion or having an orgasm.     Just wondering if anyone has t from high blood pressure? [...]   Mine is from excessive orgasm, crazy I know but I think the negative effect of it was major high blood pressure in my head/ ears. [...] I have white noise in both ears, morse cued in both as well as other tones.   [website]  When I signed up for workouts at the gym, it made my tinnitus worse and it affected my left ear as well. I was advised not to lift weights and do strenuous activities.   [website]I have experienced this effect myself both after having and orgasm and while working out and exerting harder than usual.  I know chronic high blood pressure can cause pulsatile tinnitus, but my question is directed at non-pulsatile tinnitus.  I see multiple possible explanations: 1: High blood pressure elevates the intracochlear pressure. This might cause hearing cells to be compressed to death.  2: High blood pressure restricts the blood flow to the hearing apparatus, which would cause insufficient oxygen supply. "
2175,Is stress linked to ulcers? What causes ulcers -- let alone bleeding ulcers?,"People are always telling me to stop stressing so much otherwise I'll develop ulcers, and it seems to me, that for a long time stress was often associated with the development of ulcers. But I believe that it is much more complicated than that and why stress may be a contributing factor (as it seems for everything else), that it is hardly the culprit for an ulcer.   What causes ulcers? To what extent is it linked to stress?   And what are bleeding ulcers anyhow? "
2176,How could Lyrica (pregabalin) cause hallucinations?,"I've heard of this happening on rare occasion, but I cannot figure out a sensible mechanism.   I have some limited understanding of neurology and the function of GABA, and I know that ethanol (a GABA receptor agonist) can certainly cause visual disturbances and rather dramatic changes in mental status. I do not, however, understand how pregabalin (a GABA analogue) could create the intense hallucinations described here. They seem more like something experienced from the effects of more widely-known hallucinogens, like LSD, which (AFAIK) work via more monoamine routes.  Can anyone explain how this drug could cause hallucinations of the type described in these cases? I am specifically curious about the links between the change in GABA receptor behavior and the changes in perception described. I realize that any decent answer to this question would need to be fairly detailed, so partial answers or nudges in the direction of sources of more relevant information would still be greatly appreciated. "
2177,Nasal corticosteroids and hypertenstion,"Can corticosteroid nasal sprays such as Nasonex (mometasone) and Rhinocort Aqua (budesonide), effect blood pressure? Do topical steroids like that enter the blood stream in such a way that they effects the whole body?  My condition: I have sinusitis and recently was diagnosed with high blood pressure (might be caused by different causes, weight, stress, etc.).  I am a bit confused, my ENT doctor says that corticosteroids don't; while my cardiologist says they do.   If you have any related studies or any hard evidence to support any of the claims please tell me and what do you think in general? "
2178,Sensitization and Ischaemia,"In Acupuncture, Trigger Points and Musculoskeletal Pain (3rd Edition), Baldry advances the following:  ""When the Myofascial Trigger Point nociceptor-sensitizing substances bradykinin and prostaglandins are released into the tissues as a result of trauma-induced inflammation, they give rise to the development of both vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability.The effect of this is to cause oedema to develop with compression of veins and resultant tissue ischaemia. As a consequence of this a vicious circle is liable to be created because the ischaemia then leads to the release of still more MTrP nociceptor sensitizing chemical substances.""  Why does vasodilation and increased vascular permeability entail oedema and vein compression?  Shouldn't vasodilation counterbalance vein compression and, thus, hinder ischaemia? "
2179,Altitude Sickness & Brain Damage,"I stumbled on an article about altitude sickness and causing permanent brain damage; is there validity to this for less extreme mountaineers?  It is common for Colorado front rangers to ascend up a 14,000+ ft peak in one day starting from Denver @ ~5,500.  I myself just this last weekend went from Colo Springs (~6,100) to Monarch ski resort and summited on Murkwood Point which is 12,500 feet, thus doubling my elevation in one day.  It seems the difference between the climbers outlined in the article and weekend warriors like myself are that most of us don't sleep up at these altitudes. We go ski or hike and come back down that same day, spending no more than 6 hours above 12,000 feet; the article says you can contract brain damage even if you don't feel symptoms...   I'm curious if climbing to lower-high altitudes (8,000 -13,000)  is enough to trigger brain damage; in more detail, is someone coming from sea level up to 8000ft equally as bad as someone going from 8000 to 16000 (since it is 8000 altitude gain either way)? Or does it get exponentially worse the higher you get?  Just want to be careful, because like I said above, it is very common for people to ascend 6,000 - 8,000 feet in a day, e.g. doing 14ers in Colorado and in my mind, this isn't work risking your brain permanently... however, I wouldn't mind if the symptoms go away when I descend.

2181,Affects of nicotine on the nerves,"There are new methods for getting nicotine. For example, vaping. Some people are almost promoting nicotine as a health product that can reduce the risk of Parkison's disease and colitis. Some people are even starting to use nicotine as a nootropic.   What long term affect does Nicotine consumption have on the nervous system? Generally speaking, could it cause neuropathy or perhaps make it better?  Note: I am NOT asking about smoking tobacco or cigarettes, which have many other chemicals. I just want to know about Nicotine by itself. "
2182,ICD-10 codes: required to go to most-granular level?,"Given the example ICD-10 codes below, will a diagnosis code ever not be the most-granular option within a given classification? For example, could a patient's code be left at I21.0 and not taken to the deepest level (e.g. I21.01, I21.02, or I21.09), or is it required that the diagnosis code ""tree"" for a given diagnosis be ""exhausted?""

2183,Why are neck and shoulder pain a common symptom of Computer Vision Syndrom (CVS)?,"I was learning about Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and I noticed that it said that one of the symptoms was ""neck and shoulder pain"". What confuses me is that CVS (or digital eye strain) seem to be a problem experienced by the eyes. However the neck and shoulders don't seem to be muscles very related to the eyes but rather it seems that discomfort in these would be caused by bad posture rather than anything to do with the eyes. If that is the cause how does eye strain causes discomfort in the shoulders or neck or visa versa?   As anecdotal experience (I know its not scientific evidence but it might be the cause of my confusion), whenever I've personally experienced digital eye strain the major discomfort for me has been from the upper part of my eyes or headaches. I think my neck has felt a bit stiff but I find it hard to believe that there is actually some causation between the two, specially because the neck pain is an order of magnitude smaller.   Does someone with more knowledge on this can explain this phenomenon? If the relation between eye strain and neck pain is real it seems that if I were to look down say and bend my neck for a prolonged period of time, that should cause eye strain or if I over use my eyes (by looking at the same thing for long time, say a screen) then my neck should hurt. But it doesn't seem that any information travels from the eye to the neck to the brain (rather more directly to the brain).   So essentially with my mental model of how things work, it seems that neck/shoulders issue are more common accompanied to computer vision syndrome due because people that look at screens a lot might also have bad habits of posture but it doesn't seem there an actual causation of one to the other. Am I right in this? "
2184,Can a small monitor + powerful reading glasses be a substitute for a large monitor with same resolution?,"Reading or focusing up close puts strain on the eyes and I believe can be bad in the long run. With that in mind, would keeping my monitor at a distance (3-4 feet) and using the right set of ""magnifying"" glasses for that distance be better? Are there any drawbacks of using such magnification for a person with otherwise normal eyesight?  "
2185,Is echolocation common among the blind? Or not so much? How to learn to echolocate?,"We know that echolocation is common among the animal kingdom, e.g. bats, dolphins, etc., but I've read it's also possible among humans as well (granted, we are a part of the animal kingdom too).   I know humans do not emit sonar sound-waves, but I read that humans have the ability to echolocate on some level, and it makes sense that blind people are more likely to learn to echolocate than humans with the capacity to see, but is it common for blind individuals to know how to echolocate? Stats?   Also, how do blind individuals learn to echolocate? Is it something they pick up naturally because their hearing is sharper due to sensory substitute or are they trained to make clicking sounds? How does it work exactly? How can I learn? "
2186,"Is there any truth behind violent & risky (suicidal) behavior occurring with lunar cycles, i.e. full moons? Why (if actually true)?","Rumors have been perpetuated that emergency rooms and jail cells are full during full moons due to increase in risky and violent behaviors. Is this just an urban legend or is there any merit of truth behind it.    If there is some form of legitimacy to it, what is the medical (or geophysical) reason behind it?

Goose Egg:  I know a Goose Egg is a bump sustained from an injury (I think?) in the shape of an oval (hence, the name). I know they typically occur on foreheads, but is it exclusively to the forehead? What is it exactly?   Charley Horse:  Are Charley Horses also a painful bump or are they cramps? Caused by injury or what? Is it like a Goose Egg on a leg? This I'm not so sure about...  "
2188,Catch a cold from the grass?,"Every time I play with the dogs in the backyard, then the next day I get what feels like a 24-hour head cold. I've verified this at least 7 times. This doesn't happen to me when we run around on any other grass or anywhere else; it's specifically my backyard.  I first noticed it when the grass was all dead and we would run around and lots of dried grass dust would get kicked up.  Now the grass has grown back to being green and I don't think nearly as much dust gets kicked up but it still happened to me last week.  The symptoms feel like weak/sick feeling over my body, mildly sore throat, sneezing episodes, and runny nose. Other than this, I never get sick or have sneezing/runny nose.  So is it possible to catch a cold from a backyard? Can a specific patch of grass have a high concentration of cold viruses? "
2189,"Does the tailbone (coccyx) serve a present function? A few people have been born with tail appendages, right?","Because of evolution, I know that the human anatomy is comprised of a few vestigial elements, and the tailbone (coccyx) is listed among one of them.   But doesn't the tailbone still serve a present function? Like aren't muscles and such attached to it? And doesn't it help our posture when sitting? Or does ""vestigial"" mean we don't use it for the same purposes as our earlier ancestors? Or how is it classified?  I've heard that a few people have actually been born with the tailbone appendages -- is this accurate? I suspect that they were surgically removed when the baby was born. What is the name for when someone is born with the actual tailbone appendage?  Also, is the condition of spina bifida the condition were the fetus started to grow a tail, but it never fully developed?  "

Its validity is for only one month, now its validity expires. I'm using it and I had no issues. The optometrist told me to use it just 12 hours per day and to remove that lens when I go to bed. I didn't want to do that and I'm continuously using it, but still no issues for my eye sight. Is this a safe thing to do?  Now I'm feeling some pain on my eye. I can't able to see without a lense.

2191,Is any dietary fat excreted unmetabolised?,"Dietary fat contains lots of calories, just like carbohydrates.  But the metabolic response differs.   For example, for ingested fat, the body has a much lower insulin response.  Is all the fat you eat metabolised or stored, or does the body have a (protection?) mechanism to respond to large amounts of dietary fat by simply letting it pass straight through? "

2194,Is Gestational diebetes common to all pregnant women? Can the unborn develop complications from mother with Gestational Diabetes?,"I work as an Industrial Training student in a government Hospital and every Tuesday, happens to be our Immunization clinic. Then a Health talk proceeds.  During the Health talk which was conducted by my Mother. She is a Public Health Nurse. While giving a health talk to the mothers, she asked if they were ever diagnosed of Gestational Diabetes, and every single mother present(Nurses, Breastfeeding mothers and a few that came for ante-natal) all said they had been diagnosed of Gestational Diabetes. They signified by raising their hands.  It makes me ponder if Gestational Diabetes is heriditary or if its a common occurence for pregnant women. Do all Pregnant women experience it or only a few cases of probably 10% dont?  That being said, could it be responsible for Childhood Diabetes, that is, Juvenile Diabetes(Type 1)?  or   If not being responsible, could it be a contributing factor?  What other complications could there be for the unborn child? "

I would bet that most of the people who are diagnosed with this kind of cancer wear glasses. 
2196,classical conditioning of glucose levels?,"I've edited this so it hopefully meets the guidelines of this forum.  I'd like to know if there are any studies that demonstrate an anticipatory effect similar to classical conditioning, increasing glucose levels prior to exercise.  For instance, is there any evidence that fasting blood glucose can be modified by a habit of early morning exercise?  According to the Mayo Clinic optimal fasting blood glucose should be &lt; 100 mg/dl, but blood glucose should be > 100 mg/dl before undertaking intense exercise.  Are there any studies that indicate your body ""learn"" to manipulate its glucose level in anticipation of exercise? "
2197,Does premenstrual tension/stress persist after menopause?,"""Premenstral stress/tension"" (PMS/PMT) as commonly defined does exist  I don't want to upset anyone by downplaying the real effects of PMT/PMS.  Reports such as those pointed out by the NHS aside, I have witnessed how the problem affects many women (if not all women to a degree) every month.  Another NHS page points out that     It's not fully understood why women experience PMS.      But it may be because of changes in your hormone levels during the menstrual cycle.   And, I know that women have a finite number of eggs available in the ovaries and they are all there at the start of maturity. After they are gone, no more will become available.  Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting in the loss of ovarian follicle development (Stotland &amp; Stewart, 2008). Is the stress and tension specifically linked to menstruation or if it can continue into later life (after menopause)?  It seems that Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is still released post-menopause. Does premenstral stress/tension persist past menopause and if so, are any of the other relevant hormones still released in the same proportions after menopause at the time menstruation would have occurred?

2198,If and why is McDonald's food considered extremely unhealthy?,"From my childhood I remember vehement opposition to fast food in general and in particular to McDonald's. While I believe the notion that McDonald's is extremely unhealthy is obviously widespread, I will nonetheless provide an example to not seem empty-worded: [website]I am uncertain why is that so?  Superficially, this is what McDonald's food consists of: A sandwich filled with meat, cheese and vegetables.  While I am certain such food can be claimed to be sub-optimal (white bread, too much meat, ...), it nonetheless does not seem to be horrible in comparison with the typical alternatives (eating such self-prepared sandwiches at home, but with fewer ingredients). And yet McDonald's was attacked much more vehemently than the concept of sandwiches.  Are sandwiches themsevles considered the worst kinds of junk food?  Or are sandwiches from McDonald's significantly worse than sandwiches in general? "
2199,How can I find PET scan dataset about Alzheimer disease?,"I am doing a research based on a paper.  In the original paper, the authors used FDG-PET images on the ADNI website. The data-set consists of all participantsâ baseline scans, including normal controls(NC) participants, mild cognitive impairment(MCI) participants, and Alzheimerâs disease(AD) participants. By 48th month of the follow-up, some of the MCI patients have converted to AD while some haven't.   Our goal is to use the baseline images of AD and NC to define an algorithm and then use it to determine which MCI patients are going to convert to AD. (""image"" means 3D functional data)  I have requested an account on ADNI and have asked the author for data issues, but in case she won't reply to me, I am trying to find an ideal dataset by myself.  Q1: I couldn't find an ideal set of images on ADNI. Anyone familiar with ADNI website could point out what should I do to find them? Like which filter should I use when searching?(MRI images are also good if we really couldn't find ideal PET images.)  I don't merely need the baseline images, I also need their status 24/48 months later. It is somewhat hard for me to find a project like this.  Q2: If not on ADNI, are there other websites recommended that offer publicly available PET scan images of AD&amp;MCI&amp;NC?  Thanks. "
2200,"What are the complications of ""an obese woman exercising to lose weight at primigravida pregnancy to prevent Large-for-gestational age"" on fetus","Obesity prior to pregnancy has been associated with higher rates of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorder. Some infants born to women who enter pregnancy obese, are at high risk of becoming overweight during childhood and developing type-2 diabetes in life.  There is a tendency that obese women could give birth to a Large-for-gestational age child because of maternal diabetes.  Weight loss is a contributing factor to reducing risk of Large-for-gestational age in newborns. Nonetheless, there is risk of delivering small-for-gestational age infant outcomes too.  What then is best action to take, because in both ways there are risks and possible unfavorable outcomes.  How severe could the complications of weightloss be on the unborn fetus?   Is there any recent statistic that shows low rate of Health complications on infants from obese mothers? "
2201,How much magnesium can a person really consume without side effects?,"This is the current ""Recommended Daily Allowance of Magnesium"" table:  Age         Male    Female  Pregnancy  â¤6 mo       30 mg   30 mg   â¦ 7-12 mo     75 mg   75 mg   â¦ 1-3 y       80 mg   80 mg   â¦ 4-8 y       130 mg  130 mg  â¦ 9-13 y      240 mg  240 mg  â¦ 14-18 y     410 mg  360 mg  400 mg 19-30 y     400 mg  310 mg  350 mg 31-50 y     420 mg  320 mg  360 mg â¥51 y       420 mg  320 mg  â¦   But that's something approved for the mass public with normal lifestyles and this table assumes no additional factors that drain magnesium (e.g. chronic stress).  Let's assume that due to chronic stress and mental effort a person is symptomatic with magnesium deficiency symptoms like muscle weakness and fatigue and muscle twitches.  So, in such case how much magnesium can a person really eat daily? Does this make any sense whatsoever to eat for example 600 mg of Mg citrate daily or the body doesn't need more than 420 mg daily regardless of the situation? "
2202,Can the daily recommended Dietary Reference Intake be satisfied over a longer timespan?,"Take a nutrient, such as calcium. According to Wikipedia, the RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) for an average healthy 44-year-old male is a daily intake of 1000mg of calcium.  Suppose you consumed, over a week, 7000mg of calcium. On average, you consumed 1000mg of calcium per day, which is exactly the recommendation. That's only the average, though, so you might have consumed 500mg of calcium on Monday Â­(50% of the RDA), and 1500mg on Tuesday (150% of the RDA); and so on, with similar variance.  Are you still satisfying your calcium needs? Is there a rule of thumb for determining that for other nutrients, or any pointers to resources that covers the specific cases? Thanks! "
2203,Is smoke from oil lamp dangerous,"There was a power outage recently in my flat, so I decided to light up some older oil lamp I found. I didn't notice that as the wick was probably too large, the lamp was smoking whole night. When I woke up the next day I figured out that everything was covered in a black dust that probably was caused by this smoke.  My nose was also full of this and I guess my lungs are as well.  Is this sort of dust from oil lamp dangerous? Could I poison myself or damage my lungs? "
2204,How likely is it for someone to develop a serious allergy in adulthood ?,"I always am slightly afraid of food which I know contains allergens, as although I have never had a serious allergic reaction to anything, one of my friends suffers from them. Is there any real (let's say greater than one in a million) probability of developing a dangerous allergy to an allergen to which the adult is exposed to occasionally or regularly before ? What if they were previously unexposed to the allergen ?   From a public health perspective, would restriction of the distribution of allergenic food have any significant benefits ?  "
2205,"Is rest necessary, recommended, or unnecessary in a mild MÃ©niÃ¨re's episode?","During a full-blown MÃ©niÃ¨re's episode, the patient can basically do nothing, so the question does not even occur. But what about mild events in a patient with a MÃ©niÃ¨re's diagnosis?   I am asking about a situation where the patient feels some symptoms (some dizziness, a change in hearing loss) but can still do most activities. Should the patient rest during such a period, and if yes, how much rest is good?   I could imagine a few different scenarios:     All activity during such an episode is damaging, or preventing healing of existing damage, and should be avoided even if it does not cause discomfort The body ""knows"" when the activity is damaging, and discomfort is a good way to judge how much to do There is no lasting damage or episode prolonging due to activity. The patient can decide how much discomfort he is willing to endure without fearing any side effects.  There is no lasting damage through activity, and complete rest can be detrimental, e.g. by making the patient more sensitive/susceptible to future events.    Which scenario comes closest to the truth? How can a patient decide on his activity level? What signs are there that there is too much or too little activity?   Also, if activities should be reduced: is there a difference between types of activities? Is an activity which relies on listening or balance worse than an activity which does not rely on them (e.g. listening to a lecture vs. taking a walk vs. sitting in a chair and reading)? Also, is an activity which is known to be irritating to either hearing (e.g. being around persistent noise) or balance (e.g. being driven in a car on a mountain road with many turns) worse than other kinds of activity? Are physical and mental activities similarly good/bad during such episodes, or is there a difference? "

I consulted many doctors and tried many remedies, but have not found anything that gives me relief.  What else I can do? What the possible treatments for mouth ulcers? "
2207,Can an upper endoscopy spot gallbladder problems?,"Something of a followup to a previous question I asked:  Is an upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD) able to spot gallbladder problems? I have not really found a consistent answer in a few sources I looked at:   MUSC Health: Upper Endoscopy (EGD) makes no mention of gallbladder What is EUS? says an EUS, endoscopic ultrasound, is needed ASGE suggests that a specialized endoscopy (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)) might work (but that seems more complex than an EGD)   However, an upper endoscopy does take a peek at the duodenum. Would there be signs of gallbladder problems there, or not? "
2208,Is dry urine sterile?,"I'm male, and I've noticed that when I urinate, there's sometimes a small amount of splatter which hits my legs and pants. I try to avoid this, but it seems impossible to avoid entirely.  Once dry, is this splatter potentially harmful to me or others? Does the drying kill the germs? If so, how long does it take after drying and how much of the germs (99%? 50%?) are dead or harmless? Are any other non-germ constituents of normal human urine potentially harmful? "
2209,Crohn's disease and sauna,"If you have Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (for example Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis) is sauna good for you or bad?   And how often you can go to sauna? Every day?  I think it can be good because or relaxation, but maybe bad because of extreme heat.  I found this discussion, but it's not clear. "
2210,How to test EMF interference in my bedroom for sleep impact?,"I've been dealing with poor sleep for quite awhile (over a year) and one of my suspicions is EMF interference in my room.  I've tried unplugging everything at night, but didn't notice a significant difference, so I suspect it's coming from some other source, perhaps one I'm not aware of (e.g. the wifi router in the other room).  How should I go about testing my suspicion?  For example, is there a device you recommend that will give me useful readings?  If you had similar issues, was there a strategy / product / solution that worked well for you?  That's the kind of information I hoped to find here more than in electronics.se. I beg to differ only because while the title mentions electronics (tools), the overall context / concern / application is around health.  I spoke to a specialist in EMF health and asked which of the devices are more useful and tend to help most in detecting potential health issues. The specialist said the voltmeter was less useful than the Gaussmeter, and that some ranges of radio frequencies impact human biology more than others. "
2211,Is asthma a disease?,"Our family doctor said that asthma is not a disease, is he right?   I already searched and found every where asthma called as disease. Like [website]  Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways that makes breathing difficult. With asthma, there is inflammation of the air passages that results in a temporary narrowing of the airways that carry oxygen to the lungs.    But I wonder why he told me that? "
2212,What causes optical floaters to be more or less visible?,"When I first started getting floaters in my eyes (several years ago), my opthalmologist told me that they don't go away but over time your brain learns to ignore them/filter them out.  This seems to be largely true in my case; what, at onset, was very invasive is now mostly not a problem.  But sometimes they become more prominent again, usually for a few minutes at a time.  Is this a difference in perception (something is causing me to notice them more) or a difference in placement (they've moved into the center of my field of vision for some reason and are thus harder to ignore)?  How do floaters ""work""?  If this is caused by the floaters moving into particularly inconvenient spots within the eye, is their movement affected by any external factors like posture?  This morning I had a particularly bad attack of this while I was looking down and reading something, and I'd like to avoid a recurrence.  (It was a public reading and I couldn't move what I was reading from -- it had to be flat on the reading desk.)  In case it matters, my floaters were not caused by eye trauma or retina problems; I was told this is just part of the aging process.  I am not asking for a personal diagnosis.  This is a physiology question -- what's going on in the eye (or brain) when floaters are active? "
2213,Does having one's skin pores closed or open affect its health?,"I've stumbled upon a long marketing post about better shaving techniques and instruments, which briefly mentions that ""You should close your skin's pores after shaving by splashing your face with cold water"", but it doesn't describe how it helps anything. The goal of that post was to sell some fancy shaving tools and not really educate people about how to care for their skin (face and the rest of the body). The post however mentioned that one should soak skin in warm water before shaving, so that would mean opening the pores, which even if just for easier shaving, would also result in some additional effects on skin.  So what does it matter if your skin's pores are open or closed? Do you have a better chance of keeping acne off your face either way? What if I like washing my face with warm water a few times a day? What if I live in a cold region where my skin cools off pretty fast? Are there any significant effects I should worry about? "
2214,Water and wrinkled skin. Is being under water for long dangerous?,"After spending extended time in a bath, humans develop wrinkled skin. Is wrinkled skin the only effect of the immersion?

2215,Does the pre-ejaculate of man contain sperm?,"BeforePlay writes in 8 Pregnancy Prevention Myths: Busted:     thereâs also pre-ejaculate to worry about, which does indeed contain sperm and can lead to pregnancy   KinseyConfidential writes in Q&amp;A: Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? :     Sexuality and health educators often warn individuals that pre-ejaculate might have sperm in it and thus could cause a pregnancy.      Theoretically this is true, as there might be sperm that are still âleft overâ in the urethra from a previous ejaculation earlier that day or earlier in that same sexual session (either because of masturbation or sexual activity with a partner). Thus if sperm are âleft overâ in the urethra and then a manâs Cowperâs glands release pre-ejaculatory fluid, and it comes forth to the tip of the penis during arousal, then there is a chance that some sperm could be carried in this fluid and get into his partnerâs body, if they are having intercourse without a condom.   Is the description that sperm doesn't contain naturally in pre-cum but can only be contained in it when there was recent ejakulation accurate or is it also contained naturally? "

2219,"Are tiny brown spots on a tooth a sign of tooth decay? If so, is there a way to stop it from spreading or is it too late? Is it a dead tooth?","In December, I opened a pantry, and a canned-food item from 2 shelves higher, rolled and fell off the shelf, smacking me in face. It was extremely painful, but I was so relieved that I was not bruised or bleeding on my face and at the time, my teeth seemed fine. But over the course of days and weeks, I noticed that the tooth that took the brunt of can's fall, started to develop slight brown lines that I couldn't brush away. And over the weeks, those slight brown lines, are then those became tiny brown spots... And now, one of those spots are growing, despite double efforts to brush and floss diligently there.   I know you can't diagnose me (and I need to see a dentist for confirmation), but can someone just tell me:   Is brown spotted discoloration suddenly appearing on a tooth, after an injury, a sign of tooth decay? If so, how do you stop it from spreading? Or is it not possible? What are the symptoms of a dead tooth? Are they the brown spots? Will these spots continue to spread? Or how does a dentist address this issue?  "
2220,Visualization of a game that you just played,"Do you see video of a game you just played before sleeping? It happens to me almost every time I play a XBOX / mobile / even a simple game for more than an hour or two.  After I play a game, when I close my eyes I see videos of the game I just played. Video appears the second I close my eyes and it is impossible to avoid visualizing. However, I can look around (in my visualization) the objects, move and do all the actions I could in the real game.  This doesn't stop there and continues to my dreams in sleep. Sometimes it even continues to next morning. At work, if I just close my eyes for a second or two it appears again. But by end of the day the effect would be gone.  I'm just curious to know if this is common with others or is it a condition ? what is the effect known as ? Any other info I can get? Thanks.  Update:  Thanks for replying guys. But I do not game too much. :p I do it occasionally like once or twice a month or even less. Although I like gaming I restrict myself from playing it. Coming to Tetris effect, to my understanding I don't think this is Tetris effect. Tetris effect is applying the logic you used in a game in real life. But my case is something different, I visualize it only when I close my eyes. I have observed Tetris effect when I do extensive coding. But that's my job :) "

2222,How does one effectively/safely clean-out or wash their belly button to prevent omphalolith-umbolith (navel stones)?,"This may sound silly, but a few weeks ago, I received a gag gift in a White Elephant gift exchange and received a belly button brush brush like this:   It was good for a few laughs, but it got me thinking... When was the last time I've ever cleaned my belly button? For reals? And how do you clean your belly button specifically? I wash with soap and water around my abdomen, but do I need to do something more? I shower every day like most people, but is that enough?   The person who gifted me with the novelty item of a belly button brush, recently posted this article about omphalolith, umbolith, navel stones onto my facebook to make me squirm and maybe laugh?   And while I found this YouTube video about omphaloliths, that confirms that this indeed happens... Neither the article ^ or the video ^ explained how to properly clean your own belly button. Or how often. Or explained how that impacted dirt starts growing its own hair? "
2223,HOW and WHY does blushing occur when one is embarrassed? Linked to fight or flight primal instincts?,"Blushing -- that thing that happens when you get your first kiss or something embarrassing happens and the spotlight is on you -- WHAT is it exactly? And HOW does it happen? And WHY does it happen?  HOW? We know when it happens, but what is the physiological cause of blushing?    How does our body rush blood to our cheeks (specifically)? Is our body really blushing everywhere, but is it because our cheeks are so thin that cheek skin is more easily to pink up? What is the physiological difference between blushing and flushing? Like a blushed face and a flushed face? Is it because flushing is caused my physical stress of the body, where blushing is caused by emotional stress, and the body has different reactions that somehow look different?   WHY? Most the time our body seems to react due to a physical situation, but blushing  seems like a social response that is triggered by a form of social anxiety.   Is blushing a part of the fight or flight mechanism?  Does/Did blushing serve social or physiological benefits in a Fight or Flight scenario or was it just the results of being in a fight or flight situation?   Benefits?: Is there a primal instinctive benefit that humans once had of turning red in the face in a dangerous or intense situation? Did blushing somehow scare off predators? Or it attracted a mate more in a romantic setting?  Result?: Whatever the reason for the fight or flight scenario, is blushing the result of being in a stressed environment? Like does the rush of blood to our brain rams up our metabolism to run?    "
2224,Walking and running for venis varicose,"Veins varicose occurs in the people, who walk slowly (slow walking is also known as ""standing"" and there is a question asking for how much of slow walking is bad) for the long time. I however see that walking and running are used to prevent it. It is confusing. Is there a minimal speed that demarcates between standing and walking? Is there a maximum walking time limit after which walking changes from preventing varicose to causing it?   I see that my veins swell and stick quite out after a 12-hour walk. Is it ok? Can I go hiking? How far and long (it terms of distance and time) can I walk and run in one iteration, without taking a break? "
2225,How do surgeons select which fixation method to use?,"For bone fractures, there are many different internal fixation methods to choose from when attempting to treat the injury.

2226,Cannot read from 20 metres away - even with glasses,"I have had bad eyesight from birth, and i mean bad. My lenses on my glasses are as thick as anything, without them everything is blurry unless it is a couple of inches away from my face.  Anyway, upon till now this hasn't been a major problem for me as bad eyesight is quite common, I sat at or near the front in class and just got on with my life with my glasses on permanently. Now I've decided to try to learn to drive (In the UK) and before applying for my provisional, i saw a eyesight requirement page so i proceeded to it only to see that i should be able to read a cars registration from about 20m away, so i went ahead and tested it on a few cars on a bright sunny day but i CAN NOT.  No matter how hard i squint, or how close i bring my glasses to my eyes, the text on the plate is just to blurry for me to interpret. i think i can read it from about 15 metres but rules are rules right?  I was hoping for some suggestions as to what to go about doing to resolve this? I mean i need to drive its not an option and i cant get lasik until im 21 (im currently 17).  i was thinking about trying contact lenses but how much difference will they make compared to glasses? "
2227,Termination of possible early pregnancy,"I had unprotected sex with my wife about 3 weeks back. She missed her periods yesterday. In addition to this, she has been feeling weak, her appetite changed drastically, she is usually an insomniac but now is sleeping a lot. She gets food cravings at night. No breast tenderness, nauseated at times(not very much or very frequently), no morning sickness, no vomitings and mood swings.  She also has a kind of unpredictable menstrual cycle. She keeps on missing her periods randomly. Most of the symptoms she is showing are common to PMS and Pregnancy. Only today she had a pinkish brown spotting, which put me into fear. The problem is we have a strike in our city and nearly all of the medical stores are closed so we can't really get our hands on any pregnancy test kits right now.  If it's a pregnancy it's an unwanted one. How can I confirm this pregnancy? And if confirmed, what are the steps that I can take to terminate it without having to go for outright abortion? "
2228,Which is better in general: fresh vegetables or frozen vegetables,"Where I live, we have fresh vegetables in abundance at groceries. We also have frozen vegetables at the same stores.  I have read several articles (I don't have the links right now) which tell that frozen vegetables are better than fresh vegetables.I have a hard time believing that this is the case.  I have the general impression that anything fresh is always better. And if it's possible to get fresh vegetables, I always choose fresh over frozen.  Is it true that frozen vegetables are better than fresh ones? And if so, why is is considered better? "

2230,Do transvaginal ultrasounds break the hymen if one is a virgin? Is it painful for a virgin?,"I was diagnosed with PCOS a number of years ago. Recently, my OBGYN set up an ultrasound for me to check on the status of my ovarian-cysts. I just thought it would be a normal pelvic ultrasound performed on the external part of my body, but I found out it will be an internal procedure known as ""transvaginal ultrasound."" From what I understand, that means the ultrasound wand is inserted into my vagina to take the imaging needed.   I am pretty nervous (honestly, scared out of my mind) because I'm a virgin. Will a transvaginal ultrasound break my hymen as I am a virgin??? How much pain should I anticipate? "
2231,What is the significance of the right lower node in a 12-lead electrocardiogram placement?,"Given this EKG limb leads image, I noticed that the function of the right leg node in a 12-lead ecg/ekg is missing.

2232,Why is Quark Naturally Fat Free,"Why is Quark ""Naturally Fat Free""?  [website]Low-fat or fat-free products often have the stigma that they have been ""made so"" through some form of ""processing"" which in turn removes certain desirable aspects of the food (vitamins, minerals), or adds other undesirable ones (sugar, thickener), do compensate for the removal of the fat component. So a claim that something is ""naturally"" fat-free sounds appealing.  But how can quark be naturally fat-free, when other dairy products are not?  Is it just a marketing ploy?  An example:  You start with full fat milk, you add rennet, you get curds, you drain the whey, you get cheese. Considered naturally high fat. You start with full fat milk, you add some lactic bacteria, you get yoghurt. Considered naturally (relatively) high fat (to the extent that we now ""make"" low-fat ones). You start with full fat milk, you add some other lactic bacteria, you get quark. Which is now magically, naturally fat free? How so? Where did the fat go? Is the whey that is drained out in some versions of quark full of cream? Hardly.  Some Wikipedia research yielded:   [website]  [some type of quark] contains in its basic form about 0.2% fat. Quark with higher fat content is made by adding cream   and     In general, dry mass of quark has 1% to 40% fat; most of the rest is protein (80% of which is casein), calcium, and phosphate.  "

2234,Dietary management for diarrhea,"I have seen general practitioners / physicians recommending to diarrhea patients:   no dietary restriction at all avoid ""irritating food"" such as spicy stuff avoid diary products   Why the different recommendations for the same medical condition? Also, these are advice to be followed with medication. What if no medication is given at all, e.g. when medical help is not available, what kind of dietary changes would be recommended to manage diarrhea, like certain food that could make the diarrhea worse, or perhaps make it better? "
2235,What exactly is fever?,"Pyrexia (or fever) is mostly considered just high temperature, most often caused by infections. Especially in this time of the year, influenza infections that cause fever are quite common.  I would presume that the body heats up in order to kill off bacteria (similar as to why we boil water, and cook food). This doesn't really make much sense when it comes to viruses, as they do not have a similar metabolism.  Still, one symptom of influenza is pyrexia, so I conclude that pyrexia is triggered in some part of the immune system which does not differentiate between a viral and bacterial infection. I imagine pyrexia to be the body's standard response to an intruder of any kind. Am I right here?  I also do have 2 follow up questions:  How does our body increase the temperature?  Is there a fail-safe mechanism (the many deaths caused by high temperature make me think there is none)?  For those who listen to R&amp;B: I'm not looking for the song by Peggy Lee (which is great, by the way) "

2238,Is the macro-nutrient difference between white and brown rice really that significant?,"I've often heard/read that brown rice is a better choice over white rice, because it contains the germ and the bran and so has higher levels of fibre, protein, fatty acids and so on... Unfortunately it takes quite a while longer to cook and doesn't really go well with some of the foods I like to eat with rice, so I usually stick to either basmati or parboiled rice... and feel guilty (I don't really, but it makes for a better story).  So I go into the shop and pick up three varieties of rice of the supermarket's own brand, i.e. all similar packaging/labelling, easily comparable nutritional information (all values per 100g as sold, i.e. dry, uncooked), take a photo of the nutritional information, and I find this:  Basmati rice:        Fat 0.9g of which saturates 0.3g   Carbohydrate 76g of which sugars &lt; 0.5g   Fibre 1.5g    Protein 8.6g   Salt &lt; 0.01g     Parboiled long grain rice:       Fat 1g of which saturates 0.2g   Carbohydrate 77g of which sugars &lt; 0.5g   Fibre 1.7g   Protein 7.2g   Salt &lt; 0.01g     Long grain brown rice:     Fat 2.8g of which saturates 0.7g   Carbohydrate 81g of which sugars 1.3g   Fibre 1.9g   Protein 6.7g   Salt &lt; 0.01g     So this brown rice, which everybody knows as being high-fibre, contains just under 12% more fibre than parboiled rice? And a whopping 27% more fibre than basmati rice, which is about the whitest looking rice you can find? Is that it? It also seems to have the lowest protein content of all the rice varieties looked at here, how is that? I'm really confused by this. I can see a few explanations here:   The difference in fibre really is that significant, although I can't see it, especially since the absolute values aren't very high either.  The numbers are wrong. Well, I would like others to repeat this ""experiment""/investigation in their area to see what they come up with. Brown rice really isn't any better for you than white rice, with regards to fibre intake. The are differences in the nutrient content of different varieties of rice that are more significant than just the mere brown/white distinction  "
2239,What benefits for more EKG leads?,"It seems that the 12-lead EKG is the gold standard for diagnosing many heart problems, but they're limited to fairly short samples (e.g. 30 minutes). Its possible to send a patient home for several days to be monitored with a 3-lead Holter Monitor, or a Zio patch, which clearly does better at detecting transient heart issues, but is limited by the number of leads (?).  Putting aside the additional differences in the monitoring period, what might you hope to be able to diagnose with a 12 lead EKG vs, the single or 3 lead ambulatory monitors? "
2240,Is Klippel Feil Syndrome hereditary? Recessive/Dominant? Liklihood of passing it to offspring?,"I assume Klippel Feil Syndrome (KFS) is genetic/hereditary because my sister and I both have it, and it's a rare disease.  But if I'm wrong, please do correct me. Is KFS genetic-hereditary? My brothers don't have KFS, but are they carriers?  Additionally, does this mean that one of my parents had KFS or that both of them were carriers?  If one has KFS, what are the probabilities that they will pass it onto their children?   Is it a recessive gene/trait (not dominant)?  Basically, I just want to know what the likelihood of me passing on KFS to my children would be -- and if they don't get KFS -- they  become carriers for it, correct? "
2241,Postherpetic neuralgia: Treat or suffer the pain (if you can suffer)?,"Postherpetic neuralgia can be treated by various analgesics, but I'm not sure that I need them, actually I can suffer that pain quite well. But may be analgesics  still do something more then just ""pain control"" or may be ""pain control"" is more then just ""pain control"" and provide some real treatment, nerve's regulation? I afraid that analgesics will just hide the real situation (may be good for clinic, but not good for me).  Details: Shingles (ZSV) diagnosed 10 day before, treatment by valaciclovir finished, skin is sensitive but nice how it can be after shringles (wraps body around the left). It seems I have moderate problems with immune system (because of my chronic cough?) but not AIDS. Pain is major (burning, shots, cramps) but still is not something that I can't suffer. At least can try suffer for some period. "
2242,Healthy practices: Bad smell in water bottle,"I have this habit of having a water of bottle near me when I go to sleep. Not a while ago I used a plastic bottle for that - I refilled it each day or two.  I read somewhere that plastic encourages bacteria growth (and in general not too healthy to use), and decided to replace the plastic bottle with a stainless steel one.  It has a cork and I close it after each use.   The problem is - the water gets smelly after a day. It get's this weird smell it's hard to explain. Smells maybe like mold. I cleaned the bottle with soap and hot water, but the smell returns after a day.   I thought maybe I should store the bottle without the cork?   What would be the ""healthiest"" way to have a bottle of water near you, with minimal implications like bad smell, bacteria growth, etc? "
2243,How do I safely treat subungual hematoma? Tamarind seeds paste helps?,"Some say that grinding 'Tamarind seeds' soaked in water and applying it all over the toe and letting it dry for more than 8 hours, effectively - if not completely - removes the blackened blood under the nail by absorbing it. And it is repeated until it's completely removed.  Is this true?  I don't find any article or webpage that has both subungual hematoma and tamarind using google.  Is the heated paperclip treatment safe? Is it the only form of treatment that can be done at home?  Mine doesn't seem to be above 40% and it isn't paining.

2246,When is too much running bad for your health?,"In this ted talk, cardiologist James O'Keefe argues that intensive running is bad for your heart. This conclusion is pretty alarming to me, and counter to what I have always thought. Is there a consensus among the medical community that too much running can be detrimental to your health?  If so, under what circumstances? I can understand that extreme distance runners could be doing too much, but what about short distance runners? Do I need to be concerned about high intensity, short distance (say 2-8 miles) runs? "

When taken in excessive amounts what can be the harmful effects?  Are there any harmful effects of sleep deprivation which is a likely result when caffeine is taken in large doses?  Is there any chance of developing any tolerance so that as days of use increase more caffeine is required to get the desired effect? 
2249,What diseases cause a rapid fall in hemoglobin count?,"Which diseases would be likely to cause a fairly rapid decline in hemoglobin count?     In this particular case, hemoglobin count went from 7.6 to 6.4 in 48 hours, despite 2 units of hemoglobin being administered (1 per day).  This seems to be well beyond a mere failure to produce hemoglobin, as hemoglobin decays slower than that.  It seems more like a disease that is actively destroying hemoglobin cells.  Which diseases would do that?   (Healthy 50 year old male patient, no medical issues prior to this except overweight (29BMI).  Came in for shortness of breath, hemoglobin count 8.0 at admission.) "
2250,Why people wash their hands before dinner even if they eat with utensils and not hands?,Many health professionals advocate washing hand before dinner.

Ignoring the bad health effects of a diet with a wrong equilibrium how the composition does not matter if only considering weight loss? "
2252,What approaches can I take to find out my blood type and Rhesus factor?,"I need to find out my blood type and Rhesus factor.  However, there is no medical necessity for this - it's just to know myself.  (as such, I'm aware that medical insurance would likely not cover the costs).  What are the realistic (and hopefully cost effective) approaches I can take to find out this info?  E.g., should I just request such a test to be done at my General Practicioner? (and if so how much would the tests likely cost as far as order of magnitude)?  Should I ask at some fertility clinic since they often care about Rh factor? Would they agree to test a random walk-in male, who isn't a registered sperm donor or patient with them?  Should I just go to Quest or Labcorp office?  My three main parameters to evaluate the proposed solutions are:   Convenience for an New York City, USA resident. The answer shouldn't propose showing up at some free clinic in California :) Reliability of results. The answer shouldn't be ""Do this, but chances are they will refuse to help you because you don't fit their criteria"". Out of pocket costs. I'm willing to shell out a reasonable ([tex]300.  "
2253,When would estimates of renal function based on serum and urine measurements differ as greatly as one being normal and the other suggesting CKD 3b?,"Renal function (GFR or creatinine clearance) as estimated by serum creatinine and 24-hour urine collection should in theory closely correlate.    However, I have run into a case where they differ greatly.  The serum creatinine was measured twice at two separate labs and were in normal range at 0.89 and 1.0 mg/dL, yielding a calculated CrCl of 115 and approx 90. However, the 24-hour urine creatinine clearance results yielded 38 ml/min and 5 ml/min, which would be either acute kidney injury / acute renal failure, or chronic kidney disease / failure (CKD stage 3b and CKD stage 5 respectively).  The test was again repeated a third time and again resulted in 1.0mg/dl but this time a CrCl 70 mg/dl.  This is a huge difference with large ramifications in terms of diagnosis and treatment.  The question is:   What could be the reason for this, and which measurement is the more reliable one?  I've read several studies that concluded that the serum creatinine alone was actually a better predictor of GFR than urine creatine clearance over 24, 4, and 2h. Every cohort study I found online shows an upper margin of error of around 30% where predicted values from serum creatinine fall and measured clearance levels.      There are various factors at play here:   The GFR to serum creatinine is a hyperbolic relation which is a bad function for estimating values greater than 60 ml/min and even as low as 45 ml/min:  ]1 As you can see the entire range of values for GFR is estimated over a small fraction of .5 mg/dl difference whereas values lower than 30 range over 20 mg/dl serum creatinine. The jaffe assay which was used reacts creatinine with picric acid in alkaline solution and spectrophotometrically compared to a baseline creatinine sample with are both measured against a blank. This particular reaction is not as precise as the less common enzymatic assay which does not react with with nonspecific targets      ""The nonspecificity of Jaffe's reaction causes falsely elevated   creatinine results in the presence of protein, glucose, acetoacetate,   ascorbic acid, guanidine, acetone, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides   (mainly streptomycin), ketone bodies, Î±-keto acids, and other organic   compounds."" -wiki    The standardization of measurements within labs and between labs was found to introduce about 5% error(and in 1 sample 25%) when 5 samples over the entire GFR range were sent to 26 different instruments:     After reading many studies online it appears the estimated GFR calculated by formulas are rather inaccurate predictors of GFR, and the creatine clearance is a rather imprecise measurement as well. Here's one study showing standard errors that span 100% when comparing calculated vs measured gfr although it suffers from having only 100 subjects:    One large cohort study of 45000 has good news for young healthy individuals with low creatinine clearance values: The lower the value the slower the decline with age so that even at the lowest 2.5% of 70Ml your average projection is not kidney failure 40 years later:  "
2254,"Is olive oil healthy in general, or only as a replacement for saturated fats?","Olive oil is often said to be ""healthy"".  This study, for example, states:     For each 10 g/d increase in extra-virgin olive oil consumption,   cardiovascular disease and mortality risk decreased by 10% and 7%,   respectively. No significant associations were found for cancer and   all-cause mortality.   It's unclear if such claims are talking about olive oil as a replacement for other dietary fats, or as an addition. Are such studies controlling other factors (like olive oil being chosen by wealthier health-conscious people)?  Also, in the above study, why aren't they seeing an association with all-cause mortality? Should we assume that olive oil lowered cardiovascular mortality, but increased other mortality? "
2255,Is it possible for a specific brand of a vaccine (for Leptospirosis in dogs) to cause hepatic side effects?,"I am a veterinarian in Europe and I am facing an unusual case.  Within the last month, I have seen two different young dogs (3 years and 4 years old) to whom I administered a tetravalent vaccine for Leptospirosis (commercialized since 2012). These are inactivated vaccines which are administered yearly.   One of the two dogs was previously using a similar vaccine from a different brand. The other dog was administered the same vaccine last year.   Both dogs had no signs of disease at the time of the vaccination.  After about 2 weeks from the date of the vaccination, both dogs developed jaundice and anorexia and signs of hepatic failure in lab tests.  In subsequent ultrasound and x-rays, we observed microhepaty in both dogs, the cause of which (congenital vascular defect or chronic) is at present unknown.  Given the age of the dogs, we believe that the microhepaty is congenital; in this case, it is possible that this condition is initially asymptomatic but appears as the animal ages.  Questions:   could the signs of hepatic failure be seen as a side effect of the vaccine (compounded by the preexisting microhepaty)? could the brand (or the batch) of the vaccine have a role?  Note the batch numbers for the two vaccines are different in one digit.   Further notes:   we and other colleagues have been administering the same vaccines regularly with no similar findings for years In a short search, I did not find specific links in the literature between hepatic symptoms and vaccines  "

2259,When is an MRI also an MRN?,"I'm not a medical professional. I have just noticed the mention of MRN - Magnetic Resonance Neurography  as a diagnostic tool for nerve issues.   Now, I know that MRN is essentially a kind of MR imaging; but - how can I tell (given a results disk), if I've only been MRIed, whether I've also been MRNed? Or is it the case that MRN actually involves a different procedure physically rather than a different way of processing the information from the MR imager? "
2260,How difficult is it to actually break someone's neck?,"As a child I was told ""if you break your neck, you die"". I was also exposed to people who are paralyzed, due to spinal injuries.  So clearly, it happens.   In action movies and martial arts, there's the idea that you can just spin someone's head, and defeat them with a single, quick movement.  However, chiropractors do essentially that, and in some of the craziest ways possible. There's literally contraptions that look similar to something you could hang yourself with. Ironically, the use and application of these devices puts you quite literally out of your misery, but not by killing you, but by making you more alive.  Example: [website]This actually feels amazing!  So where's the difference?  What force is needed to actually kill someone when attempting to twist their head/spine?   And why don't chiropractors kill more people? "
2261,How efficient is the human metabolism at converting macronutrients to fat,"My understanding is that carbohydrates and protein that are eaten but not immediately utilised are stored as body fat, provided that glycogen stores are already full. Also, I assume that any fat eaten but not immediately utilised either gets broken down and then stored by the same mechanisms, or else is stored directly.   How efficient are these processes, typically? What is the conversion rate for energy in macronutrients consumed to energy in fat stored? Does the efficiency differ for the different macronutrients? If the calorie values given for macronutrients already account for typical losses in digestion and utilisation, is there still an additional loss in the conversion to stored fat?  Is there an additional conversion loss when stored body fat is used via ketosis? I.e. is the available energy in one gram of stored body fat typically equivalent to one gram of fat eaten?  "
2262,"How safe is low frequency radiation in I.T. edge cases? (5G, etc)","Closely Related: 5G Radiation Dangerous?  Being inundated with all kinds of 5G health statements, (for &amp; against), I noticed a weird trend - the absence of cumulative radiation studies.    Question:  What are the health risks of low-frequency radiation, in I.T. edge cases where there is a far more significant amount of cumulative exposure? - that is, coming from many different sources at once for prolonged periods.  Case: I.T. professionals surrounded by 2.5GHz, 5GHz, 40GHz, signals, etc., in addition to 3G, 4G, 5G, etc.  But, the distinction here is that these I.T. professionals are often, (as in the case of Q.A. teams), surrounded by hundreds of these devices at once.    Background:  According to the NY Times:     The 5G Health Hazard That Isnât - Human skin blocks the even higher frequencies of sunlight.   But, the LA Times mentions this:     Is 5G technology dangerous? Early data shows a slight increase of tumors in male rats exposed to cellphone radiation - The rats were exposed to nine hours of radiation daily, in 10-minutes-on, 10-minutes-off intervals, over their whole bodies for two years. The researchers found increased incidences of rare brain and heart tumors starting at about the federally allowable level of cellphone radiation for brain exposure, with greater incidences at about two and four times those levels.   So, it seems that there is at least some sort of potential for 5G to be dangerous in certain unusual edge cases.  But, what are the radiation health risks for I.T. professionals who are certainly in those edge cases - and much, much, more exposed?  Does being exposed to both high frequency and low frequency, simultaneously, in large quantities, have the potential to increase the risks? "
2263,"What is the ""best"" or most accurate way to measure bodily hydration?","We all know that there are important benefits to good hydration. No question there.  I recently heard about a study (unfortunately I didn't catch the author's name) concluding that water is not close to an optimal hydration solution. The report was riddled with pseudo-sciency sounding stuff (""Plain water doesn't hydrate you, it goes right through you into the urine."") and I thought it was one of the worst reports I'd heard in a while.  While trying to find this study online today, I realized that while there are many ways to evaluate ""hydration"", from simple (thirst, urinary output, urine specific gravity) to complex (serum osmolality, isotope dilution, neutron activation analysis (?), bioelectrical impedance, and others), I am only familiar with a few of these.  Assuming an average healthy person, especially with regard to kidney function, is there any consensus on what the optimal way to measure ""hydration"" is?  Edited to add: For simplicity's sake, consider age to be irrelevant to this question, as with assuming normal kidney function.  Edited to clarify my intention with this question: I'm not asking about people in obvious need of fluids and how to measure success of rehydration. I'm asking more about average healthy people who know the benefits of hydration and therefore try to stay hydrated. Is there a best way to measure that they are, indeed, optimally hydrated? Sorry about the confusion. "
2264,"When taking antibiotics, does every single germ have to die?","When I get sick and need to take antibiotics, I get admonished to carry the treatment until the end, otherwise I am breeding antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Does this mean that when I finish the treatment, there is not a single germ (of a particular type, targeted by the particular antibiotic) left in my body?  I think I understand the mechanism. When I take the antibiotic, the germs do not like it, but are not killed immediately. They suffer and suffer in the course of days. The weaker germs die first and the die hard ones, those who already possess some resistance due to random genetic mutations, die last. Therefore, the overall average antibiotic resistance of the germs in my body is rising in the course of the treatment and then suddenly drops to zero as all the germs are dead. Is this correct? Does every single organism of a particular type die in the treatment? "

Or conversely, there is still no consensus since 2004 when the article I quote was written?:     While immune system abnormalities have been reported in children with   autistic disorder, there is little consensus regarding the nature of   these differences which include both enhanced autoimmunity and reduced   immune function   -Paul Ashwood, Judy Van de Water (2004): ""Is autism an autoimmune disease?"", Science Direct, Volume 3, Issues 7â8, November 2004, Pages 557-562 [website]"
2266,Does light pollution affect sleep quality while already asleep?,"Many articles on internet write about melatonin and its effects (making you tired). A ton of articles also point out how the use of devices before going to bed in modern times possibly decrease the melatonin production. Therefore, (I assume) likely making it harder to fall asleep. But this is all about the process of getting to sleep, before we actually sleep.  A recent Harvard Medical article1 states:     High exposure to bright, artificial outdoor lights during the night may result in sleepless nights for older adults.   Referring to a publication on Nov. 15, 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.  Since many people use their mobile devices in bed up to a few minutes before actually going to sleep and considering the fact that modern cities have street lights that are always enabled at night.  If we ignore the melatonin that is used in the process of getting to sleep but only focus on the sleeping time, during the actual sleep cycles.  Does a darker room with less or no light pollution (by the use of curtains or disabling all artificial lights in the room) improve sleep quality (with all associated health benefits)? In other words does light pollution, while asleep worsen the sleep quality or does it only make a difference during the âfalling asleepâ stage?  I wasn't able to find any studies or information regarding sleep quality in relation with light pollution during sleep. Were such studies performed? Also, I wonder if there are specific moments when the light pollution affects sleep quality the most, for example during REM-sleep or in a specific phase?  1 [website]"
2267,Cartilage deterioration in patient's after ACL reconstruction in contralateral knee,"From literature, about 50% of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction patient's are predisposed to osteoarthritis (OA) later in life due to cartilage deterioration and cartilage damage from the injury [Source 1 and source 2]. From my understanding, patient's, if they develop OA, typically only develop it in their injured leg as opposed to the contralateral.  If they are avoiding weight on their injured leg and mainly using their contralateral leg, shouldn't they experience some cartilage deterioration in the contralateral as well due to the gait asymmetry? Is it because they did not have cartilage damage from the injury in that leg?  I am an engineering student studying biomechanics, but I am trying to understand the importance and relationships between ACL reconstruction and development of OA.  While we're here, also the injured leg experiences decreased knee flexion angle after injury. Does this affect cartilage deterioration if you are applying less forces from the flexion? "
2268,How many people die due to various substance (illegal ones/legal/dangerous ones) per user?,"  It says 88000 people die from Alcohol related causes  What I want to know is the number of people that die compared to the number of alcohol users.  Then I want to compare that with the same ratio for   Alcohol Cigarettes LSD MDMA Meth Heroin Cocaine Crack Cocaine How many death per users per year?   Is death per user increase or decrease in places where those are legal/criminalized?  How do I get that data? Anyone studying this?  It's a simple statistic.   If I did some research I often see graphs like this      The graphs are too subjective. One is made by lancet I think. I forget the rest. I will find some sources. However, I am just pointing out that the graphs are too subjective.  The lancet source is this [website][website]However, this may not convince many skeptics.  The graphs simply say MDMA is less dangerous than alcohol. Danger is subjectively defined.  So I tried something objective.  How many people that use MDMA will die due to MDMA.  I will also take into account that MDMA are less addictive. So yes. We will be comparing those who use MDMA like once every 2 months with heavy smokers. It's still a fair comparison because cigarettes are addictives and MDMA isn't.  I wonder if such research have been done?  Another thing I want to examine will be dangerous that doesn't lead to death. Things like permanent IQ decrease, for example. However, this question ask about something whose meaning is obvious. Death.  Another useful stats is usage vs [website]I wonder if there is any research on that.  This one says that there are 600 death due to MDMA usage [website]However, it doesn't tell how many people use MDMA in US. So I can't compute the ratio and compare the ration with cigarettes.  Sample of good answer will be something like this:  [website]  The death rate for MDMA, assuming that there really were about 60   deaths directly caused by MDMA in 2000, would be roughly 2 in 100,000   users. The death rate from smoking, by contrast, is on the order of   400 per 100,000 users. Even alcohol, Americaâs official âitâs not   really a drugâ drug, nets about 50 deaths per 100,000 users each   year:3     I just want more complete pictures for more popular drugs.  I repeat that again   Alcohol Cigarettes LSD MDMA Meth Heroin Cocaine Crack Cocaine   So we already got 3. Alcohol, Cigarettes, and MDMA. I want more numbers to around those 8 I think?  If it's too broad, then I just want MDMA, Meth, Heroin, Cocaine, and LSD, and Weed.  Partial answer is good enough. So if you know the ratio for weed, then that's good enough. The best answer will be the one that show more. "

The first photo seems less serious than the last one and even though my cast was removed today after almost 9 weeks. I actually feel some pain raising the leg. Didn't feel pain wearing the cast however. I also noticed the fibula and tibia getting closer together. Is this a good sign? The orthopedist says he wants to break the fibula bone (hope I got the name right, the thinner bone behind the fractured bone) in order to speed up healing and prevent a non-union.

Qian, published in the Journal of Economic PerspectivesâVolume 24, Number 2âSpring 2010âPages 163â188, there is a claim made that a diet of potatoes and dairy is sufficient for healthy subsistence. The references for the claim are from the 1960s.   Excerpted:     The New World crop that arguably had the largest impact on the Old World   is the potato. Because it provides an abundant supply of calories and nutrients, the potato is able to sustain life better than any other food when consumed as the sole article of diet (Davidson and Passmore, 1965, p. 285). Humans can actually subsist healthily on a diet of potatoes, supplemented with only milk or butter, which   contain the two vitamins not provided by potatoes, vitamins A and D (Connell,1962; Davidson and Passmore, 1965).    To what extent is this claim true given our current understanding of nutritional necessities for healthy living? If the claim is invalidated by newer findings, is there some limited sense in which it can be made?  "

2284,"Is fainting more common in young men during blood lettings, and if so, why?","I recently underwent a blood test, and during the third vial I passed out. I awoke just as the sixth was being finished and could not immediately stand. The vials were small, only 5ml each if I remember right, and the blood letting was at an NHS hospital, UK.  In the few minutes after this, I discussed it with the nurse, only ever having fallen unconscious once (having hit a nerve cluster in my right knee). She noted that young men tend to fall unconscious far more than another demographic, although could not recall the reason why. I professed no prior knowledge of the subject, although prodded some weak ideas about height being a factor more than gender (I am ~190cm, or 6 feet 3 inches).  Only one semi-satisfactory answer has been offered so far, and it's more a combination of answers than anything. Seeing as full blood donations are never done by children, data is only really available from adults, another nurse I know personally offered from her experience that more nervous patients tend to pass out more often, but that they too tend to be men. It was then theorised that since the nervousness is known to move blood away from the brain and towards muscles, this would accentuate the blood loss, causing unconsciousness. She also said young men were likely more nervous due to inexperience with any meaningful amount of blood.  Is this a simple, personal observation, perhaps even a white lie so as to keep a weakened patient calm, or is this backed by any statistical data? Is any reason commonly attributed to it? "

I think I will be hungry by the end of the day if I eat just once in the morning. But I won't be hungry if I eat 4 times a day at smaller portions? How is that possible?  Which way is it better to eat? Maybe twice a day at 1000 kcal? (9am and like 4pm?) "

2291,Resting heart rate is 40,"I'm not an athlete and definitely don't think I'm fit, I do exercise every now then. my RHR is about 40 and sometimes it goes as low as 38. I used to be able to run a 5k without stopping but I do feel tired now and feel like can't get enough air while running but maybe it's because I'm not as fit as I used to be.  Two years ago I had an ECG done for 24 hours cause the Dr said my heartbeat was very slow and wanted to make use there is nothing wrong with my heart but ECG result came back normal and I was told my RHR in that 24 hrs was 41 bpm but everything was normal. However I'm just a bit worried now as feel very tired and feel I have no energy even though I eat enough food. my question is could I have Bradycardia despite the normal result of the ECG?  shall I ask my GP to refer me to a cardiologist?  just some more info I'm female, 33, my height is 164cm and my weight is 55kg "
2292,Need help with Dementia Hackathon Idea (Professionals experienced with dealing with Dementia patients appreicated!),"Me and my team are planning to go to a Dementia based Hackathon early March and since this is our first actual hackathon we were wondering if you could provide some advice regarding our idea. Here's some background on our team and idea.  Our Team: It consists of four people, three of whom are second year Computer Science students and me. We are all beginners - novices at programming and can somewhat use python. Only one of our friends is comfortable enough with Java so we won't be able to use an android app.  Our Idea: To create a game for dementia patients where we help them retain their memories and cognitive function by asking them to select the right picture of something. For example, if they would like to remember what a traffic light is we would get a couple of pictures from google images (one which is the actual traffic light) and ask them to select the right picture. In our theory this will help reduce the regression of cognitive function by helping patients retain their memory through a fun game and possibly stimulate neurogenesis.  Since only of one of us knows Java we are planning to create a Web based game instead of an android app.  Some Issues: We are wondering on what basis we should be asking the questions ( For example, how would we know that most dementia patients need to remember what a traffic light is?). Another thing is I was wondering if we could somehow collect the data from patients playing the game and do some analysis or show it to a professional so they can assess their cognitive function. However, would that be too advanced for us programming wise (we are only beginners programming wise)?  Note: Since this stack exchange is mainly based on health just providing some advice on our idea would help a lot (like how good it is, some tips to make it better, etc.), although if you have some experience with programming and would like to give us advice as well that would also be great. Although I think I will go to SO after to get programming specific advice. "
2293,"""Cuddle"" Parties boost oxytocin? To what degree does it help with pain management and sleep?","Tis the Valentine Season, and I suppose that's why I was invited to a ""Cuddle"" Party the other day. Haven't heard of one? Neither had I. I didn't go because it's not my thing, but  it's becoming more and more popular in urban landscapes in this ever increasingly isolated world.   The basic concept is that a group of people get together and participate in human contact (in a non-sexual way), and this not only elevates the mental health of the participants, but it has a physical health benefit as well -- thanks to the ""love drug/hormone"" or ""cuddle chemical"" known as oxytocin.   Previously, all my knowledge regarding oxytocin concerned mothers and their newborns (examples: regulates labor &amp; breastfeeding), but it plays a role outside of a mother-infant relationship. Oxytocin is released through social interactions and has manifold benefits, some of which are sleep and pain. This Live Science: 11 Intersecting Effects of Oxytocin article ascribes that one of the benefits is sleep:     Oxytocin released in the brain under stress-free conditions naturally   promotes sleep , according to a 2003 study in the journal Regulatory   Peptides. Ellison said this link makes sense because oxytocin counters   the effects of cortisol, which is the known as the stress hormone. ""It   has a calming effect,"" she said. ""It leaves you feeling tranquil and   loving, and certainly that helps our path to sleep.""   In articles elsewhere, it mentions that Oxytocin also is anti-inflammatory and can help with pain management. Thus... I was wondering:    To what degree does oxytocin released from the brain vis-a-vis a ""Cuddle"" Party (or other social interactions):  -- alleviate pain?   -- induce sleep? Just how much ""cuddling"" is needed in order to garner enough oxytocin for:  -- pain alleviation   -- sleep inducement   "

2295,Why is there no triptan on the WHO's list of essential medicine?,"As a migraine sufferer myself I must admit, the existence of triptanes has made my life much better. If those would not exist, I might risk loosing my job if I have a bad phase of my migraines. So, for me, and for a lot of other people too, I guess, it is definitely essential.  By chance I just stumbled over the WHO's list of essential medicines on Wikipedia.  It lists a lot of important medicine, as far as I understand, but also ""duplicates"" of medicines for the same conditions, but for migraine it only has standard pain medication (and a beta-blocker). Standard pain medication is like taking sugar pills for me during a real migraine. This does not sound like effective migraine medication.  I found this article stating that at least one triptan was planned to be included already in 2007. But obviously this did not happen.     The Committee also recommended that a full application for inclusion of a 5HT1 agonist (triptan) for migraine be submitted at its next meeting in 2007.   I don't want to demean other diseases, but as migraine is in fact listet as a condition, I would have expected at least one more migraine specific drug to be on the list. I would have been fine with the other mentioned drugs being listed as pain killers, but listing migraine and then not listing triptanes seems strange to me.  Why are there no triptanes in the list? Was there an official reason given for them not to be included? "

2297,Did I get Lateral pelvic tilt from left leg overuse?,"Almost 2 years ago I got a knee injury (ACL and meniscal tear) which left me with a mechanically locked knee for more than a month. I could still walk normally without much instability. Fortunately, my doctor suggested physiotherapy which got back the original knee movement and restored part of the muscle strength (not full strength though)  Right after that, I got a scholarship to a PhD program in China so I didn't do anything to it at first. Last year I rechecked with 2 doctors in somewhat reputable hispitals in Xi'an China, both of them concluded after checking my MRI results and performing physical tests that surgery isn't needed (or that it is not worth it) but I will have to stay away from competetive sports.  Now my concern is mostely related to my healthy knee, which hurts me when I put weight on it or if I do activities like jogging.   So to get to my question :  is it possible that my injured leg got a bit longer (maybe caused by weak muscles or loose ligament)? Or is it that I relied on my left side for too long until its muscles became tight which developped a lateral pelvic tilt? If that's the case, should I see a doctor? Or someone with other profession (could you offer an exact name of the profession, so I try to translate it to Chinese)  Recap : - Injured right knee with weak muscles. - Left leg feels shorter (or right leg longer) which causes pain in healthy (Left) knee. Question : who should I check with? (Should I visit another hospital, somekind of physiotherapy place, bodybuilding coach,..) "
2298,False eyelashes: eye candy for onlookers or just eye candy for bacteria?,"Catch someone's eye -- don't catch bacteria for your eye.  A few of my friends don on false eyelashes -- some do it for special occasions, others almost wear them everyday. I have never asked them, because I didn't want to appear to disapprove of their decision to do so (if they are cool with it, then hey... fine), but aren't there a lot of health risks involved with wearing false eyelashes?   Personally, just being very sensitive to adhesives, I get all itchy just thinking about having false eyelashes glued to my eyelid. And I know if I had it done, that I would constantly be rubbing my eyes, which would introduce more bacteria to them, leading to things like trachoma, stys, etc. But is this not a common side-effect of wearing false eyelashes?  Also, I would be afraid that all the false eyelashes would put pressure on my natural eyelashes when I blink, and would result in thinning or loss of my natural eyelashes. Does thinning or loss of natural eyelashes result because of false eyelashes? "
2299,centric occlusion vs maximum intercuspation,"I have found it very confusing that in the dental and orthodontic literature, it is often stated that ""centric occlusion"" (CO) and ""maximum intercuspation"" (MIC) are synonyms (for example), despite the fact that there is tons of research on the discrepancy between CO and MIC (for example). How can CO and MIC be considered synonyms, and yet also be different (and in fact, the difference between them is of interest to dentists?).  Further adding to my confusion, according to Wikipedia, MIC ""used to be referred to as centric occlusion"", but there isn't a reference to back up this specific claim.  Could someone 1) clarify appropriate terminology for me, and 2) provide a reference to support the correct terminology? "
2300,Is there literature or publications where I can find scientific explanation for muscle growth?,"Recently I've got into the argument which involved muscle growth, muscle pain, DOMS and lactic acid. I tried serfing web, but it's hardly trustworthy source of information (to be precise it's REALLY hard to find reasanoble explanation).   I've got several questions which I'd like to find answers to.   How do muscles grow? How long does it take for lactic acid to clear out of muscles? Something about DOMS   So the question is where can I find the real scientific explanation for these kinds of questions? Are there any usefull publications or maybe some litreture? "
2301,Does the saliva of a person just recovered from an infectious disease help to cure another persons having the same disease?,"I have always had this 'weird' thought (But could never quite test it...).

If yes, is the concentration (dose) of them in saliva enough to have any considerable effect directly (without any further artificial concentration or extraction done)? "
2302,Doing Sports while having Mono,"Terribly sorry to bother you with this.  I'm a 28 year old bloke &amp; last week I was diagnosed with infective mononucleosis. However I barely show any symptoms and I feel pretty good. I only went to visit the doctor because my throat was soar en my lymph nodes enlarged. I had NO fever,joint pains, extreme fatigue.(I did feel slighty more tired the last couple of weeks). And my sports performances were going in a downward direction for the last month before the diagnosis.  Being very sportive (running and cycling), I didn't perform any sports for 2 weeks. However I actually feel good. A little bit more tired but not incapacitated.So I want to restart doing sports a soon as possible. I hoped to start next week with some light training (30 - 40km on the bike or running (max) 7 km at an easy pace).  I contacted my doctor(s) and they gave the green light. They said I should mainly listen to my own body. If it feels good, then I shouldn't hesitate to do some light activities.  However I did some reading. And some people said that...  If you start with sports too soon then the body won't fully recover. You  might relapse a few months later. Or even worse, you won't ever fully  recover! And the Mono (&amp; slight fatigue) will remain lingering in my body till the end of my days.   I contacted my doctor, sister (doctor aswell) &amp; brother in law (sports doctor). they couldn't confirm this claim. They all said sports will increase the recovery time. And I should keep a close eye for an enlarged (more sensitive) spleen &amp; liver. Does anyone here have any insight in this matter? Or can anyone debunk (hopefully) this claim? "
2303,How is PCOS officially diagnosed?,"I have been treated for PCOS for about a decade now. But every-time I move to a new place, which happens quite frequently, the doctors always ask me how I was diagnosed with this condition or by what technique was this conclusion reached.   Honestly, I don't recall. I believe it was just my symptoms of being a female with lots of acne as an adult as well as extra hair patches and being in pain and fatigue. Maybe there was a blood test? I'm not sure. And later ultrasounds did confirm that indeed I did have many cysts on my ovaries, but what would have been the correct means/methods by which I should have been diagnosed instead of just going off of my symptoms (which is all I remember for sure)?

2305,"Which kind of muscle has greatest resting metabolic rate; big muscle, or strong muscle?","Due to scientific reports it is held that muscles have an important affect on fat burn, but would the rate be different to big, and to strong muscles? In other words, which type of muscle burn most fat at rest; not so strong, big, pumped-up muscle, or strong, smaller, compact, muscle?     ""Muscle is active tissue that burns calories around the clock even as you sleep, kind of like an engine running in neutral. When you move around, you burn more calories, just like a car will consume more gas the faster you go. Fat, on the other hand, is just a storage of excess energy.

2309,"Is prescription heroin (under Dr.'s supervision) in Canada, helping those addicted taper off of it?","Prescription heroin gets green light in Canada, and I was wondering if this is to help addicts slowly wean themselves off of it under the watchful eye of a Dr.? Is that the goal? If so, are there any statistics showing how effective this route of prescription has been in weaning addicts off of heroin? Or is it more along the lines of ""Well... if they are going to continue to use heroin anyhow... they might as well do so under the safety and watchful eye of a doctor?""   In Kentucky, Overdose cases spike in Louisville: 52 calls in 32 hours, and they administer antidotes to the heroin overdoses (as I assume elsewhere in the USA), but do studies from Canada's approach have data that indicates prescription Heroin would reduce the risk of heroin overdose? Or is it too early to tell? "
2310,The Common Cold - what does the name refer to?,"My mother, a school science teacher, is of the opinion that the common cold gains its name from the fact that you can acquire a cold virus more readily when you yourself feel cold. For example, in her view, if you were to spend a day in a cold temperature with inadequate clothing, or spend a long time standing in a rainstorm, you'd increase your chance of catching a cold.  I can see the potential for this to be true - if your body is at an inadequate temperature, it might be more susceptible to catching a cold (or anything for that matter) as your body is busy trying to keep you warm rather than protecting you from disease.  I argue with her, however, as I understand the name of the Common Cold to be referring to the most common symptom of it, in that it makes your body feel cold, causing you to wear extra clothing.  Could someone please enlighten me as to how the Common Cold actually takes its name, is it one of the above alternatives, or something else entirely? As a bonus, is there actually any merit to my mother's logic - is it actually easier to catch a cold when you're physically colder than your body would prefer? "
2311,"What's up with migraine auras? Why do they occur sometimes with migraines, but not always? What are they even?","When I was a small child, I thought I was performing magic whenever these migraine-auras developed, and I would ask my younger brother if he wanted to see a magic trick. I'd have him close and open his eyes, and I'd say something like, ""Viola! Do you see how colorful they are?"" He never could. I soon realized that the people around me weren't seeing these blotches of colors (scotoma-blind spots), flashing lights (scintilla migraines), and striking zig-zags (fortification spectra) as I was, and these seemingly ""thrilling"" light shows were followed by intense pain in my head. It stopped being fun. I was eventually diagnosed with migraines.   As a migraine sufferer since I was a child (now an adult in my early 30's), I have always wondered what migraine auras are exactly. They often accompany my migraines, but not always.   What triggers migraine auras to develop in some migraine episodes, but not others?  What is exactly happening to the field of vision when migraine-auras occur? Is it actually obstructed or is it more of an illusion (like bordering the line of hallucinations)?  "
2312,Do painkillers cure headaches or just stop us from feeling it?,"I'm sorry if this is an obvious question. I frequently have migraine attacks, and have to take some pills to stop the pain. Now my question is, does a pill stop the source of an attack, or does it just stop my brain from feeling it?  Let's make a clear example:  You have a broken bone, you take a very powerful painkiller (or maybe even injection), so you can't feel the pain in your broken arm anymore. But still, if you apply pressure on the bone, it will still damage the body, regardless of feeling it or not. So it's not curing the bone, it's just preventing you from feeling it.  Now when i have these attacks, i need to stay in dark and rest (as you already know what is a migraine attack), and if i still continue to (for example) use my computer, it will hurt more and more with each second passing. This is an alert from my brain:      Stop doing what you are doing and rest!!   Now i know a simple pill won't cure a major wound or a broken arm,but still, does these medicines cure a headache, or i will still damage my body by continuing my things when i have an attack and take a pill which stops the pain almost instantly?

2313,"Repairing skin, fat, muscle tears","I have a basic question. I have seen videos of wound treatment, where the doctor induces bleeding around the edge of the wound... to create granulation tissue... then suturing the wound.  My question is... what if an open wound dries up... will it eventually close on its own without inducing bleeding at the edges? or is this a necessary part of reattaching skin together.  I have the same question with regards to muscle, fat... if there's a situation where fat or muscle has torn and needs to be sutured together... does bleeding always need to be induced at the tear to promote reattachment. Or can reattachment happen if the tissues are just sutured together?  EDIT: Here's a video. Warning it is graphic:  [website]Watch 2:08-2:27  He talks about roughing up the tissue before suturing. So my question is... what happens if you suture without doing this first... will the skin still eventually close up?  What about an extreme case where the wound has been dry for months... now you suture without doing anything else first... will the skin still fuse together eventually? "

2315,What tests exist to diagnose obstructive and restrictive lower airway diseases?,"I'm interested in the false positive rate of asthma diagnoses.

2321,Can blood flow destroy part of the metal stent in 10 to 40 years?,"If a part of the metal stent has not grown into a vessel, can this part of the stent be washed out by the blood flow in 10 to 40 years (theoretically)?  Also are such cases known that blood flow destroy part of the metal stent in 10 to 20 years (practically)?  For example, titanium + nickel (self-expanding stent).  Clarification: Metal stents can corrode/dissolve, but this process is uneven, so some parts of the stents can dissolve earlier, and some later â then these parts break away from the stent and float to the heart and lung (if this part of the stent has not grown into a vessel)  Question: I clarified the question: what percentage of the different types of effects contribute to stent fragmentation: vessel pulsation, mechanical bending, blood flow?

I'm just curious why.  Like, as long as there's a lot of liquid still left, why is it not re-usable? Is it because there's bacteria or other stuff that transferred from whatever you were sterilizing into the alcohol, therefore reducing its effective % of alcohol, and that's what's important to sterilize, so once you're below a certain % concentration it's worthless.

Many of these children seem unhappy and have pain or are suffering   continuously, and at the beginning of treatment seems to change this   circumstance or at least improve, some smile and others laugh!      These small changes, for many insignificant ones, represent for the   parents a great step and some reasonable expectations, which did not   exist before.   CBD has been proved to regulate cytokines in rats, reducing proinflamatory cytokines and augmenting antiinflamatory ones (Napimoga et al, 2009).  As far as I know, it has been observed people with ASD have elevated cytokines in general (Ashwood et al, 2011).  I know there are not enoght studies of action of CBD, but it looks to act as an immunosupresant, while ASD is sugested to be related with autoimmunity.  My question is:   Can CBD be helpfull for autism because of actions on antibodies?  In other terms:  Can CBD interact negatively with other antibodies than cytokines, becoming harmfull (or helpfull) for an ASD?    -Paul Ashwood, Paula Krakowiak, Irva Hertz-Picciotto, Robin Hansen Isaac, Pessah Judy Van de Water (2011): ""Elevated plasma cytokines in autism spectrum disorders provide evidence of immune dysfunction and are associated with impaired behavioral outcome."", Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, Volume 25, Issue 1, Pages 40-45.  -Marcelo H.

2328,Is it possible to live on a diet of only inanimate/non-living sources?,"One possible reason for adopting a vegetarian/vegan diet is the desire not to have to cause the deaths of living creatures in order to survive, where sufficiently-nutritious alternatives exist. Taking this desire to its logical extreme, and thereby precluding the killing of any living thing, including plants and fungi, has me wondering:  Is it possible to survive on a diet that comes exclusively from non-living sources?  Do we have the technological means of producing energy and nutrients from sunlight without requiring plants as photosynthesing intermediaries? Can nutrients be extracted from mineral sources? Can the full range of vitamins a human needs be synthesized in a lab? "
2329,What is the expected life span of vascular stents?,"What is the expected life span of vascular stents?  For example: Universal (coronary/venous) stent WALLSTENT-UNI Boston Scientific, metal: nitinol = titanium + nickel.   How many pulsating contractions can it withstand? Is it more than 80 heart_rate * 60 min * 24 hours * 365 days * 10 years ~= 400 millions pulsations?   In artery In vein (for extravasal compression - aortovenous conflict - arterial pulsation affects stent in vein)  How many years can (the non-grown into a vessel) areas of the stent be in the patientâs blood flow until these stent areas are destroyed?

2330,What is the cause of the vaping-related outbreak of lung injuries?,"According to the CDC, there are reports of more than 1000 patients in the US with vaping-associated lung injuries, and 23 deaths have been confirmed. The median age of deceased patients is 49.5 years, while the median age of patients overall is 23 years. The first reported death occurred in Illinois August 23rd 2019.  Do any of the following three explanations for this outbreak have factual support?   There is no outbreak. After the first death attributed to vaping, patients with lung disease were asked about their vaping history, whereas before they were not. This explains the rapid rise of reported cases in the last two months. There were similar cases all along, but hospitals changed the questions they asked. Vapers changed the vaping parameters after watching videos like this one (8 of the 10 most watched vaping videos on youtube are about vape tricks). During the hot summer months vaping outside, the viscosity of e-liquid was lower, introducing a second change that increased the substance intake through the inhaled aerosol. The onset of the outbreak was so rapid that no change in products, buying behaviour or vaping behaviour could explain it because these things happen over months and years, not weeks. The cause of the outbreak was a firmware upgrade in the vaping devices that led to a change in vaping conditions resulting in harmful substances created while vaping (for example in a vape dry hit).  "
2331,How to evaluate the results of diagnostic studies: how to prove that new method is better than gold standard?,"I understand how to evaluate therapeutic studies: basically you compare the results of two groups that were chosen randomly. One group gets the new drug, the other group gets the placebo (or the drug against which the new drug should be tested). Neither the physicians nor the patients know in which group they are (double-blind testing). You can clearly see the results and test the statistical significance (e.g. with a t-test, depending on the study design).  I have a problem understanding diagnostic studies. My problem lies in the fact that you do not know ""the truth"", i.e. whether a patient really has the condition which should be diagnosed. Therefore you use the so-called ""gold standard"", i.e. the best diagnostic method so far. There is no problem when the new diagnostic method is worse than the gold standard. Yet I think there might be a problem when the new diagnostic method is better than the gold standard! Why? Because the results will be different which would be interpreted as inferior.  Let me give you an example: Let's assume that a patient really has some form of cancer, yet the gold standard is not able to detect it. The new method is able to detect it and therefore both tests disagree. Because the gold standard is taken as the reference the new method would get a minus point here... although it was right in the first place!  My questions Is my thinking correct? If yes, how do handle this problem in practice? Is there a common term for this kind of problem? If no, where lies my misunderstanding?  Edit Perhaps another (more extreme) example is in order: Let's say the gold standard has an accuracy of 50%, i.e. the toss of a coin. If you had a new method with an accuracy of 100% (so the results of this method and ""the truth"" are the same) and tested it against the gold standard this new method would get an accuracy of only 50% (i.e. the accuracy of the gold standard against ""the truth"").

2332,Is olive leaf extract dangerous for low blood pressure?,"I am 84 years old, with heart failure, diagnosed about 10 months ago, now successfully treated, and my naturally low blood pressure is kept at, or reduced to, a satisfactorily low level. I would not want to reduce it any further. With all other tests OK, I am being signed off from the clinic and expect to continue to live a normal, but careful, life.   My question is: Olive Leaf Extract is said to lower blood pressure, so does that make it dangerous for patients with heart failure and low blood pressure to take for its other benefits? Can it lower blood pressure below physiological boundaries? "

2334,How to do laundry to kill and prevent athlete's foot fungus?,"As you may know, one of the reasons athletes's foot and jock itch fungus are so hard to kill with OTC medicines like Lotrimin and Lamisil is because after you treat it, it is extremely difficult not to reinfect yourself with the fungal spores by re-wearing the same clothes and sleeping in the same bed sheets.  Doing laundry properly is of paramount importance.  I've read on certain sites that in order to kill athlete's foot fungus spores on clothes, you need to wash your laundry with ultra-hot water (140 degrees Fahrenheit).  I have some clothes and a fleece blanket so washing them with hot is not an option because I don't want them to shrink.  So assuming I can't use hot water, what is the best combination to kill the fungus?   Bleach (?) - I've read that bleach will kill fungus such as athlete's foot on hard surfaces, but when used on fabrics it doesn't always penetrate deep enough into the material to completely kill the fungus roots.  I've also read a post where the guy made the following comment:      Bleach removes fungus and mold but also promotes itâs later development... Fungus thrives in high PH environments caused by Bases like bleach... If you must use bleach you should neutralize it with a post acid rinse like vinegar or lemon juice.     Borax Laundry Booster (?) - Some people have said that adding 20 Mule Team Borax to your wash cycle can kill athlete's foot on fabric.  But I've looked at the Borax product packaging and there wasn't any mention of this benefit so I'm a little skeptical. Oxygen bleach (OxiClean ?) -This has also been mentioned, yet I see nothing on the product packaging that says it kills fungus. Vinegar (?) - Vinegar has long been touted as a natural cure for athlete's foot on skin.  Will it work on fabric?  (Note to others: Do NOT mix bleach with vinegar as that can give off toxic gases!) Something else?  "
2335,Is there a good site for drug reviews?,"I have have it difficult to research the drugs I am prescribed. I was wondering if there are any websites that are good sources for reviews concerning drugs. I have no idea how to find a trustworthy source, fake reviews are well known online.   For example, I recently found this site while trying to research my asthma medication: [website]I have no idea if I can trust this website at all. "
2336,Testing intestinal flora in transverse colon,"I have a theory that the transverse colon can be overpopulated with intestinal flora that, when fed sugar, overproduce CO2 and cause bloating/pain specifically in and around the hepatic flexure.  Has this theory (or anything similar) been documented? I couldn't find any literature.   More importantly, how could this theory be vetted? A low sugar diet could be a candidate, but there are plenty of other sugar/metabolizing-related conditions that such a test would rule out as well (diabetes, etc.). I am looking for a way to target this particular theory. For example, perhaps the bacteria that typically colonizes the transverse colon gives off a particular byproduct that might be detectable with blood or urinalysis, etc.  Any ideas? "
2337,Max heart rate questions,"Max Heart Rate How accurate really is the 220 -minus my age = max heart rate formula? I don't even come close no matter what I do. My max should be 187. Most blogs say I'm just not exercising hard enough. Today I tested this theory: Sprinted for 3 minutes. Then, slowed down to a brisk walk (139). Then did it again (145). Finally, I started at a good clip, nearly a sprint and kept it up for 8 minutes and ended with an all out sprint for about 50 yards (155). Is this cause for concern? Seems oddly low for someone who really isn't in the greatest shape right now. "

2342,Can I apply dettol & adhesive bandages on dog bites?,"I always have pet dogs in my house. Day in &amp; day out my dog bites me playfully; sometimes while cleaning his teeth, he closes his mouth suddenly to cut my finger. These happened for quite long since my first dog.   This was the bite one year back          Normally, I wash my hands with carbolic soaps &amp; then leave them.  Though they are vaccinised, I often take a booster of tetanus. But the doctor said it is not always necessary to take tetanus booster every time it bites or scratches. I don't know why he told so.  My main question is: Can I apply dettol or savlon in these cuts? Can I use band-aids on them?    Also, is there any possible explanation of why the doctor told not to take booster all the time after all they are not hazardous drugs, are they?   "
2343,Are there any significant benefits to loud alarms in the ICU?,"I read that the loud alarms in the ICU have a deleterious effect on patients' outcomes. Are there any significant benefits to these loud alarms? Otherwise, shouldn't they use some more discrete alarms(e.g. in their pocket/phone) instead?     Alarms in the ICU can lead to a disruption of care, impacting both the patient and the clinical staff through noise disturbances, desensitization to warnings and slowing of response times [1], leading to decreased quality of care [2,3]. ICU alarms produce sound intensities above 80 dB that can lead to sleep deprivation [1,4,5], inferior sleep structure [6,7], stress for both patients and staff [10,11,12,13] and depressed immune systems [14]. There are also indications that the incidence of re-hospitalization is lower if disruptive noise levels are decreased during a patient's stay [15]. Furthermore, such disruptions have been shown to have an important effect on recovery and length of stay [2,10]. In particular, cortisol levels have been shown to be elevated (reflecting increased stress) [12,13], and sleep disruption has been shown to lead to longer stays in the ICU [5]. ICU false alarm (FA) rates as high as 86% have been reported, with between 6% and 40% of ICU alarms having been shown to be true but clinically insignificant (requiring no immediate action) [16]. In fact, only 2% to 9% of alarms have been found to be important for patient management [17].  "
2344,How to find a good (or appropriate) doctor,"General case  What is the strategy you use to find a good / appropriate doctor?  The current ones I know are:   Randomness Mouth to mouth Reading online reviews   Randomness gives... random results.  Mouth to mouth is not necessarily better because often the friend/family that consulted has not much legitimity to evaluate how effective the doctor was. Often they will judge more the relationship to their doctor that the performance of the doctor. It may be appropriate for certain people but in my case I just expect the doctor to be good, kindness is just a bonus.  Reading online reviews: there's often not much available and it compares to mouth to mounth. Sometimes the doctor has a website and will display his show his research papers but it's usually not the case, and when it's the case that doctor is often expensive and unbookable before 6 months.    My personal case  I don't have any condition that will make me die in the very short term. I have mostly conditions I'd like fixed and that can greatly improve my life. I won't go into details publicly but think about that kind of conditions: stress, anxiety, addiction, sleep, diabete, hormonal problem, obesity...  I am somehow frightened to go to an experienced but passionless doctor that relies on what he learnt at school 30 years ago at school without updating itself at all.   I don't expect my doctor to give me only a diagnostic and pills, I expect him to explain me in a quantified way how my own body work, so that I can adapt my lifestyle I'm a big fan of the ideas behind Quantified-Self. I think we all have a different body and DNA, and we should all take the time to understand how our own body work.  I would like my doctor to be ok with self experiments. I would like him to design meaningful lifestyle change tests and take quantified measures of the results, like blood tests.  So I'd like to know, if you were in my position, how would you search the the appropriate doctor? "
2345,Which is a good size of leg stent?,A stent is a small mesh tube that's used to treat narrow or weak arteries. Some stents are coated with medicine that is slowly and continuously released into the artery. These stents are called drug-eluting stents. The medicine helps prevent the artery from becoming blocked again. [website]What is the difference between big hollow stent and small hollow leg stent? Are there any side effects of big hollow stent? 
2346,Protection against Flu - in 1957?,"I came across a cartoon by Giles from the Daily Express of 28 August 1957. There was controversy about US Armed Forces being stationed in the UK at the height of the cold war. Giles, an acute observer of humanity, was making fun of the fact that US forces in the UK were given ""Anti-Asiatic-Flu"" injections not available to the people that lived here.    What were these people given in 1957? A vaccine? An antiviral? Would it have done any good at all? "
2347,Proper treatment of Chalazion draining,"I have had a Chalazion on my left upper eyelid for about a month now. It had been growing larger, and recently started to form a white head.   I get styes and chalazions fairly frequently, but never this large. I even had one on the other eye that complicated into a diagnosis of conjunctival pyogenic granuloma (excision surgery was recommended, but the tumor went away on it's own after a couple months).  My current chalazion is draining as we speak...   What can I do to prevent infection?    Keep applying warm compress?  Saline solution?

2349,How to prevent sialolithiasis (salivary gland stones) from re-occuring,"Sialolithiasis is a condition where stones (calculi) form in the salivary glands or ducts, blocking the saliva from coming out.  I recently had two stones surgically removed from the beginning of the duct as it exits the submandibular gland:    The left stone is approximately 9mm across.  This was not cheap surgery, so I want to take steps to prevent re-occurance.   What steps should I take? Should I get a regular check to see if any stones have formed? (Small stones &lt; 4mm can be removed with an endoscope). If so, how often? Has there been any research on steps to prevent stone formation?  "
2350,Is it worth testing regularly for oxidative stress?,"I have read that oxidative stress is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, ageing, cancer, and diabetes. Popular health 'buzz' would suggest consuming antioxidant supplements to ward off these risks, but research on the overall health benefits of taking these supplements is mixed.  In any case, it doesn't seem worthwhile to me to treat a condition you might not have, so is it worth testing oxidative stress levels?  In particular, I am interested in whether:   Commonly available oxidative stress tests (FORT and FORD assays?) are reliable enough; It's possible to meaningfully interpret the results of the tests as far as detecting problems; There's something else relevant that I'm missing.  "
2351,"What is a ""contact lens fitting""?","When you go to get an eye exam, there is a fee.  That fee includes the exam, vision tests, and prescription for glasses, if needed.  If you need to get a prescription for contact lenses as well, there is often a substantial additional fee for what they call a ""contact lens fitting""?  What exactly is a ""contact lens fitting"", and why is it so expensive?  Is it basically just a way for the doctors to increase their profit, or is there special equipment required? "
2352,Anaesthesia and sleep,"Having had two surgeries under general anaesthesia recently, I have been wondering... Being under general anaesthesia is physiologically not the same as sleeping. Sleep is needed in humans for restorative processes, a rule of thumb being 6 to 8 hours a day.   However, not all surgeries are like mine and only take one or two hours. Extreme cases, such as separating conjoined twins or complicated brain surgery may take a lot longer, even up to several days.   During and after long surgeries, is the lack of sleep a problem for the patient? How is it managed if this is (or would be) a problem?  "
2353,Do patients who are paralyzed from the waist down maintain healthy bones?,"I was wondering if people who suffer from paralysis, specifically those who can't walk anymore, lose strength in their skeletal structure from the waist down as well.  Also, in theory, if there would be an advancement that would allow them to move their bones with the aid of artificial muscles, would their bones be rigid enough to still support them? If not, would there be a type of therapy combined with supplements that would help them regain strength in their bones? "
2354,"How does cold weather affect blood flow, heart beat, and heart attack?","When I said cold weather makes the blood not flow as well in the body, I would get the refutation that human body has a constant temperature in warm or cold weather, possibly at 36.7Â°C (or 37Â°C), because humans are warm blooded animals.  But in the winter, more people have heart attack and studies have showed that the day after the first snowfall of the year, there are much more heart attacks happening.  (Updated: I can't find the article any more. It said snow shoveling can cause heart attack, but in places where people don't need to shovel snow, the heart attack rate is also higher when it becomes cold.)  How can this be explained with the refutation that ""human body has a constant temperature in warm or cold weather"" and therefore cold weather should not be the issue?  If we do not consider the issue related to holiday stress or holiday social activities, it seems like some articles indicated it is due to blood vessel constricting in cold weather, causing blood more difficult to reach vital organs in the body. There is also one article that is medically reviewed. Is this the primary cause? "
2355,How to go about medical literature review?,"Basically, I am relatively new to research (though I do know the gist of it all but doing it is a bit different than knowing.) in an institute that focuses on research much later, however, I wish to start at least writing a medical stand-alone literature review. I do know it isn't as celebrated as a study-research paper, however, being an independent medical student, with close to no funds, does not allow much liberty, thus to slitter into the research world, this is my baby step.   I have the following questions:  What is the minimum number of references, should one review have?*  What is the minimum word limit to literature review?*  What other aspects, I should keep in mind before approaching it? Like what are the common mistakes that beginners tend to make when writing a literature review?  *I know it varies from paper to paper but what is the general consensus on the minimum number that is appreciated?  To put it simply, the general idea of the research is that a certain environmental factor is further contributing to stunted growth.  If you could help me out that would be amazing.  "

2357,Transport frozen embryo,"I'm no medical student/researcher but couldn't find a better place to ask my question: Me and my wife underwent an IVF procedure last year and had an unsuccessful embryo transfer. We did the procedure in a country other than the one we live in. We're in Canada and it would've cost us close to 25K to do IVF here, but we managed to do it with less than one tenth of that!! Now, we were wondering if there's any ways we could bring the rest of our frozen embryos to Canada so that we can try another transfer here at home? Has this ever been done in the past?! Are the tubes (in which the frozen embryos are kept), similar everywhere? What are the requirements for moving a frozen tube? Frozen embryos are currently kept in Tehran, Iran!  All advices appreciated. "
2358,What is the current standpoint on cooking with olive oil?,"Usually I make dishes by adding a tablespoon of olive oil to the meat or vegetables and just have them for some time on a teflon pan.  I know that frying is done on high temperatures and results in lots of carcinogens.  But now I've read that olive oil's burnpoint is lower than sunflower's. Around 180 Celsius based on the refinedness. And at that point carcinogens arise as well, and this makes olive oil more unhealthy for ""warm"" cooking than sunflower oil.  Does this mean that even the cooking I described above should be avoided with olive oil? Or just frying? "
2359,Can repeated light hits to the head cause brain damage?,Can a single or repeated light hit to the head that is mild enough to not shake the head but is followed by a mild headache or dizziness cause brain damage?  Does the brain need to hit the skull to be damaged? Is it possible to estimate when the symptoms are just sensations and when they speak for brain damage?  
2360,How do STIs and STDs physically enter the body?,"Nurses and health practitioners will tell you to wear a condom to prevent contracting an STD/STI, and will supplement this with ""diseases and infections can be transmitted through bodily fluids which come in contact with cuts and wounds"" etc.  But how does the virus enter the body? which specific parts of the body/organs come into play? Is there a specific part of the penis/vagina where the skin allows the virus to permeate or does it go through the urethra Where does the virus originate from and how does it reach its end destination?

2362,Maternal Mortality Ratio without healthcare,"What is an estimation of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR, number of mother death per 100000 births) without professional healthcare? In other words, how often women die during childbirth in some wild tribes which do not use modern healthcare at all and give birth at home? Or for example what was the MMR in the past, when women all gave births at home without or with poor medical assistance?  I am asking, because I stumbled upon an estimation, which I do not believe to be correct in a book. The estimation was that one of 8 women would die during childbirth without medical assistance. The book is ""Brain Rules for Baby"" by John Medina. "
2363,how long can chronic tension headache last?,"Chronic tension headaches occur on 15 or more days per month on average for more than 3 months. The headache can last for several hours or be continuous for several days. Some studies have estimated that around 1 in 30 of all adults have chronic tension headaches. In my own experience, It has lasted for more that a year and it has not gone. My doctor suggested Preventative medication and pain killers but he believe medicines won't cure the chronic tension headaches. How long can chronic tension headache last? Will this headache go away one day? If the answer is positive, will it come back again? "

So, my question is how much (%) of commercially available medical drugs have a known MOA? And I mean really known to the deepest level, without any doubt.  Thanks, pom "
2366,Why do ergonomic chairs often not support the upper back?,"I have sat in too many chairs that provide a nice cushion for the lower back, and then leave the upper back without support, either by having a back rest that is too low, or one that tilts backwards such that the only way to touch it is to bend backwards. These chairs have always been unusable to me because my upper back tenses up to keep from falling backwards.  How could such a huge design flaw be allowed in a product that is supposed to protect you from back pain?? Am I unusual in the discomfort this causes me and my desire for a chair that I can throw the entire length of my back at, or is this literally a case of cheap designs for users who don't know any better? Is there an ergonomic justification for leaving the upper back free of constraints produced by having a back rest? "
2367,Can a young voice have physical causes?,"I have noticed that some older adults (40+ range) can have voices that sound much younger than their actual age (i.e. an adult sounds like an adolescent).  My question is: could any physical aspects play a part? For instance the size of the throat, the tongue or something else? I am assuming that there are no external factors that are influencing this (smoking, exposure to chemicals, physical trauma, etc). "
2368,Is a study of one research in the field of medicine?,"Medicine is not my field, nor do I have mesothelioma. I'm also not seeking any clinical trials or experimental treatment. However, sometimes I find myself trying my read medical papers, either out of sheer interest or if I have a serious complication. I want to stress that I don't think self diagnosis is a good idea, I just can't help myself sometimes.  I find that quite a few papers I get from PubMed appear to be a ""study of one"". Consider this paper [website]Or this: [website]I'm not saying this is a bad paper, I have no idea. However, I am curious as to how common and accepted this type of paper is within the field of medicine.  On one hand, I can see that for pushing the limits of surgery, or any technique, it is interesting to see what people have had success with, even if it is just one patient. On the other hand, it is just one patient. How can anything be generalized from this?  Is there a difference between treatment with medications and surgical technique? I can imagine that surgical techniques can be replicated with far more accuracy than results from medication, which are plagued by placebo and unclear method of operation (I'm making this stuff up, so please correct me).  Again, I have no grounds of criticizing the work of either of the papers, they are just used as examples, and as mentioned, there are quite a few such papers. Indeed, if I do a search for ""we present a case of"", I get a ton of results for actual papers that lead with this. I'm sure there are many other, similar phrases that are also used for these single study cases.  My question is simply, what does the academic medical field think of this type of paper? Can such a paper, be a good paper? Is it usually considered a ""bad paper"", when compared to a paper that has e.g. many patients that received the same treatments, where variations and complications are discussed? Is this sort of paper simply part of the cutting edge of medical science, that all results are useful? "
2369,Does the use of eye glasses prevent eye disease?,I'm turning 40 and went for my first eye test recently. They said I have nearsightedness. I work on a computer all day.   They gave me three quotes for eye glasses :  Option 1: (Cheapest price)  1.1 Single vision (standard) 1.2 SV ARC Stock  Option 2: (Average price) 2.1 Single vision (standard) 2.2 KF SV CLIMATEYES 1.56 STOCK ARC  Option 3: (Expensive) 3.1 Single vision (standard) 3.2 Accomodative support lens 3.3 Incredible flexi uncoated 1.5 3.4 Blue tech  I'm not sure which option I should choose or I should wait another year ?  If the test results of my eye test changes every year will I have to get new eye glasses each time meaning paying again ?  Any advice will be appreciated. 
2370,Unilateral shoulder injuries due to decades of working in front of a computer,"I desire to learn what unilateral shoulder injuries can develop in one's dominant shoulder (such as of a ""right handed"" or ""left handed"" person), from decades of working in front of a computer and particularly controlling a computer mouse with the arm connected to that shoulder (likely in bad posture).  I found accessible information in the web1 for the following conditions, that seem to me to be caused acutely from accidents (such as from sport), or to be idiopathic with no indication of computer usage as a known or well agreed upon cause:   Rotator Cuff Syndrome Shoulder fractures (including Dislocated Shoulder) Frozen Shoulder Shoulder Arthritis Shoulder affecting Gout Tendinitis   While there isn't much data on shoulder problems in Wikipedia, the only condition I found that might suite this causal pattern is Bursitis, but no Wikipedia article exists for it.  My question  What unilateral shoulder injury will most likely develop from decades of working in front of a computer?  And may I further ask, is Bursitis the only one (if it at all unilateral and not bilateral)?  Notes  1. For example, data at Wikipedia, Mayo Clinic including an interview with their own surgeon Christopher Camp, individual Orthopedic surgeons or clinics websites, Physical therapy clinics, etc. "

2372,How to avoid eyestrain when working with mobiles?,"I've been a software engineer for around 20 years, the old monitors used to hurt my eyes but since the move to LCD monitors I haven't had any problems.  In the last year I've started working with mobile phones, since then I've noticed my eyes getting sore. I know to take regular breaks and stare into the distance, but is there any other advice with working on phones?  For Android I can hook the phone up to chrome and use it via chrome, but it's not as good. For the iphone I have to work on the iphone itself as we don't have macs.  Maybe a magnifying glass or phone holder for the monitor might help, so the phone is at eye level? "
2373,Why aren't superbugs weaker than their wild type?,"A superbug is a strain of bacteria that has become resistant to antibiotic drugs, according to Oxford Dictionary. The reason that it can resist the drug is because it has evolved in the environment which contains the drug. Only those that contain the drug resistant gene can survive and become the superbug.  But why don't they become weaker after the  evolution?   I have this question because I once worked with the resistance of HIV to lopinavir drug. There are mutants of HIV that can resist the drug, however, after the resistance, the structure of the virus itself is more fragile, hence they're weaker than the wild type. This seems logical because in its ordinary environment, the wild type of virus should be the strongest one. Any mutation of it is to fight back the drug, hence it is not the strongest one anymore.  I know that my only true for HIV, a virus, not bacteria. But I don't understand why this logic cannot apply to them. Based on the alarmed of many resources, superbugs are stronger than their wild type. Do you know why superbugs aren't weaker than their wild type? "

2377,"How long should you wait after lunch if you want to take a bath, and why?","Is it true that one shouldn't take a bath after lunch? If so, does it depend on    how heavy the lunch is?  whether one is taking a bath or a shower or bathing in a river?  how warm or cold the water is?    Often, I tend to be in a situation where I go for lunch first and then for bath. So I was wondering, whether it interferes either with digestion or with anything else.   Two contexts for this question (in response to the suggestion in the comments) :   Note : I am not looking for answers for the contexts below, but rather for the questions above.    I have heard a vague saying somewhere, that after a lunch, maximum blood flow is directed to the intestines and a bath might interfere with the digestion. (Purely anecodatal hearsay). I noticed that we burp a bit during the bath, if you have a bath after lunch.  We were once touring a hilly area. We had food at a roadside joint and soon after jumped into the cold river (yes, very cold). After we were back at our room, two of my friends had a severe stomach upset, and two others quite uncomfortable, although I was fine.   "

2381,Is there evidence that the over-avoidance of germs weakens our immune system?,"Is there evidence that the over-avoidance of germs weakens our immune system? Or vice versa: Does the under-avoidance of germs strengthen our immune system?  For some reason I hold the opinion that the immune system needs to be kept busy so it wont get weak. Therefore using e.g. 99.99% sterile-making soaps is counter-intuitive, an letting your kids get low-risk childhood sicknesses like mumps, rubella or chickenpox is ""training"" their immune systems, thus good for them. Is there some scientific evidence that verifies or falsifies parts or all of theses assumptions? "
2382,Can GERD be caused by too little stomach acid?,"Ever since the book, Why Stomach Acid is Good For You, I've wondered if it is true that GERD can be caused by too little, not too much, stomach acid. Is it possible that too little stomach acid can cause GERD? If so, by what mechanism would this occur?  EDIT - After reading the answer below, Iâd like to add a little more information.  I donât disagree with the fact that GERD is caused by a malfunctioning lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and I donât disagree with known causes that would contribute to a malfunctioning LES, but what seems very likely to me is that low stomach acid is an additional cause of a malfunctioning LES. This reasoning behind this is that undigested food is putrefying and rotting, expelling gas within the stomach, then increasing pressure on the LES. It could even be possible that low stomach acid is the cause in a large majority of the cases of GERD.  There is an entire integrative medicine field, aka holistic health, that has identified in many cases GERD is actually caused by too little stomach acid (1, 2, 3). And while I am usually not one to ever listen to this field of medicine, they make some really astute observations.   Esophageal cancer is on the sharp rise, coincidentally in an era with the most robust acid reducing medication available. Stomach acid production declines with age. Food nowadays lacks enzymes, which causes digestive organs to overwork, causing the acid producing mechanism of the stomach to fatigue. GMO Wheat 3.0 has gluten proteins which are undigestible to many people.   I realize this isnât what the mainstream doctors believe, but the mainstream is being influenced by a 15 billion dollar industry. The PPI section in the store is huge. Iâve been to multiple gastro docs, and itâs like assembly line Prilosec prescribing. Two people who know our family, that have both been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, just happen to be taking Prilosec / Nexium for many years prior. Another friend had to have is colon cut out because of a bacterial infection, which could have been caused by the elimination of the bodyâs first line of bacterial defense (stomach acid).  All evidence pointing to low stomach acid seems legitimate, so why not give it proper attention. So here Iâd like to diagram what I believe to be the problem: the step-ladder catch-22 inflammation and putrefication snowball effect. Remember, all of this is on the basis that when it comes to low stomach acid, GERD is being caused by the rotting / putrefication of food in the stomach (due to the pyloric sphincter remaining shut) and the resulting gasses which bubble up past the 2-way LES causing GERD. Then, the rotting food causes inflammation in the stomach which results in the stomach producing less acid, and the problem starts to compound. It basically goes like this:     Eat Meal -> Low Acid -> Undigested Food -> Pyloric Sphincter Stays   Shut -> Putrefying &amp; Rotting (GERD) -> Gastric Inflammation -> Next   Meal -> Lower Acid -> Undigested Food -> Pyloric Sphincter Stays Shut   -> Putrefying &amp; Rotting (GERD) -> More Gastric Inflammation -> Next Meal -> Lower Acid -> Undigested Food -> Pyloric Sphincter Stays Shut   -> Putrefying &amp; Rotting (GERD) -> More Gastric Inflammation -> And So Onâ¦   When you go down this step-ladder road for a few months, the avenue out of it is daunting, if not impossible. In my opinion, we could have millions of sufferers in our country, and for that reason I want to find out the truth. "
2383,Can someone be both prediabetic and hypoglycemic?,"Hypoclycemia seems to have several distinct causes, depending on whether you are diabetic or not.  If you are diabetic, you can apparently become hypoglycemic if you're taking too much insulin. If you're not diabetic, then hypoglycemia can be caused by a variety of underlying disorders.  My question: can someone who is in the ""prediabetic range"" - and hence not taking insulin - become hypoglycemic under any circumstances? If so, what are they?  I guess I'm wondering if there are underlying disorders that cause you to become both hypoglycemic and diabetic, and perhaps you become hypoglycemic first before becoming full-bore diabetic (hence pre-diabetic). Thoughts? "

2386,Should my kid get a flu shot if I'm coming down with something?,"I've been putting off getting flu shots for myself and my toddler because I've been busy, and finding time has been difficult.  Now I'm coming down with the flu. (Or a cold or something - you know how hard it is to tell them apart!)  There's plenty of advice on whether to get a flu shot if you're sick (like this article, and this other article), but I can't find any on whether my toddler should get a flu shot while I'm sick.  Will the flu shot that toddlers get lower their body's ability to fight off a real infection at the same time? That is, is my daughter more likely to catch what I've got if she gets a flu shot now, or will it make no difference, or will it end up helping her body?  Really I'm trying answer, should I take her to get a shot today, or wait until she and I are both healthy? "

2388,Does gargling Hydrogen Peroxide or Listerine help combat cold/flu?,"More specifically, does gargling help prevent sickness when a person feels the early-stages of being sick? (That slight feeling of rawness in one's throat, for example, or a light, abnormal fatigue).   A friend of mine says that gargling during this stage has worked wonders to prevent oncoming sickness. The argument made is that one absorbs the offending bacteria/viruses via the respiratory tractâand gargling with an antiseptic kills off otherwise sickness-causing pathogens. For example, if wearing a mask helps prevent sickness by blocking pathogens from the throat, why wouldn't using an anti-septic on the throat directly similarly prevent sickness?  I think this is a biological oversimplification. I claim that, by the time a person feels any symptoms, said person is already sick and gargling won't help prevent further sickness.  This study claims that gargling with water as a preventative measure (i.e. - before feeling any rawness, irritation, inflammation, or fatigue) reduces the occurrence of respiratory tract infections. While I don't think it's quite relevant in this question, it's the most related thing I could find.    A somewhat tangential point: We both agree that, if there's some placebo effect going on that increases the chances of fast recovery after gargling, then gargle all day! "

Does it taste bad, or does it have serious potential to make one sick?  Clearly, this is an incredibly broad question, so I'll zero in on meats, specifically muscle and organ meats from chicken, beef and pork. What bacteria/fungi/parasites tend to grow on these meats as they spoil, and how are they dangerous to humans?  Edit  I asked this question because there's plenty of information online about the consequences of eating undercooked food, but nothing I can find about eating spoiled food. I'm asking specifically what happens when you eat meat products that have gone bad. "

2392,Weakness in a finger (pianist),"I'm a professional pianist and have been playing for eight years now. I recently noticed a problem in my left hand: if we enumerate the fingers consecutively, 1 beeing the thumb, my fourth finger is very weak compared to the fourth finger of my right hand, and if I position my left hand completely open and try to bend only the third and fourth fingers, I can't manage to keep them together while doing this. Could I have injured myself from practicing too hard?   I'm especially worried, since when I was little I used to bend my fingers backwards really hard, to the point that some of my knuckles got bigger and stayed this way even after I stopped. What kind of injuries could this cause, and what type of doctor should I visit to get my hand checked?  "
2393,Is there an immune deficiency disorder that fits this description?,"I've been trying to do some research for a writing project, but I need some advice to help me identify what specific things I should be researching, because ""immune deficiency"" in general brings up a kind of overwhelming number of possible directions to go in. Ideally, I'm hoping to identify a suitable specific diagnosis for a character, or at least narrow down my options, so that I can focus my research more effectively and improve my chances of an accurate portrayal.  The character is a girl in her mid teens, who's had health issues since before she started school. That's set in stone. Anything else is open to adjustment for accuracy, but here's what kind of stuff I had in mind;   Primary rather than secondary immunodeficiency. Severe enough for her to be absent from school fairly regularly Not life threatening (at least for the time being) She's had to be hospitalised enough times that she's pretty familiar with the process. When she is in school her illness is rarely (if at all) totally invisible. There might be some restrictions on what she can or can't take part in, she might need some kind of medical equipment, she might display some kind of visible symptoms, maybe she just gets fatigued easily? Whatever it is, it's noticeable to her classmates.   So. Anything in particular come to mind? Anything I should (or shouldn't) be focusing on? Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated, and could potentially save my brain from imploding after one too many pages of dense and technical medical literature. "

Before or after brushing teeth?   After: I assume everyone one would say after brushing so you can brush all the sugar out of your teeth so it doesnt sit there all day and rot your teeth out, right? I think this too.  Before: But I also hear brushing right after eating is bad for your enamel because when you eat -- your enamel is soft and you end up being rough on your enamel if you brush right afterwards.   PLUS, is fluoride more protective right afterwards? If I use a fluoride-based toothpaste right before eating a treat is it more effective in protecting my teeth from the sugar rather than adding that layer of protection on after the threat of sugar enters my mouth?

2395,What's this about Chemical-Warfare?! Nerve agents?! What's the difference between VX and Sarin?,"In light of the bizarre murder/assasination of N. Korean dictator's 1/2 bro at a Malaysian airport, the world's ""deadliest weapon of mass destruction"" has been herald as VX in all the news headlines. I haven't heard of it... and apparently not very many others have as well?   VX is part of a group of nerve-agents (organophosphates) that have been created and used as chemical warfare as ""weapons of mass deconstruction."" It can be diseminated via liquid or vapor that has neither scent nor taste, which makes it so terrifying. Watch and learn more about the history of VX on the History Channel clip.  But I don't understand how VX differs from Sarin (another nerve-agent used for Chemical Warfare but possibly in Syria and Iraq)? I don't understand how they differ in their symptoms and manifesting themselves.   Why is VX so much more potent? "

2398,Considering obesity using BMI,Why is it that medical assessments on obesity is based on BMI when BMI scales are inaccurate?  Take for example Phillip Heath (Mr. Olympia 2016)     Height: 5â9â³   Competition Weight: 250 lbs   This gives a BMI of 36.9 when calculated using the formula (Weight in Pounds / (Height in inches x Height in inches)) x 703)  This is considered half way between obese and extremely obese and      a very high risk of BMI related diseases   Now you cannot say Phillip Heath is very obese so why do government organisations and health professions use BMI to rate people's level of obesity and look to reduce access to health care or introduce 'Fat Tax' to incentivise weight loss? 
2399,Is there any definitive prevention for tooth decay?,"I understand (in a too simplified way) that the main cause of tooth decay is the mineral breakdown of the tooth enamel by the action of acids formed from food debris on the mouth.

2400,Calculate U.S. life expectancy for 2025?,"This is the hard data on incidence of specific diseases for the year 1995 and (projected) 2025. I have omitted chronic diseases as a group, although they are projected to increase from 90 million (1995) to 168 million by 2025.  The confluence of aggravators work too well together: quality of life, disposable income, percentage of those depressed, number of those with multimorbidities, and the fact that the incidence shows no signs of stopping.  We may be looking at a snowball effect: If the workforce is undergoing constant depletion and is being increasingly transformed into a burden, the economy will start to shrink, and this will hasten the process of depletion of the remaining workforce. Access to health care will begin to decrease, further hastening disintegration of health, economy and living standards.  I think it is abundantly clear looking at the chart below that life expectancy has no chance of increasing by 2025, but the question is how much will it decrease and how quickly?  And also: what forces exist to help mitigate the damage?    "
2401,Leg apparently slightly shorter after femur surgery,"In august 2016 i managed to fall off my bicycle and broke my femur bone (right greater trochanter). It was an accident and nobody else was involved.  Urgent surgery followed approx. 12 hours after the accident which left me with a 11x420mm Stryker titanium rod inside the right femur. More or less from the hip down to the knee.  Then, 2 weeks hospital care, then home recovery. This went well and i worked with a physical therapist which gradually introduced new exercises, etc. Then I moved to a normal gym which i am still doing after 7 months. I am now almost ok, climbing stairs and walking around, but there is a slight limping i am not able to get rid of.  Now during these 7 months there were a few intermediate checks with the doctor and his team. Two times they measured my hip-to-knee distance with a ruler and compared with the other leg, and it seemed to be ok. I didn't know what that really was about at the time.  Todays x-ray check showed the fracture well recovered, however the doctor finally concluded that my right leg appears shorter by 5mm. That there's nothing to be done at this point and i should keep doing recovery and possibly try wearing a foot silicone pad inside my right shoe. No more checks have been scheduled and i am free to move on with my life.  Now, the questions:   is it normal to expect this ""alignment margin"" in this type of surgery? any statistics that says a broken femur is likely to remain slightly off after surgery? is this something i could potentially never be able to correct either via exercising or possibly other kinds of medical intervention? could the difference in length be more than 5mm, and they said that to sound ""optimistic""? if the difference is real (and it feels like it could be, since i am still limping a bit) and i am never able to correct it in any way, what kind of side effects should i expect? should i double check with another doctor? what are my options?   Thanks for any kind of insight you could provide! "

Please note the water is lake/well water and it is untreated water, non-chlorinated and has not undergone any type of purification  . The only thing added to water mentioned here is the carbondioxide added to make it soda.  So is there a possibility for jaundice or hepatitis bacteria/virus to be present in soda water and if somebody drink that soda, he catch those diseases?  I am concerned as a soda consumer.  "
2408,Why do non-sugary cereals contain twice the iron of sugary cereals?,"I've noticed a pattern that sugary and non-sugary cereals are typically enriched with the same levels of every vitamin EXCEPT iron, which is typically twice as high in the non-sugary cereals.   Here are some examples by percentage of adult-female iron  RDA per serving (double the numbers to get percentage of adult-male iron RDA).   Cheerios, plain: 51% Cheerios, any other flavor:  25% Toasted oats, plain:  45% Toasted oats, any other flavor: 25% Corn flakes:  45% Frosted flakes:  25% Quaker oatmeal plain: 40% Quaker oatmeal, any other flavor: 20%   So I have two questions:   Why the heck do the manufacturers do this?   Do they assume only female hemophiliacs eat plain cereals? How large is the risk of getting too much total iron from diet when you eat these cereals, considering the tolerable upper limit is only 40mg and the average adult male gets 20mg compared to an 8mg adult-male RDA.   Just adding two largish bowls of cheerios to the average male diet would put it over the limit.  "
2409,Why aren't fixed retainers (metal wires) behind front row of teeth affected by the MRI's? Isn't it magnetic?,"I've had plenty of MRI's in my life, and I know the drill: take off the glasses, bra with a metal clasp, hair-tie with a metal band, all metal jewelry, etc. It makes sense. You don't want to put someone adorned in metal inside a magnetic machine.   But what I've never understood is how come it's okay that my fixed-retainer (metal wire behind the front rows of my teeth --- after braces) is permissible in the MRI? I mean, yeah, I can't remove it... so there's that... But I'm not talking about proper etiquette and all that jazz -- I want to know the science behind it.   Why have I never once felt any magnetic pull or anything on the metal wires behind my teeth while I'm having my MRI's?   Would the other metal items I remove (listed above) likely not have an impact either?? It's just because it ruins the imaging? Is that's what going on there? "
2410,Do premiums count towards out of pocket maximum?,There are several terms to think about:   premium - the monthly cost of a plan deductible - the amount you pay before your insurance kicks in coinsurance - the amount you pay after your insurance kicks in copay - also the amount you pay after your insurance kicks in out-of-pocket maximum - the amount you pay before your insurance pays for everything    Two questions:   Do you continue to pay your premium even after you've met your out-of-pocket maximum? Does your premium count towards your deductible or out-of-pocket maximum?  
2411,What to do when an earthquake hits while inside a MRI?,"As mentioned earlier, I had a MRI today... I wasn't in the waiting room for long so I didn't have a chance to read the bright yellow folder labeled ""Earthquake Guide during a MRI.""   But as I walked home, I kept thinking about that folder because it seemed so bizarre to me. Was this a thing that happens a lot that necessitated a guidebook?   I had never considered what would happen if you were in the MRI during an earthquake? Was there actually an official safety protocol for this?  Except... try to wriggle your way out and go somewhere safe?  "
2412,"After recovering from a cold, I always wake up with some phlegm in my throat","I used to never have to clear my throat after waking up, but around 4 months ago I caught a cold that took a long time to clear up.  Now when I wake up, I always find that my throat needs clearing. It never used to be this way. What can I do about it? Should I be worried? "
2413,How do doctors decide on the duration of an antibiotic regimen?,"Many upper respiratory infections, otitis media in children, sinusitis and other infections, are treated with antibiotics (if these are bacterial infections, of course). Doctors usually prescribe a suitable antibiotic for 7 or 10 days.  My question is: how do doctors decide what should be the duration of treatment with antibiotics? Is it according to clinical findings? Is it according to experience and their impression of the patient's complaints? Or is it arbitrary and subjective?  I found this article online, but I'm looking for something more scientific and reliable. "
2414,What are my options to get tested for Aspergers as an adult?,"I'm a (hopefully fully functional) adult, who has exhibited many traits that correlate with high-functioning Aspergers corner of ASD spectrum.  I am intensely curious as to whether a professional would agree with that (as in, am I diagnosed with ASD, or with ""medical student syndrome"").  The problem is three-fold:   I'm not experiencing any issues in life that might stem from that potential ASD. Yeah, i'm a shy introverted geek who likes things to be in order. But none of it is to a degree that has negative impact on life.  As such, i'm not even sure how to approach a mental health professional to request to be tested - my expectation is that ""I self-diagnosed as Aspergers based on online test"" would be laughed out of office real quick. Less importantly, even if the office takes me, the insurance would refuse to cover the tests, again because there's no demonstrable pathology in my life. As a fully functioning adult professional, I'm very leery of visiting a mental health professional; especially with work-provided health insurance.   As someone who lives in Tri-State Metropolitan area of US:   What are the best options for me to get tested for Aspergers? What would be the best ways to ameliorate my concerns outlined above when doing so?  "
2415,Variety in Diet - Animals and Humans,"How come animals don't have any variety in their diets, yet they seem to be strong and healthy?   Gorillas eat only leaves Cows eat only grass Giraffes eat only leaves   Why do humans need such an enormous variety in their diets but animals don't? "
2416,What are the effects of long term benzodiazepines use?,"What are the effects of long term benzodiazepines use?  I suffer from a devastating anxiety since childhood that progressed to a point where I had a panic attack almost every day.  Benzodiazepines (namely diazepam or clonazepam) help my symptoms immensely and allow me to function much better in school, relationships, and other areas of life.  I have managed to taper myself to a fairly low dose, but can't see myself being able to go off of them in the future.  I have seen and talked to multiple doctors, and over the last two years I have tried other medications, but nothing except benzos have worked as well for me: Sertraline, Lithium, Olanzampine, Paroxetine, Fluvoxamine, Imipramine, Fluoxetine, Quetiapine and Bupropion absolutely didn't work.  Others had some benefits that were outweighed by the side effects like (on an efficacy scale): Clomipramine > Venlafaxine > Escitalopram.    I am concerned about the effects of long term benzodiazepines use.  While some papers appoint 'em as very harmful in a long term others don't. Some scientists argue that it's related to permanent cognitive loss (although my notes in college improved since I started taking benzos), dementia and so on... while others say that it is just part of marketing campaign to rocket the ""z drugs"" prescription.  Is there any research on long term HUMAN models? I mean... benzos are around since the 60's... if they were that harmful shouldn't we've already noticed it? "
2417,on what metabolism depends,"Some people have fast metabolism (high basal metabolic rate), but some slow one. Usually it's high for men and decreasing with age.   And fast metabolism is considered as good one, because it keeps you from over-weighting.  But on which factors metabolism and BMR depends? Genetic? Lifestyle? Environment?  Can you change it? If yes, then how? "
2418,What nutrients can support an immune system to counteract intense workouts?,"I have observed repeatedly that if I push myself in an aerobic workout, then not just my muscles, but my immune system also takes a beating. My chance of catching a cold is then much higher. I've made this correlation so frequently that I no longer have any doubt there is a connection.  One solution is presumably not to workout too hard, but can this be solved nutritionally? Is there a set of nutrients with which I can replenish my system just before or after an intense workout to counteract the resulting weaker immune system? "
2419,Is length a cause of alopecia?,"I'm male and I have a long hair. But some people warned me and told me that having long hair makes it more likely to fall.  Nothing I found on the internet really convinced me.  Is it a real cause or just a myth? If it is a real cause, does it happen only (or more) for men?  Should I still go to the hairdresser to cut the ends regularly? Is letting it grow without any cut a bad thing (assuming I take care of it with other ways)? "
2420,How to stop panic?,"I feel fear when I should talk to a girl or do my exams or do things I am obliged to do. It happens in the morning, I wake up with fear and I can't handle the situation. My thoughts are negative and I can't do anything to change it.  I have talked to two doctors; one's solution was to take pills and the other to do a physical program and a healthy diet that will do my body better. I find both solutions wrong.   For the first, I think I will depend on the pills and when I face a more difficult situation, I will need more a powerful pill. I could harm myself with those, right? For the second, maybe I'll be healthier but I believe a healthy diet will not improve the situation of this panic.   What can I do now? I am disappointed. "
2421,How dangerous are cracked teeth?,"Common accidents can lead to tooth injuries. A tooth that has fallen out obviously needs a dentist, but cracked teeth are on a line between important and ignorable. How does this type of injury affect the patients' health? What are the potential consequences of leaving a cracked tooth untreated?   "
2422,Harmful to eat meat from livestock/animals with high levels of cortisol (stress) hormone?,Is it harmful for humans to eat meat from livestock/animals with high levels of  stress hormones? Or does it just change the quality and taste of the meat (and not necessarily harmful for human consumption)?   How to know if the meat you purchased is from an animal that may have endured stress? 
2423,Can a hospital bill me based on my name and date of birth?,"If an out-of-state hospital has none of my information except for name and date of birth, can they bill me?  I was hospitalized in NY for a night for excessive drinking, what can I expect or should I do in the coming days? "
2424,How is the workflow of physical examination's documentation in the USA exactly?,"e.g. do you use paperforms, EHR masks? Do you type directly into a physician letter?  In Germany we use mostly a paper form in the first place and afterwards we document the results into a report. You have to document the physical examination manually twice, which costs a lot of time. A detailed explanation of the daily workflow for the documentation of the physical examination in the USA would be very helpful.  "
2425,"Rabies vaccination, two 3rds of the required course","As some of you may be aware, the Rabies vaccination requires a set of 3 doses over a period of 1 month. I have ""maybe"" had 2 of those 3 jabs. The nurse can see on my records that 2 doses have been administered back in 2004. As rabies is a one off vaccination and it lasts for life, does this mean simply having the additional 3rd dose is all that is required?  I cannot remember back to 2004 to know if I really had 2 or 3 doses so sadly we'll just have to go by what is on record. I'm just intrigued as to how this works. Because the course was not complete, does this render the vaccination useless, and does a full 3 part course need to be re-administered to ensure its effects?  Just to disclaim, I will not be using the answer to this question as sufficient medical advice, I will leave that to the nurse for my up coming appointment. I am curious however, about the technical aspect of having a  partial vaccination.  Many Thanks "

Or do the ""magnifying"" glasses actually magnify like a magnifier lenses does?  "
2427,Vaccination boosters - is their precise timing important?,"Booster vaccines are typically booked exactly 4 weeks after the prime dose, is it known how important this specific time window is? How is vaccine efficacy changed if boosters are given later than schedule?   The vaccines I am particularly interested in are DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB, MenB (Bexsero) and PCV (for diphteria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, haemophilus influenza type B, hepatitis B, meningococcal group B, pneumococcal infection), which are usually administrated from 8 weeks of age onward.  "
2428,What are the long-term consequences of binge drinking?,"The CDC has a somewhat confusing [for me] page on alcohol. First, they classify binge drinking as excessive drinking:     Excessive drinking includes binge drinking, heavy drinking, and any drinking by pregnant women or people younger than age 21.      Binge drinking, the most common form of excessive drinking, is defined as consuming         For women, 4 or more drinks during a single occasion.   For men, 5 or more drinks during a single occasion.      Followed by definition of heavy drinking (as a 2nd form of excessive drinking)     Heavy drinking is defined as consuming         For women, 8 or more drinks per week.   For men, 15 or more drinks per week.      One is in terms of peaks and other one in terms of average consumption.  Then they talk of long-term health risks for the combined category of excessive drinking:     Over time, excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of chronic diseases and other serious problems including: High blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and digestive problems.   Cancer of the breast, mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and colon.   Learning and memory problems, including dementia and poor school performance.   Mental health problems, including depression and anxiety.   Social problems, including lost productivity, family problems, and unemployment.   Alcohol dependence, or alcoholism.   But looking at their references only three seem to be about binge-drinking   Wechsler (1994) about binge drinking in college Miller (2007)  about binge drinking in high-school Naimi (2003) about unintended pregnancies   These three seem to talking about short-term problems like injuries or unwanted pregnancy. Ok, these could have more indirect long-term consequences, but seem in a different class than cancer, dementia, liver disease etc. Are any of the latter associated with binge drinking?  I'm aware of a review of animal studies highlighted in the Guardian some 10 years ago ""Regular binge drinking can cause long-term brain damage"". Has any of this (brain damage, liver damage etc.) been actually confirmed in human studies on binge drinking? "
2429,Myopia advancing into Presbyopia and the Optics needed to correct them,"This is a question about the optics needed to correct a hypothetical situation that everyone with Myopia will eventually encounter as they advance into older age.  Given that a person has Myopia and requires -2.00 diopters of vision correction, when that person advances to the age when Presbyopia is expected, and one would be unable to focus ""Up Close"", then when the person with -2.00 Myopia takes off their glasses to read something ""Up Close"", would their vision be comparable to another person, about the same age, with 20/20 distance vision, putting on a pair of +2.00 readers or ""magnifying glasses""?    In other words, would the person with -2.00 myopia have a built in advantage to be able to read things up close, as if their eyes had a ""built-in"" focus of +2.00? "
2430,Is it possible to be allergic to corn but not popcorn?,"Is it possible for a person to be allergic to one subspecies and not another of the same parent species? For instance, can a person be allergic to sweet corn but not popcorn (both subspecies of Zea mays)? Are subspecies different enough from one another that the body might reject one but accept another? Does it vary by the species? "
2431,NHS free prescriptions,"If the UK National Health Service offers free prescriptions to certain groups of society, How is the medicine payed for ?  My question is do the various drug companies have a 'deal' with the NHS to offer lower priced drugs for NHS use, and what is that deal exactly ? "
2432,Natural Remedies For Lower Muscarine?,"Histamines are found in cherries among other natural foods.  By restricting such treatment can actually prevent issues in the patient.  I was hopeful to find information like this for muscarine.  If you take a drug that blocks m1 for long periods of time and attempt to stop like Benadryl or many antidepressants, insomnia is a likely side effect.  Are there any natural remedies for muscarine and limiting acetylcholine muscarinic receptors?  What foods to avoid or supplements to take?   "
2433,Can dental scaling cause gum recession,"If even forceful brushing which may cause a little bleeding can lead to gum recession, then why not dental scaling, which can often make the whole mouth bloody? If scaling is done every 6 months (as dentists advise, if I understand correctly), then wouldn't that lead or contribute, to some extent, to gum recession? "
2434,Demodex control with antibiotics: why and how?,"Wikipedia says:      Demodex folliculorum is a microscopic mite that can only survive on the skin of people. Most people have D. folliculorum on their skin. Usually, the mites do not cause any harm, and are therefore considered an example of commensalism rather than parasitism. If D. folliculorum does cause disease, this is known as demodicosis.   The treatment options listed on Medscape include:     Medication Summary   Various treatments have been used to control Demodex mites. Most treatments involve spreading an ointment at the base of the eyelashes at night to trap mites as they emerge from their burrow and/or move from one follicle to another. A tea tree oil product (Cliradex) can be used. Terpinen-4-ol is the most active component of tea tree oil.   And crucially:     Antibiotics          Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be comprehensive and should cover all likely pathogens in the context of this clinical setting.      Erythromycin ophthalmic (Ilotycin)      Belongs to the macrolide group of antibiotics. Basic and readily forms a salt when combined with an acid. Inhibits protein synthesis without affecting nucleic acid synthesis.   Used for the treatment of ocular infections involving the lids, conjunctiva, and/or cornea caused by organisms susceptible to it.   That's all fine. But ""Used for the treatment â¦ caused by organisms susceptible to it"" seems strange. Demodex mites are not bacteria. How are they susceptible to antibiotics?  This seems not to be used for prevention or treatment of secondary/bacterial infections:     Next, apply an antibiotic/steroid ointment to help keep the mites from moving and possibly suffocate them.   Demodex infestation requires immediate, aggressive treatment by doctor, patient, Healio, Primary Care Optometry News, 2011   How does this work? "
2435,Does a cancer survivor have a higher than average risk of future cancer?,"With no recurrence five years after treatment, does a person have average risk of a future cancer ( considered in context of the persons demographics )?

2436,What is the best pH of drinking water?,I have seen that soft drinks are harmful to the body due to the very differing level of pH. I have also seen that our aged body become acid through time. And alkaline when young.  The Physiological Power of Water Dr Lair Ribeiro Md FACC  He says it at 19:20  Drinking water should be around 7 ? Or alkaline ? Above it? 
2437,Is it safe to store medicine/supplements in containers,I bought a box of supplement strips (Natberry plus) that consists 100 tablets. I feel it's inconvenient to store the tablets strip in my bag as it tablet comes out by accident sometimes. So i thought i can store all the tablets in a container.  Is it safe to store these tablets in an air tight container? Is it safe to take medicine/supplement out from the strip and store it in a container in general? 
2438,Why is Clostridium difficile toxin A + B outdated in snomed?,"I'm looking at the new version of the Snomed dictionary and the concept 707993000 Clostridium difficile toxin A + B (substance) is deactivated (and outdated) since version 20170731. Can anybody explain me, why this happened?   We have used this concept for coding of results of laboratory examinations in our software system. Is there an alternative Snomed concept usable for the purpose of coding of evidence of the Clostridium difficile toxin A + B ? "
2439,Why is it not possible to get HIV by touching a contaminated surface?,"I was wondering if one could get HIV from basically touching a surface which has had viral DNA extract, serum, or blood on it; and then touching their (bleeding) pimple or acne, or any other open area of the skin.   From what I've seen, the answer is ânoâ due to the fact that the virus is not able to live (or âstay infectiveâ) for that long outside the human body. Popular science: How long do microbes like bacteria and viruses live on surfaces in the home at normal room temperatures? If I am not getting it wrong, the first paragraph states this fact clearly:     The answer is probably not what you want to hear: Microbes can live on household surfaces for hundreds of years. The good news, however, is that most don't. Some well-known viruses, like HIV, live only a few seconds.       If the information is right, what I still don't understand is: why is it not possible for it to be infective since there will still be RNA present on the surface (even after the virus is dead or no virus left), getting in contact with skin, and eventually with the blood through an open area on the skin? Because the whole strain would still be there and would have gotten into the body. (Maybe even along with the ingredients in the dried fluids?) "
2440,Cardiovascular risk of light smoking,"What's the cardiovascular risk of light smoking? Does a light smoker only incur a proportionally small fraction of the risk of a heavy smoker?  What I've found so far is the following:  According to this meta-analysis, the risk of cigarettes smoked by day (CPD) isn't linearly correlated to cardiovascular risk, instead it follows a much steeper curve for low CPD and then flattens out.     Smokers who cut down the number of cigarettes they use can benefit from large reductions in the risk of cancer and some benefits on cardiovascular disease. However, smoking only one to five cigarettes per day is associated with a risk of coronary heart disease and stroke that is substantially higher than many health professionals or smokers recognise (as much as half the risk of smoking 20 per day).    That it is that nonlinear is a quite surprising result.  But, the problem isâ¦ there's also the famous INTERHEART study. And by this one, we find at least for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) a linear risk-CPD-dependency:    So what is it? Can those very different results be explained/harmonized? Has a firm consensus been reached regarding the correlation (cardiovascular disease) â CPD? "
2441,Does Nicotine cause Cancer?,"It is believed by many that Nicotine causes cancer, and passively vaping may also cause cancer due to the nicotine content.  My research into the idea whilst looking at questions such as Does &#39;vaping&#39; affect your lungs? has uncovered that Nicotine is also found in various fruit and vegetables (Davis, et al. 1991; Castro &amp; Monji, 1986; Sheen, 1988 &amp; Domino, et al. 1993).  It is also mentioned in How much nicotine is in tea and vegetables.  Further to the answers given so far by @Narusan and @wolf-revo-cats along with further research I have conducted  I feel there is more that can be gleaned regarding cancer risks of Nicotine.  Cancer Research UK says     [E]-cigarettes donât contain cancer causing tobacco. They do contain nicotine, which is addictive, but isnât what causes the damage from smoking.   Nicotine showed cocarcinogenic effect with DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene) in the hamster cheek pouches model (Chen &amp; Squier, 1990), but...     To our knowledge, there are no relevant study in humans on carcinogenic effects from pure nicotine including products, such as NRT and e-cigarettes (Sanner &amp; Grimsrud, 2015).   When looking at passive smoking and cancer, Domino et al. (1993) points out that 10g of eggplant contains the equivalent nicotine of passively smoking for 3 hours in a room with a ""minimum amount"" of tobacco smoke. 10g is not a lot of eggplant and passive smoking causes cancer (e.g. Hori, et al. 2016). If Nicotine causes cancer, and as eggplant, potato and tomatoes contain nicotine as well according to the studies above, would these plants cause cancer as well?  Donât get me wrong, as an ex-smoker myself, I know how stopping boosts health.  My question is whether Nicotine does cause cancer, or is it Nicotine-derived N-Nitrosamines (Hoffmann &amp; Hecht, 1985), or is it actually Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) formed from tobacco alkaloids during the curing and processing of tobacco (Hecht, 1999)?

2443,"Calcium supplements versus ""fortified with calcium""","(By 'fortified', I refer to this definition: increase the nutritive value of (food) by adding vitamins.)  Are there any differences between calcium supplements (as pills or tablets), and foods fortified with calcium (e.g., artificially added to products such as soy milk)?   Isn't the solid calcium carbonate in supplements chemically the same as aqueous calcium carbonate in fortified drinks? I'm lactose-intolerant. Alas, purely natural foods don't contain enough calcium for the Recommended Daily Intake.     Optional Reading and Addendum:      1. WebMD: ""Keep in mind that there's really not that much difference between getting calcium in a supplement and calcium in food.""   ""Calcium-fortified foods -- such as cereals, some juices, and soy milk -- are excellent sources of the mineral, experts tell WebMD.""      2. health.harvard.edu: An 8-ounce portion of off-the-shelf orange juice contains about 300 mg of calcium. The calcium in fortified soy milk also compares favorably to whole milk.   Breakfast cereals (which are also fortified) contain substantial amounts of calcium, especially when combined with low-fat milk.   A portion of oatmeal on its own contains just 100 mg of calcium. âBut if you cut up some dried figs and add it to a bowl of oatmeal with milk, you easily get about half of what you need without having any supplements,â Dr. Hauser says.      3.

2444,"Are calcium supplements harmful, even if you stay short of the maximum dose?","   Source: Do You Really Need Calcium Supplements?, Margaret Polaneczky MD, 2014 Oct 2      You may also have heard that taking calcium supplements can lead to heart disease. Itâs still an open question. Some studies suggest up to a 20% increase in heart disease in men and women who take calcium supplements, but other studies do not find this risk, or find it only in men and not women.      My Recommendation      Unless you're at increased risk for a fracture (you can calculate your fracture risk here), forgo the supplements and get your calcium from food and drinks. If you don't eat dairy, look to non-dairy calcium sources. If you can't get your entire recommended daily allowance (RDA) of it from food, only take as much calcium supplementation as you need to make up the difference between dietary sources and the RDA for your age group.   My teenage cousin doesn't suffer from any problems due to Calcium deficiency or that need Calcium supplementation. He's lactose-intolerant.  This article states that he needs 1000 mg of Calcium daily but it fails to address the impracticality of satisfying RDA from eating only  natural foods.  Given his fear, he'll keep any consumption of Calcium supplements far below the maximum dosage. Then are Calcium supplements safe to consume?  Conflicting answers from different doctors (whom he consulted) worsen his confusion. Some recommend Calcium supplements, but others reject them.

2445,Will eye floaters ever disappear?,"According to wikipedia on eye floaters:     Floaters are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually disappear as the brain learns to ignore them.   Even if this might be the case for very small floaters, what about larger ones that cannot be ""hidden"" from our vision (but that might be moved away from the point we're looking at)?  Will they remain visible or could they disappear with time? I couldn't find credible sources or agreement on their fate. "
2446,Are there current studies about long term development of WPW in children?,"Our daughter was diagnosed with WolffâParkinsonâWhite syndrome (WPW) at zero weeks age in April 2014.  I found a very interesting study from 1990 that talks about the long term development of WPW. It can be summarized as:     Among those whose tachycardia began at age 0 to 2 months, it disappeared in 93% and persisted in 7%. In 31%, it disappeared and reappeared at an average age of 8 years.   Since the study is 25 years old, I was wondering whether or not there are newer studies that better results (especially how the recurrence for patients given drugs compares to those without drugs).  So my question is:  Are there any recent studies about the long term development/evolution of WPW in toddlers/kids/young adults? "

In one study that followed more than 420,000 cellphone users over a 20-year period, researchers found no evidence of a link between cellphones and brain tumors   ...   Another recent study suggested a possible increased risk of glioma â a specific type of brain tumor â for the heaviest cellphone users, but no increase in brain tumor risk overall.  Long-term Cell Phone Use Linked to Brain Tumor Risk which says:       Long-term use of both mobile and cordless phones is associated with an increased risk for glioma, the most common type of brain tumor, the latest research on the subject concludes.   The new study shows that the risk for glioma was tripled among those using a wireless phone for more than 25 years and that the risk was also greater for those who had started using mobile or cordless phones before age 20 years.    Though the second appears to conclude direct health risk, I'm pretty sure it's not yet any hard proof otherwise we would have seen huge lawsuits being filed all over the place.  If really  harmful, what factors are in place e.g. cellular phone model, signal strength, etc? "
2449,What is the cause of Type 1 Diabetes?,"Type 1 Diabetes, also known as ""Juvenile-onset"" diabetes (due to the fact that it's often diagnosed early in life) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by the body's inability to to produce insulin, the body's primary means of regulating glucose.  What causes this disease? Can it result from eating too much candy at a young age? "
2450,Are artificial sweeteners safe?,"There seems to be a lot of noise about health risks of consuming artificial sweeteners, especially aspartame and saccharin. Many sources argue that these chemicals carry huge risks of developing cancer and neurological problems.  Should I be concerned? Is moderate consumption (say, a few diet sodas a week) of artificial sweeteners considered safe by the currently available research? "
2451,Why do I feel shaky after only a small amount of caffeine?,"I like coffee, but caffeine seems to 'wire' me much more extremely than most other people. I feel energized or even shaky after less than half a normal cup, and a whole 8 ounces will usually cause me to sweat or make my heart race uncomfortably.   Even decaffeinated coffee seems to have this effect, which seems strange to me (although I am aware that it still contains a small amount of caffeine). I typically drink green tea instead of coffee, since the effect is more mild.  Is this an indication that my body metabolizes caffeine faster (or slower?) than normal? What else can cause caffeine sensitivity? "
2452,For long-term use: Non-Alcoholic Mouthwash vs Saltwater,"Foreword: Please beware that I ask this question only for mouthwash with NO alcohol whatsoever; so please omit alcoholic mouthwashes (which can cause cancer).   Since my grandmother continues to develop cavities, she  twice daily brushes, flosses, then flosses again with interdental brushes, and concludes with a   Crest mouthwash with 0 alcohol (see the footnote). She also abstains from any added sugar or sweeteners.   Question 1: How does saltwater compare with non-alcoholic mouthwash for daily lifelong use? Her dentist does not know of any relevant research, and only recommends saltwater for short-term use. So her dentist agrees with some of the claims here by Dentist David Kerr (B.DSc (Hons) BSc (Hons), University of Queensland). Question 2: But is Dentist Kerr perfectly right in his criticism (of saltwater) below?     How about using salt water long term?      Longer term, the salt water is acidic, so there would be a problem if you were to use it every day, it could erode the teeth, but is not necessarily abrasive to the teeth. It is the acidity of the salt water that could eat away and soften the enamel on the teeth making them more susceptible to wearing, chipping and cavities.   Footnote: My grandmother uses this brand because it contains cetylpyridinium chloride, which (this website claims)  has 'been proven to reduce plaque or fight cavities'. "
2453,How safe are backboards?,I have heard a fair amount of talk recently about how safe the long spine boards frequently used by EMS personnel after falls and car accidents are. How many - if any - studies have been done on this?  If there have been studies done on this I would like to know what the conclusion was. What are the chances of having damage done by being on one for any length of time?  This link to EMS World is where I got the information about the possible safety issues.  
2454,Do carrots actually improve eyesight?,"I've heard that carrots help improve eyesight, but the sources are pretty unreliable (TV shows, mostly). Are there any studies that prove (or show good evidence) that carrots improve eyesight? Or is this just a myth? "
2455,How should ovo-lacto vegetarians compensate the lack of meat in their diets?,"An ovo-lacto vegetarian includes both eggs and dairy products in his diet, but meat is completely excluded. In a regular non-vegetarian diet, meat is very important and provides many benefits if properly consumed.  I've heard of many problems that can be induced by vegetarianism, because the body stops receiving important nutrients and it's common that the diet is not changed to compensate for the lack of meat.  How should an ovo-lacto vegetarian compensate? The meat benefits are lost, and the body still needs them. Which changes in diet should a vegetarian perform to keep receiving the nutrients that the meat stopped providing?  In other words, what diet should a ovo-lacto vegetarian have to be healthy without meat? "
2456,Fasting blood glucose and Hemoglobin A1C not valid for athletes?,"I've been a competing athlete, mostly in endurance sports for nearly 45 years now. As part of military and other physicals, I have had blood glucose levels come back several times with high levels, and follow up Fasting Glucose Tolerance Tests come back as negative. In one of my most recent blood panels (for a medical study group) came back with HbA1c levels that indicated I was prediabetic, but again, follow up studies were negative.  Recently I read a blog post discussing this study, which indicated that highly trained endurance athletes (In this case, a cohort of 47 professional and 72 elite male cyclists, compared to 58 sedentary donors) trended higher HbA1c levels than the sedentary group.  I have also read that many of the blood glucose levels were established using diabetic patients, so does that mean that the levels are not valid for me since I am a lifelong endurance athlete? Or is this something that I should just keep following up with potentially unnecessary tests? "
2457,Is there a complete cure for Limited Scleroderma?,"One of my cousins is diagnosed with Limited Scleroderma. Is there a complete cure for it? If not, are there any suggestions on reducing the pain and lead a normal day-to-day life?  A wide range of suggestions and treatment methods were mentioned in various websites, but they didn't help as more choices led to more confusion. Since this is a site for health experts, it would be great if concise treatment/cure information is given. "
2458,Does CO2 laser treatment work well with acne scars?,Several dermatologists says that CO2 laser treatment is still the best solution for acne scars. Does CO2 laser treatment provide a smooth skin or just mitigate these scars? What are the side effects of this treatment?  
2459,How exact are the times for how long to wait between pills?,"A 120mg pill of Sudafed (Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride), for example, lasts for 12 hours. You are not supposed to take another Sudafed pill before the 12 hours are up.  How exact is this 12-hour limit? Do i have to wait at least exactly 43200 seconds between pills? How much leeway is there? Could i take the second pill a few minutes (5? 10? 30?) before the time is up?  Note that Sudafed is used as an example here. The same should apply to any other drug with a time limit. "
2460,What are the symptoms of Migraine and how to categorise into severe or mild etc,"How to identify if someone suffers from migraine? and how is the migraine categorised ie whether it is severe, mild etc? "
2461,Why is natural sugar healthier than refined sugar?,"The WHO recently published this recommendation regarding sugar consumption:     Keeping intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake reduces the risk of overweight, obesity and tooth decay.   They define free sugars as â¦     â¦ monosaccharides (such as glucose, fructose) and disaccharides (such as sucrose or table sugar) added to foods and drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.   On the other hand, they state that:     The WHO guideline does not refer to the sugars in fresh fruits and vegetables, and sugars naturally present in milk, because there is no reported evidence of adverse effects of consuming these sugars.   Why is natural sugar healthier than refined sugar? Also, how is sugar in fresh fruits healthier than sugar naturally present in fruit juices? "
2462,Is eye patching effective for older children with amblyopia?,Parents of young children with amblyopia are often advised that vision in the weak eye can be improved by covering the healthy eye with an eye patch for a couple of hours every day. At what age does eye patching become less effective? Does the age at which the patching began matter? 
2463,Supplements: When and how to take them to maximize absorption,"I switched to a vegetarian diet a while back, and I am now taking a few supplements consisting of common minerals, vitamins and omega-3's as a compliment to my regular diet.  When should I take the supplements to ensure that they are absorbed most effectively?  Does it matter what time of day it is, and does it matter what else I have in my stomach at the time?  I have read that some vitamins are fat soluble â does that mean that they should be taken with a meal? If taken with a meal â does eating a lot of food reduce ""digestion efficiency"" of the supplements?    What I have done, which is based entirely on my own thoughts, which are not based on any particular research:  I have been taking my supplements during the afternoon a few hours before dinner. At around 5 pm, body metabolism is at a high, and I usually don't have a lot of food in my stomach. My thinking has therefore been that the body will be efficient at absorbing the contents of the supplements.  I have avoided taking supplements in the morning because I am a morning coffee-drinker, and caffeine is laxative. "
2464,Are there any known health risks with taking megadoses of beta carotene?,"According to the research I've done, taking high amounts of vitamin A in animal form can lead to issues (Vitamin A1, retinol). However, the Carotenoid form (ex: beta carotene) seems harmless.  I heard some people can take megadoses of vitamin A regularly, and the only real side-effect is Carotenaemia, which is harmless (and sometimes desired - for fair-skinned people, it acts as a natural tan).  Is there any excessive harm to the liver for chronic use of - say 10,000 IU of beta carotene? How about 100,000 IU of beta carotene? "
2465,Can I Survive on a Mostly Grass/Leaf Diet?,"I want to guarantee an easy, effective, and possibly free food source for the rest of my days, but I am skeptical.  Growing my own organic food would be ideal, but that would limit my mobility or require that I rent/own land. I apologize in advance for my ignorance in terms of nutrition and science. So here it goes:  Can I train my body to survive by relying mainly on grass or leaves as a food source? Has anyone ever successfully pulled this off?   I am not sure what a reliable source would be for such a question, but I have seen, to some extent, positive and negative answers to this question.  Follw Up: If the answer is negative, what's the easiest way to satisfy to satisfy my nutritional needs in a safe way? By easiest I mean 1) requires no land, little time or effort, 2) easy access, 3) doesn't make one sick, and 4) inexpensive or free. "
2466,Why might lab test results be normal when thyroid nodules are present and there are symptoms of hyperthyroidism?,"By ultrasound there are many nodules in Thyroid gland but all thyroid tests (TSH,T4,T3, microsomal and thyreoglobulin antibodies) are within normal range but there is clear heperthyroidism signs like hair thinning,anxiety,irritability,cardio neurosis,fatigue etc. Why lab tests don't show any disfunction? What is the cause of these overactive thyroid signs?  "
2467,Will Down's syndrome be ever reversible?,"Down syndrome is caused by genetic disorder when in DNA chromosome #21 has three copies (instead of 2 copies). If I understand correctly then the Genetic Engineering is the closest field in modern medicine that studies how to alter host's DNA.  Would there in next few years be a cure for Down's syndrome (i.e. remove the third copy of chromosome #21 in an adult's DNA)? If not, then what are difficulties that would still need to be overcome in genetic engineering to do something like that?  For example,  is it impossible to consistently change DNA for all cells in body? Would these cells start to ""attack"" each other while being in partially reconfigured state?). If I understand correctly then CRISPR* method is the new tool in genetic engineering that may allow to do such DNA manipulations?  P.S. as it may be obvious from my question I don't have medical background and my questions is motivated by having relative affected by Down's syndrome.  P.P.S. I found this link [website]"
2468,What are the long-term side effects of glucosamine taken as a nutritional supplement?,"(1) found that glucosamine supplementation was linked to significant, reversible increase in intraocular pressure , but the sample size of the study was small (n=17). The investigators could not exclude the potential for permanent damage.  I wonder:   whether the results of (1) have been confirmed by larger studies, if so, whether the increase in intraocular pressure is reversible or permanent, what other long-term side effects of glucosamine taken as a nutritional supplement are.

2469,Stuttering problems,"I am a college student with stuttering problems. My first language is Spanish and my second language is English. I came to the U.S four years ago. I didn't stutter that much back then on my first days in the U.S, but as English became my first language, the problem worsened more and more. Now today, I can't even say a sentence in English without stuttering and I avoid talking to my teachers, partners,colleagues etc. I don't even go to office hours because of that fear. I use mathstack  exchange as a way out to avoid going to office hours. Any advice?. Right now, speech pathologists haven't made any significant progress in finding the cure for stuttering, so what can I do in the meantime?. I have never tried taking medications because that would be the perfect inducer for doing drugs and other things that go against my ethics, but is taking medication worthwhile?. "
2470,no medication treatments for MS,"   What are the no-medication treatments for Multiple sclerosis (MS) ?

Is there any specific method (without taking medications) for MS? "
2471,Is it possible to regain lost lactose tolerance?,"I could perfectly digest dairy till the age of 35. One fine day when I went to doctor to ask about stomach problems I had in past some days that year, I was told that I am lactose intolerant. How did that happen after so many years? Now I am stuck to the lactose-free milk. Is it possible to regain/rebuild lactose tolerance? That would be a life saver as I do not eat meat and milk is a major source of protein for me. "

2475,What is the mechanism by which diarrhea is triggered?,"I know that many things, from stress to pathogens, can cause diarrhea.  But I was curious what in the digestive tract detects that something is wrong (eg are there chemoreceptors which find problems, immune cells which detect pathogens, etc.), and then how is that signal carried to cause the changes needed to produce diarrhea (eg hormonally, through the enteric nervous system, etc.)?  Is there a single answer, or are there many processes? "
2476,How does the injury classification system work?,"Whenever an incident has caused someone to become hospitalized, news reports on the incidents are always quite vague about the injuries. I understand how these injuries relate to each other, but not what they entail. What is the difference between the categories below? Is there a generally accepted guideline on what injuries fall under what category?   lightly injured; mild injuries; injured; heavily injured; critically injured; life threatening injuries; shock;  "

2479,"timing of mineral consumption, and absorption competition","It makes sense that many minerals inhibit the absorption of other minerals because they are chemically similar and therefore often compete for similar biochemical pathways for absorption [e.g. iron, magnesium, zinc, etc. are divalent cations].   If the human body absorbed several times the RDA of each of those nutrients [e.g. iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, calcium, selenium, manganese, cobalt, etc., all the usual suspects], but still in the same proportion as the RDA's of those minerals so that they remained ""balanced"", would regular elevated consumption of the above mentioned minerals be likely to cause health problems to the average human body? In order to not have absorption issues of competition between minerals, how long does the average human body need between supplements of a given nutrient before supplementation with the next nutrient can take place without absorption problems? [e.g. 2 hours, 3 hours, 5 hours?]  "
2480,Why do people still get hungry if they're overweight,"So, I recently learned about how exactly obesity is formed. I learned that if you consume too many calories but don't burn enough of them, your body will start to form fat. Then how come that people still get hungry even if they have plenty of engergy stored by fat?   In other words; Why does the body still need extra food even though it has plenty of energy? "
2481,Do detection of Kidney cysts (PKD) at an early stage helps prevention of Kidney Failure?,"Kidney cysts are becoming 4th leading factor of kidney failure unfortunately. There is no cure of PKD yet though research is going on!  My question is ""If a person suffers from PKD detects it accidently at very early age suppose at his twenties. Will it be helpful to him anyway as there is no cure available? At early stage, there are only some cysts on Kidney then at later stage where thousands of cysts reside on Kidney stopping Kidney to do its functionality.  Also I found:     Q. Does everyone with PKD develop kidney failure?     Answer: About 50 percent of people with PKD will have kidney failure by age 60, and about 60 percent will have kidney failure by age 70. People with kidney failure will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.    Source: Kidney.org    It's heart-rendering as no one want do die from kidney disease. Can there be something done which may stop cysts to grow on kidneys?  "
2482,Overfull ERs across the globe,"A study conducted by the German journal Ãrzteblatt revealed that in German Emergency Rooms     more than half of the patients do not think their condition requires urgent treatment and thus do not meet the definition of a medical emergency.   Is this a flaw within the German healthcare system or can a trend of overfull Emergency Rooms be considered a global issue?  For this specific question, I do see that there might be an absence of studies and numbers, so Iâd encourage personal experience as long as it is well reasoned and backed up by inherent logic or facts.

2483,Scoliossis exercises at Gym,I have scoliossis.I went to 2 doctors and they send me to get some kinetotherapy .  I asked them what can I do with my problem.I asked them if I can go to the gym and they said that I can only go to the swimming pool. Both doctors are women if that matters.  Are they right? Aren't any exercises that I can do at the gym?Since I didn't went to the gym my muscles became smaller and I feel like my learning speed had decreased because I don't move and I don't get enough oxigen.   
2484,How are Sensitivity/Specificity determined for tests in mental health?,"Originally the question was How are Sensitivity/Specificity determined for the first test available for a disease? but I narrowed it down a bit since it seemed to be too broad.   Given that measuring Sensitivity and Specificity requires that you know in advance which people are positive or negative for some disease what's the general process if you develop a new test for a new disease where there's no existing test for the disease making it hard to actually reason about who has the disease and who doesn't. Similarily, if you have an existing test and develop a new test that is supposed to be more accurate, how are you going to tell who has the disease and who not because using the existing test to quantify that introduces ""unkown"" errors.   Similarily, how is this done for diseases that don't even have biomarkers available at that point. I.e. mental illnesses like depression. The way they are defined is by a set of criteria that define the illness and then people develop questionaires to screen for these mental illnesses but since the only way of knowing whether somebody actually has depression is to apply the criteria from the definition those criteria are actually what defines the test in the sense that hose criteria determine whether somebody has the disease, or not. In essence, doesn't this mean that you invent criteria based upon 'nothing' and then create a questionnaire for it but since the definition is actually arbitrary how does this gain you new insight or new information? In some sense, I could define 'hoarding' as well... 'excessively collecting/hoarding objects...' and then devise a questionaire that consisting of two questions 'do you hoard books' and 'do you hoard empty bottles' and if 80% of hoarders do one of these things I will have 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity but I might as well just use the criteria from the definition and do much better than that questionnaire.   You can't really make the argument that the criteria are set so that it fits people having the disease well... because the criteria is what defines the disease in the first place contrary to disease that are diagnosed based on an underlying known pathology and tests try to detect that pathology (or side-effects of that pathology) and the accuracy of the test depends on how good in can detect that pathology.   Some thoughts:  I guess the way I'd do it is I'd just measure a lot of stuff and then see if I can find any significant correlation. Like I have 100 patients with similar symptoms and I check their blood and see that 80 of those patients have more copper in their blood than a healthy control group causing me to think that copper is involved in the pathology then I'd investigate that further and then I notice that their bodies don't process copper as they should and this sometimes causes in 90% of the people with that pathology increased copper blood levels, in 10% we don't see that and the other 10% of my patients turned out to have something that produces the same symptoms but the pathology is something completely different. So I devise a test around that that' measures elevated copper levels which 90% people (with that pathology) have but with some errors and due a cut-off level I have to put somewhere let's say I get about 88% sensitivity and 96% of specificity (because a few people have idiopathic elevated copper levels or something that produces a higher copper level). But I obviously can't really do the same for illnesses where I don't know the pathology because there's zero way of telling who has which pathology. Like depression. If I define depression as 'a.) has low mood on most of the days for at least 6 months' or similar and this is both the test AND the definition of the disorder I obviously get 100% sensitivity, but that's because the test and the definition is the exact same thing and there's no way of determining the specificity because everything that matches my criteria is by definition having this illness I just defined meaning it will match absolutely everything that provokes these symptoms regardless of the pathology so I can't really measure specificity unless I neglect the existence of other diseases producing the same symptoms, in which case I'd get both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity but this is obviously 'cheating' OR if I just define it as co-morbid to some other pathology in every case but that's basically also just a neat 'cheat'? I could then add a little extra criteria 'b.) not due to some other disorder' but this at least scientifically looks like another 'cheat' because now you don't have a test for anything anymore to begin with. You have a definition, but no test. You can't use a questionnaire anymore.  "

What first aid / steps should be taken after this happens?  Is this something you'd call 911 for immediately and need an ambulance for?   Or could you get someone with a broken leg or arm to hobble over into a car and take them to an emergency room?  On that note - When someone has a broken bone, do you take them to an urgent care or an emergency room? How do you decide? "
2488,"""Copay with deductible"" vs. ""Copay after deductible""","Pertaining to health insurance, what does ""Copay with deductible"" mean, in contrast to ""Copay after deductible""?

2490,Seeing a nutritionist on Wednesday. Is there anything else I should ask about?,"I'm seeing a nutritionist on Wednesday, and these are the list of questions I intend to ask.  Would like to get advice of anyone in my position (vegetarian, blood results okay but on the borderline - especially LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, eat a range of food but not too focused on super healthy, don't weigh portions, decent amount of exercise). Also, am I missing any questions that I really should be asking?  Overview   Iâm a vegetarian. I eat milk-byproducts, eggs, and all vegetables and fruits.  Donât like mushrooms or aubergine/egg plant Tofu is OK, seitan NOT ok. No allergies to nuts or fruits except for black grapes and yogurt. My family has a history of diabetes, high BP and cholesterol; They are on medication.    Questions to the doctor:   Whatâs the cause for high LDL and low LDL levels? What should I do to increase my metabolism?  What should I do to prolong the time I can avoid medication for either of the above? What is the ideal weight for me?  3 big meals or multiple small meals? Low-fat vs. Low-carb for weight loss? What is one nutrition advice you give? How can I support my immune system so Iâm not as vulnerable to an auto-immune diseases/pathogens/colds/flu? How might personal genetics influence how my body uses nutrients? As a vegetarian, how can I make sure my protein intake is high enough?    What do I eat/drink on a normal day?   Exclusively use Olive oil for cooking in the house.   Breakfast (8am)   1 small bowl Cereal (Tresor, Chocapic, and Kellogsâ¦ ?) - quantity?  1 Sandwich with fresh cheese, lettuce and tomato  1 Chocolate muffin 2 cookies NOTHING Sometimes    Scrambled eggs with bread Ramen    Lunch/dinner (1/8pm)   Pizza with cheese and vegetables. White rice with    Lentils: Chickpeas, green peas, black beans Vegetables Egg fried  Tortilla Vegetable pasta Lentils: Chickpeas, green peas Soup + sandwiches with cheese Salad   Wild rice, apple, cucumber, feta and nuts Quinoa, nuts, apple, avocado    Snack (5pm)   Crisp-bread with Emmental cheese and seeds Chocolate Assorted nuts Sometimes a couple of beers. Patatas bravas Apples  Pears Banana   What should I avoid?  What should I eat?   Can we define the quantity of food I eat? Where will I get my vitamins?  My minerals? My phytochemicals?  My micronutrients? My omega 3âs? I donât want to weigh everything I eat ( we have a scale).    Can we define it in terms of units, handfuls, cups? Is it a case of what I eat but less? or changing what I eat?    What exercise should I do?   Currently I swim about 1.5km every day (why is my pulse so high?, what can I do to reduce it?) Resting pulse of  68. Walk to work (4km round trip) Sometimes a regular home exercise  The rest of the day I am sitting in front of a desk   "
2491,What will happen if you keep running? What will eventually cause you to stop?,"A more specific form of my question would be, ""Barring mental barriers, what will lead to collapse after extended cardiovascular exercise?""  I was considering asking this in the worldbuilding SE, but I figured that I would get more detailed or realistic answers here.  When you do cardiovascular exercise for an extended period of time, the typical process (pretty much as roughly speaking as possible) is:   Do the exercise. Make the conscious decision to stop doing the exercise once you're sufficiently exhausted or once you've exercised for a sufficiently long time.   You can make the argument that there are some exercise routines that swap step 2 for ""Get to the point where you can't do the exercise anymore and stop there,"" in which case the decision to stop wouldn't exactly be a conscious decision.  I suspect, however, that even with an exercise routine like that, if someone pointed a gun to your head and told you to keep exercising, then you could probably keep going.  Those mental barriers are just too strong: at some point, your brain will say ""No more!"" before your body does and you will stop prematurely.  In stories that I write, I occasionally run into the scenario of characters in a ""run for your life"" sort of situation, where something is perpetually on their tail that they need to escape from.  They can't slow down or stop: they have to go as fast as they can for as long as they can in order to escape danger.  In this sense, it's like the hypothetical I described: a gun is basically being pointed to their heads and they're being forced to keep running.  At this point, mental barriers are thrown out of the window in order to prevent premature death, so they're not going to get in the way.  But something will eventually.  At some point, the hero will collapse, and I'm interested in knowing what's going on in the body when that point finally happens.  Do the muscles cease their functionality due to a deficiency of ATP?  Do you briefly black out or pass out due to lack of oxygen (or rather, a surplus of CO2) being distributed through the body?  Or is it still going to be a mental barrier that inevitably causes collapse (in other words, will something kick in the brain before other parts of your body fail that will force you to stop running regardless of external stimuli)?  We can assume that prior to the extended sprint, the character is well-rested and hydrated.  If different cardiovascular exercises are expected to yield different results, we can limit things to just running, since that's what I'm primarily interested in.  Also, since many people can jog pretty much indefinitely provided the jog is slow enough, we can assume that the character is continuously exercising at the peak of his or her capabilities. "
2492,Why do drugs expire?,"I've googled through internet, and all I found was ""what expiration dates mean"". I found nothing about the underlying mechanism of expiration.   As drugs are chemicals, why do they expire? Are there chemical reactions that produce other chemicals? "
2493,"Could the cerebral hypoxia caused by voluntarily hyperventilating for an hour (""breathwork"") cause brain damage?","TL;DR hyperventilating for 60 minutes for psychedelic/meditative/therapeutic effect: is this dangerous?    Hyperventilation can lead to cerebral hypoxia, as hypocapnia (reduced CO2 in blood) causes vasoconstriction in the brain along with alkalosis which impairs the ability of the blood to deliver oxygen (Bohr effect). This is all pretty understandable and there's an extremely detailed breakdown of the mechanics and effects of hyperventilation in this excellent article by an anesthesiologist.  As a result of the hypoxia and alkalosis, hyperventilation can have some pretty psychedelic effects (tingling, numbness, spasms, confusion, disassociation, hallucinations, generally altered state). Some New Age practices take advantage of this (under the term ""breathwork""[1] ), with a whole layer of pseudoscience and/or mysticism on top, but I've tried it once and the effect is real: hyperventilating for that long produces some crazy results!  Hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia is ""well tolerated""[2] but the only concrete info I can find about cerebral hypoxia is that you lose consciousness about 15 seconds after oxygen supply to brain is interrupted, and brain damage can start 4-6 minutes after that. On the one hand, hyperventilation won't even come close to cutting off oxygen supply. On the other hand, these practices can keep this up for an hour. The widely reported ""choking/fainting game"" has caused injuries and fatalities, but has components that make it more dangerous - strangulation, pseudo-Valsalva maneuvers, and holding your breath.  How dangerous is this? From what I can tell, mild hyperventilation can cause noticeable mental effects without being dangerous (common in panic attacks for instance). But what if you take it really far? What are some sane limits on duration, and how could you identify that you're getting into dangerous territory?    [1] Wikipedia article and dumb-but-relevant tabloid article  [2] Via citation on Wikipedia (sorry): Laffey JG, Kavanagh BP (2002). ""Hypocapnia"". N. Engl. J. Med. 347 (1): 43â53. doi:10.1056/NEJMra012457. PMID 12097540.  Note: This question Is a hyperventilation+hypoventilation breathing exercise (Wim Hof Method) more likely to prevent or promote cancer? has a lot of great info about the effect of hyperventilation (and hypoventilation) on the body, but it's in the context of regularly performing the exercise long term, and the breathing pattern is different. My question is about the possibility of acute damage from pure hyperventilation in one go. "

2495,Can I gain immunity against traveler's disease?,"I need to visit Nepal every 2 years (at least). I was there 2 years ago and got very sick in the second week, basically stomach flu, probably salmonella or e.coli or both.  I was there about a month ago and became sick again in a similar fashion, although it seemed very slightly less dramatic, no high fever this time etc.  Can I expect to gain immunity against e.coli at least or maybe even salmonella? Can I expect to get a stronger stomach, which is not so easily upset? Do frequent travelers to Asia or Africa, who tend to experience these type of problems tend to experience them less the more they travel?  I have asked a similar question on The Great Outdoors and was advised to ask on Health as well. "
2496,Is drug-based liver damage usually traceable to free radical generation?,"From my fairly limited understanding, much of the time medications are said to be damaging to the liver, what is meant is that the process of breaking them down causes the formation of free radicals, which then attack the local liver cells. Is this usually the case?  For example, acetaminophen (paracetamol, Tylenol, Calpol, Panadol depending on where you live) is broken down in the liver through three pathways, glucoronidation, sulfation, and a third involving the cytochrome P450 enzymes. This third pathway entails breakdown chiefly by CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 through the intermediate NAPQI, which is a strong oxidizer. Too much acetaminophen, or a little over a long period of time, leads to a buildup of NAPQI, which causes oxidation of liver cells and subsequent liver damage.   Is it the case that usually, when drugs are known to cause liver damage under certain conditions (such as high dosage or extended use), it's because the drug is broken down in the liver into reactive chemical species that cause oxidative stress on the local liver tissues?

2497,Is dandruff bad?,"I have a lot of Dandruff and I am just starting to lose hair. Is there any co-relation. I heard Dandruff is neither good nor bad, it is quantitative. Meaning that everybody has it, but on different levels. For some it  is not visible, but they do have it and others have a lot of it.  Is this true? More over is dandruff bad for my hair. Does it Cause hairfall? "
2498,What is a pain response when the feeling of pain isn't there?,"Is there a term and definition for when the body reacts to pain you can't consciously feel? To be more descriptive, it's a reflex to pain, like pulling back from a hot stove and coddling the finger you touched it with, although you don't feel any pain.  Less importantly, but more broadly speaking, what is a reaction to what would be pain, though pain isn't felt by the person? "
2499,Are cheap sunglasses dangerous?,"Does having any plastic between your eyes and the environment automatically provide UVA and UVB protection?  Or do the lenses actually have to be coated (or be comprised of a special type of plastic) in order to afford UVA and UVB protection?  This question is partially prompted by a shirt that I bought that prominently advertises its high level of UV protection.  Well, even the least expensive t-shirt seems to provide good protection. "
2500,What's with anal sex and HIV?,"There always seem to be much vaguely stated health reading material about anal intercourse increasing the risk of the transfer of HIV/AIDS, but it never reads precisely; so my question is: does research show that it is the penis that gives the HIV more easily to someone through insertion of the penis into the anus (unprotected) vs. vaginal and/or orally?    Is it the other way around, i.e. the infected person's anus is more likely to carry the virus and thus more easily spreads HIV to the uninfected person's penis? "

2502,Correct english term for an urgent referral,"I am translating a Swedish text, and I am having problems translating the term ""akutremiss"" to British English. The term is commonly used in Swedish healthcare. It is basically a referral, of any type, where the medical issue is urgent. I have done some basic googling on some of the options, just to see which ones are the most commonly used.   GOOGLE SEARCHES AND HIT COUNTS  healthcare ""acute referral"" 19 700  healthcare ""emergency referral"" 95 400  healthcare ""urgent referral"" 56 800   The clear winner is ""Emergency referral"". ""Urgent referral"" is the runner up. But I feel there is a big difference in the level of urgency between ""urgent"" and ""emergency"", with an emergency being way more urgent than something which is just ""urgent"", at least to my ears.   Note: I included ""acute referral"", mostly because it is a direct translation of the Swedish term, but it sounds really strange to me. I have never heard anyone use the word ""acute"" to mean ""urgent"". The pages I checked seem to be mostly about eye damage, so perhaps the term is eyes-only (pun intended).   What are some thoughts? Is there anything like an ""official"" term used in the healthcare community? "

Even, if a child having kidney cysts suffering from ADPKD herited from his parents at very early age nothing can be done to help him.   Cutting sodium(recommended by doctors as treatment) in diet can't be a permenant solution possible for forever.  In 21st Century, such disease should have eliminated a long ago, then why researchers aren't still up with something, that help reducing the death toll(Kidney Failure) due to PKD? "

2508,Why is treating hepatic vein injuries so difficult?,"I've read a few ER room stories on quora where trauma surgeons would dictate their real life accounts.  One of them said about a accident victim who was very much alive , conscious and talkative. Upon operating the surgeon's team found that the hepatic vein has ruptured from vena cava behind the liver. So the team decided that nothing could be done to repair that damage and save the patient's life. They stopped the life support and slowly the patient died on the table.  Full account of the incident here  Reading through the comments I found this passage : You remember Professor Asrat used to say that injuries to the vena cava behind the liver are when the surgeon sees God? He used to say things like that that I didnât understand. I understand now.ââ  What I fail to understand is why was this situation deemed untreatable? Especially when someone is very much alive.  Why would one not try to treat it anyway regardless of success rate when the other option is definitely death of the patient?  Several cases which are very likely to be fatal (cancer , HIV , ebola ) etc are treated regardless of the final outcome so what went wrong in this case? "

They usually occur when I feel sick or have a cold or flu-like symptoms. An EEG test said everything was normal. It only happens at night when I'm asleep so maybe something is being triggered while in REM sleep?  How can I find a solution to this? Are there specialist doctors I can go to? "
2512,What causes the cornea to change shape in astigmatism?,"I was diagnosed with astigmatism last summer, I've never had any noticeable vision problems before (I'm 20 years old). The shift from fine to terrible happened quite fast. I've visited an eye doctor, and found out that I've got astigmatism.   So naturally I've tried to google what astigmatism is, and what causes it. From what I've found, I understand that astigmatism is caused either by an irregularly shaped cornea or a lens, but cornea related problems seem to be more frequent.  So I was wondering why does this happen? What causes the cornea to change shape so rapidly?  IMPORTANT EDIT:  As it turned out, in my case astigmatism was a symptom of a disease called Keratoconus, so if you're experiencing rapid change in your vision, and your optometrist can't tell you why, go to another one, or better go to a clinic that specialises on treating Keratoconus, as it is very important to get a proper diagnosis as soon as possible, I've wasted too much time, going to unqualified optometrists.

2513,How can you increase melatonin?,"Melatonin, I believe, is the chemical in your body that makes you tired and fall asleep.  If someone were having trouble falling asleep at night, in what ways would they be able to increase their melatonin levels in order to fall asleep faster? Are there foods that increase melatonin?  On the other hand, what things should be avoided as they decrease or prevent an increase of melatonin? I believe higher light levels decrease how fast your body produces it, what else affects it? "

2518,Health I.D for diabetes - What is the preferred method of identification?,"Having type 1 diabetes for a little over a decade now I've never worn an identification to help others know of my condition especially in case of emergencies (such as hypoglycemic attacks - paramedics giving me resuscitation instead of simply giving me glucose).  The problem is that there isn't enough talk on this issue especially in the aesthetics of wearing one, as they look unfitting.  As far as best practices, I think a wristband is the most common method as it's effective (easy to locate). Either I proceed with a Do-It-Yourself initiative to create my own or find some cool looking ones to purchase.  Things to consider:   How often does the ID have to be replaced? Should it be waterproof? What material serves best for long term use (if this is preferred) Should the medical info be stylized as engraved or placed as an attachment? It's hard to find ones that actually look cool/neat/practical.     UPDATE  [SOLVED_EasilyAccessibleStandardLogoNoGlitter]  What ever makes the responder identify the situation quickly enough will help in the worst case scenario or for an emergency. So, for my question what type of accessory would make it easier to identify this particular type of situation? Ideally a bracelet is the best option. Otherwise, if a bracelet can't be worn then it would be appropriate to use a necklace instead.  Just make sure the I.D.'s design isn't straying too far away from how medical logos are displayed. Since we are talking about a standard procedure the medical logo (or the Snack-on-a-Pole / SOS) must be visible to any peripheral vision.  Thanks to @PETE, I was now able to understand the importance of speed to acknowledge responders to take the appropriate action for person(s) in danger. This is because they were able to locate the information needed as-fast-as-possible without any fuss or delay.  Now, I just wonder if people ever considered using a Tattoo for this case.... "
2519,Can a one year old safely follow a ketogenic diet?,My daughter will be one year old soon and she is slowly adapting to eating 'normal' food.  My girlfriend and I follow a ketogenic diet (I have been doing this for almost 3 years now and my girlfriend for almost a year). I would like my daughter to also follow a (somewhat) ketogenic diet. I don't intend to leave out all the carbs but where I live there is a big tendency to go really high on the carbs. Eating a lot of bread and drinking a lot of milk and have a lot of potatoes or rice or pasta with your dinner.  In The Netherlands you have 'checkups' on your child for the first four years in a (google translate) 'clinic'. These people measure and weigh the child and give advice on the next period regarding food and mental and physical development. They are now basically saying she should switch from formula milk to regular cow milk. I am not really a big fan of milk (partially to my ketogenic lifestyle) and I was wondering what is in the cow milk that she really needs and can they easily be replaced by other things?  The internet only seems to give me information on ketogenic diets for a child if they suffer from certain types of epilepsy. I do not want to take the gamble and cut out carbs if they somehow are very important to her mental and physical development.  My concrete question would be how can I keep the carbohydrates to a minimum while still making sure my child will remain healthy? 
2520,Which ideal body weight formula is used when choosing the ventilator's tidal volume?,"When a patient is under mechanical ventilation, the ventilator's tidal volume is chosen based on the patient's ideal body weight.  However, there exist several ideal body weight formulas. Do practitioners agree on one formula when used for mechanical ventilation, and if so which one?  If practitioners disagree, what are the upsides and downsides of each formula? "
2521,What's the difference between eating 2000 Calories at once compared to eating 4 times a day at 500 Calories?,"I wonder is there any difference in how many times I eat per day?  Let's say I eat one big meal in the morning at 2000 Cal (at 9am). Is that any different than having 4 meals at 500 Cal throughout the day (at 9am, 1pm, 5pm, 9pm)?  I think I will be hungry by the end of the day if I eat just once in the morning. But I won't be hungry if I eat 4 times a day at smaller portions? How is that possible? It's still 2000 Calories. Did I just cheat science?  Which way is it better to eat? Maybe twice a day at 1000 Cal? (9am and like 4pm?)  Head scratch. "
2522,Bleomycin and Cannabis,"To my understanding, bleomycin has a considerably detrimental effect on the lungs of a patient taking it as a part of their chemotherapy regime. However, my question is, if a patient smokes cannabis (Provided it's organically grown without the interference of pesticides and alike) after the treatment, will it effect the functionally and health of the patient's lungs?   Also, what period of time after chemotherapy has ended would it be 'safe,' if at all, to use cannabis recreationally?   Just to add, I have done quite a bit of searching across the Internet for studies and patient accounts regarding the use of cannabis both amidst and post chemotherapy. Although a majority of the things I've read are accounts from patients, none mention having any difficulties with their lungs. All of the accounts I've read attest to it aiding their recovery from treatment.  "
2523,Bleomycin and Oxygen,"Do patients exposed to bleomycin as a part of their chemotherapy regime have to avoid exposure to concentrated levels of oxygen for the rest of their life?   If not, how long after treatment ceases does it take for the lungs of the patient to feel 'normal' again typically? Also, does the age of the patient, say less than 25, play a roll in the prognosis?

2525,Can Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome be caused by medication?,"According to several medical resources, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is congenital and caused by mutation, e.g.           Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene, the gene that codes for the enzyme DHCR7 that normally converts 7DHC to cholesterol in the final step of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. - Reference    This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  - Reference           A friend of mine, who is 4-month pregnant, recently took a medical test giving her a high probability (1 in 8 as the test paper says) of SLO Syndrome. She has mistakenly (not knowing she was pregnant) taken Diane-35 under her doctor's prescription for 21 days in her early pregnancy. Now my question is, given that no mention has been made of drug intervention relationship with the syndrome in the medical resources, at least in those I checked, and that she already has a successful pregnancy background, can SLOS be caused due to drugs? In case of abortion, how can she make sure whether she or her husband is carrier of the syndrome for future pregnancies? "

2528,Does being underweight have an influence on cancer risk?,"This occurred to me reading Lifetime cancer risks for for people with healthy lifestyles? When talking about cancer in regards to body weight, it's usually about obesity.   But does being underweight (BMI below 20) have an effect on cancer risk for any cancer - in any direction?

2529,Why is the skin around my genitals darker than the rest of my body?,"I've noticed that the skin around my genitals are a lot darker; think a darker shade of peach against the rest of my body. Of course, I'm well aware the skin around your nipples seems to be just the same color as the skin around my genitals, but I'd like to understand, why is it this way?  Why is the skin around my genitals so much darker than the rest of my body? I'm fairly sure I don't sunbathe naked, and most of the time my privates are being protected by a few layer of clothing, so what could make the pigmentation so much darker than the rest of my body?

2530,Mastocytoma vs Mastocytosis?,"My 8-month old son has a mastocytoma developing on his arm (confirmed by his pediatrician). Does this mean he also has mastocytosis? Or are they two separate things?  If they are separate, how correlated are they? Anybody know of any statistics as to how likely an infant with a single mastocytoma is to developing mastocytosis later on in life? "
2531,"Infant has a mastocytoma, any cause for concern?","Our 8-month old son is doing very well so far, developing physically and mentally right in lock step with where the ""developmental miletstones"" say he should be.  At around 4 months of age we noticed he started developing a small red mark on his arm that kept getting a little bit bigger every few weeks. At his 6-month well visit the pediatrician said it was a mastocytoma, and that it was nothing to worry about. Furthermore, she said:   It might get bigger It might change color He may have it for a long time   I asked if there were any surgeries available to remove it and she stated that surgical removal often exacerbates them and makes them worse and/or more dangerous.  While this was all very reassuring, it has now almost doubled in size since that 6-month well visit, and is now roughly the size of a thumbtack, so it appears to be picking up ""momentum"".  If you Google mastocytoma, you get back a slurry of articles/blogs/etc. that give mixed information. Some coincide with what the pediatrician said and they state that mastocytoma is nothing to worry about. Others state that while its typically benign, it can become malignant and dangerous under certain conditions.  I guess I'm worried that the pediatrician is simply trying to relieve/placate us by telling us that ""it's alright"". Meanwhile, it's doubling its size every few months.  So I ask: what presentations in mastocytoma should be worrisome and warrant followup/further investigation? What signs/symptoms/changes take us from the ""definitely benign"" zone into the murky in-between zone? Would a trip to the dermatologist be a prudent next step?  Essentially, if this is a worrisome case of mastocytoma, I want to address it as aggressively as possible. "

2533,How much risk am I taking by joining my coworkers for smoke breaks?,"Several of my coworkers take regular smoke breaks outside the office a few times per day. I don't smoke, but I join them once or twice a day. There are a few reasons why I find it valuable to do this:   I enjoy the break, and the conversation Spending time with these coworkers builds my rapport with them Most importantly, valuable business-related information is often discussed   I'm aware of some of the research around secondhand smoke. In particular, I'm aware that it's considered a no-threshold toxicant, which means that the risk increases with exposure, and that even a small amount of exposure can be harmful. Furthermore, the effects of secondhand smoke are well-known to be harmful.  So why the question? I'm trying to weigh the costs and benefits. Essentially everything we do risks some harm for some reward. (E.g., I gather that bonfires are also a no-threshold toxicant.) Presumably the many people in my situation would like a more nuanced answer as to how much risk am I taking by standing outside next to smokers for 15-30 minutes per day? "
2534,Tuberculosis: Lung scarring and weight gain,"I have a few questions regarding tuberculosis:   If a person is cured of Tuberculosis, is it compulsory for all patients effected by Tb to have a patch/scar on their lung? (references for patch)  Reference Can't the patch/scar on the lung ever go away? Or will it stay forever? If it can go away, in what procedure can it be done? One of the references talk about the weight gain. If there is no weight gain, what does that mean?  "
2535,Hot food flask (thermos) effect on nutrients in packed lunch,"General guidelines about optimum nutrition and cooking usually say that one should avoid too much heating and air/light exposure of food to minimize the loss of vitamins and nutrients.   However, there are some products in the market that act like a thermos food flask that one can use to pack hot meals in the early morning and then take to work, to eat around lunch time with the food still very hot (after 6-7 hours). But doesn't keeping the food in tight hot jar/container at such high temperature for 6 or 7 hours actually destroy the nutrients in the food, even if it is tightly sealed?  In other words, if one has the options of packing the food cold and microwaving it later at work versus packing it hot in a thermos and keeping it hot all the way until lunch, which option is healthier? "
2536,Why can thinking make a headache worse?,"I sometimes get headaches where if I try and ignore them and continue with my work, they get so bad I feel sick and have to have a lie down until it passes.

2538,Using corticosteroids during pregnancy,"I recently learned that steroids are sometimes given to mothers in preterm labor.  For example:     If a baby is at risk of being born too early, giving the mother steroids before the birth can help her unborn baby's lungs to develop more quickly. This reduces the risk of the newborn having serious complications or dying   Pregnancy and birth: Before preterm birth: What do steroids do?  However, steroids are also the drug of choice during pregnancy for certain disease, for example for asthma, or in inflammatory diseases because they fight inflammation and NSAIDs should not be taken during pregnancy, if it can be avoided.   For example:     For example, steroid tablets may be recommended if you're pregnant and have severe asthma, because the risk to your baby from uncontrolled asthma is higher than from the medication.   Corticosteroids - Who can use them  Is premature development of the lungs, the desired effect when giving steroids for preterm labor, one of these risks? In other words, when giving steroids to a pregnant woman, does the effect on the fetus's lungs pose any risks?  "
2539,Minimum time between typhoid vaccine and prednisone treatment?,"Having recently completed the typhoid oral vaccine series (live attenuated), I note that one of the described drug interactions are corticosteroids. What is the nature of this drug interaction - is it simply that the immunosuppression reduces the effectiveness of the immune response to the vaccine?  How many days following the completion of the vaccine series should one wait at minimum before taking prednisone (high dose, tapering), in order to maintain the efficacy of the vaccine and prevent side effects? I am unable to find a great deal of information in the literature about this drug interaction.  NB: The doctor seemed unconcerned about this; however, I would still like to know more about the nature and timescale of this drug interaction. "
2540,Possible causes of chronic nasal congestion and dry lips?,"What could be the possible causes of chronic nasal congestion and dry lips? I have read that dry lips can be a result of breathing through one's mouth which can be directly linked to nasal congestion. Are the most likely causes possibly related to factors such as minimal exposure to sunlight, wintry weather with temperatures between 5 and 15 degrees centigrade? Otherwise, is it likely linked to daily, yet minimal exposure to common vehicle exhaust gases? "
2541,Do vitamins protect you from common cold?,"Do vitamins (taken as pills) boost your immune system, and make you less likely to contract diseases such as common cold or flu?   Is there scientific evidence either way?  I tend to think that vitamin pills are mostly useless. If they were beneficial, surely doctors and health organisations would recommend them, but it doesn't appear to be the case.  However, many people feel quite strongly about vitamins and supplements, with the reasoning that ""if they can't help, at least they can't hurt"".   Is there is a medical consensus over this question? "
2542,How does ones TSH tend to vary over the course of a day?,"A single TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) blood test is commonly used to help diagnose thyroid problems, however my understanding is that the TSH tends to vary substantially over the course of a day, based on time of day (eg TSH is highest at about 5am, from memory).   Is there data and/or a chart available that illustrates typical variation over the course of a day for people with a healthy thyroid? How about for people with thyroid problems? "
2543,What to eat to maintain regular thyroid activity?,"My friend has hypothyroidism and I have had hyperthyroidism in the past.

2544,Is it possible to have dental sealants removed permanently?,"I'm interested in whether it's possible to have dental sealants (on the back molars) removed (and not replaced).  I've heard from (possibly not-credible sources) that acid used when applying (possibly taking off?) the filling etches the enamel on the teeth. Thus, once you get sealants you must always have sealants.  Is this true?  "
2545,What are side effects frequencies based on?,"I am one of these patients who reads everything that comes with their pills. Including, of course, the sometimes really long side effects list. Where I am, and from what I read online this is common, these side effects are sorted into several frequency categories (common/rare/very rare/sporadic, something like that).   Yesterday, after years, I realized I had no idea where those frequencies come from. Do they come from scientific studies? From people participating in really large-scale trials?   Or from doctors reporting back on what their patients report? From patients reporting it? But then, how are the frequencies determined? ""Common"", for example means something around 10 percent where I am, so you don't just need to know how many people report that side effect, you need to know how many people took the medication (and did so as instructed, and didn't take anything that interfered with it, etc.).   So, where do these frequencies and these lists of side effects come from?   I'm in Germany, but I am open to an answer as to how this works in any country.  "
2546,How to avoid back pain while sleeping?,I usually experience back pain while I sleep. I was wondering if there is any way to prevent this. Are there specific sleeping positions that can prevent back pain? Should I use different types of beds or pillows? 
2547,Are there any untoward synergistic effects in taking a combination of acetaminophen plus ibuprofen?,"A number of years ago, it became popular to advocate a combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen (or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication) at the usual higher doses (e.g. 1,000mg acetaminophen plus 400mg ibuprofen*) because studies had shown increased efficacy over either medication alone in pain relief.  In fact, I believe in Europe there are over-the-counter products that combine the two.  My question: does the combination of the two medications taken together have increased risks above the combined risks of the individual medications? If so, is the mechanism of the untoward synergistic effect known?  *Dosage based on studies showing that higher doses of ibuprofen were no better at pain relief than 1200 mg/day. "

2552,Is breathing using the nose and diaphragm truly healthier?,"Searching for instructions on how to breathe properly one generally comes across the following:         Breathe using the nose.    Breathe using the diaphragm.      Yet I have never seen these claims with reliable sources.  They are generally found with other claims that aim towards relieving stress, but this ones I take for granted since I can test them out on my own. (E.g: breathing rhytmically; taking large breaths.)   I understand that the nose would be more useful than the mouth due to the fact that mucus is a defense mecanism against unwanted parasites, yet I don't understand why it is preferred if the mouth can accumulate more air in less time. (Or at least it seems like that.)   So, are these two claims truly healthier?  Do they apply while doing heavy exercise like running?

2553,What are the downsides of hypnosurgery (vs. using traditional anaesthetics)?,I can only find upsides of hypnosurgery on its Wikipedia page:   fewer side effects patients can leave the hospital sooner reduction in blood loss  post-operative nausea  etc.   What are the downsides of hypnosurgery (vs. using traditional anaesthetics)? 
2554,Systemic effect of topical diclofenac,"Topical diclofenac (as Voltaren gel, for example) is a popular choice for quite a few things, from osteoarthritis to sports injuries.   Diclofenac itself can be hard on the body, especially the stomach, but not just because it's taken orally. How much systemic effect does topical diclofenac retain? Is there any rough ""dosage equivalency"", like ""x grams of topical gel a day equals one 15mg tablet in terms of the systemic effect""?  "
2555,Is there a synergistic effect between phosphate and testosterone in respect to Physiology?,"For example: A patient's blood analysis results come through, and it states that the patient has high testosterone and high phosphate levels.  What are the likely causes of this, assuming/acknowledging that environmental factors etc, are not contributing factors to the results and the thyroid gland is correctly functioning?  However, the condition of the parathyroid gland is unknown. Would it be a proper first response to rule out the possibility of a malfunctioning parathyroid gland via further testing? "
2556,"Excessive sweating of hands/feet: what is it, and how is it dealt with?","What are the reasons for hands and feet that appear to sweat an abnormal amount?   Here's a bit of information, to explain what I mean with an ""abnormal amount"":   visibly seeing the moisture on hands and feet (there doesn't seem to be a pattern as to when this occurs, though) sweat hindering normal day-to-day functions: reading books, writing, shaking hands, playing sports (tennis racket slipping, ...), etc.    What is this called, what causes it, and how common is it?

2558,How long should I wait to drive after taking a painkiller?,"Recently, I was prescribed hydrocodone. Part of the instructions I was given (on the label, from the physician, and from the pharmacist) included not to drive while taking the medication. However, it wasn't clear (and I didn't ask at the time) how long the driving restriction applies.   The medication label states to take no more than one pill every six hours. 6 hours? This drugs.com Q&amp;A says it stays in your body 24 hours, with no citation and little explanation. 1 day? Should I trust my own judgment (when I no longer feel woozy)? This seems like the least safe option.  "
2559,Are artificial dyes harmful to children?,"I've seen many claims online regarding artificial dyes causing problems such as ADD/ADHD in children, such as this one from healthychild.org.

Do artificial colors (in the concentrations seen in food and drink products) represent a risk to children? "
2560,What heart condition(s) cause tingling and lightheadedness that are NOT caught by an ECG?,"Please note: A lot of things cause tingling in the face + extremities (""neuropathy"") as well as lightheadedness, but in this question, I'm only interested in potential heart conditions, or anything cardiovascular in etiology.  Is it possible for someone to have an underlying heart/vascular condition that is causing neuropathy and lightheadedness, but to also have a perfectly ""clean"" ECG? If so, what condition(s) exist and why do they fly under the ""ECG radar""?    I googled this extensively and either nothing came back, or the results mentioned that ECGs would be successful in detection. "
2561,Do Western Blot 'false negatives' eventually produce positives?,"I've heard again and again that the Western Blot test, used to detect the presence of Lyme Disease, often produces false negatives.  But I would suspect that at some point, whatever it is that Lyme Disease produces that this Western Blot test checks for, must eventually be unable to evade detection. I would suspect that - eventually - all people with Lyme will test positive with Western Blot.  Or am I wrong? Perhaps there are different strains of Lyme and the Western Blot only checks for certain ones. Or something like that. Any ideas? "

2564,Why does icing work best when applied shortly after tendinitis symptoms appear?,"It is recommended to apply ice as soon as possible after tendinitis symptoms appear. Is icing quickly after the injury much more effective than after a while (e.g. a few days), and if so why?  This Yahoo answer post by Susan says :     Apply ice in the first 48 hours following an injury is effective in   that it will constrict blood vessels, thereby limiting fluid rushing   to the area and reducing swelling. The cold can also be helpful in   pain reduction. With an injury, a knee included, the R.I.C.E. method   is best to employ- Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. Rest the   area, apply Ice (15-20 minutes at a time, never directly on the skin   and always allowing the skin to return to normal body temperature   before reapplication- this usually means waiting at least 60 minutes   between applications), Compression as in an Ace bandage or similar   wrap and Elevating the affected limb on pillows or in a sling above   the level of the heart. You can take Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen for   pain relief with Ibuprofen being the better choice due to its   anti-inflammatory properties. It is best to take it with food.       Icing an injury will not stiffen a joint.       The cons to icing an injury are leaving the ice on for too long a   period of time or icing the injury beyond the first 48 hours. After   the first 48 hours, moist heat should be used.       If the patient is undergoing Physical Therapy, often the Therapist   will begin the session with moist heat to relax and loosen the area to   be worked and after going through exercises they may apply ice briefly   in closing.   But does not give a reference. "
2565,Right wrist pain from using computer mouse,"I'm Shimmy, almost 30ish, Male, 6', 158 lbs.  I'm a heavy computer user and sit in front of my homedesk for long intervals (5-18h daily).  I use the computer mostly for working with text (software development), selecting text, accessing menus, drag-drop etc.  In seasons, depending on how heavily I'm sitting at my desk, I suffer from right hand strain and pain.  It might be due the wrong chair height or desk setup, wrong sitting, hand rest or whatever. Please help me find out what's causing the problem, what does this kind of pain signal, and what can I do to avoid it and any related injury.    I suspect it might be because of the hand-rest, is it related? If yes, should I rest/unrest my hand on it? Should I completely remove it? Should I lift my chair a bit? Any other mouse set ups and other alternatives to consider?   In the preceding figure, I tried to mark on this picture the channels I feel pain, but the most of it is either at the wrist knuckle (between arm and hand), and at my hand top.  I use the Tzora Rialto chair, not that I believe anyone knows, but it's a pretty customizable chair, I just don't know to choose the right setup (you can see the available customizations in their website, see the middle tab on the bottom):   Here're some pictures of my desk setup and my hand as I normally sit on it:     "

2569,Why am I advised not to eat immediately before exercise?,"It is commonly said that, after eating, you should wait 2-3 hours before exercising. It isn't recommended to eat and right afterwards to exercise (or swim).  But I haven't really understood why that is. Does this bad behavior affect me immediately (if I'm in robust health) or does it affect me in the long term? Înd how? "
2570,Are nitrites/nitrates in processed meat unhealthy?,"A friend of mine has avoided eating any conventional processed meat products for almost a decade because he heard about a risk of cancer and/or prostate problems associated with consumption of nitrites and nitrates used as preservatives.  I have seen a few studies that suggest this is the case:   Systematic Review of the Prospective Cohort Studies on Meat Consumption and Colorectal Cancer Risk Processed meat consumption, dietary nitrosamines and stomach cancer risk in a cohort of Swedish women   What is the current medical consensus on this? Is it advisable to avoid processed meat products and anything else containing nitrites and nitrates? "

2574,Would butter on burns help or harm?,"I have read (a long time ago, in an old book) that butter is good for burns. Is this true, and if so what is it that helps?  Is salted or unsalted butter better? And how should it be applied, and kept there? "
2575,Can urinary tract infection be treated by inducing urination?,"Urinary tract infection causes dysconfort by giving the urge to urinate even with empty bladder. The one time I had the symptoms (blood in urine, urge to urinate again), I forced myself into drinking too much water so my bladder filled again in a few minutes, so I could urinate. I repeated the process during the course of a few hours, and each time the urine was clearer, and never again I had the symptoms (this was about 4 years ago). Today my girlfriend had the same symptoms, and she used the same procedure. She also went to the hospital, and due to excessive urination, the urine sample she collected for the examination was water-clear. Results came out with no indication of infection, so the doctor sent us home without antibiotics.  Is there any study or established knowledge that forcing urination is an effective treatment for UTI? Should I be worried she might still need antibiotics? "
2576,"Dangers of having MRI, CT-scan, & X-ray within a seven day period?","I had a MRI last week for my spine. I got a call today that I'm having a CT-scan tomorrow for my abdomen (unrelated issue). The day after tomorrow, I'm having X-rays done on my teeth at the dentist because I cracked my teeth. These are all unrelated medical issues. But all these medical issues required medical-imaging that happened to be scheduled within 7 days of each other.   Is it dangerous to have a MRI, CT-scan, and an X-ray all within a week's period? Are they all radioactive? Also, I had an ultrasound 2 weeks ago (which was unhelpful --- which is why I'm now having the CT-scan).  "
2577,How does gallbladder removal affects fat digestion?,"If I understand correctly, the sole purpose of the gallbladder is to store extra bile that is opportunely released in order to properly digest fat.  When the gallbladder is removed, what happens when there's not enough bile to digest a given amount of fat? And particularly, what happens with the fat that does not get digested?  I had my gallbladder removed a few weeks back and I've heard that consuming a relatively high amount of fat might produce problems such as diarrhea, gas and bloating, but I haven't experienced these (fortunately, or perhaps I haven't consumed a meal high enough in fat yet). In addition, I don't understand if the undigested fat is excreted or just stored in the bodyâas opposed to being properly used as a nutrient (I Googled this and there are mentions and accounts of both weight loss and gain; I didn't find proper research papers or a reliable source). "
2578,What are the medications you definitely need to tell your dentist about?,"I will go see a new dentist and I know that they ask all their patients what medications they're taking (in the US, at least). However, I don't want to tell my dentist this information because I feel like dentists and their staff do not keep things very private. Staff at some dental offices seem overly curious and may gossip a lot. And at some dental offices, I've heard very detailed conversations about the medical issues of other patients. I want to protect my privacy. Is it ok if I just say I'm not taking any medications? To put the question in more specific terms, which medications are actually crucial to tell your dentist about (for fear of serious medication interaction effects)? "
2579,Odd leg swelling,"34 year old male. Had a long flight to Cancun Dec 2015, when I arrived my feet and lower legs began to get extremely swollen and red and put me out of commission for the first 3 or 4 days of my vacation.  I saw two doctors there and they couldn't identify it, they thought it was some sort of cellulitis.  Ever since that time, I started getting them regularly.  It started occurring monthly (mid=Jan 2016 was the next time) but around Sept '16 it's been daily.  My shoes hardly fit - I don't tie my laces anymore,  - this IS with compression socks warn each day.  The socks used to help, but now the swelling seems to just force the socks to expand, too.  I've gone through two primary care doc's in this time, and I had two docs in Cancun look at me.  I've had a rheumatalogist specialist look at it, I've had multiple ultrasounds and X-rays on my legs.  My PCP had me go to the ER in Sept for redness developing and I ended up being checked in for 3 days with bag after bag of different antibiotic IVs (at least 3 or 4 types) and then I was sent home with amoxicillin (which I discovered I was allergic to). Since then, I haven't had a single day where the swelling wasn't there.   I get intense leg cramps, my toes will get sharp pains and go numb/purple sometimes.   The various doctors keep suggesting Buergers and Cellulitis and maybe some other stuff, but I wasn't diagnosed with anything (why not?).  After some time with this and lots of reading, I don't think it's Buergers anymore.  I had extremely high IgA and ALT levels on my blood test results 3 times, then suddenly they were normal on the 4th test (not sure if this is anything related).    Does anyone have any idea what I could do to help the problem?  Or any idea what could be causing something like this?  Thanks "

2582,Does photographic (eidetic) memory exist or is it a medical myth?,"I was always under the impression that photographic, aka eidetic memory (from the Greek word for ""form""), was a genuine, realistic condition. It's referenced in pop-culture a lot. As a child in grade school, I was always envious of the people somewhere out there that had this condition because I always wanted it for my math, spelling, history, geography, etc. tests.   However, this idealized ""photographic"" memory has seem more and more of a myth. Sure, some are born with a keen sense of memory than others, but they aren't just born with a photographic memory, but that this is something that they have to train their brains to do (I'm not sure if their memory/brain exercises will ever reach the degree of ""photographic"" -- does anyone know)? Anyway, is this a correct realization? Or does photographic/eidetic memory actually exist from birth?   Or is photographic memory only achieveable through memory exercises such as the ""memory palace""?  I know that there is the condition of hyperthmesia, where individuals are able to recall vivid details from their own personal life, but that's not quite the same as seeing thousands of numbers and memorizing the order. But is hyperthemsia a real condition too?   "
2583,Are cremated ashes medically harmful to the living?,"Disneyland's Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean have become notorious public touristy locations to sprinkle/spread ashes of deceased loved ones, according many articles, including this one: Secrets of Disneyland. Disneyland has a firm ""no spreading cremated remains"" policy, and it always removes the ashes from the rides ASAP upon discovering that they have been covertly sprinkled by park guests on the ride.   I understand completely why Disneyland does this... Cultural sensitives, ash buildup can cause maintenance issues, cleanliness standard, among tons of other things (but out of respect for everyone else), but I'm curious if cremated ashes of a cadaver are medically harmful or cause any health hazards to living humans? Like is it toxic to accidentally inhale a bit of it?   Is Disneyland also removing the ashes immediately because of health risks?? Or is more of the cultural-respect and clean atmosphere (and probably legal standards)?  "
2584,We add Sodium with salt but not Potassium,"I know that the blood needs both Potassium and Sodium. However, we use only added Sodium with our food (when we salt it). The medical saline is also water + sodium chloride and contains no potassium. Why is the imbalance? Should I avoid added NaCl in my food since it is not paired with K and, as such, will be drained by kindeys anyway or Should I look for added Potassium salt to recover the balance?  "
2585,Surgical masks - do they prevent the spread of disease?,"Now and then you see something like this when looking at pictures from Japan:    There are supposedly many reasons for this, but one is, quoting a summary from Wikipedia:     Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public in East Asian countries to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases; in Japan, it is common to wear a face mask whilst ill to avoid infecting others in public settings. In Japan and Taiwan, it is common to see these masks worn while ill, as a show of consideration for others and social responsibility.   (emphasis mine)  My question is: Does it help? That is, are people in Japan less sick from airborne diseases compared to cultures where it is not common to wear a mask? Are there any data to back it up, or to disprove it? I'm specifically thinking of the common cold, but other diseases would be interesting.  I appreciate the difficulty in answering such a question - it seems as if you would have to find a near-identical country to compare with, but then again, there are probably a lot of organizations tracking just this sort of thing.

I talked to my Dentist and He is our of Town and will be available after 3 days. Dentist said - "" Leave it as it is. It will cause no harm.""  But I suspect, since food and water (Water is hard at my area)  can get between tooth and the bracket, And 3 days are enough for cavity to dominate. Is my tension worth?

We make out all the time, and I've never given him hickeys before  (never desired or thought about giving him hickeys -- or even knew how), so I'm not sure how I gave him not just one, but several on his neck this weekend. I didn't seem to do anything different.   How long do hickeys last? What are good ways to promote the healing process?   Since I'm not sure how I managed to give him hickeys since I made out with him as I normally do, how do I prevent future hickeys -- he's pretty embarrassed about it.

2591,"Taking pills A + B individually instead of 1 cold medication that has A + B + C + D, bad idea?","When you have cold symptoms and go the pharmacy, you have two categories of choices:   Individual over-the-counter medications to treat specific symptoms, such as:   Pain reliever/fever reducer (example: Acetaminophen 325 mg) Nasal decongestant (example: Phenylephrine HCl 10 mg) Cough suppressant (example: Dextromethorphan HBr 15 mg) Expectorant (example: Guaifenesin 100 mg)  ""Cocktail"" (...correct terminology?) drugs, such as:   Tylenol cold + flu severe (Acetaminophen 325 mg, Dextromethorphan HBr 10 mg, Guaifenesin 200 mg, Phenylephrine HCl 5 mg) TopCare cold multi-symptom (Acetaminophen 325 mg, Phenylephrine HCl 5 mg, Dextromethorphan HBr 10 mg)    My understanding is, if you only have, say, only 2 cold symptoms, it's better (or at least, not worse) to simply take the individual medications that treat the symptoms separately rather than some ""combination"" drug that also treats other symptoms you might not have. At best, that would seem like a waste of the drug, and at worse, it might have side effects.  To be 100% crystal clear, I'm assuming a reasonably intelligent layperson here who pays attention to the active ingredients and the dosages and who doesn't blindly mix and match. For example:   I'm NOT asking about mixing e.g. Topcare Acetaminophen + Tylenol Cold, which would double-dose the acetaminophen and potentially cause liver damage. I'm assuming no overlap of active ingredients.   I'm NOT asking about mixing 4 drugs at 2x the dosages that they would be found in a combination drug. I'm assuming the dosages are close to what they would be in the combination drugs. I'm NOT asking about mixing Ibuprofen + Acetaminophen, or Ibuprofen + Dextromethorphan HBr for that matter. Again, this is because I'm assuming the combinations taken are already obviously found in existing OTC drugs on the shelf at similar dosages, and in this example they're not.   Given these, am I correct that it's better (or not worse) to treat the individual symptoms here, or is it worse? For example, might I overdose on the inactive ingredients, or might they interact dangerously? "
2592,Is the second vaccine dose necessary if seroconversion occurred after the first dose?,"My question is applicable to all multi-dose vaccines with vaccination intervals of several weeks, though the specific case that triggered my question was the chickenpox vaccine Varilrix/GSK.  My assumption is that, if after the first dose of the chickenpox vaccine, the patient develops chickenpox-like blisters (more than 10), that seroconversion occurred and that the patient would have detectable and lasting antibodies against chickenpox.  If that is true and if seroconversion certainly happened, is it at all necessary to vaccinate a second time?  My analogy is that, if actual chickenpox infection conveys long lasting immunity and the vaccine-strain infection certainly happened, will that be enough for long-lasting immunity?  Or is vaccine effectiveness independent of how the immune system reacts to a single dose? "
2593,Safe UV exposure time,"How long can our body be exposed to UV to not cause health problems like skin cancer, etc,. In some parts of the USA, the UV index can reach High (7-9). I'm trying to understand if I need to stay outdoors during this time for few hours, can it cause skin cancer? If not, how long is the safe duration without having health issues? "
2594,How can I evaluate my sleeping habits based on a Fitbit Charge HR (or similar)?,"The Fitbit Charge HR allows one to track their sleep by continuously monitoring motion and heart rate. It uses algorithms to infer when its user falls asleep and when they wake. The next morning, Fitbit's software can generate a report of the sleep, including:    Time spent asleep  Sleep/wake schedule (timestamps for ""bedtime"" and ""wake up"") Periods of wakefulness (plus number of times awake and total time being awake) Periods of restlessness (plus number of times restless and total time being restless)   How can I use this report to gauge the quality of my sleep? What's normal, and what's the ideal?  A naive answer might be that 8 hrs of sleep plus no periods of restlessness or wakefulness would be ideal. This varies from person to person and with age, however: a baby wakes more than an adult, and an elderly person may wake to use the bathroom--but each case is healthy and ""normal"". Moreover, a sleep doctor I had once said that it's normal and healthy for the body to turn over several times while sleeping, if only to improve circulation and decrease stiffness.  "
2595,"Survival Cannibalism: extreme starvation lead to pica disorder then to cannibalism? What is ""edible""?","Desperate times call for desperate measures. I've been reading a lot about the Donner Party who came to a screeching halt on the Sierra Nevadas when snowstorms and starvation killed the majority of the party, the first settlers of Jamestown who faced certain death due to starvation, and last, but not least, the rugby team aboard a Uruguayan flight that crashed into the Andes, and their desperate attempts to survive. All of these truly unfortunate atrocities have two things in common: starvation and cannibalism.   I have a number of questions relating to Survival Cannibalism (which is what the above incidents are about). In all cases, survivors tried to avoid eating their deceased counterparts at all costs, I'm sure, so I'm wondering...   did they first developed pica disorder, where they craved other items instead? Like leather shoes, fur jackets, wagon canvases, etc? Are those even edible?  Or is it not considered genuine pica disorder because ""desperate times  call for desperate measures,"" and it's not like they were craving that over a nice hamburger and steak fries. It's just that those were the only things available besides their deceased loved ones? When they eventually did start consuming their deceased friends and family, what parts of the body were the most edible? Or the most commonly consumed areas? (As I imagine that the survivors wouldn't want to look at the face of the dead as they cut them as it would exacerbate survivor's guilt all the more)?  "
2596,How to tell if someone is high on meth?,"This is a duplicate of a question asked on Parenting.stackexchange.com, that I'm reposting on this site because I want an answer to this, too. I've never heard of anything like this before, I always heard of Methamphetamine ruining somebody's life/ health. In this case, it seems to be making it better:     ""My 16 year old son used to take weed, XANAX, and Adderall and I was easily able to tell when he was high on any of them. He somehow managed to get a medical marijuana prescription so now I just have to let go of the fact that he can smoke weed.       ""He recently moved on to methamphetamine and I have no way of telling weather he is high or not. I tried comparing Adderall reviews to methamphetamine and from what I garnered meth is the same as Adderall but without the side effects such as the speedy talking and weirdness, but much higher neurotoxicity.      ""We have a hidden camera in our kitchen and I saw him take meth on the kitchen table. When I came home I tried noticing any signs of him being high, but I couldn't find any. Unlike Adderall, he talked completely normally. He did all his homework and chores and even took pride in it, and on top of that studied math even when he didn't have to. He normally finds all of that boring and rarely does it. I didn't want to let him know we had a camera in the kitchen, and I didn't want him to think that the completion of his chores and homework was a sign of him using drugs, so I stayed quiet. He was up until 4am practicing for a test that he had 2 days later, and whenever I walked in, he wasn't playing any video games and actually studying. I have never seen him this way (working so hard without going behind our back to play games), but again, I don't want to make him think its a sign that he using meth.      ""His grades changed to A's and B's once he started using meth, but I know how neurotoxic it is, and that the long term effects are extremely terrible, and I hate to admit it but meth turned him into a better person, but only when he's on it, when he gets off it he is much worse then he was before.      ""Eventually I asked him straight-up if he was any drugs besides what I knew, and whenever he is on meth he is extremely honest so he admitted to his use. He claimed it isn't a problem and that he takes 40mg every 2 days orally and that he lets the comedown happen, but I know that meth is really bad long term so I don't want him taking it.      ""Does anyone know how to tell if someone is high on meth besides the fact that he is working on chores and homework?""   Credit to kirill2485 for the OP.  Link to post: [website]"
2597,Which blood test results would most indicate further testing for cancer?,"As a member of the healthcare community, I've long been taught (as we have all) that test results are only valid in the context of symptoms and at the discretion of a healthcare professional.  That being said, preventative medicine has long suffered at the hands of treatment-based medicine, and at present the cost of routinely conducting tests for the most dangerous of medical conditions is prohibitive for most. In the interest of promoting preventative medicine, what if routine, inexpensive blood tests were used as a prescreening for further condition-specific testing, rather than strictly as an accompaniment to patient complaints of symptoms?  To zero in on one common and dangerous category of conditions in particular, which test results in common blood tests (CBC, CMP, etc.) would most indicate, with high sensitivity and irrespective of symptoms or whether the patient is even experiencing symptoms yet, further testing for potential cancer cases? "
2598,Is a taste test a reliable way to determine mineral deficiencies?,"I stumbled across a rather odd class of products online, dubbed ""trace mineral taste test kits"". I won't link to them because it'll probably trigger all the spam filter bots, but a typical product description is as follows (emphasis mine):     Set Contains: 8 - 8 oz bottles Liquid Mineral Test          Potassium    Zinc    Magnesium    Copper    Chromium    Manganese    Molybdenum    Selenium          To Test - Sip a small portion. Swish the liquid about the mouth, you may discard or swallow. The mg. Content of each mineral per taste test is insignificant.       You need this mineral if the taste is sweet, pleasant or no taste. You have an adequate amount of the mineral if you taste something. You don't need this mineral if the taste is so-so, you don't like it, or it's pretty bad.   At a glance this seems to be a bit of pseudo-science to me. On the other hand I do know that e.g. food tastes better when I'm hungry, water tastes better when I'm thirsty, etc.  Is this based in truth? Are mineral deficiencies, at least the ones in that list, self-identifiable based on the ""pleasantness"" of the taste? I'm primarily looking for answers backed by concrete, peer-reviewed studies from reliable sources. "
2599,What's the difference between Vanishing Twin Syndrome & Fetus in Fetu?,"What is the medical/clinical difference between Vanishing Twin Syndrome and Fetus in Fetu??   General Differences:   I know that in both cases, there is a set of twins, but then there is just one fetus in the end. So is the difference on how that comes to be?? Or on how the case manifests itself?   Vanishing Twin Syndrome   From what I understand about ""Vanishing Twin Syndrome"" is that one of the twins is absorbed by another (sometimes due to it being a blighted ovum)? But are there any times in which the alpha    fetus absorbed a fetus that would have survived?   Fetus in Fetu   And with Fetus in Fetu -- A fetus (or teratoma) that dies is not absorbed by the other growing twin, but exists as a separate entity inside the fetus that will survive?     And with Fetus in Fetu --- is    it really thought to be a teratoma and not just a non-viable fetus?   Is this correct? "
2600,Are all Infants' Aquatic Instincts lost after 7ish months? Can they be maintained if skills are utilized often?,"Babies have extraordinary instincts upon their arrival just into this world. It just happens naturally. One of these is of the swimming variety as witnessed in this video Underwater Baby Divers. Who knew!?!   The trait we just witnessed in this video is  described in this article, Life Science: 5 Incredible Baby Skills, known as:      the ""diving reflex,"" also known as the bradycardic response; also   exhibited by seals and other aquatic animals, the instinct may be a   vestige of our ancient marine origins.      It works like this: Infants up to 6 months old whose heads are   submerged in water will naturally hold their breath. At the same time,   their heart rates slow, helping them to conserve oxygen, and blood   circulates primarily between their most vital organs, the heart and   brain. The survival response keeps accidentally submerged babies alive   much longer than adults would survive underwater.   Another astounding video to watch is Babies Swimming, but it is almost 4 minutes long and has uber cheesy music in the background.   A scientific/medically based article is found here: Bradycardic response during submersion in infant swimming  Now these infants aren't engaging in synchronized swimming extravaganzas or anything of that nature, but what they are capable of doing just on instincts is incredible!!!  I imagine this is a vestige of a positive evolutionary trait. For example, if an infant slipped into a lake while mother was bathing nearby, etc. etc. etc.   NOW TO MY QUESTIONS:   1. Why do infants lose these instincts around 7ish months?   --- Is it because they are not as vulnerable?  --- Or that they are larger and have more strength and their reflexes don't work the same?   --- Or they simply forget because their minds are being filled with other important pieces of information?  2. If under the watchful eye of a professional trainer, lifeguard, parent, etc., the infant utilized these skills frequently, would they be able to maintain their ""diving reflex"" beyond the 7ish month period?    To be clear I do not advocate at anytime that these infants have advanced swimming capabilities to swim alone... so never leave a baby or child unattended near a body of water  "
2601,Why do we need a rabies vaccine after exposure?,"So I understand the need for rabies vaccination ""before"" exposure since the vaccine basically prepares the immune system, so that in the future should the same intruder enter the body again, the immune system already knows how to handle it.  What I dont understand however is the need of an immediate rabies vaccine for a person after he/she has been exposed to rabies virus (bitten, scratched by a rabid dog) , assuming he/she has not been vaccinated before.  The rabies virus is already in the saliva of the rabid animal right? and the immune system should already start making the necessary antibodies to counter it right? What's the purpose of injecting a weaker version of the virus if the immune system is going to create the antibodies anyway?   Is the immune system more effective, efficient and quick in creating a solution if it is introduced to a much weaker version of the virus? And after figuring out a ""fix"", it applies this to the original, strong version of the virus?   Or is the immune system not very responsive to the original virus and it must be ""triggered"" first to create the necessary ""fix"" by introducing a weaker version with which it is more responsive?  In any case, I'm quite lost on this. "
2602,Baby aspirin interaction with other NSAIDs,Baby Aspirin (ASA 81 mg) commonly prescribes as a cardiovascular protective agent because of its unique antiplatelet effect. NSAID-NSAID interaction is a famous well known interaction.1 2 3  My question is in a patient with risk of cardiovascular disease and another disease like arthritis (which patient needs NSAIDs everyday for the pain) which is a common situation in senior patients.  based on studies/guidelines is it right and safe to prescribe this combination (NSAID like diclofenac + baby Aspirin) specially with the knowledge that this combination gonna be used for a long time?  if it is what is the best nsaid choice for this situation and how should they be taken (in different hour/ dosage adjustment)? 
2603,Why does breathing stop during cardiac arrest?,"I've been reading about resuscitation, and found several suggestions that people don't continue breathing after effective heart function stops because the diaphragm quickly runs out of oxygen.  Is this correct?  As best I can tell, current conventions are to continue to attempt resuscitation so long as brain stem cells are likely to stay alive, which, at normal body temperature, seems to be somewhere around 5 minutes after loss of pulse.  But while the brain stem is alive, does the respiration center not continue to (try to) breathe?  If so, does the diaphragm really use all of its blood's reserve oxygen in just a few breaths, and simply not have energy to breathe?  If not, is there some other effect that impairs breathing when the heart is not pumping effectively?  I suspect it's the latter, since otherwise CPR would never include respiration, and effective CPR would be evidenced by the subject's breathing. "

2610,Did my dentist lie to me?,"I went to the dentist a couple of years ago for a diagnosis of my jaw clicking. He told me it was TMJ joint disorder and said that my jaw was misalligned and needed to be corrected. he showed me a mirror and showed how the two teeth on the top were fractionally misalligned with the gap of the bottom two teeth.   now he told me to lift my arm. I did, and he was easily able to push my arm down. He told me my misaligned jaw meant that my muscles were off centre and therefore weak. He then moved my jaw until the top and bottom teeth were centered and made me bite onto a popsicle stick. Now he told me to put my arm out and when he tried to push it down he said he couldn't because i am much stronger now. He prescribed me a $2000 AUD pair of braces that i can put on and off, which will fix my TMJ. He said it could take a few months, he said it could take a few years, but it will eventually be cured. Back then i was still a kid living with my mum and I told her the TMJ joint disorder made my jaws lock when i opened my mouth and i couldn't eat so she ended up buying it for me. I wore it for about a week and it just felt like it was making things worse. so i stopped wearing it and after about 3 days it got better. 3 months after that i went to the dentist again who said i got much better. I didn't tell him that i stopped wearing it.  The reason im bringing this up is because i saw the ""put your arm out and resist me pushing your arm down"" thing done by this energy stone seller on TV. It seemed like a con artist gig. Also, my tmj has been acting up again 3 days ago. do misalligned jaws really weaken you by so much? are jaw correction braces the best way to fix TMJ?  "

Note that this single entry is the 3rd leading cause of death (after heart disease and cancer) so it is important.  I know that in cancer there is something called ""minimal residual disease"" meaning residual cancer cells that regrow and cause a relapse, however in that case I would have expected the mortality to coded as cancer, so this category would seem to be something different, or no?

2622,Does increasing âallergyâ histamine affect âwakeâ histamine? Do both respond to the same triggers?,"I understand that histamine is used by the body as part of the immune response, widening blood vessels, etc., to aid the white blood cells in their attack. Often this ends up helping them attack perfectly innocuous foods, leading to allergy attacks.   I also understand that histamine is also used by the body in regulating the sleep/wake cycle; this is why first-generation non-discriminatory antihistamines cause people to feel sleepy.   Are these different histamines correlated with one another? Would intentionally causing an allergy attack, for instance, promote âwakeâ histamine, causing a person to feel more alert? (I imagine thatâs a stupid idea, but in theory, would it work? I mean that it would cause a person to feel more alert because of increased histamine, regardless of any increased epinephrine levels that potentially might go along with it.)   Along similar lines, while I imagine you canât directly measure the âwakeâ histamine due to blood-brain barrier issues, could you diagnose a sleep disorder by measuring âallergyâ histamine and use that to indirectly determine how much âwakeâ histamine one has? "
2623,Fluoride poisoning by toothpaste,"Long story short: Is there a maximum number of teeth brushing per day without having fluoride poisoning?    Full story: It is certain that a high fluoride intake leads to health problems.  This is related to ingestion only (that is swallowing toothpaste, drinking high-fluoride water, eating rich-fluoride food) of this element.  While, when we talk about fluoride in toothpastes, we have a completely different assumption and absorption mechanism. Thus, I assume, there will be different AI (adequate intake) and UL (upper intake level) than for fluoride food assumption[a].     my assumption is sustained by the fact that most commercial toothpastes[b][c][d] have less than 1500 ppm of Fâ in them   Ultimately, does exist a daily upper safety level for fluorine absorbed from the toothpaste?

But then I thought about it... and I understand that the contacts need to fit to your eyes and such, so they need to know how bulgy or small your eyes are, etc -- but does the overall eyesight prescription stay the same?

2628,Caffeine clearance range/distribution and what determines it,"A Sci. Am. article mentioned that     Some people's bodies clear caffeine within a few hours, but lunchtime coffee may still be in the system of other people even late at night.

2631,Food sanitation,"After getting ill due to bad sanitation of ingredients I decided to know a little better of the process of food hygienization.  It first occurred to me that a good first step would be to use lots of strong antibacterial products. Later on after reading I realised that most elements 'that-are-not-the-food-itself' (dirt &amp; etc) are either water soluble or fat soluble, that means if you apply water combined with soap most of the stuff will go away (suppose you had sugar coating the food and olive oil, they would be rinsed).  If you went one step further and used an antibacterial product chances are you would probably get rid of anything that could do harm to your health.  My question is  a) are there any other big group of components that aren't neither water nor fat soluble and could be hazardous?  b) talking about general food sanitation which is usually more effective?   the chemical act of removing through soap and water killing bacteria and other harmful organisms using antibacterial products   Any other general thoughts about sanitation is appreciated since this is a very important question of notorious public concern and I couldn't find expert opinions on the subject "
2632,Does the usage of PC muscle to achieve multiple orgasm in males cancels or transfers the ejacuation to the bludder?,"There is a concept about dry/multiple male orgasm. Most common idea is what by practicing clenching of ones pubococcygeus (PC) muscle just before a point when the process of ejacuation begins, a male can achieve orgasm without ejacuating or rest/refactory period. Question is: out of these options (or other which are not listed here) which is the true one? 1. Clenching PC muscle cancels the process of ejacuation and  the inflow of rest/refactory chemicals, but not the orgasm. 2. The ejacuation still continues to the next available ""outlet"", i.e. the bludder? "
2633,Does Blood Testing give meaningful insights in Vitamin/Mineral Deficiency?,"I yesterday watched the documentary Vitamania by Dr Derek Muller, which is about the production, benefits and risks of vitamin supplements. In the film, he briefly talked about people being blood tested in order to get some insights if they are vitamin and/or mineral deficient.  So I was wondering: When we as humans have to pretty much constantly get the vitamins our body needs to function right, can a blood test really give meaningful insights of a vitamin deficiency?  For example, if the day (or even week) before the blood test I eat less water-dissolvable vitamins like vitamin C than usual and than needed. Would that show a deficiency in the blood test thus leading to false results? Or would a deficiency only appear after a month, two, three? Or even half a year?  I already tried to search for something relatable on google. Only found some forum posts or non-scientific articles of random people claiming things like ""Vitamin B gets flushed out like every day or so"", which is not really specific or backed up by any literature/study. I don't really have access to any physical literature or something similar. "
2634,Common to panic/have trouble breathing when an oxygen mask is placed over nose and mouth prior to surgery with anesthesia?,"I had my 17th surgery yesterday so it's fair to say I've been around the ""hospital"" block quite a few times and know what to expect on the patient side of things.   Everything went as expected up until I was on the operating table and they were administering the general anesthesia to put me to sleep, and they put a breathing mask full of oxygen covering my mouth and face.  (This was as expected too as I recall this happening prior to all my other surgeries). But this time, as soon as they put the oxygen over my nose and mouth, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I had a hard time breathing, and wanted to rip the mask off because I started panicking that I actually was not breathing (even though I logically knew there was an oxygen mask over me). But the mask made me hyperventilate instead, and my lungs started to hurt. Thankfully, this experience was only 30-40 seconds of panic before I drifted off to sleep.    So my questions:  Why a mask of oxygen over mouth &amp; nose while general anesthesia is administered to knock one out for surgery? Common to feel like you can't breathe when it's placed over the mouth and nose?   Is it because some patients may have trouble breathing during the first few moments of the induction of anesthesia? (Like the sensation of not feeling able to breathe was not the oxygen mask, but the general anesthesia entering the body, impacting breathing system).  Or do the oxygen masks contain so much oxygen that the body has a hard time breathing it. (Like the amount/% of oxygen being pumped in a LOT of oxygen in the lungs all at once, and the lungs start to hurt?) Or... simply that mini panic attacks can ensue as instinct doesn't appreciate something over the nose and mouth and wants to throw the mask off. And this causes one to get anxious and hyperventilate?      Basically, why the need for the breathing mask at first? And is it common to find it harder to breathe?  "
2635,Why do opioids administered via IV cause pruritus?,"I was told by a nurse that it is common for patients to complain of itching after administration of IV opioids, which tends to resolve soon thereafter.  Those who experience this often do not experience it when taking the same medication orally.  Why?    What about narcotics being administered IV causes pruritus?  Is this a type of allergic reaction? What is chemically happening that causes the pruritus? Why doesn't this happen with the oral form?  "
2636,Does playing wind instruments cause damage to the eyes overtime?,"Found some studies that investigated the IOP's relation to wind instrument playing: one two three.  I'm curious because I thought wind instrument playing (as over time it takes endurance to control air with the obturator muscle) will acutally lower IOP, as endurance exercises usually do.  The authors claim that the valsalva maneuver increases IOP and practicing many hours a day may cause glaucomatous damage over time.  Do you think there is some truth to this? Does wind instrument playing damage the eyes? and if so, what were the symptoms?  "
2637,Can band-aids prevent or reduce acne scar formation?,"Can band-aids prevent or reduce acne scar formation?  It's known that keeping wounds covered is actually better for healing. Here are the reasons: It keeps our skin cells from drying out so that scabs don't form. Scabs can impede healing and increase scarring. It protects the wound from re-injuries.  [website][website]Would the same apply if someone picks on their acne till there's bleeding, and use band-aids after washing their facial wounds properly? Can it actually minimize acne scars formation?  I haven't heard of dermatologists recommending band-aids for acne scar prevention yet. It can be quite difficult not to pick our skin with acne. "
2638,Has the (in)famous J-shaped curve with regard to alcohol consumption and life expectancy been finally disproven?,"Firstly: I am aware of the other question: Is moderate alcohol consumption beneficial for maximizing life expectancy?  Nevertheless, this question dates to 2015, and the recent campaign of medical authorities against alcohol consumption in any quantities is a, well, recent thing. This I believe mandates a newer question.  Shame on me for not being able to find the source; but I DO recall seing an article about the J-shaped curve - the (purpoted?) correlation that moderate alcohol use increases the life expectation relative to teetotallers. I must've read this article a year ago or so, and the article itself is likely even older. The article claimed that:   Attempts were made to invalidate the J-shaped curve by pointing out that teetotallers' life expectancy is reduced by the presence of former alcohol addicts in this group; The studies were repeated, explicitly removing former alcohol addicts from the group of teetotallers, and the J-shaped curve persisted.   Nonetheless, as we can see, nowadays we have multiple claims from medical authorities that alcohol is harmful in any quantities, that even moderate or light drinking does one no good and that to minimize risk, a consumption of 0g of ethanol should be recommended.  Has the J-shaped curve been finally conclusively disproven then?  EDIT: A late addition, but I've FINALLY found the source of my claim that studies that removed former alcohol addicts from the group of teetotallers still shew the J-shaped curve: [website]"
2639,"What are the factors that make veins easy for a blood test one day, and difficult the next?","I take blood tests quite frequently, and most the time the technicians (Phlebotomists) spend a lot of time searching both my arms for a good vein. I pump my fists, and they smack my arms (and of course there's the typical tourniquet up on the arm), but still not much luck. This has led to inserting the needle in wrong places (ouchy!) and ultimately they end up using butterfly (smaller/for kids) needles. I've constantly been told that my veins are difficult.   However, there's been a few times when the technicians (even the same ones -- so it's not a matter of skill level) are able to insert the needle right away as my veins are prevalent and easy to find.  What are the factors that make veins easy for a blood tests one day, and difficult another day?  How can I make it so my veins are easy for the technicians?   Also, are there some people who just have hard/difficult veins for blood tests/Iv's regardless of factors? "

2641,What is injected into the IV to wake a patient up from general anesthesia?,"In my previous 16 surgeries in the United States, I eventually woke up from general anesthesia on my own -- it took a few hours after surgery for me to wake, but I woke up naturally in ""Recovery."" However, my only surgery done in Canada was a different case. Within minutes of the completion of my surgery, I woke up immediately and seemingly full of energy -- and I was still in the Operating Room as everyone was still cleaning up. And when I woke up, they were basically expecting me to as they started asking me questions. It is my conclusion that they injected something into my IV to wake me up from my general anesthesia so as to speed up the the process and make more room in the hospital for other patients. Oh Canada.   Regardless of my experience and whether or not my conclusion is accurate, I do know that something can be injected into a patient's IV to wake them up immediately from general anesthesia. What is this ""something""? How does it work?   BONUS: Is it used more frequently in Canada than in the US? "
2642,"If a patient arrives at the ER unconscious and needs immediate surgery, will they be put under general anesthesia?","I can't seem to find an answer to this question anywhere, but I'm sure that there's some kind of procedure for this situation. Assuming attempts at resuscitation fail, what is the next step for a patient who needs immediate surgery? Does general anesthesia pose additional risks to an already unconscious patient?  "
2643,How does our brain get its Mg when we don't take Mg threonate which is the only form known to increase its levels?,"Obviously, if magnesium from foods or other forms of magnesium supplements can't enter our brains, our brains must be low in it before the invention of magnesium threonate. With low brain magnesium, plasticity is reduced and spacial memory is impaired.  But according to at least one study, magnesium threonate is the only form known to increase cerebrospinal fluid levels of magnesium. Other forms don't cross our blood brain barriers. [website]Is it possible that:   During one of studies, the forms of magnesium weren't taken with meals which may affect the absorption some forms of magnesium needs higher doses to reach our brains the samplings were taken too early  magnesium threonate is naturally found in foods or it's formed during digestion Losses from CSF samplings weren't taken into account Results from rats may not always predict its effects on humans Some forms of magnesium have laxative effects, depending on how they were taken, which may reduce absorption?   If we can get magnesium from foods into our brains, how does it work and what forms allow it to enter our brains?  If other forms of magnesium can't reach our brains, how did they improve sleep and reduce stress, both of which comes from our brains, in customers taking them?  If those issues were improved, can we be confident that our brain is taking in the magnesium from our supplements?  Here are some stories of Mg helping with those issues. [website]"
2644,"How does the med, Spironolactone, help with PCOS?","I've been taking Spironolactone for my acne for many years (I'm a woman in my late 20's now). I have been taking it for this intended purpose. The other day,  a doctor was looking over my meds and for what purpose I take them for, and said, ""I assume you're taking Spironolactone for your PCOS, yeah?"" I told him it was for my adult acne, but I do in fact have PCOS. He was surprised I wasn't taking it for PCOS. I've never heard of Spironolactone being used for PCOS... and now I'm curious:   How does the med, Spironolactone, help with PCOS?    Would the Spironolactone I'm taking for acne also be helping my PCOS, and I just never knew about it? Or do you need a much higher dosage when using it for PCOS instead of acne? "
2645,"When using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush with pressure sensor, is it possible to cause gum damage when pushing too hard?","When using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush with pressure sensor, is it possible to cause gum damage when pushing too hard?  Some of their toothbrushes have a pressure sensor. When you push too hard, it buzzes to warn you, and reduce its power to protect your gums.   Let's say the toothbrush is angled poorly so that the pressure wasn't evenly distributed. Is it possible to cause gum recession? Does the pressure sensor take into account the possibility of aiming it poorly?   Let's assume that inflammation was taken into account because when the swelling reduces, the gum line is lower.  I noticed that my gums were a little raw when I didn't angle it properly for my upper molars on the buccal side. Is that a sign of gum damage? Since my gum line was uneven from recession, it was difficult to find the gum line of my teeth.  Update: After almost a year of using the toothbrush, my dental hygienist noted about 0.5mm of gum recession on some areas. We're supposed glide the toothbrush, letting it do the brushing rather than using our muscles to do the brushing. "
2646,Can isometric exercises preserve independence in seniors with hip fractures?,"Can isometric exercises preserve independence in seniors with hip fractures?  When a senior person has a hip fracture, there's less than 50% chance of recovery to a pre-fracture level of function. You've probably heard that the survivors quite often end up in nursing homes. Even being active prior to the fracture doesn't offer very much protection. [website]Studies show that muscles weaken and atrophy rapidly when immobilized. We're talking about losses in hours or days rather than weeks, months, or even years like in those who became sedentary or former athletes.   A study showed that ICU acquired weaknesses, which may be incurable and lead to a loss of independence, are associated with a loss of satellite cells. Maybe hip fracture patients had a loss of satellite cells as well [website]Isometric exercises involve contracting muscles without moving your joints or muscles. That means immobilized muscles can still be exercised.  Would they be enough to prevent a permanent loss of independence like in seniors who fractured their hips?  Is it possible that we don't aggressively and promptly push the exercise program because we're ignorant of the possibility of preventing a loss of independence?  Possible challenges   Patients may not know how to activate all of their muscles. At certain positions, some muscles may be easier to activate than others. For example, you may find it easier to flex your gastrocnemius muscles with your legs straight than with your knees bent. Patients may need to be trained how to activate all of their target muscle groups at the right intensity. Even very sedentary individuals may have full recruitment at least for a brief time multiple times a day, possibly protecting against a loss of muscle mass. The therapist may not be able to tell whether the right muscle groups were activated or if there was 100% muscle recruitment. It's possible that the protection is limited to activated muscle fibres. That means if the exertion was at less than 85% of one rep max, the largest motor units could lose their satellite cells while those of the smaller motor units may be spared. This can decrease maximum strength since there's effectively fewer muscle fibres, and decrease endurance since larger motor units are recruited later in exhaustive exercises. Patients have to consciously activate their muscles. For example, our foot muscles, and muscles that moves our legs and feet sideways subconsciously get used when walking but leg curls and extensions may not properly activate them. If those postural muscles are permanently weakened, it can increase the susceptibility to injuries through poor form, and cause balance issues.   A Study that suggests that isometric exercises can help.  Electrical stimulation at 20 Hz in mice for 3h can suppress satellite cell apoptosis when immobilized. This seems like isometric than concentric or eccentric exercise but much longer. [website]Other possible applications   Bed rest  Microgravity Rehab ICU  Other illnesses Other injuries  "
2647,How much vitamin C last in orange juice?,"Vitamin C is a fragile micronutrient [1,2]. Any manipulation of the fruit which contains it, can destroy it. Let's talk for orange juice, for example.  Virtually, staring with harvesting of the orange, vitamin C degrades. And this trend continues due to mechanical (squeezing), thermal (pasteurisation) and chemical (adding preservatives) treatments when the orange juice is made. Furthermore one should take into account orange juice that has been placed into a bottle, stays on the supermarket shelf for weeks, after it has been transported from the made factory to the supermarket.  And the question born of your own accord: how much of the vitamin C listed in the nutritional label is actually in the orange juice I drink?  Long story short: how much vitamin C is actually present in a glass of orange juice, taking into account could have been passed months since harvesting-squeezing-bottling to drinking? Is the nutritional label correct?    [1]: [website][2]: [website]This question worth for other vitamins and other susceptible micronutrients in other foods, as well. "
2648,"Empirically, do people who exercise less/more actually eat less/more, (and if so, to what degree)?","I am looking for the answer to what I think is a very basic question that people must have looked at: empirically, to what degree does food intake actually correlate with exercise, (especially in the United States)?  I am only secondarily interested in removing confounding variables here - what I am looking for is just a raw correlation, e.g., something like a chart with exercise by hours per day or by calories burned per day on the x axis, and calories consumed per day on the y-axis.  I have tried looking for some studies online, but do not have access to some of the journals (e.g., PubMed) that I think may give good information on this subject.

2649,patient in traumatic cardiac arrest - trauma centre diversion,"QUESTION AT THE BOTTOM  I am from Hong Kong and for injured patients who are treated by paramedics and need transport to hospital for treatment they have a trauma diversion guide. This is for patients with major trauma, designed to go direct to a trauma centre, instead of the nearest hospital.  The trauma diversion guide is as follows: If the patient is in cardiac arrest OR cannot maintain airway or breathing they are to go to the CLOSEST hospital regardless if it is a trauma centre or not.  If patient is not in cardiac arrest and can maintain airway or breathing, physiological and anatomical criteria will be applied to decide if they need to go to a trauma centre. If they fit ANY of the criteria below, they will be transported to a trauma centre.  Physiological Criteria:   GCS &lt; 14 systolic BP &lt; 90 Respiratory rate &lt; 10 or > 29 per minute   Anatomical Criteria:   Flail chest 2 or more long bone fractures amputation proximal to wrist or ankle penetrating trauma to head, neck or torso limb paralysis pelvic fracture combined trauma/burn (equal to or greater than 2nd degree or equal to or greater than 20%)   My question is, if the patient is in cardiac arrest why does the Hong Kong trauma diversion guide state that they need to go to the closest hospital? Wouldn't it be better for them to travel to a hospital in which a resuscitative thoracotomy can be performed?  "
2650,Does Nicotine Trigger a Relaxation Response?,"If I read this article correctly it indicates nicotine triggers a relaxation response in rabbits. Do we know whether a similar response is triggered in humans? Is this relaxation response the same relaxation response Lissa Rankin states explains much of the placebo effect?  Note:  The YouTube video is set to start at the relevant segment and is only about 3 minutes long  If you'd prefer a link to literature rather than a video clip, Rankin refers to Herbert Benson. A relevant paper is here and a book is here.  My layman summation of Lissa Rankin's point: When a relaxation response is activated, mental stress in the body is reduced and chemicals like oxytocin, dopamine, and endorphins are released. Certain natural healing mechanisms flourish in this state. Placebo effects basically result from an activation of this relaxation response, but you can also do things like meditate or get a massage to tap into that relaxation response to some extent. "

2652,How can genital herpes be transmitted even with a condom?,"I have read from various sources that, although the use of a condom does reduce the risk of transmission, it does not completely rule it out.  Just how does that happen? Assuming that there are no open lesions and that a condom is worn, does the virus get transmitted through unbroken skin? How? Please back your claims with references as to the exact mechanism of transmission.  PS: I am specifically referring to HSV-2, not HSV-1. I am also not referring to the latest trend in the two strains intermixing due to unprotected oral practices. "
2653,Can Asthma lead to a Cardiac Arrest and thus require CPR?,"I recently read a story, in the story, there was a person that had a severe asthma attack. Another person came into his rescue and performed compressions and mouth to mouth.  It wasnt stated whether or not the victim of the asthma attack had his heart rate stop at all in the story.  My question(s): - why was it necessary to do compressions? - can an asthma attack stop heart rate if its too severe? (If yes then it would answer the previous question) "
2654,Insulin & break down of different nutrient groups,"I have been a type 1 diabetic for over 30 years. According to what I learned during my life from doctors and dietitians, for my age/height/weight, I should take around 6 bread units of carbohydrates per meal (=6*12g= 72g).  The carbohydrates are currently forming around 50-60% of my food intake.  Right now I am looking into increasing my protein intake at the expense of carbohydrates (so that carbs remain around 40% of the daily nutrients), while remaining on the same target calorie amount per day in meals.  As far I understand, insulin regulates all of the nutrient absorption:     [Insulin] regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein by   promoting the absorption of, especially, glucose from the blood into   fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells      Wikipedia   However, whenever I was talking to doctors, they maintained that I only needed to count insulin needed for eating carbohydrates when planning how much to inject before a meal.  So the question is whether in general less insulin per meal is necessary when consuming more proteins at the expense of carbs? Will the proteins (and fats) be able to be absorbed and used by body without (or with less than usual) insulin?  "
2655,Why Dydrogesterone is no longer available in US? Why dienogest is not approved?,"Dydrogesterone and Dienogest are very very helpful medications in treating endometriosis condition, and Dydrogesterone helps many women to become pregnant. They are widely used around the world and help a lot of women.   But in US Dydrogesterone was discontinued a long time ago. In US women have access to only a single type of progesterone - Norethindrone or Depo Provera, which is not good in helping with endometriosis or infertility. Dydrogesterone, Dienogest, Desogestrel - are not FDA approved. Why so? So many women suffer from endometriosis and Depo Provera (which is usually prescribed) has sooooo many side effects and fertility restored up to 2 years! Norethindrone or Depo Provera are the worst options for women, and they are the only option available in US. Why is it the case? Why Dydrogesterone was discontinued? "
