0,Is there a reason to run exim4 on a relay?,I have two relays and they both have exim4 running. Is there a reason for this? Do I have a need for a mail service running?   
1,Android Orfox - Clearing RAM messes tabs up,"I have found that clearing RAM using the stock Samsung memory manager transfers all standard tabs in Orfox to private mode - and makes them reload.  When clearing RAM, reloading does happen in Firefox.  Transferring ordinary tabs to private mode does not happen with Firefox.  Suggestions?  Am I in the right place for this?  Please treat this tor noob gently - I do try to find my own answers before I post. "
2,Would like to use Tor with _and_ without proxy --> unexpectedly ends program,"I am using my laptop at home (with proxy) and outside my home (without proxy). I have set Tor to use proxy. Then, of course, when I am not at home, it cannot connect to the network. No problem so far. The problem is, however, that I do not know how to change the settings.  The window ""Connecting to Tor network"" closes too quickly for me to click on ""Open settings"".  Then the window ""Tor network settings"" appears, but it only has the options ""Restart Tor"", ""Contact torproject.org/about/contact.html#support [not a button]), ""Copy log to clipboard"", ""Next"", and ""Close"". (Please excuse me if I do not have the exact names, I am using Tor with German.)  Here are my questions: What do I have to do to be able to use Tor both at home and outside my home? Where can I set the settings so Tor knows not to search for a proxy?  Thank you in advance,  Michael "
3,How is tor traffic exempt from censorship/a country's DNS servers?,"This is my understanding around how Tor may be used to circumvent a country's censorship of particular sites:  John lives in a country that has blocked traffic to a particular server (via DNS, I assume?).  John jumps onto Tor, and now his traffic is sent to a different DNS server since his exit node is quite possibly outside of his overly-strict country.  He can have access to the site, great.  The question is, I don't live in a country that has this kind of block in place. But supposing it was me logging onto Tor, is it not possible I could hit an exit node that was from John's country? Thus being subject to the DNS server that blocks traffic to the server to which I'm making a request? "
4,Internet download manager reveals IP using Tor Bundle?,I was using the Tor browser bundle with JavaScript turned off and when I clicked on a page with a video playing my application outside of Tor kicked in and popped up as an overlay over the Tor page asking me if I wanted to download the video!?  Anyone know how this could happen and if the IDM app would have contacted the onion site I was on thus revealing IP and making Tor useless? 
5,TAILS - LIVECD & RATs,"If i have a RAT on my computer, obviously, they have control over the computer when I am in win 10 os, for ie. But what about if after the RAT has infected the host os, I use a LIVECD.  QUESTION: When using the livecd, while the host system is RAT infected, can they still see everything I am doing?   QUESTION: While in TAILS, if I open an email that is created to auto-execute with a RAT (or I click a link, etc), and the RAT downloads onto my livecd, could a very sophisticated (3-letter agency) RAT getting onto my HOST OS?  I definitely have a RAT on my computer; opening and closing tabs, etc. I opened an email that auto-executed. NOt first time.   Thanks!! "
6,How to refer to Tor hidden services network and community,"What is the correct way to refer to the Tor hidden services network. ""Hidden services"" is the name of the technology used (and individual servers), but what is the name of the resulting network and community?  I believe I may have heard something similar to ""onionland"" long ago.  Example sentence: ""Contrary to popular belief, much of the content on X is not illegal at all.""  Saying ""Tor hidden services network"" is too long, so what does one say instead of X? "
7,Free static web hosting inside the Tor hidden services network,"Do anyone know of any free (as in no payment, no ads, and no invites needed) web hosting provider inside the onion network currently? Or did everything die with Freedom Hosting?  I don't want anything fancy, static web hosting is fine (as in no PHP or other serverside scripting). Reliability and available storage space is more important.  For the purpose of this question, hosting a server myself is not possible.  I am aware that one also need to announce the website to the world for anyone to know it exists and be able to find it. "
8,Can somebody clarify the Tor --> VPN and VPN --> Tor notation please?,"I have repeatedly seen people describe combining Tor and a VPN using the following notation: Tor --&gt; VPN  or VPN --&gt; Tor or even Tor --&gt; VPN --&gt; Proxy but then not provide any real-world example of how this is set up.  For example, does Tor --&gt; VPN mean that I have a VPN client running on my Mac through which all of my traffic is tunnelled, then point Firefox to a locally running instance of Tor thereby all of my Tor  traffic is running inside of the VPN tunnel?  Or is it something else entirely? Can somebody please give me a concrete example of each setup?  Edit: I really should've added an example of what I was talking about, I was primarily referring to the examples given in the Tor wiki on the subject. "
9,Entry guards are persistent for a period of time when using Tor. How is it done?,"One may use multiple systems to connect to Tor. It maybe done from different physical locations. Sometimes it is direct access to Tor, other times connection to Tor maybe via VPN. My question is how does Tor keep the entry guards persistent? What is the actual process to keep the entry guard persistent? "
10,Tor security if LE/ISP want me really bad,"Let's say LE knows who I am ... they already know I am using Tor. Is there a way for them to create a surveillance from my ISP ? You will say Tor is encrypted except exit relay ... but common to the first node... I have to send the encryption code also so the message is decrypted , right? Also when I get back the response, Tor already know my encryption code... so is Tor safe if Law Enforcement will do a ""man in the middle"" attack exactly between me and my ISP ? "
11,How can I set up logging with latest Tor Browser?,"The current version of the Tor Browser Bundle doesn't contain Vidalia. Therefore it is quite hard to have a look in the log file and to find relevant messages. What is the best way to set up logging using version 3.5 or later of Tor Browser Bundle? How can I open the log file? How can this be done in GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X? "
12,In Tor Browser Bundle how can I manually use a proxy address without turning off Tor?,"When I use Tor Browser, the Tor button next to the address bar says ""Tor Disabled"" whenever I try to manually configure a certain HTTP/HTTPS proxy IP address. Is there any possible way to use a certain proxy address without disabling Tor?  Please see the screenshots below.  If it says ""Tor Disabled"", does that mean that your computer is connected to the proxy server without going through Tor?    "
13,"Assuming, there is malware on a system, can one bypass that by using live cd when using Tor?","Can one use Tail, to bypass any of the following potential attack vectors? There are five potential attack vectors:  Malware on the disk within a partition. Malware within the boot sector. Malformed partition or filesystem structures that exploit bugs in the OS  Malware within disk firmware. Modified hardware (e.g. replace the firmware PROM with mask ROM containing malware and/or implant hardware keylogger device in keyboard)    How far Tails can take us if one download it from Tails site and verify the signature? "
14,Arm may not be usable for TBB windows users. What are the alternatives?,The anonymizing relay monitor (arm) may not be usable for TBB windows users (or is it?). What alternatives exist for TBB window users? 
15,Is there a way to use Tor to download apps for Windows 8 from the Windows Store anonymously?,"Is there a way to use Tor to download apps for Windows 8 from the Windows Store anonymously?  The Windows Store uses its own customized app for access and apparently isn't accessible from normal browsers.  Is there a way I could redirect access attempts by the Windows Store app into Tor?  Or, is there a way to use the Windows Store from Torbrowser, without involving the Windows Store app? "
16,DNSSEC & DNSCrypt over Tor,"I want to use DNSSEC and DNSCrypt with Tor. I wonder which configuration is more secure and better?   SOCKS4 + dnscrypt-proxy: Forward the DNS traffic to a DNS server which I choose. Although the DNS server is DNSSEC, DNSCrypto and has no logs. SOCKS4a:  Forward DNS traffic within Tor network and resolve it from many IP address. SOCKS5: Forward DNS traffic within Tor network, but resolve it from one IP address (exit node).   So, basically the question is ""How to use DNSSEC and DNSCrypt correctly over Tor?"" "
17,If I am an exit node can/should I restrict certain sites?,"Can I pick and choose what sites a user can access via my exit node? For instance I might be very pro-facebook, but I probably have no interest in helping to conceal the identity of people downloading child-porn or engaging in other things I might find morally objectionable.  For instance, could I advertise that if you want facebook or news sites, you can use my exit node, but all other traffic is restricted? "
18,Is it possible to create a Tor Hidden Service in Python (Django) or Ruby (Rails)?,"All the Tor Hidden Services seem to be written in PHP or just plain HTML.  If this is possible, is there any reason not to do it?  How would one go about doing it? "
19,Is using Pinned Tabs and Bookmarks bad for Tor Browser?,There are some onion sites I want to keep track of but the URLs are so long. Is using pinned tabs and bookmarks a secure option? Will people be able to track me if I set bookmarks or pin some tabs? 
20,All .onion domains seem slow,Is it just me or are most .onion domains really slow?  If its not just me then why is it slow?  Alot of domains seem to not work and a few work and are really slow... 
21,Is Tails browser same as separate Tor bundle-browser?,"It seem to be somehow different, is it still FF-based? Or is there any possibility to use tails and then use Tor bundle same way as you use it in Windows?  And of course, is Tails's browser's security in same level as Tor Bundle? "
22,AOL Mail no longer works: Error 1 - COFE error 1714?,"I've upgraded to the new tor bundle several weeks ago and I love it so far.  However, since the upgrade, I am no longer able to access my email (AOL webmail). The error I get when I sign in is ""Error 1 - COFE error 1714"".  They suggest I clear cookies, cache and restart in ""safe"" mode.  Below is their suggestion:      Browser security settings sometimes disrupt sign-in. In Internet Explorer, try selecting “Enable Protected Mode” in both the Internet zone and Trusted sites zone. On Firefox, try using Safe Mode.   You also might try deleting your browser history. Find this in the “Tools” menu — and make sure to clear (delete) cookies!   Of course I'm OS X 10.7.5 so their solution really doesn't help. Unfortunately, I'm not the most savvy with some of this stuff, but I have some questions:   Is there a work around? Is there a tor-friendly webmail?  "
23,Can the NSA or similar agencies see where my device is when using Tor?,"Can the NSA or similar agencies see where my device is when using Tor?  If so, to avoid this, do I need to encrypt my wi-fi as well? "
24,What security implications does symlinking the Data/ directory in Tor Browser have?,"Is the recommended way to update the TBB still by replacing the old version (and handling bookmarks and Data/Tor separately)? I hate losing preferences such as fonts, NoScript configuration etc. To handle this, I've moved the Data directory out of the top-level TBB directory and symlinked to it. On update, I download the new tar file, unpack it, delete the new Data directory, and symlink back to the saved Data directory. I'm fairly new to TBB, but this has worked so far. Are there security implications to doing it this way? Thanks for any help. "
25,Can a Tor hidden service make outbound connections?,"I am working on a decentralized card game and using Tor to easily avoid firewalls etc. In the application each user runs a hidden service via Tor and accepts incoming TCP connections. Now I want to make outbound connections from Tor.   Is it possible to use the same SOCKS5 proxy I am using to listen for connections to also make outbound connections? If so this would avoid firing up another Tor client to make outbound connections. Otherwise, is it possible to use the same Tor address/key for the other Tor client? This would be the same key that is being used for the Tor hidden service. This would help with my application not having to authenticate multiple Tor addresses for one user.   Cheers, Kris "
26,Can Tor be configured to run on all outgoing connections on a server?,"I want to make a web-service that is going to make requests to various other servers. However, I don't want those servers to be able to pinpoint the location/IP address of my service (As a SPAM prevention method, along with other things).  I was wondering if it's possible to set a server box (Be it dedicated or VPS, with a popular linux distro) to run all outgoing connections via Tor (ideally silently and separately from the service that makes the requests).  The end result should be that using a simple cURL or other HTTP requests from the server would run through Tor and as such would be anonymized.     Is this possible? Am I barking up the wrong tree? If it is, could you provide with pointers/articles that can help me implement this?     Note: This is all still theoretical. I don't have the server or the service yet, so I can implement it in any way I need for this to work.  "
27,How do Google servers discriminate anonymous users?,"First of all, I am a new user of Tor and a very naive computer user in general, so excuse me if I am too thick.  When I searched anything on Google using Tor, most times I got the 'Error 403 forbidden' and sometimes I had to type a CAPTCHA. I came here and I read this question Tor and Error 403 forbidden. I followed the first option and I haven't got any 'Error 403 forbidden' since then. I don't understand why that has worked in my case, since my problem seemed very different from the one posed in the question. I have also read Does Google know that I am using Tor Browser?, but I still don't understand how it worked the answer in the first question for me.  So this is a two-fold question: Why does the Error 403 appear? And how did what I did worked? "
28,Is TOR legal in Ukraine?,Is TOR usage legal in Ukraine? I mean for legal purposes. Are there any countries where TOR is not legal? Thank you very much! 
29,ISP & LEO tracking on Tor,"I realize this will sound like I am beating a dead horse; however, I've read many, many threads and comments on this topic and am not quiet satisfied. Maybe I'm being too specific and need a more specific answer.  This is a two part question.  Scenario ONE: Time and again I see the question of whether or not ISPs can see detailed information on users activity and repeatedly see the answer ""No, they can see the URL but nothing more on httpS, etc.""   Question: Why can the ISP NOT see what is coming through their servers? In my mind I see it like this: Hi, I'm Skynet ISP. I see that right now IP#THIS is on http Google and he's looking up homemade taco soup recipes. That IP # is assigned to Hugh Jass.  And here is IP#THAT on httpS Yahoo. That IP is assigned to Pat McCrotch. Even though it is a httpS, I still must be able to decipher what is on the page to make sure I transmit the data properly. Yahoo is delivering an ad about Clash of Clans, Headlines of a presidential assassination and Microsoft going bankrupt.   Oh, Yahoo just delivered video results about college orgies.   And... this is odd, IP#THIS&amp;THAT...assigned to Mike Hunt is on a strange looking URL...   .onion. Oh, he's using Tor. I'm going to open Tor Browser and see what is on that page. Looks like Mike is shopping for unauthorized medicine. I'll log this and save it for law enforcement.  .................  Scenario TWO: On the other end is the FBI running DeepWeb markets. One site sells unauthorized medicines. The funds go to support the Bureau in efforts to rout out cyber-criminals. Maybe even bust a few customers here and there since they have their address. Looks good in the papers to see the Bureau busting people for online drug deals.  On another page the FBI runs a photo &amp; video page of underground porn, jihad execution videos, hacker Anonymous video messages, etc.   Question: Would it not be possible that embedded in the photo or video metadata could be a homing beacon? Every time the beacon hits an ISP, relay and final destination the beacon would ""phone home"" to announce it's current location thereby exposing the users and relays and final recipients of the requested information?  ............................  It seems to me that the only way to be completely secure is for you to produce your own encryption software, hand it to me on disc and I install it on my PC. Then when I go to your encrypted site and the data begins to transfer thru my ISP they have no way of decrypting the data because the decrypt software was never online.  Fin. Please tell me how I am mistaken in my suppositions. Thank you all for your time. "
30,How does de-anonymization work?,"I heard that someone, who can read the traffic of many tor nodes (like the government of a country where many nodes are located) can find out which user is sending/reading data to/from which resource by statistical analyzing those node's traffic. I've read this is done by analyzing the traffic of the first and last node of each route. As I did understand, the middle node seems not to be of interest. Is this true? If yes: Why is the middle node's traffic not useful for statistic analysis?  Each tor route goes through three tor nodes. Can it help to protect the anonymity of tor users to choose only routes where the first and last node are located in different countries? Maybe even different continents?  And what about hidden services? The traffic from a user to a hidden service goes twice through the tor network, so that there are six tor nodes transporting the data. How does this influence de-anonymization? Is it enough to analyze data of nodes 1 and 6? Or is there a need to analyze the nodes 3 and 4 too?  Supposed Tor software already creates only routes where the nodes 1 and 3 are located in different countries: If a user connects to a hidden service, can it be, that nodes 1 and 6 are now in the same country? Wouldn't this allow this countries government to find out quicker to which hidden service a user is connected, than to which normal website?  clarification:  I am not interested in other methods of attacking a users or a service providers anonymity. I am asking about traffic analysis and how it can be influenced by placing Tor nodes over the planet, and if hidden services make it easier or harder to perform such analysis. "
31,How can a .onion url be routed on the internet on the right server?,"Ok, so thank you for taking some time to read this.  My teammates and I are on a university project to understand how Tor functions.  In the context that a client made a request to a normal website (i.e. through public DNS), the request will have a path consisting of exactly three nodes and the last node will make the request to the requested IPv4 address.  Otherwise, if it is an onion address (and this is the question), there will be three nodes for the client, and three nodes for the server who is hosting the onion website requested. Between the client nodes and the server nodes, is the request filtered through Tor's DNS so they can change the onion address to an IPv4 address? And relay the request to the first server node which will transmit it to the others two nodes where the exit node is going to make the request with the IPv4 address that Tor's server changed?  For sure, Tor's server would have encrypted the message three times.  By the way, is the message encrypted with RSA with the three public keys of the assigned node's path? Once a node has the message, does it decrypt it with it's private key?  To summarize a little bit:   Is Tor changing an onion url to an IPv4 address in the middle between the three client nodes and the three server nodes? Is the exit node on the server side making the request with an IPv4 address?   Thank you so much for helping us in our understanding of Tor! "
32,Is it bad to stay connected to Tor for long periods of time?,"Tor circuits change every 10 minutes. If I leave the Tor browser open on my computer, or the Orbot app connected on my Android, will I add any network overhead for the network? Should I disconnect when I'm not using Tor, or will the client automatically stop creating new circuits until I start using it again? "
33,Is there any added value in https over hidden service?,"Is there any added value in using https with a hidden service, such as Facebook is doing?  Does the SSL provide any more security than regular http? "
34,Does running the Tor browser turn me into a (exit) relay?,"If the person downloads the Tor Browser and uses it to surf the Internet, is this person also automatically running a Tor exit node or a Tor relay? Or other nodes?  "
35,Tor Encryption Standards,"I'm looking for up-to-date information on Tor encryption standards, and I can't seem to find anything newer than 2013.  What encryption algorithms does Tor use?  What is the reasoning behind keeping hidden service onion RSA keys at 1024 length?  Hidden .onion service with 2048 bit (or 4096 bit) RSA private key -- how to host it?  Everything I've been able to find links back to a proposal to move to Ed25519 keys: [website]Poking around in my own Tor relay, I found a master public and master secret ed25519 key, along with a signing cert and signing secret key. However, there's also a secret_id_key and a couple of secret_onion* keys that are RSA private keys.  Does Tor 2.7 use Ed25519, or 1024-bit RSA? Why are there 2 kinds of keys? How secure is Ed25519 compared to 1024-bit or 2048-bit RSA?  Thanks in advance,  Tristan "
36,Allow command-line tor client to accept anonymous connection from private address,"I am running the command-line tor client on OS X 10.10 and I have a short script that routes all my WiFi network connections through the SOCKS proxy where tor is listening (127.0.0.1:9050)  INTERFACE=Wi-Fi sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy $INTERFACE 127.0.0.1 9050 off sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE on tor -f ~/bridge.single sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE off   Here bridge.single is a very basic torr config file that specifies a bridge relay to connect to and the Socks and Control ports for the tor client.  When I run this all my browser traffic goes through tor - e.g., Chrome - which I verify by going to check.torproject.org.   But, I am using a separate desktop app that also makes an internet connection and the tor client spits out the error  [warn] Rejecting SOCKS request for anonymous connection to private address [scrubbed]   and my other application doesn't work.   Does anyone know how I can fix this? I tried changing the tor Socks port to 9052 but it didn't help and playing with some of the ExitRelay configuration parameters here but it didn't help.  Why would Chrome's requests and responses have no problem connecting but this other application gets blocked by the tor client?  I don't have access to any ""network"" settings on this other application but I didn't do anything special on Chrome - I just route my WiFi traffic through tor.  Various questions here didn't help.   Update: I tried the following: connect a second computer to ethernet and run the tor client there (and route all its ethernet traffic through tor). Then I shared this second computers connection over AirPort and connected my computer to it. The second computer has a tor IP through its browser but my computer STILL shows local IP while browsing through second computers connection!!!  Thanks. "
37,can Verizon wireless see Web traffic when I'm tethering to my pc which is running tor browser?,"I use my Verizon wireless phone and a third party app to tether to my home network. When I use tor browser on my pc can Verizon see or read the Web traffic?   The way I have it set up is, I use my third party app to tether, via USB, my phone to a raspberry pi which acts as a wireless router for my home network, then I connect to the wireless network on my pc and run tor browser on the pc.   So if I went to, let's say facebook.com, while running tor browser could Verizon wireless (or anybody else) see and read any Web traffic? Also, if I went to, let's say blahblah.onion, could they see and read any traffic? As well, can the destination website tell where the connection originates from?  I'm just curious how anonymous using tor browser truly makes me when using my Verizon wireless connection. I assume Verizon keeps a record of data transmitted, but can they or anybody else see where I'm connecting to and can the destination tell where I'm connecting from when using tor browser on my pc, in the network configuration I have set up?  "
38,Do sessions still work for onion websites?,"Given that many users will come out of the same exit node for any given site, do sessions still for for onion websites?  ie. Will the people that come out of the same exit node be all logged in as the same user when they visit the site? "
39,tor and android,"I just downloaded  Fire.onion+tor from google play.  Will this be acceptable or should I download  tor  alone,  and can I download  it on my android  lollipop tablet?  Thank you "
40,Why is it so hard to use an internal relay that has no Guard flag as Guard Relay?,"I've set up a tor relay that has no Guard flag, but I want to use it as a Guard relay when I use Tor from outside. But sometimes it works and sometimes not. Why is this so hard and what can I do to use my relay at any time when it's up?  In my client, I added the followind line to the torrc:   EntryNodes $fingerprint_of_my_relay   What's wrong with this? "
41,List hidden service managed by an HSDIR,"if i have a relay with the HSdir flag, there is a way to know what are the hidden services descriptor hosted on it?  in other word, can i list all hidden services present in the hash table of a relay? or better how can i know what hidden services are managed by my relay?  thank you in advance for your reply.  EDIT  I would like list HS without modify tor's source code "
42,How does handshake with directory server work?,How does handshake with directory server work in the standard setup? How does it work when you configure Tor Browser to use a custom bridge?

44,Running Tor over Tor,So I am going to set up a Raspberry Pi Onion Router and I normally use the browser bundle would it be bad? More effective? Or just as effective as using just the browser bundle? 
45,Allowing Flash Player even though its insecure,"Sorry but since ""add a comment"" only brought up a sign-up-window this will be a new question.  It is again about allowing flash content to be played within the TOR-Browser. Every one just answers it would be insecure and thus is blocked even if the plugin is enabled and the player installed. Flash may leak the IP-Adress.. to whom? The flash site itself might get to know who I am, but the provider of the internet I'm using will not. And that is still some kind of anonymity wished for as long as flash is still around.  So one answer is 'go VPN instead'. But why do you want to kick out flash users from the TOR-Community? The whole idea was to get lots of people using TOR for normal reasons so that whistleblowers for example can hide in that crowd. And what is a more normal use of internet/TOR than browsing for porn? As long as the NSA-Buildings we all got to see in the Snowden-News are not hosting a majority of all porn content to get the real identity of TOR-Users that porn surfing crowd is helping to hide other more critical guys.  I do think blocking flash is a terrible decision. Warning about Flash is enough. Also No-Script can be just deactivated allowing Java-Scripts leaking the IP adress and no one is blocking that. It just works the way flash used to work in TOR. Just allow everything every normal web browsing user would expect to work. And allow to go back to full-safe-mode with one click. And that's it. Security for the ones who require it, Comfortability for the crowd protecting that kind of dudes and porn for the ones takeing a break from being full secure without haveing to rely on another product (VPN). "
46,Does Tor change the Guard node (Entry node) if I connect my PC from a different IP address?,"Assume that I installed Tor on my PC and used it from IP1.

51,Tor Browser won't launch after torrc file edited for hidden services,"I'm a beginner who need a little help. I got stuck while i was trying to setup my hidden service.  I'm on a Mac (EL Capitan) running Windows 7 on Parallels Desktop virtual machine. I have my wampserver 2.5 running quite nice (honestly i have a little issue: if i place my site to the www folder it wont load for the localhost command in the browser, only when i give the exact location like localhost.index.html, i don't think its connected to my tor problem :) ) or? :)  Tor Browser run just fine, but when i add this line:  # Hidden Service HiddenServiceDir C:\Users\UserName\tor_service HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80   I got an error message:     Tor unexpectedly exited. This might be due to a bug in Tor itself, another program on your system, or faulty hardware. Until you restart Tor, the Tor Browser will not able to reach any websites. If the problem persists, please send a copy of your Tor Log to the support team. Restarting Tor will not close your browser tabs.   If i make any changes in the torrc file, this problem occurs. When i delete the added lines, the problem disappear.  Any idea? "

53,How to specify country (ExitNodes) on command line,"I'm a Tor newbie using the current version (5.5.4) on Windows 10.  I'm using it so that I can browse as if from other countries.  I will be changing the country frequently so I want to specify the country on the command line, not in the configuration file.  On Windows, Tor is started by 'firefox.exe', so I type:     firefox.exe ExitNodes {GB}   This starts Tor, but appears to just cause FF to try to browse to the site 'ExitNodes'.  Won't that command just pass my config option to FF and not to Tor - but that is what the documentation tells me to do (as far as I can tell).  What am I doing wrong?  Or is there some other way to specify ExitNodes without restarting the browser? "
54,How feasible is that Directories grant you only compromised nodes to build the circuit from?,"I asked this question about Tor and how secure are the first steps before the circuit is made (the guy who answered me, lead me to this site which i didn't know).  Please correct me if I'm wrong (or if the guy is wrong, since I will take his answer as starting point).  Currently the Directories (which are hard-coded servers in the Tor software) download a huge list of nodes. The Tor client is the one who creates the circuit. However: How can one be sure that the Directories are not compromised (after all, they are mainly maintained by the US Defense dept.) and don't bring compromised nodes? I'm aware that Tor does not build a circuit having 2+ nodes from the same ""person"" but ... what if the NSA has spread a lot of nodes and the Directories bring you such nodes? (perhaps your IP address is already being watched by the US dept. for suspicious* activities beforehand, and they only grant you, for that IP, a subset of nodes which are all from distinct identities but all of them compromised in the same way).  How feasible is what I say?  (* this could apply even to entire countries, e.g. USA trying to put an eye on Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Middle-East countries with internet access, ... having a IP2Location database is easy to get and pay for). "
55,Bridges *within* repressive countries? Good or bad?,"Is it a good idea to establish bridges within repressive countries (China, Iran, etc.), or a bad idea?  On one hand, having the bridge within the country removes the ""foreign"" stigma from that IP address for purposes of filtering/censorship.  On the other hand, does this mean that the bridge will then attempt to connect to a published relay IP address, making it obvious that it is an entry node?  Considering this topic in light of Belarus's recent ban on Tor.  "
56,How is data encrypted and decrypted in onion routing?,"I read that onion proxy adds a layer of abstraction for each onion router in a route,and each onion router just removes a layer of encryption then does onion proxy knows about all onion routers in the route? and does onion routers just decrypts the data and not encrypt them?

59,What is the difference between Atlas and Consensus health?,"Dear those experts who are familiar with Directory Protocol, I just search on Atlas for Authorities Directories and found there are 10, include ""Tonga"".

So may question is that: Is ""Tonga"" really an Authority Directory? IS ""Tonga"" and ""consensus"" a same node? Thank you in advance! "
60,"Better to run one relay or two, given equal total bandwidth?","For example, would it be more helpful to the network to setup one relay that had 4TB  of bandwidth, or two relays that each had 2TB? Does the answer change depending on the amount of bandwidth each relay would have? "
61,Graphs on Atlas not updating,"I recently started running a relay on my NAS. While the relay itself is running fine (no errors from tor itself), and I understand that I won't get much traffic for the first two days (I've read this article), I have some problems with the graphs on atlas:  The graphs on the details page of my relay are not updating. They still show only data up until 2015-03-04 9AM (for the bandwidth graph) or 7:30PM for the consensus weight graph.  They also didn't change at all since I checked them yesterday evening.  Is there something wrong with my relay? And if so, how do I fix it?

62,Import a SSL Client Certificate into the Tor Browser,"as an extra layer of security, I want to use client site SSL certificates for authentication on my hidden-service webserver. Within the original Firefox (version 36.0)  this is already working (with tor as socks5 proxy), but when I try to import the client certificate (client.pfx)in TBB, the same way as I did in Firefox, simply nothing happens (he should ask me for the certificate password).   I'm wondering is this a Bug or is it suppose to be like this because client certificates with in the Browser certificate store are some how a threat to anonymity (witch then needs to be explained, because my Firefox always ask me if i want to sent my client cert)?  I relay would love to use client cert's on my hidden-service because I hate password's. Maybe somebody can give me a hint how I can do this or if this is impossible with the TBB ?

63,What's a good RelayBandwidthRate?,"I know the minimum required rate is 20KB, and the minimum rate to be considered ""fast"" is around 100KB, but even the ""fast"" rate seems incredibly slow to me, compared to the average download speed of a residential broadband connection in the US (~4 MB/s).  Is there a rough consensus around a recommended minimum rate that meets the expectations of the average Tor user? "
64,What is most likely cause of page injections while using Tor?,"So, I have a connection from my Linux-64-tor-2.6.3 TBB browser to an entry node in a foreign country.  That country is a very long way from here.  The node is running the latest Tor, so it's using a ECDHE* (supposedly strong) encryption cipher suite.  I look at netstat, and see only the 443 connection from here to the foreign node. While Tor appears to be working OK, I see that junk is injected into my pages (nasty stuff).  I believe the junk may come from a local hostile environment. I did not accept any additional certificates. So, if it's really local,  what's the most likely scenario:  1) The ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES256 suite can be broken on the fly (very quickly)?  2) The certificates for the Tor node are manipulated/compromised?  3) I have somehow been compromised with a trojan, in spite of only using the single encrypted Tor pipe to the foreign node, and having made a fresh OS install immediately prior to that?  4) Your choice "
65,Does all direct clients have to talk to Directory Authorities to fetch the consensus at the first step?,"I just read a description on Tor Metrics stating that: ""These estimates are derived from the number of directory requests counted on directory authorities and mirrors"". So my question is already stated above, but in more details: ""does a directory-request get counted twice if the download from mirrors also counted?"" Because as far as I am aware, all Tor clients only know the Directory Authorities, which are hard-coded into TBB, and have no idea about mirrors (directory-caches). In other words, I imply that all direct users first request the whole consensus document from Directory Authorities, but not the mirrors. Later, Client maintains the validity of the document by frequently fetching only descriptors (from the mirrors) which have different hash-value from the one that they are processing. By this way, the clients do not need to talk to Directory Authorities a second time. Please correct me if I imply something wrong. Best regards.  "
66,Atlas is still showing old relays,i was playing around with running a tor relay on several servers.  So now that im finished i would like to get rid of the old relays wich still show up in atlas. One of the relays is down for about 4 days.  Is there a general downtime timeout and they disappear after some time or do i have to revoke the keys manually?  If i have to revoke the keys how would i do that?  Thanks for your support. 
67,How do clients know if a descriptor is new/changed/or disappeared from the Tor network?,"I noticed a paragraph in dir-spec.txt as follow:     To address these, we extended the directory protocol so that   authorities now published signed ""network status"" documents.  Each   network status listed, for every router in the network: a hash of   its    identity key, a hash of its most recent descriptor, and   a summary of    what the authority believed about its status.  Clients   would download    the authorities' network status documents in turn,   and believe    statements about routers iff they were attested to by   more than half of    the authorities.      Instead of downloading all server descriptors at once, clients   downloaded only the descriptors that they did not have.  Descriptors   were indexed by their digests, in order to prevent malicious   caches    from giving different versions of a server descriptor to   different    clients.   So could anyone please explain me how Tor clients check if a descriptor is there in their recent network-status-document? If the answer is basing on ""what I have highlighted"", could anyone please give me a hint where I can have a look at those ""variables"", given that the recent version of Tor only fetchs micro-descriptors, not the whole server-descriptors. Thank you so much!  ____Edit______  So from this Snapshot (please copy URL of the image and open it in new-tab for a better view), I compared two cached-microdesc-consensuses at two different time, and the differences are highlighted by the plugin of Notepad++.  As you can see the ""identity key hash"" and the hash of its most recent descriptor did not change. So can you please tell me a little bit more details of how a client update microdesc-consensuses?  Say,    will they send the ""identity key hash"" OR/AND the hash of its most recent descriptor of all descriptors to Directory Mirrors,  then the mirrors will check if any value of those descriptors has changed next,the mirrors reply to client by sending only those descriptors that have been changed?

69,How Tor network works,"I know that while you are using Tor, the exit relay and the middle node often change. Does the guard node also change, or does it stay the same until I close and restart Tor? When I click on ""New identity"" does the guard node change too? "
70,Tor Browser with Flash AND firewall software,"Tor Browser developers have often stated that using Flash Player with Tor Browser isn't considered safe because Flash can connect to the Internet on its own bypassing the Tor Browser.  My question is would using a firewall software such as Comodo Firewall to prevent Flash from making its own connections solve this problem? If so are there any other pitfalls with using Flash (other than the vulnerabilities that are present when using ""normal"" browsers)? "
71,How does data go through Tor,"I know how Tor works (mostly) but I want to know how data returns through Tor to the user. Example: I send a message from me (Bob) to my friend (Rob) and it goes to, let's say, 3 relays. Now, when I get the data back from Bob which relays does it use? The same ones? And if I sent that to a website it will send the data back to exit node. How does the exit node know who to send the traffic to? I will be using a Tor>VPN. How does the exit node route the traffic from the VPN back to me? And also since I encrypt the data when I send it and then the data gets decrypted layer by layer by the relays, who encrypts the data when it is going from a website to me? Sorry if it's long but there is no information about this anywhere. Thanks in advance. "

73,No websites listed when I click the NoScript icon,"I'm using TorBrowser v4.0.5 on Ubuntu v14. I have NoScript set to ""Forbid Scripts Globally"". When I encounter a webpage that doesn't work, I sometimes will turn Javascript on for that page only; but I'm finding this is more difficult to do with TorBrowser than it is with a non-Tor Firefox browser.  When I  click the NoScript icon in a non-Tor Firefox browser, it lists all the domains that supply Javascript to the current page and I can temporarily turn on JS for one or more of them until the page is working. But when I use the Tor Browser, no domains are listed under NoScript.  Does anyone know if this is an intentional feature of the TorBrowser or if it is a bug?  If I click ""Temporarily allow all this page"" and then click NoScript, Options, Whitelist, only the main domain of that page is whitelisted (which usually is not really ALL the scripts on that page). Often this is enough to get the page working, but some pages still do not work properly.  My guess is that they need JS from other domains to function.  Unfortunately, I don't know what domains they need because NoScript doesn't list them. Does anyone know of a workaround for this issue that is less drastic than using the ""Allow Scripts Globally"" feature?  Thank you. "

I do not expect there to be many users (overestimating 1 GiB bandwidth usage over 1 month)  I am not worried about me nor my users being anonymous  Is this small amount of traffic good for the Tor network? It adds some noise so that the legitimate users blend in. But it also reduces their available bandwidth.  I am also planning on using server-side processing (PHP in particular).  Pros:   I can get a semi-custom Onion domain for free/low cost I can provide better uptime than free hosts on the clearnet Allows legitimate users that require Tor to blend in with traffic generated from site Introduces people to Tor and Tor Browser Bundle (eventually some will become relays)   Cons:   Reduces the bandwidth for legitimate users Possibly more likely for me to be D/DoS-ed (people aren't going to take down a site that is helping them blend in, will they?)

My torrc file encoded in UTF8 w/o BOM, is this wrong? "
90,Is denial of service possible by getting the exit node to create another circuit?,"Even though circuit length is limited to 8, can an attacker create a circuit of length 8, and then get the exit node to create another circuit of length 8 (get the exit node to be a Tor client)? Then could he repeat this to get a really long chain of circuits and flood the network?    Update: I guess this is possible unless exit policies block connections to Tor ports on entry guards, or entry guards reject exit nodes. "

We hear alot that Javascript, Flash Player and more... is really bad for the user to run because it might deanonymize them, but those it work the other way? Can it deanonymize the server?

Does this mean VPNs are also safe from Flash IP leaks while TOR is vulnerable?  Why can't TOR solve these leaks while VPNs seem to?  3) Is this due to TOR using a proxy and not tunneling traffic unlike a VPN?  4) Is there a solution for this like having the TOR proxy on a router or other PC and having it act as VPN and tunnel traffic through the router?

Interested in ensuring safety users who will transmit traffic through my entry or relay node. "
101,What is the purpose of the middle node?,"So I'm just trying to understand the functioning of the Tor network from Robert Heaton fantastic article. My understanding is that the guaranty Tor tries to give is that no node knows which source IP is talking to which destination IP.    The guard node knows the source IP but not the destination. The middle node doesn't know the source IP, neither the destination. The exit node knows the destination IP but not the source.   My question is: what is the purpose of the middle node in ensuring the guaranty? If I remove the middle node from the list above, neither the guard node nor the exit node know about both the source and destination IP, so the system still works.  Of course if I control both the guard and exit nodes at once, I could correlate the logs to construct the logs of a full circuit, but that is also true with 3 nodes if I also control the middle node. In this case, why stop at 3 nodes? The more nodes there are in the circuit, the less likely it is that one entity is controlling them all. "
102,Why does Tor use more relays when connecting to .onion site than to normal one?,"I've noticed that Tor connects to sites on clearnet with 3 relays (see first picture). In this particular example my packets go through relays in Germany, Canada and US. But when I connect to duck duck go on deepweb (see second picture), it uses 6 relays, 3 of which are concealed. Am I interpreting it correctly? If so, why are they secret? And why do I need 3 more to connect to the onion site? I've been researching a lot, but no guide mentioned this (maybe I got something confused). Thanks a lot.    "
103,Does the response traffic of the hidden service website basically coincide with the request traffic of the client?,"Users request hidden service '*.onion' address through Tor Browser， hidden services receive requests and respond.  So, I want to know if the size and order of TCP packets sent by Tor Browser encapsulation is the same as that received by hidden services?   Is the size and order of TCP packets sent by hidden service the same as that received by Tor Browser?  Is the incoming and outgoing packets observed between my Tor browser and the entry node exactly the same as the data packets between the hidden service and the entry nodes? "

107,Are the IP addresses listed for relays in the Tor consensus documents accurate?,"I am working on a research project involving the analysis of Tor exit nodes and their IP addresses from a specific time frame using data from TorMetrics.

Also, if the IP address listed with a relay in the consensus document is accurate, then what even is the point of having exit list documents?  "

Does there could be any possibility for Encountering this situation?  Thanks for your attention. "
110,Hidden Service in TestingTorNetwork connected to non-Exit Nodes,"I set up a testing environment made of lxd containers on Ubuntu 18.04. Each container is based on the Ubuntu 18.04 image and runs Tor version 0.4.1.6. Specifically, I have the following running machines:   3 Authorities (named as TorAuthoritity[01,02,03]) 3 Exit Relays (named as TorRelay[01,02,03]Exit) 3 non-Exit Relays (named as TorRelay[04,05,06]) 1 Hidden Service (named as TorHs01) 1 Client (named as TorClient01)   The torrc file has the ""TestingTorNetwork 1"" configuration value.  Moreover, only the torrc of Exit Relays has the following configuration values:  ExitRelay 1 ExitPolicy accept *:*   whereas all the other torrc files (i.e., Authorities and non-Exit Relays) have the following configuration values:  ExitRelay 0 ExitPolicy reject *:*   All the Tor relays and hidden service are configured in order to use the three Authorities  However, I noticed that the Hidden Service is always connected to one or more non-Exit Relays whereas I expected to see only connections to Exit Relays. For example, by running the command ""lsof -i"" on the container providing the Hidden Service, I get the following result:  root@TorHs01:~# lsof -i COMMAND   PID            USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME systemd-n 180 systemd-network   14u  IPv4 128314      0t0  UDP TorHs01.lxd:bootpc  systemd-r 182 systemd-resolve   12u  IPv4  52219      0t0  UDP localhost:domain  systemd-r 182 systemd-resolve   13u  IPv4  52240      0t0  TCP localhost:domain (LISTEN) sshd      251            root    3u  IPv4  77216      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN) sshd      251            root    4u  IPv6  77314      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN) apache2   260            root    4u  IPv6  81261      0t0  TCP *:8050 (LISTEN) apache2   272        www-data    4u  IPv6  81261      0t0  TCP *:8050 (LISTEN) apache2   273        www-data    4u  IPv6  81261      0t0  TCP *:8050 (LISTEN) apache2   274        www-data    4u  IPv6  81261      0t0  TCP *:8050 (LISTEN) apache2   275        www-data    4u  IPv6  81261      0t0  TCP *:8050 (LISTEN) apache2   276        www-data    4u  IPv6  81261      0t0  TCP *:8050 (LISTEN) tor       396             tor    9u  IPv4 116948      0t0  TCP localhost:9050 (LISTEN) tor       396             tor   14u  IPv4 117902      0t0  TCP TorHs01.lxd:54948-&gt;TorAuthority03.lxd:5000 (ESTABLISHED) tor       396             tor   15u  IPv4 117904      0t0  TCP TorHs01.lxd:41538-&gt;TorRelay02Exit.lxd:5000 (ESTABLISHED)   where the last two lines represent connections to TorAuthority03 (which is configured as a non-Exit Relay) and TorRelay02Exit (which is configured as an Exit Relay) respectively.  Generally, the Hidden Service is always connected at least to a non-Exit Relay (e.g., TorRelay04, TorAuthority03, etc) whereas I expected that the Hidden Service was only connected to Exit Relays (in my lxd environment, TorRelay01Exit, TorRelay02Exit, TorRelay03Exit).  Looking at the network traffic through Wireshark, it looks like the Hidden Service is using a non-Exit Relay as an exit node, although the consensus already includes the three Exit Relays in my testing environment. Is this behavior related to the testing environment only? If yes, do you already know why this happens? Is it possible to avoid this behavior?   Thanks a lot "
111,is tor still vulnerable to replay attack?,"I'm doing a project to my University that consist studiyng vulnerabilities on TOR network. One attack I came across on Intenet is the ""replay attack"". This type of attack allows a adversary, that controls Entry Node and some Extit node, duplicate cells to raise duplicate errores on Exit Node.  My question is simple (but I didn't finde info on Internet): is this attack still efective on TOR? or is there a patch that fixed it?   Thanks! "
112,TOR questions and concerns,"1) ISPs request bridges and blacklist them, that means obfs4 connections could be listed as Tor, does that mean the ISP is able to see  the obfs4 IP and connect your activities to Tor just like without obfs4?  2) If the ISP knows you use TOR, although you may not be doing anything illegal, could that make you a target and have you reported to an intelligence agency for investigation?  3) Is there any way to protect yourself from the above?  4) Is there any difference in what the ISP sees when using Tor Browser to when using Tails?

114,How can I make the Tor browser remember different zoom levels for different sites like the Firefox does?,"for the firefox, I can set a zoom level for a domain, and then FF will remember this zoom level for every page of this domain for all the tabs.  However, for Tor, it can only keep a zoom level for a tab, for this tab, any page, no matter from same domain or not, is display in the changed zoom level. But if I open a subpage from a domain I have set a unique zoom level, the new tab always display in the default 100% level.  It seems that in Firefox, the zoom level is bound to domain name; while in Tor, it is bound to tab. How can I change tor to the ""firefox mode"" to remember zoom levels according to domain?  To set them for each time I start Tor (once a day) is acceptable, but I dont want to set the same zoom level for same domain for every tabs of that domain. That drives me crazy.  And will this weaken my anonymous level?  Thanks in advance. "

120,How does NAT punching in Tor work?,"When a Tor hidden service is implemented it publishes an introductory point. To my current understanding, connections to the said hidden service is highly dependant on this introductory point.    Is this introductory node jurst another Tor relay/exit node? Do I know that my Tor exit relay is somebody's introductory point? Can I host one introduction point if I want to? If the introductory service goes down, does it make the hidden service go down too? Is my hidden service smart enough to realise when the introductory point is down and republish another?  "
121,Is my relay working?,"I am not sure whether or not my relay is working. I see messages in the log file saying something like ""Tor has successfully created a circuit. Looks like client is functioning."" (I'm not sure exactly what it said because it just made a new log file, but I know it said something very similar to that if not that). That message makes me think that the relay is working. But then I get another message: ""Your server has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is reachable."" This message leads me to believe that the relay isn't working. I checked the Atlas, but my relay does not show up there. I have forwarded the ORPort through VirtualBox (I am running the relay on a Ubuntu VM), I have opened the port in my firewall, and I have forwarded it in my router. Am I missing something? Do I have to trigger it instead of forwarding it? I currently have it set as TCP everywhere, it is TCP and not UDP, correct? "
122,Does running a relay expose my IP and make me vulnerable to attacks?,"I'm running a non exit relay, but I am slightly concerned. My relay information is listed on the Atlas, along with my IP Address. Is this safe? Doesn't it make me an easy target for getting ddosed? "
123,Why use Tor for basic internet surfing?,"I have a friend of mine that only uses Tor, when asked why?, simple explanation is he doesn't want anyone knowing what or where he is going online.  I know this guy pretty well, and he's not into anything too weird, gamer, 420 friendly, usually in a relationship but off an on again.  He is always complaining about how Tor gives him so many problems, I don't really dive too deep in just say ""Yeah that sucks"" and move on about my day.  I tired using Tor, going to Google was a pain, eBay didnt like me, a lot of sites gave me issues, so much so I didn't use it.  I don't do too much illegal, download some torrents, alone time activities, here and there surfing, not a gamer.  Does Tor usually give issues when basic browsing? ie. not super user stuff, basic average internet user stuff.  If he is not doing anything illegal why would he cares who sees what he is doing? Besides hiding from ads on Pandora, which doesn't work in Tor btw.   I he wants to prevent his computer from learning what he is doing incognito works too... as far as I can tell.  How sure is the entire Tor community that Tor is 100% anonymous, it was designed by the US Navy how do you know the NSA isn't looking at people on the list, maybe you are not on the list? "

I couldn't find any question regarding my problem so I posted a new thread instead. If it was answered please show me the link to the solution and I'll post back to tell you if it helped. "

Is this correct?   Q 2 Are the first three packets I see (SYN, SYN-ACK and the ACK) between the tor client and the tor relay and bridge and all packet there after  encrypted when using a bridge and a relay?

134,Advertise obfs3 Tor bridge on port 80,"I'm currently running a Tor bridge on port 80 (for personal purposes, luckily no real needs). From what I can see in the obfs debug there's no connection other than mine, probably because the bridge is not (correctly) advertised on the Tor network (I guess).  I'm running it with a hack, because I couldn't find a better way to o so. Time ago I found an answer on SO which explained how to run a bridge on port 80 via iptables rules, and that's what I do and works fine. But since the Bridge is online it's a shame others cannot benefit from it.  This is my configuration:  RelayBandwidthRate 900 KB RelayBandwidthBurst 1 MB ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed DisableDebuggerAttachment 0 SocksPort 0 ORPort 2000 ExtORPort auto BridgeRelay 1 ServerTransportListenAddr obfs3 0.0.0.0:9999 ServerTransportPlugin obfs3 proxy public_ip:80   When started Tor reports the ORPort as reachable, but that's not the obfuscated port. I guess many people can benefit from using a Bridge on port 80.   So two questions:   is there a non hack-ish way to run a bridge on port 80? I did some tests in running Tor as root user, but other than being discouraged it was still not working because the control socket was still created as debian-tor user (on Ubuntu), and I stopped there. (more important) how can I advertise the bridge on port 80?  "

If the app is forwarding some traffic (Bitcoin transactions) to a Tor hidden service (a .onion URL under the user's control), am I correct that there is no MITM concern for that portion of the data?

136,Infected tails dvd,"if a RAT hits my computer and it is NOT the kind that can write to firmware, and I am using my tor tails livecd, and I have no HDD installed on the computer, can this kind of (non-firmware writing) RAT write to my livecd on my dvd player? Or would only a firmware writing RAT be able to write to the livecd?  2...along those same lines, If i download tails iso to a separate computer - (not the computer I will use TAILS on) and someone is on my computer and they send a RAT to this downloaded iso file, or to the dvd with the burned completed tails file/ livecd, will this RAT be permanent on the dvd such that whenever i use it for TAILS livecd, there will always be an active RAT?   thx - newbie!

137,Tor and Submarine communications cables,"According to the papers leaked by Snowden, the NSA has the ability to intercept communications carried by submarine cables.  My question is: does Tor also use these submarine cables? So, can Tor be monitored through surveillance programs like PRISM or Upstream?  Edit:   Imagine that the NSA has intervened all submarine telecommunication cables. I suppose Tor uses these cables. So, could the NSA spy on Tor's communications in this context?  (Forgive my English, English is not my mother tongue). "
138,"TOR BUG,Tor dropping SSH tunnel to hidden SSH service","I have multiple hidden services which are SSH servers.

Sometimes with a SOCKS error 1 or with  packet_write_wait: Connection to UNKNOWN port 65535: Broken pipe  A couple specifics   I use openssh as the server HidServAuth is properly configured on all client I use netcat-openbsd to connect to the socks 5 proxy (configured through ProxyCommand) Compression Yes in the client .ssh/config file   Anybody any suggestions to overcome this kind of behavior?  EDIT: I tried every ProxyCommand, but I feel like it is the Socks proxy of tor (or tor itself) that drops the packet or stops working. I'm running in a chroot, can this make a difference? "
139,Tails and OnionShare,"Tails 2.10 includes the OnionShare software for the first time. While experimenting with OnionShare I discovered that I could share files on my desktop. That surprised me. TorBrowser was hardened so that it could only access files in the /home/amnesia/TorBrowser directory. Allowing OnionShare to access files on the desktop seems contrary to the philosophy that guided the hardening of Tor Browser.  Is my analysis correct? Is a user of OnionShare protected with the same kind of hardening as is a user of TorBrowser? Are the threats completely different, rendering my view of things too superficial? Should we be asking Tails developers to adopt the same approach to OnionShare as to TorBrowser? "

144,Not forwarding to TOR,"I am using raspbian configured as an AP with a Wifi dongle and an ethernet out.  AP works fine, I can connect and get an IP on the WIFI part.  Forwarding seems to work as I can also get a website from a wireless device and a Traceroute also shows me routing from wifi to ethernet, but TOR doesn't seem to be operating.  Status is showing as working fine but if I go to ipchicken it shows my real IP address.   For configuration, I followed these instructions but changed the IP addresses for translisten and DNS listen to the ethernet address of the Pi. From a flow perspective, my device connects to the Pi AP, this then forwards to the Pi Ethernet port, which then uses my ADSL router gateway to enter the internet. That works fine but it shows my public IP address still. Am I missing a piece?  Update: it is currently working. The IPTables commands for ports 53 and 9040 seem to reset on reboot. I have to re-enter them. I did the save as listed. Any ideas how to make them load? "

146,Fingerprint effect of changing TBB default font size,"I asked this on tor-talk (no answers) &amp; through Tor email support (also no answer).  Suggested trying here.  Does changing the default font names or sizes used by TBB (3.51 - 3.5.2) for Windows, affect fingerprinting of TBB?  If so, how much &amp; what all ways? Problem - if one uses default settings for font styles / sizes, then text on some pages is UNcomfortably small for a fair number of users with any sight problems.   I understand the fingerprinting issue - that's why I'm asking.  In Options > Content > Advanced, the default TBB settings are used (for Windows, English):   For Proportional -  Serif:  Times New Roman - size16. Minimum size font:  size ""None""  (meaning, some pages display tiny text.) Checked:  ""Allow pages to use their own fonts...""  (if checked, some pages display tiny or less readable text, i.e., weird font.)   What effect on TBB fingerprinting does changing any of these DEFAULT settings have:     -The proportional font NAME or SIZE?.   -The minimum font size?   -UNchecking the option:  ""Allow pages to use their own fonts...""?   Note:  more recent checking of browser (TBB 3,5,x) characteristics, on [website]AFAIK, No other (reported) characteristics are changed, either.    That doesn't mean changing the font settings won't affect some other ""fingerprint"" characteristic (NOT shown by these sites).  Seems * if * changing font settings increases fingerprinting, TBB should spoof ? the values, for everyone (maybe it does?). "

In light of the NSA scandal and the NSA desire to bring down Tor, is there a possibility that the NSA infiltrates Tor code and adds code to suit their needs?

NTRU appears to have a variety of benefits, both performance wise and in the light of recent advancements regarding quantum computers.[1]  Are there any benefits of ECC over such an algorithm?

155,Is my anonymity compromised when I am in the clearnet with another browser while surfing with Tor?,"Sometimes I am surfing anonymously via Tor and parallelly with a regular browser in the clearnet.

157,Is Google de-anonymizing me?,"I am a regular TBB user. I update TBB as and when updates are available, with at most a delay of a few days. The bundled addons are also updated regularly. I also have the standalone Vidalia package installed &amp; I usually run it along with TBB. Both are run from a USB Flash drive. I run TBB with NoScript set at ""forbid scripts globally"" and I use its ""temporarily allow ..."" option, ad hoc, per site, to gain the requisite functionality from the site.  I have noticed recently, while accessing google.com, that I was being redirected by Google to its country site where I am currently located. When I looked at the exit node it was in a different continent. I've observed that Google.com usually redirects to encrypted.google.com and sometimes to its country site where the exit node is located, when accessed through Tor. I'm not sure how to interpret the anomalous behavior of google.com. Should I assume that my real ip has been revealed to google.com and perhaps to other sites? Is any information being preserved across sessions in the form of cookies or some other means? I would greatly appreciate any help. Thanks.  Update: I have noted that the behavior seems to be occuring only for that particular exit-node. "

160,Something Serious -TBB Leaking Location indirectly to Facebook,"Yesterday I created a new Facebook profile with a fictitious name which does not make any sense, i.e. I chose a name like Regaldoes Mondwse and such names do not exist in my country. I was using TBB. When I created the profile, it showed me the pages of newspapers/celebrities belonging to my country. How did Facebook know that I belong to that country?  Today I created two more profiles with weird names again, and Facebook asked me if I belong to a particular city of my country. It again showed the pages of celebrities and products of my own country.   The Exit node did not belong to my country as I tried different nodes every time to see if Facebook really gets our location through some hidden script. I checked the Account setting of Facebook to see my login detail to see my location. It was showing my location of Germany (the IP address of Exit node) and not my country.  So what is the issue with it? If exit belongs to other country and has nothing to do with my country, how Facebook could know my location and how could it show me the pages of celebrities of my country? "
161,Problem running Tor under Ubuntu,"I followed the instructions to install Tor in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  When I invoke Tor from the command line it proceeds to the point that I'm told that it has bootstrapped 100% and a circuit is established.  But then I keep getting the warning,     Got a certificate for ides, but we already have it.  Maybe they haven't updated it.  Waiting for a while.   and it loops forever.  I am also warned that I have an old version of Tor, 0.2.2.25, although my understanding is that the correct version should have been installed.  Doc says that apt-get update will fix my problem but it seems to do so.  Not Good.  In the end I don't care what flavor of *nix I run since I won't use the machine for anything but for running the relay currently on my other machine, but I heard Ubuntu is easy to use.  My torrc is vanilla except for changing SocksPort  to 9053 so that it wouldn't collide w / my  relay running on another machine.   How to I get Tor to boot successfully ?

I think for non-general-purpose circuits, we should call that third hop something else. I'm open to suggestions -- one option would be to just call the last hop on a non-exit circuit ""Middle"" also. Another option would be to call it ""Internal"".   There exist one more stackexchange question too.  In conclusion, what I have seen is that TOR made internal circuits and called me the EXIT of them. That is not really a problem because I am not an EXIT of the Tor network itself. "

170,Measuring current load on a Tor relay,"I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on the usefulness of measuring the current load on a router. I have read the bandwidth authority specification, and I have a rough idea on how bandwidth authorities send a file and measure the current bandwidth experienced from the router. I was wondering would it be reasonable to utilize some sort of a packet pair technique to measure the available bandwidth on a Tor relay (or the current CPU utilization) ?  Would it be less or more useful than what directory authorities already publish in the consensus? And if the relative usefulness is not known would this be an interesting thing to attempt? Does the way that current directory authorities measure has some limitations could be worked upon?   I have read some papers that do active probing or similar but those seem to be written before the bandwidth measurement by bwauths were introduced or else introduce a lot of traffic in the network. Are there any research papers anyone can point me towards that particularly talk about the limitations of the current measuring structure? Or give any opinions. Basically, my main question is whether it would be worth it to measure a router's load at any given point, and what sort of ways (if known) may be available. I do not intend to measure the entire set of Tor's router population but maybe just about a dozen (so that might not overwhelm the network). Any advice would be appreciated.  "

174,What is the most appropriate kind of hardware to run a Tor relay on?,"In the purpose of setting up a Tor relay that makes good use of a fast FTTH connection, what computer will do the job most efficiently at the time of writing, provided the following requirements are met?  Requirements:   best bandwidth usage / power consumption ratio must run Linux, any flavor of it but preferably GNU / free software (proprietary blobs not encouraged) low budget, let's say less than 250 US dollars?   The real capacity of the Internet connection is not known, but possibly capped at more than 1 Gbit/s. Not all the bandwidth needs to be made use of, speed / power ratio takes precedence.   Single board computers (Odroid, Raspberry Pi...) seem to be the winners at first sight. However I would like to get answers based on the specifics of Tor reference implementation, which I have no clue about. Would it benefit more from higher CPU clock frequency? Multiple cores? Bigger RAM? What does Tor need the most?  I tried to identify some of the basics:   cryptographic routines need:   fast CPU is Tor optimized for specific instruction set (NEON, SSE, AVX...)? is Tor optimized for several cores?  connection management need:   Gigabit link lots of memory (2GiB as a bare minimum?) big CPU cache   "
175,A few questions about how bandwidth scanners work,"I have a few questions related to how bandwidth scanners work. I would appreciate it a lot if anyone could answer any one (or all) of them:   From what I read in the bandwidth scanners spec, my understanding is that nodes are first divided into subsets of fastest, fast, slow and slowest. Then each of the bandwidth scanners probe these subsets individually by creating 50-node slices, and creating a circuit using two nodes from each slice. I am confused about how relays are divided into 50-relay subsets. Are they spread out in percentiles according to their bandwidth just as the categorization of fastest, fast, slow and slowest criteria. And are these 50 relays chosen from the subset already assigned to the particular bandwidth scanner or they move across bandwidth scanners.  Also, I was wondering how directory authorities isolate the bandwidth of a single node using a two-hop circuit. Shouldn't the bandwidth measured using the two-hop circuit give an approximation for the entire circuit rather than the node? From the specs it seems that the bwauths have specific criteria for choosing nodes for these two-hop circuits (having Fast and Running flags, leaving out subsets with no exit nodes, /16 subnet different requirement). Is there ever a possibility that relays are left out? And some relays not measured at all.    Thanks. "

EDIT  My question is about exit nodes and not the chain length. Exit nodes see unecrypted data so it can send it to the server. Can an attacker who host the exit node at this step sniff the data, and not send it to the server directly but using a new tor chain in order to be totaly anonymous ? "

178,"How to best avoid having unencrypted information logged by an exit node, if encrypted connection is not an option?","There is a role-playing game I would like to play, but I would like to remain anonymous (more like pseudonymous in this case). I want to keep my IP address hidden from the servers.  The main issue I have, if I do this over Tor, I risk having everything that I do in the game captured and logged by the exit node, since the game can't be played through an encrypted connection, as far as I know. That means every action I do in the game could be logged, I am not comfortable with this.  What is the best option I have here?  Edit: I'm looking for the best thing to do privacy-wise, if I'm going to play the game anyway. I considered some options:  Using Tor unmodified, I will get random exit nodes, at least some of them will log.  Using Tor and limiting my exit nodes to more ""trustworthy"" exit nodes that are less likely to log. But are there any such nodes, and how will I find them? Would it be a good idea to look for a specific country they're located in, or a specific organization that operates these nodes? And is this even a good idea at all? I thought it would not be that bad because I would be pseudonymous instead of anonymous in the game anyway (character).  The other options I thought of are not preferable. "

183,"Can't access tor hidden service remotely, worked locally","So before I flew several thousand miles away I installed Tor on my computer and setup a SSH hidden service. I sat upstairs and could access the machine through tor using a SSH config file and also locally (i.e. ssh [username]@192.168.100.118). (Because I didn't want to relive rlogging in to a machine across the Atlantic watching keystrokes appear on my terminal with the speed they did 20+ years ago.)  Both worked beautifully. Now I took my flight. Unfortunately I'm limited to public access points. I don't know if that is the issue. I'm getting  nc: connection failed, SOCKS error 4. ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host   Googling the first led me to a site which indicated SOCKS error 4 is ""Host unreachable.""

184,How does the exit node recognize which response from a server is tied to which request?,"A Tor exit node communicating with a high volume web server may be sending streams from multiple Tor clients to that web server at the same time.  If the clients used the Tor browser there should be no identifying data sent to the web server. The exit node keeps state for each client and its Tor path.  When the web server sends its response, how will he Tor exit node recognize which stream the response belongs to?  More specifically, what piece of data in the response will allow the Tor exit node to identify the appropriate Tor path and client? "
185,Can Tails Leak My IP?,"I know that by default all traffic is routed trough TOR, but can my IP leak when using Tails? What i mean is, for example, my machine gets hacked while using Tails and somebody who hacked me wants to find out my IP. Excluding MAC address wifi network name and other identifiers can the attacker find out my IP or does Tails secure/hide it? EDIT: Also excluding TOR attacks/vulnerabilities (timing attacks, checking packet size at ISP/Entry Node and Exit etc.). "
186,Make client software connect to the hidden service without modification of source code,"I have client and server software. They use single TCP-IP port to send data between client and server. Both made for Ubuntu. Both of them can not use socks proxy.  I want to use Tor to hide server's IP from clients. And I need solution without modification of app's source code.  First of all I can launch hidden service.  As I understand server software should not be modified to support Tor incoming connections. I just add HiddenServicePort instruction in torrc file on the server and traffic will be redirected to the server app.  But how can I setup client side to connect to the hidden service? I can set up redirection of all outgoing traffic to the Tor (i.e. Transparent proxy). But client software needs to ""resolve"" .onion address. Can this be done without modification of client software? Any configuration of the Tor/Ubuntu is possible. "
187,How does HTTP/1.1 compare with HTTP/2 when using Tor?,"How is are privacy/anonymity affected by the use of HTTP/2? Did anyone look into this yet?  I suppose that timing attacks might be simpler, because HTTP/2 has sever push and not-requested content might be sent, until the browser cancels them. On the other hand the use of a single (encrypted) stream might make that harder, when looked on from the outside.  Does the protocol introduce new possibilities for fingerprinting?  Is there any research on this yet? Does the TBB take HTTP/2 into consideration? If there was no research yet, would it make sense to disable HTTP/2 for now, until implications are better understood (and workarounds for any problems that might pop up are in place)?  And maybe as side question: How does HTTP/2 affect browsing speed? The protocol might be optimized, but high latency seems to be a bigger issue than with HTTP/1.1. "
188,Tor Circuit failed to be created: destroyed,"Okay, so I'm running a few experiments on Tor for a course project. I keep on changing different relays to see the effects on response time.  But on some of the circuits, I keep on getting this message:     Circuit failed to be created: DESTROYED   I was reading Tor's spec-file and found out that it's when the circuit gets destroyed w/o any explicit TRUNCATE message sent by the client.  Do you have any ideas how do I minimize the connections being destroyed? I think there might be a relationship between geographical distance. But then again, if it took too long to establish the circuit the message should have been TIMEOUT and not DESTROYED. So, it's probably due because relays might have to free resources from time to time? Or could be a whole different reason. Any ideas?  Edit: Since one (or more) relays send destroy(circId) messages to destroy the circuit along the path I was wondering if there's any way to figure out which relay initiated the circuit destruction step.

195,How can I randomize the entry guard?,"Tor is moving to a single entry node implementation (#11480). I think that's because it's statistically feasible for an adversary to deploy entry and exit nodes and perform a correlation attack by profiling your use of those resources — sooner or later you'd end up using those nodes at least once.  Regardless of this circumstance I'd like to be able to quickly randomize the entry of a circuit programmatically. How can I do this? My guess is telnet tor daemon and send some commands, or is there a better/quicker way to accomplish that? If I correctly understood this answer deleting the state file would be an option. "
196,Why do some websites have both onion address and non onion address?,"Some websites have both public address and also a onion address. By having a public address, the service is no longer a hidden service. What is the point in having a .onion address? As a user, is using .onion address more anonymous than public address over tor network?  Update: From what I understand the following are the reasons,    Avoid using tor exit node. This has some benefits.    No one can know how much traffic is reaching the website using tor. Potentially faster as there are usually small number of exit nodes as they are difficult to run.  Once the users bookmark the addresses, they don't have to worry about invalid/compromised certificate authorities. The address is self authenticating.  "

But how does the website send it back? if it sends some random data to node 6, how does node 6 know where this goes?   I know that node 6 remembers the sender route so would know to send it to node 5 but how does it identify where the data the website is sending wants it to go. e.g. node 6 is used by this website for 3 different connections as the exit node. how does node 6 know where each bit of data is meant to be sent if there are 3 paths (because of 3 connections example) and the website only knows node 6's address and nothing else?  So essentially  website sends data saying ""example"" to node 6 website sends data saying ""example2"" to node 6 website sends data saying ""example3"" to node 6  how does node 6 know the path the website wants this data to be sent? does it use a secret code or something?  Hope that makes sense "
206,Can bookmarks set in the TBB (or Firefox) be used for Fingerprinting? Is it safe to use bookmarks?,Bookmarks are (for me) a handy feature to keep track of notable sites in the internet.

For some reason, I cannot access the hidden service's .onion url from another computer (using the Tor Browser) unless the Tor Browser is running on my server machine.  I can access the site through localhost:port in a normal browser, so Apache is working. And I can access the site through the .onion url with the Tor Browser on either the server machine or another machine, but only when the Tor Browser is running on the server machine.  Is this intentional? Are hidden service servers always running a Tor Browser in the background? If not, what am I doing wrong and/or what config files should I post for community analysis?  The tor service is running according to ss -aln | grep 9050. "
211,Am I safe from doxing with a Wordpress.com blog?,"I am using the Tor Browser not to hide from a government but instead to be safe from doxing by highly motivated ideological zealots. The content of my upcoming pseudonymous blog will be controversial, and I cannot afford to get doxed by those who may want to punish me for publishing the content. My fear is that these enemies will somehow get Wordpress.com to give up a list of all IPs associated with my blog (by using social engineering, fake administrative subpoena, hacking, etc.). Do I have any reason to fear that my real IP will be among those IPs?  I have always connected to Wordpress.com using the most current available version of the Tor Browser for Mac. However, I did have to enable JavaScript in order to use the Wordpress.com backend for my blog. Is the stuff I do as I administrate the blog somehow riskier than just visiting a website?

Is either contacted by the exit node?   I'm curious if a malicious hidden services with malicious introduction points can connect activity on the hidden service with activity passing through an exit node.  "
215,Tor customize connection path and speed,"I need your help for 2 questions that I'm struggling with.   How does the path of nodes matters to the connections speed? E.g will my connections speed be faster if the tor connection goes: Germany->China->Argentina->France instead of Germany->Denmark->Italy->France. I suppose the answer to this is yes but please elaborate if there are any specific details that a newcomer might miss. If the answer to the first question is yes, is there a way to tweak the path that my connection will take. E.g If I'm in Germany and want to access a French website, can I somehow tell tor to use only European nodes?   Thanks in advance "
216,Why do bridges collapse?,I'd like to ask if anybody knows why all bridges suddenly go offline at random times?  It can be viewed via the Tor metrics chart which shows how number of active bridges often hits zero and then comes back.       
217,How to Detect Tor Usage From Old Network Traces?,"As part of some computer forensics work, I have been asked to look at network traces (showing IP addresses and port numbers) from several years ago, to see if someone was using Tor.  I have heard that I can use services like CollecTor and Onionoo to check if a certain IP address is currently an entry node and/or an exit node, but that does not help if those nodes are no longer in use.  From reading Tor documentation, it sounds like Tor nodes often use ports 80 and 443 in order to pass through firewalls, but seeing those as destination ports does not tell me if the user is trying to connect to Tor or just connecting to a Web server.   How about looking for ports 80 or 443 as source ports? The OS would never hand out a port number that low unless the program asked for it specifically, right? And ordinarily only the Web server program would ask for 80 or 443, and then only as a potential well-known destination port for someone else to use, not as a source port.  Or am I going about this all wrong? "
218,"Private Tor network, socket explanation","I recently made a private Tor network using virtual machines (with this tutorial). The network is composed of three nodes:    goupix with the ip address 172.26.145.31 grodoudou with the ip address 172.26.145.32 grolem with the ip address 172.26.145.33   Moreover, grolem runs a directory server too.  The problem is, I have unexpected and yet unexplained opened socket on my VM's.  The nodes seem to communicate with each other, as shown by the following screenshot:    Why 172.26.145.31 communicate with 172.26.145.32 ? I don't have any client requesting the building of a circuit, and yet two nodes communicate with each other.  Here you can see another screenshot of a tcpdump on goupix ( 172.26.145.31 ) communicating with grodoudou ( 172.26.145.32 ) :    The length seems to be the size of Tor cells if you remove the headers.  Also, why there is a UDP socket ""listening"" on my machines, doesn't Tor communicate only via TCP? I didn't find any information on this. "
219,Is it recommended that we use a VPN along with Tor?,"Would using a VPN along with Tor improve privacy or security? I have read conflicting views, and I was curious what Tor's stance was on the subject. If using a VPN with Tor, would there be a specific set-up?   Also, lets say I have two browsers up simultaneously (Firefox and Tor). Could I have the VPN running to cover browsing on Firefox while I have the Tor Browser open in another window? Would this setup decrease privacy in one or the other?  I am new to Tor but have been using a VPN for a while. Thank you to anyone willing to share! "

221,How to configure tor browser in Tails to use meek bridges?,"I noticed the Tor browser that come with Tails live OS is a bit different than Tor browser bundle for Windows OS. The latter comes with built-in sets of bridges(obfs3, obfs4, meek, etc), while in Tails, there're no such options, the configuration window ask you to manually input bridges.  The problem is, obfs3 and obfs4 bridges can be retrieved using bridgeDB, however, there're no meek bridges in bridgeDB. So my question is, is it possible to use meek bridges in Tails? If so, how do I do it? "
222,Variable success in verifying Tails,"Since the introduction of the new Tails signing key, which I think was towards the end of 2015, I have had variable success in verifying my download of the Tails ISO file. For example, to verify the tails-amd64-3.6.iso file, I enter the command  gpg --keyid-format 0xlong --verify tails-amd64-3.6.iso.sig tails-amd64-3.6.iso   which returns the informative message:  gpg: Signature made Tue 13 Mar 2018 11:41:20 AEDT gpg:                using RSA key 0x3020A7A9C2B72733 gpg: Good signature from ""Tails developers &lt;tails@boum.org&gt;"" gpg:                 aka ""Tails developers (offline long-term identity key) &lt;tails@boum.org&gt;"" gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

I realize that there is always the remote possibility that I have downloaded a fake Tails iso file. For what it is worth,   sha256sum --binary tails-amd64-3.6.1.iso   gives  826c8fc05a7fb04962c6a45350648fc9273bf98f8b19b2d5a491b440d78ecbf6 *tails-amd64-3.6.1.iso   NEW INFO ADDED 2018-03-23 : I have installed the Tails verification extension in Firefox, which verifies the download. However, I'd still be very interested to know why the gpg check fails (despite the same approach succeeding with the 3.6 ISO) "
223,Is there any advantage at using public wifi with tor?,"consider these two scenarios:  1) You use tor on a private network (ex: home wifi), you also use a VPN you trust as a second layer.  2) You use tor on a public network (ex: library), and a VPN you trust.  Assuming the VPN never disconnects and there are no human errors, is there a advantage of using a public network? Does using a public network provide more anomitity or is it the same as a using a private one?  Or is the only advantage of a public network that if something fails your real IP cannot be leaked? "

If the ""identity key"" is used to sign, what is the ""connection key"" for? I've been looking for this information for weeks, but I can't find anything.  Thanks for your help! :)     These are 1024-bit RSA keys:         A long-term signing-only ""Identity key"" used to sign documents and    certificates, and used to establish relay identity.   A medium-term TAP ""Onion key"" used to decrypt onion skins when accepting    circuit extend attempts.  (See 5.1.)  Old keys MUST be accepted for a    while after they are no longer advertised.  Because of this,    relays MUST retain old keys for a while after they're rotated.  (See    ""onion key lifetime parameters"" in dir-spec.txt.)

247,Tor connection in guest OS is being blocked by unknown firewall At Host OS part 2,"a few days ago i have posted this:  I am having a problem setting up tor through virtual box and let me give you guys some details: I have installed tor bundle on win xp that is installed on virtual box but when i am trying to activate tor bundle it won't connect, it will get stuck in the ""loading network status"" level. I have malware anti bytes installed on the pc and norton anti virus. malware antybytes will show me message when i am trying to connect to tor like :""website blocked ip:61231 port"" i will get a few messages like this and it just won't connect to tor on guest os. i tried to deactivate norton and malware antybytes but it still won't connect to tor. What else shall i try?  and i have gotten this answer from Alexey Vesnin: Malwarebytes is blocking Tor - it's a known issue. If I got you right - you have two antiviruses on one PC, it's a bad idea nowdays: I remember 1994 - yes, then it made some sense, but not now. Some network filtering is remaining when the AV is deactivated, and - if your host is also Windows - it can activate windows defender+firewall when disabling other antivirus... Use network bridge for your virtual machine - it should keep you out of trouble. And feel free to ask further if it will not work - together we will solve this, don't worry!  I didn't know if i should respond over there in the answer section or i should just open a new question tab, so that is what i am doing.  So, i have removed malware bytes from my pc and i have stayed just with norton, but still i am not able to connect to tor through the guest os. n.b what exactly and how exactly do i do the network bridge that you told me? because when i am trying to bridge the virtual box network adapter it tells me that i can bridge it just to another lan network and my main network is wireless. please help me.

248,How can Youtube see my viewing history through different circuits?,"I watch a few videos on Youtube using TB, all about the same or very similar topic. Let's say ""topic x"".

But this time Youtube will list and recommend me videos about ""topic x"" on the right side in this new window. How does Youtube see what I watched in a previous window using a different Tor circuit?  Is it because cookies? Aren't different windows operate kind of as different ""instances""? How can I prevent this without restarting TB?  I tried to use cookie manager addons and the built-in Firefox cookie manager, but none shows any cookies. How can I manage cookies in TB? How can I delete cookies set by a certain domain without closing and restarting TB?  Thank you for the help! "
249,Tor Browser Bundle for Windows without installer?,"I can't find a non-installer download for the browser bundle for Windows anymore.  I still see non-installers for Mac/Linux.  Did they remove it? Why??? I hate installers since you don't know if they put stuff into the registry or user folders. When you just extract an archive you know where the files goes, THAT'S what I want.  Anyone know if you can still get a non-installer Tor Browser bundle? "
250,How much time they may take to track me down?,"What I did:   I used Tor Browser Bundle and created a fictitious Facebook account. The Facebook was registered through a fake email, No personal information was given. I uploaded the video and copied its direct link. Through TBB, I sent by email the link to the Home Minister and Human Rights Organisation.   Anyways, the hunt to track me down is on. As the question of law is involved, my country can issue warrant to seize the exit node or something like that.   Can I really be tracked down if the whole government (which is in power these days and the Minister/politician is one of them) wants go to any extent. I am in one of the Asian countries. At the time of hosting video, the exit node was that of Italy and the IP address which went inside email belongs to exit node of Romania.  Kindly guide me on this matter.  1, For how long should I use the same bridges? I feed 6-7 entry bridges (not obscure bridges) in the TBB and use them until they expire. Is it the right way? "
251,"What are the implications of ""starting up with tabs/windows from last time""","I am a bit of a tabs nut, and have been trying to read up on various parts of staying anonymous but where I am the ISP is owned by the gov (relatives of the pres) and they don't like the whole idea of people being anonymous soooo (this is going somewhere) I have been trying to read up somewhat incognito using the TBB but I gotta say its not the most convenient way (for me) to go through lots of material. I usually have lots of tabs open and use a addon (in my none tor bb browser) to manage tabs etc which helps me organize my reading etc.   Question is (are):    in a country as small as mine with limited tor usage how visible would I be making myself using 1-2 extra addons? If opening up tor with tabs from last time is that problematic (which i assume it is since it is totally disabled in tor bb) is there some sort of work around? Like these external bookmarking programs, except for tabs? Something similar to ""Tabs Outliner"" (for chrome) but as a separate program that wouldn't been seen my websites that I'd be browsing?  "
252,Can someone in our local network find out that I use Tor browser?,"My desktop is connected to our office network. If I use the Tor browser, can our IT trace that I'm the one using Tor in the office? Could the websites I visited using Tor browser also traced back? "
253,How can I remove the overly frequent popup that's constantly warning me about HTML5 Canvas?,"On several sites where I use Tor, I too often get the following popup message:     This website attempted to access image data on Canvas. Since Canvas   image data can be used to discover information about your computer,   blank image data was returned this time.   This is considerably intrusive and it's interrupting my work. How can I configure Tor browser to never again show this popup? Ok, it sent back blank image data - I get it. I'm happy with that. I just don't want to be reminded of it - ever.  I tried following the advice here in the accepted answer: HTML5 Canvas Image Extraction  However, that doesn't work (maybe something has changed since that version?) If I delete the permissions.sqllite file, then Tor just writes it back. Editing the file just seems to show a table definition (I wanted to change the value). If I can change this value to false, and this succeeds in removing this popup, where can I change it?  How can I get rid of this message so that it never again shows up, especially after requesting a new identity? "
254,Does the Tor network accept clients or relays running customized source code?,"In How to implement the modified source code of Tor?, OP may be asking about using a tor binary built from customized source code.  The public Tor network rejects customized clients and relays, right? "
255,Downloading In Tor,"I was told before using the Tor browser that it is not advisable to download in Tor browser.  My question is once I have downloaded a Tor file (A pdf file or a video file) and then restart the browser session and then use the downloaded file, will I still have a possibility of being detected? Or if I shut down the browser and am still connected to the internet will I be detected? If the Q sounds a little outdated... Sorry. Am a first time user....  "

Until when it be able to identify me? Till I change the circuit? Will it be able to identify me if I use it again another day? Will I have to generate another public key? (or does tor does this every time I start it?  Also, will the exit node be able to associate my identity with relay (does Tor uses different keys for my relay/hidden services?) "
257,Is it still true that each onion relay keeps an open TLS connection to every other relay? Why?,"The original paper describing Tor says this on section 4:     Each onion router maintains a TLS connection to every other onion router.   That paper is from 2004, when there was a much smaller number of relays on the network. Now there are more than 5000.    Is it still 100% true that relays form a complete graph at all times? Wouldn't that number of simultaneous connections exceed some OS limit on number of open sockets or something like that?  Does it impose a performance penalty on relays?  Is there any privacy consideration that requires those connections to exist at all times? What kind of messages do those relays exchange when they're not part of the same circuit?  "
258,Does increasing the number of introduction points for a hidden service help with its scalability?,"Would increasing the number of introduction points help distribute the load among more relays? Would it have any security implications?  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of introduction points a hidden service can choose, so it seems viable to increase it, I'm just not sure if it'd be any help.  [The specification is vague about how many introduction points a hidden service can have (""a small number"", ""arbitrary""), which I'm assuming leaves it to the implementation.] "

I was under the impression that if I set it up as only a relay and not an exit node, then I'd have practically no problems.  I'm surprised any company would block IPs based simply on that IP being an internal relay node.  Any way I can avoid this? "

When I use VPN (but use a normal browser), I am Ok and can normally do what I have to do at that website.  So, if the Tor exit nodes are publicly known, and the websites have software to sniff our Tor, then the number of websites that disallow Tor will increasingly grow. and there will be a day when Tor can't be used on any website at all, if my logic is OK so far.  So can anyone shed any more light on this? How do I use Tor and not get banned at a website?  I don't have to use any bridge software as I can access Tor directly. "

275,Multiple Tor relays vs one bigger relay on one connection,"Today I got an idea, that I have multiple (5) computers, which I can have running all the time, so why not to make them all relays, right? Well for one, I have limited connection (50mbit up/down). So I guess I would surely lose my Guard status, if I ran those 5 computers on that line. Is there any reasoning as to why would I consider it?   server with Xeon 4/4 3.2GHz desktop with i7 4/8 2.4GHz desktop with i7 2/4 2.6GHz desktop generally slow, I don't know the exact CPU desktop generally very slow, I don't know the exact CPU   I am currently running a relay on the server. With regard to the CPU speed, which I don't really think is the limit, nonetheless, if I had those first 3 computers running all the time as relays, is that a good idea for some reason than having all bandwidth used by the server?

280,I need to send an email to my stalker without him knowing my location,"What is the easiest, most secure way for me to send a one-time email to my stalker without him learning my general physical location from my IP? Can I do this by installing the Tor Browser and then using that to go through something like guerillamail? Will that mask my IP/physical location? I don't want to hear back from him. He just needs to be given some information. I'd rather use a disposable email if at all possible.   Believe me, he will sue an email provider to get my location if he can. If he knows the city/state, it's over. I don't have the money to run again should he find me. I'm not a hacker type, but I can follow directions step-by-step if there is a good guide somewhere. I'm using a Mac. Thank you.  EDIT  I saw that someone flagged my question as a duplicate and went to read what was posted under the other person's question. I appreciate the help, and please accept my apologies for saying so, but I'm not seeing a cohesive, easy-to-execute solution under the duplicate that fits what I'm looking for. It sounds like there's some disagreement on what really works, plus the most detailed answer went way over my head.   Someone suggested going to a local public wifi and using that, the library or a coffee shop, in addition to using TOR, squirrel mail, etc., but my stalker would still be able to figure out the city and state where I live from the public wifi's IP. If I had a car and the money to drive several hundred miles to use a public wifi that wasn't in my state, I would be on the road right now and none of this would be necessary. No need to hide the IP. If he believed I was in that other state, fantastic. Nor, do I need encryption. I couldn't care less who might see the email. My stalker doesn't need to verify the email was from me. He'll know. And the last thing I want to do is exchange correspondence with him. All I needed was a way to safely hide my location when sending him a single, one-way email. A method where him suing the email provider to get my IP would be difficult.  What I have learned from these extensive and thoughtful answers is that it's almost impossible to hide your location, and only someone with a specific skill set should attempt it. Which leaves me out. Thank you to whomever posted the link about TOR/Guerilla Mail. Whew, you saved me there. I was just about to go that route. Bottom line, decided it's better to take the consequences of not sending the email in the first place, than risk being found.  "

You'll need to configure Tor and   all of your applications manually. This installer must be run as   Administrator.   but there's no installer, it's just a zip-archive. Anyway if I run Tor/tor.exe in it then it starts as a process, and then I can use it with php curl by doing:  curl_setopt([tex]CURLOPT_PROXY , 127.0.0.1:9050) curl_setopt([tex]CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE , CURLPROXY_SOCKS5)   This works and I can get a new IP by restarting the tor-process.  However I want more control than this. For instance I've tried creating a ""torrc""-file and specify a different port for example, but it doesn't seem to read the file no matter where I put it. Where is it supposed to be placed anyway? Also, I try running different commands like the ones on here with the tor-executable but nothing works.  C:\Users\Oscar\Downloads\tor-win32-tor-0.2.5.12\Tor&gt;tor -h C:\Users\Oscar\Downloads\tor-win32-tor-0.2.5.12\Tor&gt;   I get no kind of feedback. Only difference is that this wont tart the tor-process. What am I doing wrong? "
284,Setting tor hidden service in /etc/hosts,ok so I wasn't receiving updates for drupal so I decided to go to /etc/hosts and added my hostname like so  127.0.0.1  something.onion  I restarted tor and drupal now can receive updates again anyways does this cause any issues? Is it dangerous to do this? 
285,Tails signature mismatch,"So I downloaded the new signing key with Key-ID 0x58ACD84F. However, the detatched signature file for Tails 1.3.2 seems to be signed with Key-ID 0x752A3DB6 and I can't seem to find that particular key mentioned anywhere on the website. It does show up on the keyservers, though. Is that the old one? Should I trust it?  Edit: I see now that 0x752A3DB6 is a subkey of 0x58ACD84F. Why would Kleopatra claim there's ""Not enough information to check signature validity""? "
286,Using Raspberry Pi as Tor Relay,"I'm attempting to set up my raspberry pi as a tor relay. I found some instructions on Instructable: [website]I'm only concerned for steps 1-6, since I can't get the tor browser due to the type of processor in the pi(and I'm almost positive I don't need it for the relay to work).   I can get to the end of step 6 and get: Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working.  But when I check Atlas or Globe the relay nickname doesn't show (I let it run 12 hours before checking).   Is there any way to confirm the relay is actually working? (i.e. monitor bandwidth? I know Stem can work, but you need the browser to get the info [I think])  Any help would be great, thank you. "

288,Can a hidden service directory enumerate hidden services?,"It seems like having a list of all of the hidden services might be a good way for an attacker to find poorly-secured systems, or to find obscure hidden sites.  Can an HSDir list hidden services? What percentage of them can a single HSDir find out about? "
289,How do I browse the tor stackexchange from tor?,"Since this has not been directly asked yet it seems, I thought we might as well address the elephant in the room.  Cloudflare prevents access to the CSS, images and javascript of the stackexchange sites unless a cloudflare captcha is entered to be able to access the resources hoted on cdn.sstatic.net.  How do we work with that ? Should we get a stackexchange admin involved so maybe they at least address the fact that static content is hosted elsewhere, with cloudflare protection ?  Fun fact: to ask this question I had to login. Loging in seems javascript based, so I had to get *.sstatic.net to bypass the tor socks proxy. "

293,How to use FaceBook anonymously with Tor? Is it possible to use FaceBook without JavaScript?,Is there any way to use FaceBook with JavaScript disabled? I would like to use FaceBook anonymously with Tor but FB requires JavaScript to be enabled and I read that it can be used to track my identity so in this case Tor wouldn't protect my privacy. Is it possible to safely use FaceBook with Tor? If not does that mean that nobody is and never will be anonymous to FaceBook? 
294,Why can't user be identified or located if he uses tor,I know how tor works but I have this question. Lets say that the user which uses tor has done something bad with some website. In website log there would be ip which did this thing. If they try find the pc which has this ip they will found it and they will figure out that its exit node of tor. Then they will try to found the previous pc from where this request was sent and they will find it. They will have to do that thing several times and eventually they will find you. Can you please which part of this story is wrong? And one more question when exit nodes are found why police is not shutting it down or arresting the man who owns that pc? thank you.  
295,URL returns 404 error,"I downloaded recently Tor and when trying to access a specific website I get the following:   Firstly, a page titled ""One more step, Please complete the security check to access (the website)"", with a captcha box. In order to see the captcha word presented properly, I have to lower Tor Security Setting to Low. On this page, the following message is also found:      What can I do to prevent this in the future? If you are on a personal   connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your   device to make sure it is not infected with malware. If you are at an   office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run   a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected   devices.    Then, after entering the captcha word, the url returns a ""404 page not found"" error.   The URL works fine when using other browsers, without the need to enter any captcha words, I can get straight into it. I'm not a computer expert at all and reading the answers to some of the other questions on the subject didn't really help.   Does anyone know how to fix this?  Many thanks in advance. "
296,Is TOR Compromised on my computer?,"Tor browser is acting funny.  First, when I toggle tor browser on my lexar jump drive it goes to a shortcut stating ""Start TOR browser"". then when I ask for a new identity  TOR crashes or gives me the message ""TOR browser will close all windows and tabs. All website sessions will be lost.  Restart now to reset your identity?"" TOR has NEVER asked me this before.  Plus TOR opened with Duck Duck Go as the search engine.  Am I compromised?  (Also ran EXTERMINATE IT, Malwarebytes, and Spybot to ensure I'm not infected.) "
297,Gmail and Gtalk over Tor suggestions,"How should one best access Google communications and social services, like Gmail, Talk/Hangouts, and maybe G+ over Tor?  I'll propose the default threat model for interacting with Google as : We've only one non-temporary identity with Google.  Google should never connect web searches or maps queries with this identity.  Google should never learn our location either.  We could access Gmail and Gtalk by asking the Tor browser bundle for a new identity, but that's error prone and prompts CAPTCHAs.   Instead, we could make our exit node constant for Google by running a second Tor on port 9050 with the config lines :   MapAddress *.google.com *.google.com.foo.exit MapAddress *.gmail.com *.gmail.com.foo.exit    And access Gmail via IMAP/SMTP and Gtalk via XMPP instead of the Tor browser bundle.  We cannot make our exit node constant for the Tor browser bundle in this way because we might wish to use Google search.  In this setup, there remains some risk of CAPTCHAs since foo.exit is a Tor exit node.  We must therefore point a browser at port 9050 at least occasionally.  And we might want G+, Google Groups, etc. too.    A priori, I'd do this by creating a second profile in the Tor browser bundle that uses 9050 instead of 9150 and disables Tor button?  What else should we do?  What else have I missed?    How should one select foo.exit?  Just pick an exit with solid bandwidth and uptime from the list of tor exit nodes?  Attempt to pick an exit with several alternative exits in the same city?   Does MapAddress support IP address ranges?  I could imagine it doing so with a syntax, like MapAddress 64.233.160.0-64.233.191.255 *.foo.exit, but afaik nothing like that works.  Also, I presume the same MapAddress trick cannot realistically be used for financial institutions, like PayPal, unless we've a private exit node that never appears in the consensus, right?  "
298,Actual impact of ad blockers on Tor Browser,"You risk making Tor browser signature unique anytime you add browser extensions. Are there any quantifiable differences between Tor browser with and without certain extensions?  How should one evaluate extensions?  There are no differences displayed by panopticlick.eff.org if you have Privacy Badger and/or uBlock installed, or not installed, but that's only a coarse measure. Any thoughts on what else one should evaluate beyond what panopticlick.eff.org reports?  As an aside, I'd expect the Tor browser bundle does not benefit from Privacy Badger since the Tor browser blocks much cross-site scripting anyways.  Can anyone confirm that?  "
299,Setting the country of the tor ExitNodes,"I'm having some trouble in setting the country of the tor exit nodes. Following this link, by adding the bellow entries to the ./Data/torrc  ExitNodes {ru} StrictNodes 1   an exit node from the specified region should be used. However, geo locating the exit nodes shows that none are from Russia. Upon picking a new identity the exit node always remains in the EU or US. Why is that? "
300,Whonix with http server not reachable,"I've been following this tutorial on how to setup Whonix with a lighttp server so I can host my own tor website.  I did all the steps described in the tutorial, but when I try to visit my tor website (through another machine) then it (eventually) says The connection has timed out.   And I'm sure my lighttpd webserver is running. Made sure by doing a ps ax | grep ligh.  My torrc is exactly as it says in the tutorial:  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/  HiddenServicePort 80 192.168.0.11:80   Not sure about the IP address 192.168.0.11 though.

302,Tor Hidden Service with authentication,"I would like to develop a small hidden service that require authentication, i.e. the first thing that must show up is the login page.  I'm pretty newbie in all this web-services world and some questions arise in mi head:   What are the secure recommendations when implementing this feature? What software do you recommend? (apache + php?)   It is necessary to get a SSL certificate? And more important, will this feature be seeing as a challenge in the eyes of some enthusiast Tor users?   So far I've just seeing this question with ""Who knows, it might even work."" as the final sentence of the correct answer. So I'm a little intrigued.   Thanks in advance! Warren. "

304,Multiple instances of Tor w/ Tor Browser since v4.5,"I'm aware this has already been asked, but with an update to Tor browser it seems a bit more difficult to manage. See here: How to run multiple Tor browsers with different IPs?  It requires editing TorButton preferences, which is no longer an easy thing to do. How do I change my settings to use custom proxy?  I see it's possible using linux: [website]EDIT: I found this also: [website]At the bottom, MikePerry says "" ... you need to either edit the Torbutton about:config prefs 'extensions.torbutton.socks_host' and 'extensions.torbutton.socks_port', or set the environment variables TOR_SOCKS_HOST and TOR_SOCKS_PORT before starting TBB.""

306,No terminal messages from tor 4.5.1,"After downloading the last release of tor (4.5.1), terminal messages do not appear anymore. The usual stuff tor used to tell me when ran from terminal is not there - stuff like ""Tor can't help you if you use it wrong......"", or ""Opening control listener on 127.0.0.1:9151"", or ""Tor browser exited cleanly"", or info saying that the circuit has been established, or how many % of guards, midpoints and exits have been found, nothing at all, nothing. Why is that? Does anyone know? I'm running LUbuntu I should also add that before 4.5.1 release I ran tor from terminal and not as root and I do so exactly the same way now, the difference is there is no feedback from tor... "
307,Hiding my location anonymous email,apologies for asking such a basic question but I'm having trouble finding a clear answer.   I want to send an email anonymously (I'll create a new email account). I don't want the recipient to know the state/city that I'm located in as this will give away my identity. There are numerous others who could send the same email that i want to send but they are all located in a different state to me. The recipient is an employer and will only have access to a office based IT person to try and figure out who sent the email.  Do I need to use the Tor browser to prevent my employer from knowing the location I sent the email from? Can I use my home internet connection while using Tor or do I need to use a public wifi? Are there any settings I need to adjust when using the Tor browser at home?  Thank you!

"
312,Connecting to freenode using irssi,"This is arguably the same question as How to connect to freenode using Tor? except that the answers there seem to be outdated, as freenode now allows access via Tor again. However the instruction there is not clear to me. For example, it says in the end:     Note that due to the SSL certificates not matching the hidden service, you might have to disable the verification in your client. If your client supports key pinning, you can verify our Tor server's public key fingerprint:      E0:1B:31:80:56:D9:78:C4:2B:2D:3F:B2:DB:81:AB:03:15:59:BF:04:7E:31:E8:60:5F:98:07:A1:BB:8F:A3:0D      You'll then want to tell your client to try the EXTERNAL mechanism. We lack comprehensive documentation for this, but it's a feature in most modern clients, so please check their docs for instructions for now.   I don't quite understand the first paragraph, and the second one is not very clear instruction to me...  Would anyone be able to give a step by step instruction as to how to connect to freenode via Tor using irssi (or any other client), especially how to set up the SASL with EXTERNAL mechanism and how this requires a client certificate to be generated and added to the NickServ? "
313,"HTTPS, HTTP Headers, Privacy and Tor","I have several doubts regarding the HTTPS protocol:  - First: Are the HTTPS headers encrypted? I mean, HTTPS encrypts the content, but does it also encrypt the headers?  -Second: Navigating with, for example, Chrome, through the HTTPS protocol, is it safe for privacy? I mean, imagine that the police are analyzing my network traffic through a sniffer. I am browsing with a normal browser but through an HTTPS page, can the police track me? And Can the police know the server to which I am sending data?  Third: The main purpose of Tor is to hide the user through the three nodes. But my question is: If using HTTPS only the connection is encrypted, and the HTTP headers are encrypted, how can the user be tracked if everything is encrypted?  Four: Does using HTTPS also encrypt IP?  Thank you.  Forget my English, English is not my mother tongue.    I add more doubts...:  I have just opened this thread as a result of this animation ([website]First: According to that image, if I only surf with HTTPS, people (Police, NSA ...) can track me. At first, I thought that maybe they could track me because of HTTP headers. But now I know that HTTP headers are encrypted in HTTPS. So I guess they can track me, for example, thanks to the IP, which is not encrypted (among other elements, like cookies or fingerprinting). Right?  Second: According to that image, when I navigate through HTTPS, the Police or the NSA can know to which web page I am connecting. Our fellow canonizing ironize has said that ""they know who you are and what site you are using (because) the site you are connecting to is not encrypted. The resource you're fetching from the site is"". I do not quite understand this. I mean, if the HTTP headers are encrypted, the ""Host"" request header is also encrypted. So how do they know the site I'm connecting to?  Third: Look at the animation ([website]A) If I am using Tor and HTTPS simultaneously, according to the image, if there is a hacker monitoring my router he only receives one information: ""Location Tor"". What does this mean? He can not see my information (is encrypted because of HTTPS), but does he know my identity? (Imagine that the hacker is monitoring a router in a huge building with many routers. The hacker does not know exactly which router he is monitoring, he only knows that it is in that building. If I use Tor and HTTPS, the hacker can see my real public IP? I say it because the information has not gone through the three nodes  yet...).  B) According to the image, if I use Tor and HTTPS simultaneously, my ISP and a possible NSA agent that monitors the Network BEFORE the first Tor node, can see the same thing as before: ""Location Tor "". Can anyone explain this to me? What does it mean? I think it means that he can know WHO the information comes from, but not WHERE TO GO. But this means that Tor is vulnerable ... In the same way, the first Tor node can see ""Location Tor"" ... What does this mean?  C) According to the image, if I use Tor and HTTPS simultaneously, the third Tor node, as well as a possible NSA agent located AFTER the three nodes; the ISP of the site that I connect to and the website can see the site to which a Tor user connects (""Site.com"") and nothing else, right? That is, they can see the site to which a connection is connecting, but they can not know where the connection is coming from, right?  D) Imagine this situation ... I am using Tor. The NSA is monitoring ALL submarine cables, as Snowden suggested ... Okay. Then, there is an NSA agent monitoring the Network BEFORE the first Tor node and another monitoring the Network AFTER the third node. They detect all my traffic. According to the image, the first agent receives ""Location Tor"", and the second agent receives ""Site.com"" (the website to which I connect). If they share the information, can they know my identity?  I know there are a lot of questions ... I'm sorry, but I think they're interesting. Thank you.  (Forget my English please; English is not my mother tongue). "
314,Tor Multiplexing,"I'm trying to understand how tor multiplexing work. I went through all their design documentation and original research paper, but there is very little mention of it. Examining Tor source code, didn't do much.  My main question, what is being multiplexed, where does it happen, and how is it happening?   Is it at Tor client? If so, what is being multiplexed? Is it the connections? or is it streams belonging to same circuit? is multiplexing always guaranteed? Or is it governed by some conditions?   I'm asking this, because as I far as I can see from the code, streams are being written to circuits as they are received from the browser.  Any help, clue or references is much appreciated.   "

318,Diverse doubts about Tor relays,"According to Tor's official website ([website] ORPort 443     Exitpolicy reject *: *     Nickname ididntedittheconfig     ContactInfo human @ ...  Okay. First question: But can I configure the ""ORPort"" field with any other port? Port 443 is used for default HTTPS communications; So Second question: does that mean that a person who is browsing by Tor on an HTTP web page (port 80 or 8080) will not be able to navigate through my relay?  Third question: Adding these parameters to the 'torrc' file, will I be an intermediate node only? Because I suppose to be an exit node the Exitpolicy field has to be configured with ports too, right? Example: ExitPolicy accept: *: 80, accept *: 110 Or has this changed?  Fourth question: This question is extremely curious. In an old example of the 'torrc' file ([website]################ This section is just for servers ##################### NOTE: If you enable these, you should consider mailing your identity. key fingerprint to the tor-ops, so we can add you to the list of servers that clients will trust. See the README for details.  In the example of the current 'torrc' file ([website]Also, in the Tor FAQ ([website]However, on a non-torproject web page ([website]""Yes. But by default users will only use you for the middle hop of their circuits. To become more useful to the network, please send mail to the ops with your key fingerprint and contact information"".  So, the question: To be an exit node, is it necessary to send an email to The Tor Project? I'm very confused...  Fifth question: I have read that once the file 'torrc' has been modified, the directory authorities must vote and approve the node. Is this still so? And in that case, who votes that a node is valid or not? A human administrator? Automatic software?  Next topic: I have read that to be an entry guard, I have to meet some requirements. Well, here are two questions:  1. Does the first node (or entry guard) to the Tor network know the IP of the Tor client? 2. I have read that to be an entry guard node it is necessary to have a good bandwidth and be a stable node. Who decides that I am prepared to be an input node? A human administrator, or software?  That's all by now. Thank you Tor Stacks volunteers. I'm learning a lot with you.   (Please forget my English; English is not my mother tongue). "
319,Fate of Tor circuits upon resuming an hibernated computer,"When a user's computer (not a relay) having established Tor circuits goes down into operating system defined states of deep sleep  (hibernates) - to be restarted (awoken) at a later time - is state maintained in the net relative to those circuits, both at the Tor circuit protocol level and as underlying TCP connections ?   What are the timeouts if any applicable to such suspended Tor connections ?

329,Tor Browser Bundle Single-Hop,I downloaded the Tor source. I could compile it and run it with the changes to the or.h file creating a single hop for better tor speed.  As explain in this topic: How to decrease number of Tor hops?  But after compilation. I don't know how to use the newly compiled and installed Tor without using the Tor bundle. And apparently the tor bundle comes with all the tor and stuff in it. So it doesn't use Single hop. Soo....  Is there a way to configure the tor bundle to use Single Hop? OR How do you make use of a Tor compiled and installed from its tor-0.2.9.10.tar.gz source.   Or can I make changes to the Tor Bundle Source to create single hops.

332,How can I determine if Tor is being blocked?,Several attempts resulted in failure on a network where Tor used to work. I noticed that DuckDuckGo and Startpage and Ixquick used to work also but now get an error message when access is attempted. My only conclusion is the system admins must have noticed the use since regular access to the search engines stopped about the same time Tor started having problems on the network. How do I determine if Tor addresses are getting blocked? Do I have to use a bridge in this case?

334,Having trouble editing Torrc,"I have downloaded and installed the Tor bundle for Windows and all is working fine. I would like to configure it so that it restricts my IP address to Australia only.   I have read the edit my torrc entry and have located the Data/Tor/torrc file, but how do I actually edit It? I am an ordinary user - not advanced - so I really have no idea what I'm doing. What program do I open the file in? When I opened it in notepad (you're all probably laughing out loud!), this is how it read:   # This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments will not be  # preserved   # The old torrc file was renamed to torrc.orig.1 or similar, and Tor  # will ignore it   DataDirectory C:\Users\maria\Desktop\Tor Browser\Data\Tor  DirReqStatistics 0  GeoIPFile C:\Users\maria\Desktop\Tor Browser\Data\Tor\geoip   I have spent hours reading everything I can to work out how to edit it on my own, but I unfortunately I don't have the necessary knowledge and experience to understand what I'm reading. I know I have to put {au} somewhere, but where and how? Could somebody please tell me the exact steps to take so that I can configure Tor to always make me look like I have an Australian IP.  I'll be grateful for any replies. "
335,Is logging into accounts on Tor secure (from a technical viewpoint)?,"Reading about the Heartbleed Bug, and the NSA having readable access to the Tor network, I can't really answer this question myself.  Is logging into any account on a website using https, in technical terms, as secure as just browsing the Internet?  From what I have understand, Tor randomizes the path packets use for different sites etc. Assuming that there is no Tor server in my paths that is leaking security (like with the Heartbleed bug) are my packets still encrypted in a safe way, so that no man in the middle attack can occur?  Please note that I don't want to discuss the security of the account, just the technical security, in terms of delivering the packets on the wire. "
336,How is 'Exit Probability' calculated?,Tools like Atlas graphs an Exit Node's 'Exit Probability': [website]How is the Exit Probability calculated? (Bonus for a link to the code.)  Do exit probabilities add up nicely to 100% among all exit nodes?    Is there a mechanism to re-run the calculation taking into account a particular exit port (or IP)? 
337,Tor LFS and TAILS,Hope this isn't stupid but I've thought about this on and off for a while: Does it make sense to build a Linux From Scratch (or BLFS) project (hardened?) using the TAILS component list as the model? The idea being to launch Tor from the best possible foundation? This will increase user familiarity with the components which should improve security as well. Someone who is familiar with this should be able to explain why this might be a weaker or stronger environment for launching Tor. 
338,"How a client maintains a list of guard nodes, from among hundreds of guard nodes, for creating a circuit?",It is said that a client maintains a list of guard nodes for certain time for making a circuit.

342,Is it safe to send identifying information unencrypted through Tor?,"My question is similar to What&#39;s the extent of the problem of information leaking to exit node, but the answer there isn't sufficient for my question.  If I send unencrypted information through Tor, e.g. if I send an email (without PGP) which contains personally identifying information, is my privacy compromised? I am worried about the following scenario: suppose I send an email     Hey [recipient],      I was thinking about setting up a [sensitive issue] advocacy rally on [date] at [place]. Let me know if you would be interested in supporting the cause.      Best wishes,      [name]   If I send this email through Tor and it happens to go through a corrupt exit node that is watching for and capturing plaintext, is my privacy compromised? I know the exit node wouldn't know my IP address, but the email directly contains identifying information. Could an exit node read this email? "

It was reported as a bad signature. This happened again with the 1.0 download. I have tried a few different ways of verifying the signature - same result. Does anyone have any idea what has been happening? Is this an actual attack? Could the key I downloaded with .22 have been tampered with (in which case the software is probably also comprimised)?

349,Tor + I2P on a system and Is I2P better than TOR?,"Greeting's, given recent events of FBI taking down silk road 2.0 and 3.0. I have few questions, please keep in mind that i'm not technologically too sound.   Is I2P better than TOR? Can i have a system which will use I2P + TOR? Something like whonix (although whonix only uses TOR but has a dual system model - so can i configure one system to use i2p to connect to TOR gateway part of whonix OR can i have i2p on a system and use TOR browser bundle?)? does that configuration make anonymity stronger? Is this useful or stupid - install TOR on a system and connect to a VPN service provider and surf? (i'm pretty sure it's dumb since VPN service provider will keep a record of inbound connections and exit will show directly to wherever I've tried to surf too plus the part of paying the service provider leaves a trail). So secondly, can i use TOR to connect to a VPN service provider and use TOR on the system to surf further? If the server is fully rented to me? (again stupid, since he can monitor the server; but at this point I am asking this to ensure my knowledge isn't fully degraded or if i'm not missing anything.)   Lastly, if anonymity is paramount; Which would be the best system / protocol suite to use (including combination of) to use?

I would like to know   Is it possible to run multiple relays on the same static WAN IP? Will I need to forward different OR and DirectPorts for each system on my adsl router? Is it benificial to the tor network in anyway by having this set up?   The reason for using more than one relay is because I already have one set up on my primary internet connection and no matter how much bandwidth I allocate to it, it only downloads 100Mb and uploads half that a day.  I intend to use 5 Rasperry Pis running headless raspbian or arch linux to accomplish this. "
352,what are all of the ways an android can be traced/tracked/identified,"At first glance this seems like it might be more complex than worrying about a computer. With a computer, a proxy like tor takes care of the ip and mac spoofing takes care of the rest. Android has more identification numbers such as serial numbers, ANDROID_ID's, ESN's and I'm assuming others. Does one need to worry about any other numbers besides IP and MAC being transmitted and potentially being used to identify them?  Furthermore, if one were to turn on airplane mode, activate orbot, ensure all data went directly through orbot, installed a softphone app, and coupled the softphone with some sort of virtual phone service, would this in theory allow for phone calls to be made without advertising identity and location to every cell tower in the area? "
353,Can the Tor Browser be configured to function as a non-exit relay node?,"I downloaded the 64-bit Windows installed for ""Tor Browser"" from this URL:  [website]It installed and worked as expected and can display normal and .onion sites. The first default page it displays is  about:tor Under ""you can help"" there is a link called Run a Tor Relay Node which says:     Alas, since Vidalia (a graphical interface for Tor) is no longer included in Tor Browser, there are currently no easy relay packages for Windows and OS X users.   Followed by Configure Tor by editing the torrc file.  I edited my ..\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor\torrc file as directed and added the port forward to my firewall. Unfortunately the Tor Browser failed to start after that and entered a failed to start, need to restart loop.  I enabled debug logging but nothing was added to the log during these events. I reverted the edits and verified the logging system actually worked. I trawled the tor site, Google and this site for further explicit information with no luck.  I am now assuming that the ""Tor Browser"" is 100% client and cannot relay traffic for any other users of the network.   Am I correct? If not, how do I active the relay functionality?

355,Will the Underwritten method for using TAILS work?,"I have read THIS and THIS and I would also like to use tails as my primary OS. Before I go any further, please understand that this is mainly and academic exercise. So im not too bothered about the slight impracticality of the hardware work in this project.  I want to buy THIS computer as a cheap way to try this out. I will remove the hard drive, then another one of the USB ports, and resolved it to the motherboard via a few inches of wire. I will then insert a 1 male to 2 female USB port splitter into the now extended USB port, and put a tails usb stick into one of the resulting female ports. I will keep the cables etc out of the way, with insulation tape in the void where the hard drive was. The remaining empty female USB port will then be used as the original motherboard USB port was (I will position it at the edge of the board, and secure it with tape) so that other usb devices can be connected as they were before.  Then, if I power on the computer, tails will be the only available OS, and it will boot. Right?  I just posted on here to make sure that this will work  as this is my first time doing anything at all like this. Thanks. "
356,How to configure multiple Tor.exes,It's very possible to have different end-nodes using the Tor Browser. see here  I want to configure the .exe to do the same thing (without the TBB). These are a list of commands that help to do that (I think). Has anyone tried this before? Possible? 
357,Why exactly is it not recommended to exclude relays?,"I'm doing some research on Tor for a paper and stumbled upon this section on the Tor FAQ page, where it says how to choose or exclude certain nodes from your circuit. Below it says that it is not recommended to do this, but not explicitly why. Here's the link: [website]My guess is that you can be distinguished from other users more easily if certain relays are constantly avoided. But that would require extensive statistical traffic analysis, wouldn't it?   Or is there another way that I fail to see? "
358,Does Tor usage increase the traffic volume compared to other browsers?,Let's say I visit some page via Chrome with in/out packages at the level of 10MB.  Could we know (theoretically) how the traffic volume will be affected if I visit the same site via Tor? Will Tor usage increase the traffic volumes my PC sends?   The question is related to internet usage limited to particular volume which I cannot exceed. 
359,ExitPolicy to local machine,"There is a comment in the torrc man page that exit policies can target the local machine or private networks, like say :   ExitPolicy accept 127.0.0.1:80 ExitPolicy reject private:*   Does anyone actually do this?  How would one actually exploit it?    There are no ip address limits specified in the consensus according to :    egrep ""^p6? "" /var/lib/tor/cached-microdescs | grep ':'   I suppose this means ""Tor does not bother to list such exits"", or their operators somehow suppress inclusion, or nobody does this.    If someone configures this, how does one use the access the local exit created?  Does the server need to set Nickname foobar or whatever.  And the client need to set AllowDotExit 1 and then access localhost.foobar.exit:80?  Is there an easier way?  Is this a viable approach to making a private exit useful for pinning an exit for a specific site?  Also, what is the difference between ExitPolicy and ReachableAddresses?   "
360,Do 'window.innerWidth' and 'window.innerHeight' in CSS pass back the values to the webserver?,"I have JavaScript turned off, and so no leakage of screen resolution to Panopticlick.eff.org fingerprint testing tool.  However, JonDonym's one - ip-check.info - has an alarming-looking vector down the bottom called 'Browser window'. Even with JS off, this value persists, and reveals even more uniqueness than the 'outer' screen resolution itself can - if you have Firefox's Menu Bar showing, the value changes - if you even zoom in (e.g. use NoSquint add-on on a larger screen), it changes, in fact it's in real-time as you change anything inside Firefox that affects the 'inner' window dimensions itself!  Without using JS, Flash or anything else aside from standard HTML and CSS - does this value get passed onto the webserver and thus can be used as a very serious de-anonymization vector?  Or, being dynamic and CSS, is it only local-browser residing, and so nothing to worry about at all? "
361,Anonabox & Tor (TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH),"I'm using the Anonabox and, as its hardware connects to Tor, I'm looking for something similar to the 'transparent torification' option in the Tor browser (to avoid running everything through Tor twice).

363,Adding a blacklist for known scam sites?,"It seems that the issue of fake/spoofed onion sites is becoming more and more of a problem.   The situation is such that on some more popular sites an incorrect keystroke may expose the user to malicious software, theft of credentials, government scrutiny, or simply fraud.   The lack of a central authority in the Tor network is such that there is no practical means of removing these entities. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the user to put in place practices which will prevent visits to unintended destinations.  Of course no human is perfect, and a failsafe should exist to avert this threat. That then begs the question:   Does the Tor Browser Bundle have the capability of blacklisting, either manually or through a subscription, spoofed sites? Can this be implemented , perhaps via a plug in or added feature?  "
364,Post install questions," I have installed Tor on a Opensuse 13.2. There is no log files in /var/log for Tor, how can i fix this? When I start Tor and press the link ""Test for Tor Network Settings"" I am told that I an not connected to Tor. How can I address this issue?  "
365,Since what version number is first TOR IP address unchanged?,"I have read messages from some users stating that the first of three tor nodes is fixed constant and that this is intentional. My question here is about when this changed in the version numbering because I have seen posts about this question from summer 2015 and I only installed Tor in Jan 2016....  Whenever I request a ""new tor circuit for this site"" it always sets the first IP the same (to an IP in the USA). This was not like that just a few weeks ago. Current Tor browser version is 5.5.5. My original installation version is given as 5.0.7 (installed since Jan 2016). I don't understand why this would change and considering previous postings saying this was due to a Tor version change were posted in Jun/Sep 2015 last year how come versions I have used since January 2016 did not always work this way? By the way this  has persisted despite me demanding around 50 new Tor circuits yesterday and also today (28/5/16) the same - always the same first IP address without fail and I have tested this for .com and .co.uk and .de websites, no change.   Also, how can I make sure this first fixed IP is trustworthy/genuine? "
366,How do you specify a specific ExitNode?,"I want to specify an ExitNode that is near me, so I looked at OnionView and found the IP address of the one I want to use. What is the syntax to put in torrc?  ExitNodes 73.48.139.226?  ExitNodes 73.48.139.226:9001?  ExitNodes {73.48.139.226}?  The first 2 show the ""Connecting to the tor network"" dialog forever and the last one crashes Tor. (I tried several exitnodes and they all do the same)  I realize I am not nearly as anonymous if I do this and this is sort of unorthodox, but I'm trying to test some things and cannot find documentation anywhere on how to do this. "
367,"""Trustworthy"" exit nodes","Unfortunately, a secure end-to-end encrypted connection is not always an option in every case. The user's ISP is, in many cases (depends much on the country), probably more trustworthy than a random Tor exit node, which anyone can run. Many exit nodes are potentially malicious, run by spying agencies such as the NSA, FBI, or other malicious organizations. Even if they don't attempt to harm the user directly (MITM), they may spy on the user and log content of the connection.  I have to use an unencrypted connection in this specific case.  I know I cannot get ideal security this way, but I am looking for some exit nodes that are at least as secure to use as a good, reputable ISP. Ideally these nodes should be hosted by a reputable organization committed to privacy and not keeping logs. What should I look for, and what country should they be located in, if I want good privacy (Switzerland?)? "
368,Nature of HTML5 Canvas fingerprinting,"I am something of a layperson, and have two questions regarding HTML5 Canvas fingerprinting.   As I understand it, it allows the site to extract certain hardware and software information about the visiting computer, which can be used to uniquely identify that machine. So if I were to visit site A, get finger-printed, then visit site B, and get finger-printed, my activities on sites A and B could be associated. If some identifying information (i.e. IP address) leaked on site B, my activities on site A could also be associated with that information. Or if I visited site A twice, it could tell that I was the same person. etc...  However, as I understand it, by itself, it does not reveal any identifying information. So if for some reason I didn't care about being identified as the same person on multiple occasions, I could allow it, and maintain my anonymity.  My questions are;   Am I correct in my understanding? How would this be affected by running tor in a VM?  "
369,Are AES-NI crypto instructions used by my Tor (relay) server?,"I have a server with Linux Debian 8.4, running a relay.  I read that AES-NI could improve the performance of my relay.

371,Creating ExitNodes command for Tor 6.0 on a Mac,"I sometimes need to set a specific ExitNodes country code in the torrc file. I am using Mac OS X 10.6.7.  Prior to Tor 6.0 the torrc file for TorBrowser.app on a Mac was located in the app's bundle, i.e.,  TorBrowser.app/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/torrc   I would edit that file to specify the desired ExitNodes command. Note, torrc was initially created by the app during first execution.  After that I could edit it.  In Tor 6.0 the app bundle organization is different and there is no torrc in the bundle.  So how does one now specify a specific ExitNodes country code?  If it's still a torrc file where does Tor 6.0 look for that file on a Mac? "

For example, I'd like to set the proxy of my RSS reader to connect through tor.. now, it connects to lots of websites, so I can't really know if all of them are using HTTPS.. is there a way to force tor to lose connection if it doesn't connect to HTTPS in this case, so I can be sure I'm ""safer""?

378,Is it possible to use BitTorrent over Tor without harming the network?,"Using BitTorrent over Tor is said to slow down the whole network because it can't handle the load. The Tor Project discourages it for this reason.  What is the main issue with BitTorrent over Tor, and why is it worse than downloading a large file from a website?  Is a different circuit built for each peer, and is this the reason? Is it possible to configure Tor to use only one circuit at a time, and would this help?  Let's not focus on the issue of BitTorrent leaking IP, this can be avoided with proper configuration.  Would reducing the number of relays in the circuit used for BitTorrent to 2 help? This may not be good for anonymity, but it may be the best tradeoff. I'm not sure whether it is possible to do this.  Lastly, would limiting the download and upload speeds in the BitTorrent client help? "
379,"Currently, how many entry guards does Tor choose and for how long are they maintained?","As it is said in the Tor FAQ: ""each Tor client selects a few relays at random to use as entry points, and uses only those relays for her first hop."" These relays are known as ""entry guards"".   I have read many things about this: For example, that ""every client picks 3 guard nodes and keeps them for 2 to 3 months"". But I've also read that Tor is currently thinking of setting up a single entry guard node (Proposal 236: [website]Then, CURRENTLY, in the version 0.2.9.10, how many 'entry guards' are chosen and for how long are they maintained? And another question: does the ""NumEntryGuards"" option affect this list of nodes? "
380,"Attacks from client-side, & server protections","Just as a hypothetical attack, assume Eve is using TOR. But Eve wishes to take control of the TOR nodes, and so injects a malicious package into the packets she sends to her TOR relay that takes over the servers. She creates several different relays in order to infect multiple machines. Then, if Eve wishes to eavesdrop on TOR traffic, she can monitor exit nodes if any of the servers she infected is acting as one for other clients, and she can intercept unencrypted data.  I have a few questions regarding this...   How feasible are client-side attacks in TOR? Is it feasible to inject such malicious packages into the packets? How feasible is the above attack? What kind of protections does TOR offer to the nodes against attacks from the client?   It doesn't seem to be addressed elsewhere, and the attack seems like it could potentially be carried out by organisations intent on monitoring the encrypted traffic. "

383,"Why does Tor Browser sometimes choose one entry guard (most of the time), but sometimes it choose two or three entry guards?","Some days ago I opened a thread asking how many entry guards Tor Browser currently picks. I found out, with help from forum volunteers, that the current source code of the stable version of Tor (0.2.9.10) stipulates that Tor has to choose, by default, 1 entry guard. For two reasons: firstly, because the entry guard is chosen by consensus, and consensus parameter NumEntryGuards=1 currently stipulates an entry guard. But, in addition, if the consensus did not stipulate the entry guard, Tor by default has to choose one (this appears in lines #79 to #85 of the source code).  I saw that, although the source code says that, the Tor directory protocol, version 3, says that Tor has to choose 3 entry guards by default (this appears in the line #1837 of the Tor directory protocol). The explanation is that, perhaps, the Tor directory protocol, version 3, is outdated. Or at least that line.  Here is the curious part: I have done several tests with my Tor Browser and I have discovered that normally the software chooses an entry guard (this is in line with the current consensus and with the source code), but sometimes in the state file I see that Tor Browser has chosen three or two entry guards, and I cannot find the reason. Why does Tor Browser choose three or two entry guards if the software is set to choose one?  To do the tests, I have reinstalled Tor Browser and I have not changed any settings. I performed the tests under Windows 10 Pro 64-bits and with version 6.5.1 of Tor Browser. I attached the torrc file here so that you can see the configuration.  Next, I attach screenshots of the state file, so you can check how Tor Browser sometimes chooses one, two or three entry guards. To change entry guard, I have deleted the contents of the state file and started the Tor Browser again. The question I want to solve is: Why does Tor Browser sometimes choose one entry guard (most of the time), but sometimes it chooses two or three entry guards? It is very important for me because I'm doing an universitary reserach about Tor and I do not find the reason of this.  The first time I started Tor Browser, it chose 3 entry guards. Screenshot.  The second time I started Tor Browser, it chose 1 entry guard. Screenshot.  The third time I started Tor Browser, it chose 1 entry guard. Screenshot.  The fourth time I started Tor Browser, it chose 1 entry guard. Screenshot.  The fifth time I started Tor Browser, it chose 2 entry guards. Screenshot.

385,Technical differences between Tor webbrowser and Firefox,"I've started to use Tor as my main browser recently.   I've noticed things enabled by default like NoScript.   However, one thing that strikes me is the memory comsumption, which is close to null. By comparison, running 10 tabs with Firefox usually takes up to 800 Mb of Ram.

The second computer is setup using the the Tor bundle browser which is configured to access the Tor network using the proxy server address of the first computer.  To my way of thinking, this configuration has to use two circuits through Tor.  Am I correct? This configuration seems to work fine.  I left out a lot of details in case there is no interest in this configuration experiment. "

396,Why isn't GPG adequate (is GnuPG better?) for Verifying Tor?,"I'd so much rather use GPG because GnuPG will require me to go into and type in the Terminal application.

And the guy in the tutorial does it so damn fast. So is it possible to use GPG tools to verify that I have the true Tor program and I'm really me, etc.? And avoid opening up the deathspace of Terminal? "
397,Why does Tor Browser include multiple torrc files?,"When the tor-launcher extension starts Tor Browser's tor, it uses the ""-f Data/Tor/torrc"" argument and the ""--defaults-torrc Data/Tor/torrc-defaults"" argument (if a torrc-defaults file is found). Here's what the man page says about these options.   -f FILE  Specify a new configuration file to contain further Tor configuration options. (Default: @CONFDIR@/torrc, or $HOME/.torrc if that file is not found)   --defaults-torrc FILE  Specify a file in which to find default values for Tor options. The contents of this file are overridden by those in the regular configuration file, and by those on the command line. (Default: @CONFDIR@/torrc-defaults.)   So it looks like Tor should be copying the contents of torrc into torrc-defaults. Why not use one torrc file only and set it with either the -f or --defaults-torrc options? Why are both files included? "
398,How much privacy is one giving up when javascript is turned off?,"I was thinking about setting up Tor browser bundle to be my main browser and perhaps add a ""open in chrome"" (or something like) when I ran into an insurmountable Tor related problem.

I thought I'd try in my regular browser testing on panopticlick with and without js enabled, disabled I'm a not great 1 in 14k, was 1 in 83k with default IE, 1 in 700 with my regular browser no js using Tor, with js and no Tor, well pretty darn unique...   My question is, if I am using Tor with javascript disabled, and something like ""self destructing cookies"" am I at significantly more risk? Another side to this is, how much benefit is there to regular browsing hiding ones location? with the slew of addons I have installed (checking it against things like browserspy.dk) it really seems like the main bit of ongoing information ""leakage"" left is my location, which coupled with my language does make me a bit unique but as I have cookies (LSOs included) regularly deleted) js disabled etc. that doesn't seem as ""trackable"".

401,Tails: Separation of different identities within the same session,"On the Tails webpage, the users are warned that different identities are not separated ""magically"" within the same Tails session. It is recommended to shutdown and reboot Tails before using a different identity.  Does this also apply to the TorBrowser shipped with Tails?    In the latest version of Tails, the TorBrowser contains the ""New Identity"" feature of Torbutton. By clicking ""New Identity"" on the green onion in the tool bar of TorBrowser, a new TorBrowser session is generated. As far as I understand, the TorBrowser in Tails behaves the same way as the stand-alone TorBrowser does with regard to session separation.  Do I really need to shutdown and reboot Tails to separate different browsing sessions and thus, identities? Or is it sufficient to use the ""New Identity"" feature of Torbutton to separate different browsing sessions/identities?  (Remember: I do NOT mean the ""New Identity"" feature of Vidalia!) "

Therefore I am considering the use of the FoxyProxy plugin to the Tor Browser Bundle. (Yes, I know I actually should not use browser add-ons.)  Yet, I am highly suspicious that FoxyProxy will screw up my anonymity.  I am afraid that it will route all traffic directly through the proxy, bypassing the Tor network altogether. (Changing the default 127.0.0.1 to X.X.X.X | FoxyProxy not being able to chain proxies.)  Are my fears justified or can I safely use FoxyProxy? "
404,Most common TOR browser configuration - panopticlick,"Yesterday I put some effort into getting the best ""score"" I can on Panopticlick. The following is my result:    I did several things to get the lowest numbers for ""unique in x browsers"".   I looked up what the most common screen resolution is and set my browser to it. It's not the default setting of the TOR browser though. I've tried several user agent strings and it seems an empty string is way better than others. I deactivated WebGL, so that the WebGL canvas thing cannot be used. I got an addon to block HTML5 canvas and that asks me whenever someone tries to use HTML5 canvas on a site - shocking how often that is! But when I use it consequently on panopticlick, the test stops working at the last step, not letting me see the results, so that is not included in the screenshots. (Is there a better way to test my ""uniqueness"" somewhere?) I can deactivate the JS, but then I'd not see the information about all the things, which can be exploited when I have JS on, so that's also not in the screenshot.   However, despite all this effort, it seems I am still unique in 145k browsers. If I am still a unique profile, then all the confusion created by the TOR network is for naught, if someone really wanted to track me. If I multiply those ""unique in x browsers"" numbers together, I'd get the combined ""uniqueness"" when someone considers really all of the listed things there. The number is still sooooo high, I am still far from a not unique fingerprint. Now the question is:  Can I still improve this? If so, how?  And for everyone else I hope you have use for this configuration and that it helps you. "
405,Open ports in Tor Browser vs other browsers,"I checked for open ports using GRC Shields Up website, obtaining a perfect stealth score on the following platforms and browsers (latest version of each one up to 06/06/2016):   Windows 7: IE, Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Dev Edition, Opera, Opera Beta, Comodo Dragon, Ice Dragon, Chromodo, Vivaldi, Pale Moon, Torch. They all also passed the Reverse DNS test. Also the DNS leak test always worked properly with fine results. iOs 7.1.2: Safari and Chrome. No port responded but Reverse DNS failed. Android 4.4.2: Firefox. Same as iOs.   Then I tried to use GRC tests on Tor Browser on Windows 7 with active and configured Windows Firewall and Comodo Firewall. As a result I got a failed Reverse DNS test (which of course did not point to my ISP) and for the ports test it says that port 80 and port 443 are open. Also DNS leak test did not work.  My question is: why on every browser and system i checked, my ports are always stealth and non responsive but when i check Tor, 2 of them are plain open? Is it normal? Is it some kind of vulnerability? Does it vary depending on the exit node configuration and can i do or should do something about that? "

407,Does Tor latency leak location information?,"This might be a general question about any anonymizing service, but I'm new here and curious about, but not super familiar with, Tor.  Suppose there's a service that engages in some handshake with clients that takes the form of a 'call-and-response'. (The client has to make some decision in response to content at an application level. )  They also have some data stored with the service, so they need to authenticate. So later sessions can be compared against this one.   It seems like the service should get a full round trip time for packets, all the way back to the source, along with a reasonable location for the exit node (they can traceroute to that point).  Latency can be impacted by so many other factors, (including tor routing) so it's definitely noisy data, but the more a person visits, each time from a different tor node, can't the service do a clustering analysis to get a gradually improving picture of the person's physical location?  Is there something that prevents this gradual acquisition of data? "
408,What would happen when multiple servers are having the same onion hostname?,"I'm concern about uniqueness of the onion sites in terms of finding the right onion hostname and publishing it. How I can be guaranteed that my onion site will be the only one in Tor network with the same address?  So I'm not sure if it's possible, but since there is the same script used by everybody (scallion) to generate onion hostname for certain pattern, like mytextxyz and multiple people are looking for same pattern, isn't they end up with the exactly same private key (or pattern)?  Or another possibility can include copying the private key, then what happens when few independent servers running the website with the same private key?  For example when somebody finds the private key for the same pattern like facebookcorewwwi.onion (which is nearly impossible, but somehow they manage to find the pattern which they wanted, so hypothetically we can assume it can be possible) and publishes the fake site for phishing attacks (or multiple of them in different countries with the same copied key for a better results). Which website users will be seeing? The official, or the fake once? "
409,Why do Tor hidden service operators bother with SSL/TLS encryption?,"Tor hidden services have an asymmetric key pair. That seems like it ought to do the job of authenticating the server and securing the connection to the client. When Tor clients reach out to normal servers, the final traffic passes through the exit node, so it makes sense to use application-level encryption there. But hidden service traffic stays entirely inside the Tor network, where encryption can be used the whole way, presumably. But occasionally, you see a .onion using HTTPS.  What is the purpose of using HTTPS for darknet web sites? Does it provide any security benefits for the server or client, or is it completely pointless? "
410,How quickly could my Tor hidden service be deanonymized if I run it on the same machine as a relay?,"Suppose I'm already running a Tor relay, and I want to run a hidden service for a little while. I know it's bad to run both on the same Internet connection (because of timing attacks), but it would be really convenient, and I'm not going to keep the hidden service around all that long.  How long could I safely run my hidden service there? That is, how long - roughly - would it take for someone to deanonymize the service if I ran it on the same machine as a relay? "
411,How do I make sure my Tor hidden service gets trustworthy entry guards?,"The Tor site's page about hidden service communication mentions that a given hidden service will always use the same set of entry guards:     At this point it is of special importance that the hidden service sticks to the same set of entry guards when creating new circuits. Otherwise an attacker could run his own relay and force a hidden service to create an arbitrary number of circuits in the hope that the corrupt relay is picked as entry node and he learns the hidden server's IP address via timing analysis.   The hidden service configuration instructions don't say very much about how a service's entry guards are selected:     Now that you've restarted Tor, it is busy picking introduction points in the Tor network, and generating a hidden service descriptor. This is a signed list of introduction points along with the service's full public key.   How does the hidden service host avoid picking a ""corrupt relay"" as one of its permanent entry guards? What do I need to do to make sure that the guards I use are trustworthy? "

415,Could someone hack a tails device based on the firmware in it?,"Could someone hack a tails device based on the firmware in it?  I am aware that there is firmware on devices that tails can be installed on. In new laptops this firmware may connect directly to a sever. This connection will not go through tor.   Signs that you laptop may have firmware I am talking about are the presents of PXE booting options, firmware update able laptops, Pre OS networking etc.   Also there are laptops with Intel and AMD management engines. I think this management engine means that it can connect to the Internet   directly.   According to the libreboot website.  [website]It states.  “CPU microcode #firmware-cpu Implements an instruction set. See #microcode for a brief description. Here we mean microcode built in to the CPU. We are not talking about the updates supplied by the boot firmware (libreboot does not include microcode updates, and only supports systems that will work without it) Microcode can be very powerful. No proof that it's malicious, but it could theoretically  There isn't really a way to solve this, unless you use a CPU which does not have microcode. (ARM CPUs don't, but most ARM systems require blobs for the graphics hardware at present, and typically have other things like soldered wifi which might require blobs)  CPUs often on modern systems have a processor inside it for things like power management. ARM for example, has lots of these.”  I am aware that this firmware can be used to monitor your computer and in some cases may be able to even monitor your activity.  So my question is can some one hack a tails device based on this leaking firmware? "

I have used Tor only for Facebook since 1/1/15 when terms and conditions allowed them to spy into devices used to log into Facebook. At some stage Facebook kept blocking me from entry and then my use of core onion solved that. However the past 3 days I can log into fb BUT I can not post directly on my personal page OR any of the pages or groups I admin in. I can only share to them. I am unable to edit any of my shared posts to those pages once I have posted them either. Any attempt to do so immediately crashes TOR and it closes. However I can like, comment and edit on any and all other posts that are not under my admin control. I keep getting crashes and Tor Browser closing after I have moved through several pages on reloads. The only time it doesn't crash is if I stay on the home page so long as I don't try to post a status. I have checked for Tor updates and it says I have the latest. Does anyone know why this might be happening?? BTW I am not an IT whiz by any means of the imagination, so hope someone can simplify the answer if there is one.

420,Is this a security flaw?,"Now, this seems almost too obvious, so I assume I must be missing something, but I figure I should run it by the experts first to see.  Hypothetical scenario: At 5:18pm, a user using the Tor network logs on and posts something on WikiLeaks (or some other site wherein anonymity would best be maintained in the interest of self preservation).  Lets say the data leaves country x, bounces off county a to country b to country c, finally arriving at server y in country y.  If regime x really wanted to seek prosecution of whomever contacted server y, wouldn't be as simple as contacting country y and using diplomatic connections to find out the ip of the server in country c which contacted the server y at exactly 5:18pm, contact country c to find out who contacted server c in country b, contact country b and find out who contacted server b in country a, then finally contacting country a to find out who contacted server a in country x? This of course would give them little trouble hunting down server x (you).  x => a => b => c => y   get ip of c by looking in y's logs at precisely 5:18 and some milliseconds get ip of b by looking in c's logs  at precisely 5:18 and some milliseconds get ip of a by looking in b's logs kick in your door once they realized your ip contacted server a at exactly 5:18   It should be mentioned, that county x would begin the investigation if the data sent to server y directly involved it. but if the data did hurt country x, then it's not a far cry to assume that they would begin an investigation  Of course this whole thought experiment relies on the idea that countries y,c,b, and a would all be diplomatically friendly with country x, but if its a life and death scenario should we really be relying on one countries inability to communicate with another???   Please tell me I'm missing something!?!?!?! "

423,How do you get legit relay bandwidth ballpark figures?,"I'm using STEM.  I'm trying to create custom circuits based on relay information but I'm unable to get reliable relay information.  RouterStatusEntryV3.measured which appears to be the heuristic I want is only present in votes, don't know what good that does.

424,is the use of both introduction points and rendezvous points redundant?,"   One of the reasons for not using the introduction circuit for actuall communication is that no single relay should apppear to be responsible for a given hidden service. This is why rendezvous points never learns about the hidden services identity.   from [website]This doesn't make sense to me since the location of the different introductory points is published to distributed databases. So naturally, won't said introductory points become tied to the hidden service regardless? Furthermore, if this was such a great concern, couldn't the hidden service simply change its introduction points periodically? Lastly, presumably the circuits that lead from the hidden service to the introductory point must not be static, since there's only a finite amount of relays that can fit the bill to make this possible (stable/high uptime), so if the circuits leading to the introductory point are constantly changing, doesn't that itself hide the hidden service's identity as well as the use of rendezvous point does?

428,How do overlay network nodes communicate without IP addresses?,"I've been reading about how Tor and I2P use cryptographic addresses to send messages to other nodes, but how does this work?  I looked through the documentation for each and neither is very clear on this.  For two machines to communicate, you ultimately need the IP addresses at some level, right?  EDIT: Removing my second question as it is unrelated to my original.  What I'm getting at is: if these anonymous networks are overlays built on top of the existing internet infrastructure, then they must be using TCP/IP protocols for nodes to communicate, right?  So do these cryptographic addresses somehow translate to IP addresses?  I'm not really looking for a Tor-specific or I2P-specific answer, just a general answer on how this works in overlay networks.  I don't understand when the Tor/I2P documentation mentions that nodes communicate without knowledge of the others' IP addresses, only knowledge of their cryptographic address. "
429,Why are all circuits now local?,"I am using Tor Browser 4.5.3 and I have noticed that recently all the circuits created by Tor are geographically local.

431,Why do relays not end idle TCP sessions?,"I'm running a relay on a 1Gbps connection. However, my relay averages around 3Mbps up/down each after several months. After substantial investigation, I found the cause: my relay sets up TCP sessions with clients and other relays, and NEVER closes them (it simply waits 24 hours for them to expire). I quickly hit my router's NAT session limit and can't build any more circuits. At any given time 99% of my connections are using zero bandwidth, and I can't build more connections because of my router's limitation.  Is this a design decision in tor that has some security properties? It just seems extremely inefficient, like mallocing all your memory and never freeing it, why not end sessions that have not been used in an operator configurable amount of time, e.g. 30 minutes.  The only downside I see is that clients who idle for a very long time (AFK? not recommended using tor!) may have an extra second of load time inbetween idle periods. But by definition, this wouldn't affect people who are actually using tor.  On the upside, it would allow some relay operators (like myself) to increase their bandwidth by factors of hundreds. "
432,Can a tor hidden service be successfully attacked via (D)DoS?,"I'm planning on creating a tor hidden service(in the context of a research project) and am wondering how resilient is it against common (D)DoS attacks(i.e. DNS amplification, UDP flood, etc.) given that the real network address of the server is not known to the attacker? Is it possible to limit the number of open connections to the service via tor in order to avoid resource(open sockets/bandwidth) exhaustion?  "
433,Hidden service private key chain,"Can a certificate chain be used for a hidden service's private key? It would be nice to be able to periodically re-sign a public key and upload it to the host. This would mean that in the case of the private key on the host being compromised, it is only valid for a short amount of time, due to the manual reauthorization process.  I'm not sure of the correct terminology to use, so I'll try to explain it with some examples and my reasoning behind wanting this:   Host: I am ONION_ADDRESS, my public key is HOST_PUBLIC_KEY. HSDir: I don't trust that public key. Host: Here is the signature from root key ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY: SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY.   Depending on whether the signature has expired:   HSDir: ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY is valid, and that signature is valid. Go ahead.   or   HSDir: ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY is valid, but that signature has expired. Goodbye.   The ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY is stored on a machine under physical control of the hidden service operator. The remote host is considered the weakest point. Should the remote host be compromised, all that can be obtained is HOST_PRIVATE_KEY (and of course HOST_PUBLIC_KEY), and the SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY. Due to the signature being created with an expiry date, the adversary can only masquerade as the hidden service for as long as SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY remains valid. Should the hidden service operator become aware of the host becoming compromised, he would not renew the signature. Once the SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY expires, due to the absence of a renewed signature, HOST_PUBLIC_KEY will not be trusted, resulting in the adversary's loss of control of the hidden service.  The purpose of this is to limit the impact which a compromise would have. Further, once SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY expires, the hidden service operator can regain exclusive control of the .onion address &ndash; it would not be necessary for a new .onion to be created.  Are there currently any methods (or any planned methods) which would allow for the host to be given partial/temporary authority to serve as the hidden service?

437,First Circuit Server Constant (New Identity),"No matter what I am trying, I can't change the first server in the circuit. Neither ""New Identity"" nor ""New Circuit"" or closing the browser will change it. I tried two different tor instances from different (verified) downloads. While the first server (IP) is different, I can't force it to change there either.  Am I wrong or does this seem to be a bad bad bug? I mean the first server is the instance which knows the clients real IP (thus, in connection with the third, it will be possible do identify the client). Shouldn't this server change frequently too?  Edit: I am using the current (4.5.3) version of the TBB and it is the first time I noticed it.

I assume that would provide the benefits of both operating systems? Im not sure.

I have my gateway planned and almost setup but I do not have my workstation setup.  (also as a side note, when referring to Tor -> Tails over Tails -> Tor for security, does that mean run Tails as a live CD and use Tor browser or use vidalia and Tails in a vm?

451,Running a Tor (non-exit) relay behind university firewall,"I have a personal laptop connected to a university connection, and reach the Internet through a proxy server. I have configured Tor to use only HTTP/HTTPS (since the firewall seems to reject all other connections as far as I'm aware).   Is it possible to run a non-exit relay under these circumstances? Is it possible for the network administrator to notice that I'm running a Tor relay? I understand that with deep packet inspection it's possible, but if they're just monitoring logs etc. can they figure it out?   I'm only asking because the admin has proven themselves to take very, very unkindly to any ""hacking"" that they see on the network, and using Tor is definitely in violation of the rules. "

456,How can Facebook's Tor Onion be constantly accessible with the massive bandwidth demand?,"Background: (you can skip if you already know the details of Facebook's Hidden Service) In 2014, Facebook unveiled their Tor Hidden Service that let people from restricting governments access Facebook freely (because Facebook was being blocked in many key countries).  Tor is a networking protocol that routes any TCP traffic through 3 random servers (that are voluntarily run by any individual so that it remains decentralized) in layers of encryption, slowly stripped down until the exit node, where all Tor-based encryption is finally stripped by the node and sent on to it's destination, which sends data back through the circuit in reverse. This is what most people use Tor for, however there is another (apparently not very well known) feature called Hidden Services.  A Tor Hidden Service (I call them Onion Services, Tor Onions, or just Onions) is, in a nutshell, a computer that is running the Tor software with certain configurations enabled that allow them to run a Hidden Service (which is as easy as un-commenting 2 lines in the centralized configuration file). This ""opens up"" virtual ports in a virtual firewall that allow anyone with a certain address (a 16-character string of random numbers and letters ending in .onion, calculated by the hash of the Onion Service's public RSA key) to connect to the service anonymously, being routed instead through 6 Tor nodes and meeting in the middle, called a rendezvous (where the connection never actually leaves the Tor network and is truly end-to-end encrypted). This makes it so that the Onion Service knows nothing of the user's location, and the user knows nothing of the Onion's location. For anybody in between, it's practically impossible to detect the location or even interaction of either the user or the Onion service.  The user is able to find the Hidden Service by using the address in the distributed hash table, hosted by Tor Nodes who elect to host them by enabling an ""HSDir"" flag, because the Hidden Service published a ""descriptor,"" a small file that includes very basic information (the Onion's public key, and a bit of signed data that includes very important information [what this question is really about]: introductory nodes). The introductory node is a very important node (an Onion service chooses 3 of them) that is the only node that is in between all traffic that flows between Tor users and the Tor Hidden Service. It is the node that ""introduces"" the Hidden Service to the network.  Okay now to the actual question  There have been known attacks that can temporarily take down Hidden Services, namely one where any Tor node can set itself up to be a Hidden Service's introductory point at a given time. From there, they can deny all traffic that goes to the Hidden Service, effectively taking it offline.  Now the internet is filled with crappy people. That being said, why don't people do this to big-name Onions constantly, like Facebook? Or even why don't the governments attempting to block Facebook in their country attempt to take down these measly 3 nodes that control the entire connection to Facebook through Tor?  Okay okay, assuming that this is just because people like facebook and don't want to disrupt it, why isn't this happening with other hidden services, like The Pirate Bay, or The Imperial Library of Trantor? Are there safeguards against this attack of which I'm unaware of?  Assuming that there are safeguards against it that popular Onion Services use, there are still only 3 nodes that control the entire connection to a service, and Tor is known for being extremely low-bandwidth. So how can only 3 (randomly selected) introductory nodes support the massive bandwidth going towards Facebook's Onion?  I mean, the only reason Facebook made this available was so that people from other countries could access Facebook, so there is an entire country-worth of people going through only 3 weakly-connected nodes. How can facebookcorewwwi.onion possibly be constantly available and fast?  --EDIT-- Apparently I was mistaken; there is no attack that allows a Tor node to place itself in a position allowing itself to become the introductory node of a Hidden Service. I was thinking of a similar attack on Hidden Service Directories instead. This could still have an effect on the uptime of a Hidden Service, as the HSDir could refuse to serve the descriptor, but with the use of a program such as OnionBalancer, this becomes increasingly difficult as more HSDir nodes hold the descriptor. Thank you for this information, canonizing ironize. "

469,Why would an .onion have different URLs for different users?,"I was recently invited to join a hidden bulletin board. In the note that was sent to me about it, the sender specified that the URL given to me was unique to me. A friend from Reddit was sent the same invitation bearing a different URL, unique to them, obviously.  Both URLs resolve to the same site, an innocuous phpBB install. I logged in and it seems to be a functioning phpBB site with different levels of access and nearly all posts blocked from new registrations but there's a few things I've noticed that send up red flags. It leads me to believe that this is some kind of elaborate phishing scam or some byzantine means of installing malware.  The thing is, registration only ever asked for a username and password that I don't use anywhere else on the internet. They were specific about this. I was never prompted for any further info that might identify me or be used in a way that could access other accounts linked to me. I've looked over the client-side source code and there's nothing obvious in there nor do I know of any malicious PHP.  But no one ever seems to be logged into the site. Post view counts never seem to increase. It's like I'm alone on this board and I'm trying to figure out its angle, if it even has one. Why would the URL be unique to me?

The few questions here seem to have people saying not to worry about it, and one had a technical problem of their time being off.  I normally keep my browsers open for lengthy periods of time with many tabs and only close/restart them when I run into problems.  Is that bad practice for tbb?  Will that cause problems?  Are there security, anonymity, or privacy concerns that I should be aware of?

I had to compare this to my default Firefox install and reset NoScript to actually be useful and actually block scripts by default.  Is there a reason(s) for NoScript being configured the way it is for tbb?  I did a quick search but didn't find explanation(s), though I do find plenty of instructions on how to make NoScript ""more secure"" by essentially turning it on.  I first started with a version 4.x of tbb, though I don't recall the version.  I think I've been using tbb for 3 or 4 versions now.  Edit:  I found this question: Noscript and latest TBB (v3.6.4) — recommended modifications to default settings?, but there's not much in the way of technical data.  At least part of the reason NoScript acts different is that tbb runs in FIrefox's private mode, so you have to go into NoScript and enable the permanent allow option if you want to permanently allow scripts on certain sites.  Those few settings make it harder to use tbb as your daily driver browser IMO. "
482,"Can tor nodes (entry, exit, others) store IPs?","I'm a new Tor user. And I want to ensure several questions.    Can ""entry point"" router store my IP? Can ""middle relay"" store ""entry point"" IP? Can ""exit point"" router store ""middle relay"" IP?   I think yes. And the tor routers can be configured (hacked) to store IP and target server information. So when all points belongs to one owner (eg. network provider, NSA, etd.) then he can know what page I want to see and from which IP. Correct?  I understand, that they cannot see the content due to HTTPS.  This is anonymity problem. So how is this ""secured"" in tor system. Do I have to believe that tor routers doesn't store and share this information? But ""believe"" is not secure enough. "
483,"How to assign new identity when using the ""advanced"" version?","So how do I do this in MacOS Yosemite and Windows 7 ?  In the previous windows releases Tor wasn't running in the background so I could just close the app and run it again. But in the new version when I start the app it stays in the background and I only see it in Task Manager.  Same happens in MacOS, it's only visible in the terminal if I use ""ps"". Is ""killing"" it the only way? "
484,"All Tor nodes showing LOCATION as ""Baghdad (Iraq) and Dhaka (Bangladesh) in Facebook","All Tor nodes showing LOCATION as Baghdad (Iraq) and Dhaka (Bangladesh) in Facebook.  For the last 5 days, I have tried all the Tor nodes to log into Facebook to see if there was some kind of leakage of real IP while using Facebook and I found that the Facebook's settings>security tab is showing only two locations:    Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Baghdad (Iraq).   What is the real cause of this?  Another issue is that when we use proxies for simple (non-anonymous) surfing, one website with name ""isisxxxx..."" automatically tries to connect to the proxy server. (Note: ISIS is the terrorist organization which is eliminating the citizens of Iraq)  Is it all due to the Iraq War due to which USA is monitoring every traffic on Tor node, or Facebook supplying data of Tor users to NSA/USA by firstly sending the data to some location of Baghdad (Iraq) and Dhaka (B'desh)? It may be a trick being used by Facebook to separate our material/posts by categorizing by location. "
485,Hidden .onion service with 2048 bit (or 4096 bit) RSA private key -- how to host it?,"2048 bit RSA is proven to be more secure than 1024 bit, so with the help of Scallion I have generated a pair of hidden service hostname + 2048 bit private key for it (there were 1024b 2048b and 4096b options, I decided to choose the middle)  Now, I am trying to launch the hidden service, but some unknown reasons Tor is giving lots of errors. It looks like Tor is trying to interpret my 2048 bit RSA private key as 1024 bit RSA key, and as result fails  Do you know, how to enable ""2048-bit private key mode"" of Tor hidden service hosting? If yes, how? And is it possible? (although I am sure it is, because I noticed there were debates about implementing 2048-bit RSA support at 2011 year, probably since much time have passed this feature is already there) "
486,What is the best way to hide Tor usage?,I'm looking for the best way to hide Tor usage. Because Tor is banned where I want to use it.  What is the best way to hide Tor?  I've found this web-proxy:   [website]I know about socks5 proxy and proxychain. Is it still the best way? What about VPN after Tor ? Is it as bad as torrent ?  
487,Multi-VPN hopping Advantages/Disadvantages over Tor,"I was told that using Tor and/or a VPN is always a tradeoff of privacy and anonymity. I'm wonder what combination of Tor, VPNs (paid or free), and proxies can help minimize this risk.  For example, if you use ISP -> VPN -> Tor, your ISP won't know you're using Tor, and your VPN provider won't know what your traffic is (encrypted), only that it's going into Tor network. However, the Tor exit node will see all your traffic in plain-text, depending on HTTPS use, and if that's really a secure option you should trust.  So, I'm wondering, would it be better to do ISP -> VPN -> Tor -> VPN to hide traffic from the Tor exit node? Does that gain you anything, or expose you in anyway? Basically with the first VPN you can hide your Tor usage from your ISP, with Tor you gain anonymity, and with the second VPN you hide your data from the Tor exit node.  But does this have any advantage over just using a second VPN? For example: ISP -> VPN -> VPN. It seems like your first VPN would hide your origin from the second, and the second would hide your data from the first.   How can I hide my plain-text data from a Tor exit node?  (Is HTTPS alone an acceptable solution?)  Is using another VPN an acceptable solution? Does this have any advantage over just chain-linking multiple VPNs together?   Bonus points:   What kind of traffic slowdown/overhead will this cause? (anybody's personal experience)  "
488,HSDir selection,"I'm writing some code to play around with and test some hidden service things. I need to be able to emulate hidden service directory selection. HSDirs are calculated by selecting the three closest onion-routers whose identity hash is larger than the hidden service descriptor's descriptor-id, and who also have the HSDir flag.  Which network status document is used to find the HSDirs of a hidden service? Is it correct to use the ""cached-microdesc-consensus""?  Additionally how could you get such a document if it wasn't already cached on your computer from Tor? I found this script, however it requires a file, ``cached-consensus'', that I don't have.  edit The Stem interpreter (which can be accessed using the command tor-prompt) can be used to download consensus documents. For instance with the command: GETINFO ns/all. Additionally, if HSDirs are selected correctly you should be able to check by making the following HTTP GET request:  [website]I have not yet been able to replicate HSDir selection using this data, however. Either the documents aren't the correct ones or there's some nuance to HSDir selection that isn't obvious. "
489,Why some companies are connected with Tor hidden service and they use the same process ID like Tor?,"I installed Tor hidden service, when I use terminal and type netstat -tapln (to see all opened ports) I can see foreign established connection and it is not clear to me is it dangerous or not?  Of course, I can see that mysql port is opened and sshd and so on, it is not problem.  It is strange for me, I see foreign address (to which server is connected) of companies that have nothing to do with server located in Asia. But all of them use the same process ID (PID) 12973.  One established connection is of course my IP because I use terminal to access server.  Second established connection is french IP.  Third established connection is one web hosting company in Germany.  Forth established connection is one company from the US. Their Global Internet Backbone provides IP Transit.   It is strange that 127.0.0.1:9050 is used by Tor and its PID is 12973/tor, all this companies have the same PID, for example like this:  IPAddress:9001 ESTABLISHED 12973/Tor  It means if I kill PID 12973 I will kill Tor, not only these companies. So, why Tor has the same PID like companies from Europe and USA that are connected with server? Server is located in Asia.  Is it some Tor directory authority or descriptor or anything similar?  If it is so, can I choose to which Tor descriptor/authority server will connect? Where to find list of them, to choose whom I want?  The most important point: can these companies snitch Tor server? If server traffic goes through them, it would be logical they can snitch traffic.  I suppose if I restart Tor, other companies will be connected with server? or not? I don't want to do it now because my client is changing his website but I can ask here. "
490,RDP over Tor - safe?,"I am considering using remote desktop protocol(RDP) over Tor, to circumvent my country's blockade of RDP and also get the most of anonymity.   I just tested a RDP connection with proxy chains remmina. (Proxy chains configured to avoid DNS leaks and resolve DNS requests via Tor instead.)  While everything was working fine technically and surprisingly the response times were quite acceptable - Vidalia warned me that the RDP connection might leak my position.  So, could you tell me how real this risk to my anonymity actually is? Should I better avoid using RDP over Tor? May there be any way to make it safe in this case? "
491,"How does it work - ""Hidden services""?","Could somebody describe to me, like for Nooo-oo-ob, from the Start and to the complete End.  My questions are:   I've setup HS.  My Tor client connect to the rendezvous. Is it populate full onion domain for rendezvous?  Nextly, I open browser on another station with another Tor instance and enter my onion domain. How my browser's Tor instance find my HS's instance, if nobody know its name?  Is there broadcast to all rendezvous? Can it be eavesdropped?    Could somebody explain step-by-step?  Why nobody can extract all onion domains from Tor network?   Can rendezvous relay extract onion domains that it keeps?  P.S. I can't split my question into parts, because it is about only one thing. "
492,Tor traffic capture,"How possible is it to capture and then analyse Tor traffic to/from your local machine (i.e., using wireshark)? I'm interested in more than just website requests / responses;  I want to capture all traffic, including things such as circuit creation cells and descriptor publishing.  My attempts to do this so far have failed because I wasn't able to decrypt captured traffic. It should be possible to decrypt the traffic, however, I need a copy of all public/private keypairs used for all encryption on the local machine.  Alternatively is there a good website where these sorts of captures or examples are available for download? "
493,Hide VPN money trail?,"Not sure if this will be considered on-topic for the Tor board.   If not, feel free to yell at me.  But I think it belongs, as the spirit and the essence of this question is at the center of what Tor is all about.  I think I screwed myself by purchasing a VPN with my credit card.   This was right after I heard about the NSA thing. I was scared.  Come to find out, the general consensus for remaining anonymous online is to avoid VPN's, or wash your money trail if you do use them.  So now I'm curious, how do you wash your money trail before buying a VPN? (if you decide to use one)  I'm assuming Bitcoin?  I am partially happy with my VPN service thus far, and will probably buy another year of service after this one's up. (with a new account and a clean cash source, of course!) "
494,Are there any good hosting-providers for hidden services?,Are there any hosting-companies that provides (possibly exclusively) hosting for Tor hidden services sites?  Or is my only option to set something up myself on a computer I own or rent? 
495,Few questions about connecting to Tor hidden services,"I am hoping some one can help expand my knowledge on how a user connects to a hidden service, I have read the specification, but have found it confusing and still have some questions.   Sorry if any seem silly just trying to make sure I completely understand how it works.  Firstly how do you know what hidden services are available, is there a list such as the consensus or is it dependent on knowing about the hidden service you wish to connect to?  Say for example I wish to connect to a completely legitimate service such as the hidden wiki, how do I go about finding out the z.onion:port address for this service, or does this once again require me to pre-know this?  How are the descriptors for the service retrieved?  Is there a specific rendezvous point needed for each service or is it simply any node that supports this feature?  How will I know what the introduction point has been chosen by the service which they want me to connect to?  And finally what information is sent to the introduction point to tell it about the rendezvous circuit?  Sorry for all the questions but it would be a great help if someone can help me answer these so I can further understand hidden services. "
496,Communicating through Tor using Python,"Are there any libraries that make it easier to do networking in Python using Tor? I'd like to be able to write IRC bots/clients and possibly use other networks, so none of the HTTP libraries which have you set a proxy server would work, as I need access to more than just HTTP.  The best solution for me would be a library which allows me to do pretty much direct socket programming in Python, only it redirects things through the Tor network.  Does something like this exist?  The next best thing would be a library for SOCKS5 communication, but I couldn't find anything like that either.  I should also note that I've come across socksipy, but that project seems to have been abandoned, so I'm not sure if I should be using it.  Does anyone know the status of the project or if it's okay to use? "
497,Only HTTPS connections allowed,"For whatever reason I can only use HTTPS connection to the internet, regardless of the browser.  I'm using Mac Mini with Mountain Lion 10.8. The problem occurs when TorBrowserBundle is not running, using Safari or Firefox. Maybe Tor is completely innocent, but it's the one that comes to my mind when thinking about secure connections. I just don't know where else to dig deeper.  Is there a possibility that Tor changes network connections to 'HTTPS only' and forgets to reset before closing it?  Is there any other way to reject HTTP connections?   "
498,Retrieving hidden service descriptors,"just wondering if anyone can shed a lil light on this,   basically i am wondering what processes must be followed to allow alice to retrieve the descriptors for bobs hidden service, what packets are needed to be sent for this, and what is the structure of these packets as i can not find this information in the spec.  i understand Alice's OP opens a stream to a directory server via Tor, and makes an HTTP GET request for the document '/tor/rendezvous/', where '' is replaced with the encoding of Bob's  public key as described above. but what is the structure of this packet  edit i have looked again at the document and think i have found the structure however it states this is for bob and not alice so am a lil unsure if correct :   KL    Key length                            [2 octets]  PK    Bob's public key                      [KL octets]  TS    A timestamp                           [4 octets]  NI    Number of introduction points         [2 octets]  Ipt   A list of NUL-terminated ORs          [variable]  SIG   Signature of above fields             [variable]   is this the packet required to be sent to an HSDir node, what will this packet need to be sent in, I.e. a relay packet ? and could some one explain what the last three items in packet are mainly NI and Ipt, and what values these should be  and what information will i receive back and what structure will this be in ?  Thanks guys "

502,Voted and applied relay flags,"I've set up a exit, according to consensus-health.torproject.org it got voted Fast and Exit (I guess Flags shown as RED means that they were voted?).  I was monitoring the relay with arm and realized that my Connections tab was only showing Inbound/Outbound connections and no Exit. So, I checked consensus-health again and the flags were not applied yet (voted 24hrs ago).  Is it normal that it takes that long for flags to be applied? I've read 'lifecycle of a new relay' and according to it, it's also normal that your relay gets roughly no use in the first 3 days. I was concerned at first because my Advertised Bandwidth was only around 140kb/s -- but I've set no limits and according to the ISP it's 100mbit/s unmetered. I dont think they are throttling, but I will keep an eye on that after the 0-3 day timeframe anyways. "
503,Is it possible to have more than one server hosting the same Tor Hidden Service?,"If I ran a Tor Hidden Service on a server, would it be possible to mirror it on one or more other servers, and use the same onion-address for all?  I was thinking having the mirror(s) periodically checking the main server, and then start-up it's own Tor-service and http-daemon if it couldn't connect to the main-server for several tries.  What I'm really asking, is if it's possible to have several servers reveiling hidden services with exactly the same onion-address?    If it's possible, what would I have to copy from the main-server to the mirrors?  Some config-file for Tor?  The main-servers host-keys? "

515,How to block local ports and get a working Tor version,"I've been trying to block torrent downloading on a mac computer using WaterRoof. I create rules that block ports 1025-65535 except 9150 which is the Tor control port, If I'm correct, but Tor Browser opens say either that Tor unexpectedly crashes or that it could not connect to Tor control port. I used the activity monitor to see which port it's trying to use and most of the times it says something like this localhost:50172 localhost:9150. Why is Tor reaching to other ports first and then 9150? I even selected ports 80,440 as the only ports that my firewall allows but nothing. Can anyone help me?  Update: I fixed the issue. It turns out that I selected IP as protocol when I was making the rule in WaterRoof. I chose UDP and now Tor is working fine. Weird thing though is that I cannot connect to the Internet from normal web browsers. I tested the rule on my Macbook but no problems there. Any thoughts on this? "
516,Setting up Tor for use with stem,"I frequently use either Tor Browser or Tails. Now I would like to do something entirely different and want to use stem. The tutorials on that site all presuppose that Tor is installed separately from the Tor Browser but I'm having trouble finding the documentation about the best way to install and configure Tor as a stand-alone. Nor, to my surprise, did I find any question addressing the point here (perhaps I searched for the wrong thing). But, hence the questions ...   What should I be reading? If I use the synaptic package manager to install Tor in, say, Linux Mint, will I get the most recent stable version of Tor? When I installed Tor (briefly) some years ago through the synaptic manager, it immediately started Tor and set it running at log-in time, which I did not want. Is that still the case, and how can I avoid it?   I would appreciate any advice. "
517,Can technicians track my computer which has an image on it if I use Tor?,"My laptop is imaged on a school network, which allows the technicians to remotely connect to it, locate it and track what I'm doing if I'm connected to their network, if I use Tor at home (or any different network), can they track what I've been doing on my computer if I later connect to their network when I use it at school? They can locate my computer even if I'm not on their network because they have data of my computer (such as serial no.) so they can ping it (idk exactly) even if I'm not connected but can they track my activities if I'm not on their network and if I'm using Tor?  Thanks for the answers, however as far as your answers are concerned, you're under the assumption that ""malware"" is installed on my computer to track my activities, I have sent private emails and had private conversations with my friends and these conversations involve trouble that we've been in with the tecnicians themselves, I doubt that there is programs on my computer to track my activites because then they would be able to uncover the real culprit in those situations but they mentioned nothing about it. I know that if they look at my private emails/conversation, it is illegal because they are breaching my privacy so that could've been the reason they did not mention it however the real question is that if I access a site using tor, will there be traces on my computer that I've been on that site?  There must also be a limit in terms of what programs they can install on my computer, as one of you have said, they can see and track every single one of my actions, that would be an invasion of my privacy which would be illegal because they don't have legal rights to see emails I've been sending because they're confidental or when I use IM "

520,What are Whonix system requirements?,"Hello my name is Gregory. I would like to ask a few questions about running Whonix on a notebook computer.  What would be an ideal notebook/specs for running   Linux Host VirtualBox Whonix (both VMs in VirtualBox) VPN client on host   There has been alot of talk about Intel hardware having a backdoor in it. Obviously we can neither confirm/deny this information as we don't have access to it, we only have speculation but logically newer hardware would more likely have it since, unfortunately, we are going downhill when it comes to freedom and privacy.  So what would be an ideal notebook that is cheap and can run Whonix and everything on the notebook smoothly without lagging and glitches. We don't need to get specific about models, just specs and most importantly CPU models. RAM is cheap and upgradable so it is irrelevant as it would be 8GB. Would the CPU at least have to be an i3/i5/i7 model or can it be a late model Core 2 Duo? Again this is not a question of what can run this setup, it is what can run this setup very smoothly and without lagging.   mirimir has said in the past that SSDs can compromise FDE so my question goes out to mirimir and everybody else on that. Can SSD compromise FDE and why? "
521,Android Orbot on non rooted android device with Drony,"I'm supporting android proxy Drony that has ability to also use VPN mode  so it can intercept all flow and redirect to proxy that is set in settings.  Recently was added also support for local SOCKS proxies. This includes also Orbot. For now only TCP flow goes to Orbot SOCKS proxy on port 9050.  Reading about Tor I find out that problem is also DNS UDP called as DNS leakage.  So there will be additional change, when Orbot is involved, to redirect UDP DNS requests,  or maybe just all UDP to Orbot?  Question is, there should be also any other additional action performed  that will add protection for user on Android device?  Not meaning changing http requests (removing headers or similar actions), more changes on TCP, UDP packets headers before they hit Orbot proxies. "

525,"I'm running a Tor Relay on my Raspberry Pi, is it safe to use the Raspberry Pi as a proxy for all the machines on the LAN?","Recently I've been reading lots of comments stating it's not safe to use your own Tor Relay as a proxy into the Tor Network, but typically none of these conversations have any evidence to substantiate their claims.  I'd be willing to write it off as FUD, but for something as important as Tor I wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something unnecessarily stupid!  So, my setup is really simple;  I have a Raspberry Pi which is running the Tor Relay and has been doing for the past three or four months without any significant problems.  After some reading, I set the following options in my torrc file which I believe restrict access to the proxy only machines on my local network.  Is that right?  ## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address. ## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept ## all (and only) requests that reach a SocksPort. Untrusted users who ## can access your SocksPort may be able to learn about the connections ## you make. SocksListenAddress 192.168.0.34 SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16 SocksPolicy reject *   So for every device or application on my LAN that needs access to the Tor Network, I just point them all to the SOCKS5 Proxy running on the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi's IP address is 192.168.0.34, so I point every device to: 192.168.0.34:9050.  So, are there any major security implications that could lower my anonymity using my setup? "
526,Which one of the relay nodes need to get compromised for client de-anonymization?,"Tor can't protect against traffic confirmation (also known as end-to-end correlation), where an attacker tries to confirm an hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math. The question is: Is it enough for the adversary to compromise any two of the three nodes to be able to de-anonymize the client?

531,Are individual circuits exposed in inter-relay traffic?,"There are thousands of Tor relays. And so it's arguably impractical for each relay to maintain persistent connections with all of the others, even without padding traffic.  At the other extreme, a given relay would only connect with another when it received a cell that was addressed there. Is this how Tor currently works?  I gather that relays perform no explicit mixing. But, beyond padding to constant cell size, are there steps to obfuscate inter-relay traffic? For example, can obfsproxy be used between relays?  Is the cell structure of individual circuits obvious in inter-relay traffic? To what extent is it obscured through TCP mechanics? "

535,Problem getting Tor exit node from a bash script,"I have been trying to get the IP address of the tor exit node from a bash script.

537,In what ways can private relays be used?,"There are applications where private relays, not listed in public consensus directories, would perhaps be useful. For example, one might use four-relay circuits with private entry guards and exit relays.  In How to create a private exit node?, weasel - Peter Palfrader notes: ""The routing protocol allows for [private exit nodes], but there is no support in Tor or its directory layer for what you ask."" However, I see in the manpage:     PublishServerDescriptor 0|1|v1|v2|v3|bridge,…        This option specifies which descriptors Tor will publish when acting as a relay. You can choose multiple arguments, separated by commas.        If this option is set to 0, Tor will not publish its descriptors to any directories. (This is useful if you’re testing out your server, or if you’re using a Tor controller that handles directory publishing for you.) Otherwise, Tor will publish its descriptors of all type(s) specified. The default is ""1"", which means ""if running as a server, publish the appropriate descriptors to the authorities"".   So if I set PublishServerDescriptor 0 in a relay, it won't appear in any directories, right? But a client can still specify it as an exit, right?  Also, in that case, will information about my relay be forwarded beyond any adjacent relays in circuits specified by clients?  And just to be clear, is it true that none of the considerations discussed in The lifecycle of a new relay apply to unlisted relays?  The entry-guard piece seems trivial: bridges, perhaps obfuscated. But there is some ambiguity. I see in the manpage:     BridgeRelay 0|1        Sets the relay to act as a ""bridge"" with respect to relaying connections from bridge users to the Tor network. It mainly causes Tor to publish a server descriptor to the bridge database, rather than publishing a relay descriptor to the public directory authorities.   So if I set PublishServerDescriptor 0 and BridgeRelay 1 in a relay, will it be usable as a bridge, and yet not appear in any public directory?   For using it as a bridge, I see in the manpage:     Bridge [transport] IP:ORPort [fingerprint]        When set along with UseBridges, instructs Tor to use the relay at ""IP:ORPort"" as a ""bridge"" relaying into the Tor network. If ""fingerprint"" is provided (using the same format as for DirAuthority), we will verify that the relay running at that location has the right fingerprint. We also use fingerprint to look up the bridge descriptor at the bridge authority, if it’s provided and if UpdateBridgesFromAuthority is set too.    If UpdateBridgesFromAuthority is not set, will the Tor client check the fingerprint by directly accessing the bridge, without ""look[ing] up the bridge descriptor at the bridge authority""? In other words, will the client use bridges that aren't in the bridge authority? "
538,Tor - refresh your path every x seconds,Is there a way to refresh your path in Tor every x seconds or minutes without manually doing like pressing new identity?

However, that feature won't really become useful until   we move to a ""directory guard"" design as well.""    What does ""directory guard"" design means in the above quote?

547,"JAP/JonDo uses SocksPort in Tor v0.2.4.23 built from git repo, but not in corresponding binary from Tor Project repo for Ubuntu trusty; why?","I'm exploring the possibility of tunneling JAP/JonDo through Tor, working in Ubuntu 14.04.1 x64 VMs in VirtualBox. The JonDo client has an option to use a SOCKS proxy. JAP/JonDo connects through SocksPort 9050, using the tor-0.2.3.25-1 binary installed using tor_0.2.3.25-1_amd64.deb from the saucy repo.  But the JonDo client does not connect through SocksPort 9050 using Ubuntu binaries for Tor v0.2.4.19 (from Ubuntu 12.04 aka saucy repository), Tor v0.2.4.20 (from Ubuntu 14.04 aka trusty repository), or Tor v0.2.4.23 (latest stable Tor release from Ubuntu Updates for trusty).  However, the JonDo client does connect just fine through SocksPort 9050, using Tor releases tor-0.2.4.20 or tor-0.2.4.23, built in Ubuntu 14.04.1 x64 from the Tor git repo.

549,Tor relay (arm monitor) doesn't seem to follow Tor settings (torrc),"I'm a rookie Tor relay operator but would like to give back to the community. According to the data in the arm-software ([website]I've added the following settings to the top of my file (update 05-aug-2014: please see image at bottom for current torrc):  Nickname myNick ContactInfo myMail ORPort 443 DirPort 80 ExitPolicy reject *:* Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log  RelayBandwidthRate 500 KB RelayBandwidthBurst 2 MB  ControlPort 6051 CookieAuthentication 1   Notice the bandwidth rate set to 500 kb/s (I suppose).  From the arm tool, however, this is what I see:    Notice the measured speeds. The average speeds are way above the speeds I set in the torrc-file, and sometimes I've seen the burst rate exceed 3 mb/s. It is a requirement that the maximum average speed in kb/s is fixed at 500, and that it's working, else I will eventually run dry of bandwidth from my ISP.  Do you have any idea of what went wrong and how to fix it?    Edit: Another fun observation is the highlighted (grey) text in the screenshot:   Bandwidth (limit: 3.9 Mb/s, burst: 16.0 Mb/s, measured: 3.0 Kb/s)   Where does this information come from? I'm not even able to neither download nor upload with 16 Mb/s. I have a measured speed of 111.6/22.5 kbit/s.    Update...  According to the logs in the following screenshot, tor only uses a few hundre kb/s of bandwidth, yet the arm tool reports an average bandwidth of 1 mb/s. This 1 mb/s doesn't add up to the total amount of data send/recieved, though!  Here's the image:      As per request, here is the torrc as seen from within arm (Note: KBytes and MBytes are used in actual file):    Here is a quick look at the current speeds:    When I left it like that it continued to up- and download with 2 mb/s (it is allowed to burst like that) - the top of the graph shown in this image peaked at about 4.5 mb/s. The average speed is still 3 times higher than permitted, however. Maybe the aim of the average speed is per week or even per month based?  "

555,Why does adding a Guard-Exit (EE) node in Tor yield more catch probability than adding a guard and exit node separately?,"The following is the default Tor network in shadow simulator:  Total BW of Guard flagged nodes=258.15 MB/S   Total BW of Middle nodes=23.69 MB/S   Total BW of Exit flagged nodes=13.23 MB/S   Total BW of Guard+Exit flagged nodes=213.4 MB/S     I inserted 40 guard nodes and 40 exit nodes, each of 5 MB/S in above Tor network and performed the simulation.    Following are the bandwidth weights derived from the consensus document when Guard and Exit nodes of 5MB/S are added separately:    Wbd=1454 Wbe=0 Wbg=4882 Wbm=10000 Wdb=10000 Web=10000 Wed=7091 Wee=10000 Weg=7091 Wem=10000 Wgb=10000 Wgd=1454 Wgg=5118 Wgm=5118 Wmb=10000 Wmd=1454 Wme=0 Wmg=4882 Wmm=10000     Next I added 80 Guard-Exit (EE) nodes, each 5MB/S and perform the simulation.    Following are the bandwidth weights derived from the consensus document when EE nodes of 5MB/S are added:    Wbd=4722 Wbe=0 Wbg=0 Wbm=10000 Wdb=10000 Web=10000 Wed=4826 Wee=10000 Weg=4826 Wem=10000 Wgb=10000 Wgd=452 Wgg=10000 Wgm=10000 Wmb=10000 Wmd=4722 Wme=0 Wmg=0 Wmm=10000     I calculated the catch probability (probability that a client chooses my added nodes in guard as well as exit position while making circuit) in both cases and found that the second case yields more probability.

558,What are the dangers of possible Mac OSX backdoor?,"Many people say that Mac OSX has a backdoor in it. It probably does, why wouldn't it? It's closed source therefore it would be stupid for Apple not to put in a special access route.   The question is what implications does this have on anonymity/Tor? Let's say you're running VirtualBox with Whonix with a Mac OS X host, what's the danger in that if,   No important information is stored on the computer The computer is only used for Tor to browse the internet and that's it   Can somebody explain what the dangers are during normal browsing (through Tor)  even if a backdoor is present? Why would an open source host make Whonix and VirtualBox safer? Again, this would obviously be different if actual data is stored on the system and could therefore be looked at or stolen. However browsing is fairly amnesic. I think the problem is that I'm not understanding how a computer can be attacked during just browsing the web through Tor.  "

I already tried to slacken Tor settings a little (unchecked everything except flash in torbutton -> preferences -> security settings) but the problem remains.  Is there anything I can do?  edit:  Somehow, after completing my registration, I was assigned a new username... so, I am the same guy who asked the above question. thanks mirimir for the comment, I was subsequently able to post on ubuntuforums but I suspect it succeeded because I did it only a few seconds after logging in, and not because I visited [website]So the question is: Can I tell Tor to not change nodes randomly? At least until I finish my business on one forum? Or would that be too insecure? "
565,How can I know whether my ISP is limiting Tor on its bandwidth,My question is not a duplicate of this question as in that it is asked only about Tor relay and the user has not given perfect bandwidth allocation of the ISP.  You can normally check whether your ISP is blocking the Torrent download by simply seeing the download speed (which is way less then your real speed i.e. 60Kbps instead of 6Mbps)but how can I check whether Tor is being limited or restricted by the ISP ?  Is there any method to check whether my ISP is really into blocking / limiting my Tor usage (Tor usage may include setting up a relay and/or exit nodes) traffic which is done either through the Tor software or the browser bundle  If at all the ISP is serious in blocking / limiting it's bandwidth  for Tor then what are the steps to be taken to free my self from this limitations? 
566,Does Directory Traffic count towards Consensus Weight?,"When I have a node running, lets say an Entry Guard, that also acts as a Directory Mirror. Will the bandwidth used sending directory information also count towards the consensus weight?  And if so or if not so, what is the reason behind this? "
567,How can I verify my relay is working?,"This is the first time I'm running a relay. Doing it on a raspbian, and I've got some short questions. Be ready: I'm a newb.  I'm only controlling my raspberry via SSH, so no GUIs.  I opened ports on my firewall. /var/log/tor/log tells me there is a successfull circuit, bootstrapped 100%. Good, right? Then there is something that confuses me: [notice] Interrupt: exiting cleanly. I was not expecting this. Does anyone know what it means? Moreover, arm gives only positive output on connectivity related things.  Everytime I open arm it tells me my relay is unresponsive. About 15 seconds later it notices that the relay is resumed. I do see some activity on the traffic graphs. Why is this? Is my relay stopped as soon as i close arm? (I presume not, the tor service and process are still running after). Is there a way to verify traffic is coming in and out, without using arm? arm doesn't show an uptime in it's interface, where it should. Is this related?  Traffic has stopped almost completely after +/- 2 days. This is not what I was expecting after reading the post on torproject blog about traffic amounts from new relays.  What is the use for tor and arm to run as a unique user? Security related reasons? Standard linux stuff?  Extra info: The relay has flags RUnning, V2Dir, Valid  I hope someone takes the time to answer these questions. Thanks in advance!  edit: some tags to this post weren't accepted, so the only tag is arm. "
568,Curious to know How Tor works?,I am very curious to know about Working of Tor. Please tell me how Tor works ? I am using Tor Browser Bundle.  I want to know that is there any other Service/ Software similar to Tor ? 
569,"In generating a new hidden service address, does the tor client check for collision with existing ones?","In generating keys for a new hidden service, and the corresponding .onion address, does the tor client check for collision with existing .onion addresses? The process being so fast, I can't imagine how it could. Or instead, does it rely only on luck, in that the address space (280~1024) is so much greater than the number of published addresses?  Also, how many hidden service addresses have been published? Is it on the order of 107? As I recall, each of those ~106 Mevade slaves created a hidden service, and that's the largest known influx. Yes? I'm guessing that far more have been generated in seeking vanity addresses, but most have never been published. "
570,What IPs will connect to my server running a hidden .onion site?,"If I'm running Tor and a hidden .onion site on my server, which IPs will connect to it? Will it be just 127.0.0.1 or one of the thousands of daily changing exit nodes? Will they connect over a specific port (8080?) or any other kind of behaviour?  I would like to block all traffic with iptables except a few IPs + Tor Traffic. If all Tor traffic comes over 127.0.0.1 or port 8080 I could just white list/allow 127.0.0.1 or port 8080 right? And then block everything else. "
571,Who can know that I am using Tor for browsing?,"I am using Tor browser to browse, and download things. My question is: If I visit a website using Tor browser, then who knows, or who can know, that I am using Tor browser? And what will he get? That is, will he know what websites I browsed using Tor, or only the information that I am using Tor? "
572,It is possible to find a Tor page based on the 512-bit hash?,"On the internet there is unsolved mystery of 3301/Cicada where decrypted text says:     ""AN END.

573,Can I use random IP from ALL exit nodes?,Would it be possible to use random exit node (from 1 bar to 3 bar nodes in Tor network map from vidalia) instead of using the strongest exit node? Would it be possible to do this via torrc or telnet? I need a random IP instead of one of most common ones (best bandwidth). 
574,Can my college proxy access my Tor history?,"To access internet in college, we need to authenticate the IP and MAC address of our machine at a certain college portal. Earlier we used to have to provide proxy authentication every time the browser opened, but they changed it to this recently. However, technically I am still accessing the web using my college proxy(right?). Does the proxy track and log my Tor browser bundle history? "
575,What happens if I enable scripts globally in Tor browser?,"In Tor browser bundle, there are some extensions like NoScript installed. However, setting NoScript to block scripts breaks many websites that rely on Javascript. Does enabling these scripts mean that the website knows who I am (or at least my IP address)? Which scripts in particular are the most dangerous? "

577,Why can't I connect using an older version of Tor?,"My college has one or two facilities enabled with WiFi. I've been provided with complete access to the Internet. A few websites were blocked by the router (say Twitter, YouTube, probably any site that's fun!). I was using Tor (v2.3) to access those sites. I used v2.3 because I like the Vidalia Panel, the details, logs, customization etc. are quite charming, until...  Last week, something terrible happened. Whenever I try to connect to the network, it's stuck here, at ""Establishing an encrypted directory connection"".    Then, I tried using v3.6.3. It connects (within a few seconds) as usual. I'm able to browse those sites. So, what's the big deal? Why's there a conflict between both of these versions? I'm curious why this happened all of a sudden. "
578,Use of Orbot on Mobile,"I read that using Personal Accounts like Gmail, Facebook etc (with real Personal Information) on Tor is not anonymous or safe. So if I installed Orbot on un-rooted android mobile then even I browse anonymously using Orweb, but the other apps like my Email Client, Stackexchange app or even Play Store itself on my phone does/can connect to internet using my external IP (the real one). Doesn't it reveal my identity?? I am using ""NoRoot Firewall"" (noroot firewall is an app for un-rooted android devices which block or allow internet access to certain devices by creating a virtual VPN) for blocking internet access of some apps but running Torand Noroot Firewall simultanously makes a bigger mess (running simultanously Orweb shows You are not connected to Tor even when Orbot saying you are connected to Tor i.e. may be orweb connects directly to internet with my real IP address). I also tried edit my mobile APN setting to local host and 8118, but may be that allowing all apps to connect through Tor including Gmail account via Email Client.  So how can I use Tor on android while blocking internet access to other apps like email client and other apps which use my real identity? Is there any other option other than rooting my phone? "
579,Are there any Javascript implementations of Tor client?,Are there any available Javascript implementations of Tor client?  Links:   What implementations of Tor are there?  
580,How many clients are typically using Tor simultaneously? How many circuits are simultaneously in use?,"From Tor Metrics: Users, I get that there are currently about 2.4 million ""directly connecting users"". And in Questions and answers about user statistics, I see:     Q: So, are these distinct users per day, average number of users connected   over the day, or what?   A: Average number of concurrent users, estimated from data collected over   a day.  We can't say how many distinct users there are.   However, I vaguely recall arguments that the number of simultaneously connected Tor clients, at any given instant, is rather smaller than this estimate, which is calculated as 10% of daily directory requests.  Is there any reason to think that's so?  Also, is it possible to estimate how many circuits are simultaneously in use? "
581,How to contribute to Tor as an inexperienced developer?,"I've often heard contributing to open source projects is a great way to learn, as a student. Tor is something I would like to contribute to as I believe in the cause. I've seen the bug tracker, and guidelines for submitting patches etc in the docs.   However, am I doing more harm than good by trying to fix bugs and submit patches that may not be perfect? I'm wondering if contributors should have real world experience on large scale projects, or what's expected of contributors?  I do not want to waste the time of people actively involved in the project. "
582,Can I have more than one .onion site?,Is it possible to create more than one .onion site on one computer? I know that it involves using my server so it would be weird if I could but if I can could you please tell me how or lead me in the right direction?  Thanks 
583,Prove ownership of a hidden service?,Is there any way to prove ownership of a hidden service without revealing it's private key? Maybe signing a message with the key?

584,Possible to run Tor router in headless ARM server,"I would like to know if its possible to use the Tor router in a headless (no GUI, only SSH access) server, in order to provide a simple access point to the Onion network, and Internet in general to services running within the server?  Furthermore, would it be possible to run Tor in the ARM architecture, like Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, Beaglebone and so on?  Appreciated. "
585,Why does Tor Browser open my timezone file?,"During launch, Tor Browser opens /usr/share/zoneinfo/(continent)/(city)  Why?  How can I hide that info? "
586,How does a OR know that it is the cells final destination?,"As far as i understood the payload is encrypted in layers and each relay router decrypts its layer as the cell passes along its way to the exit router. Contained within this payload is also the relay header and the relay routers just replace the circuit id according to their tables.  My question is how does the ""last"" node, the exit router know that it is the final destination of the cell? Is it because it has no entry in it's forwarding table for this circuit id? "
587,What metadata does Tor leak to my ISP?,"It is wellknown that an ISP can see when an end user is using Tor. What exactly can it infer by looking at the Tor traffic? Specifically   Can the ISP infer Tor bandwidth usage, i.e. actively downloading a file vs. an idle connection? Can the ISP distinguish between a Tor handshake (when launching Tor initially) vs. an existing session?  "
588,Tor'ing through dual router network,"I have a two router setup at home. The master router handles the incoming DSL connection and DHCP settings, and the second router is used as a wireless extender. My desktop also connects via the second router by means of a LAN cable. DHCP is switched off on the second router.  Will using TOR via the second router though the master compromise on anonymity? Is there anything else I should consider doing with the set up in order to make browsing more secure? "
589,Security of other browsers + Tor vs. Tor browser,"I'm a bit confused about why using Tor with regular Chrome or FF is considered insecure.  Let's say I use it with Chrome. I install the ""Expert Bundle"", then the proxy-switchy Chrome extension and set up a Tor profile (Host: 127.0.0.1:9050, Socks 4). And disable the Flash player from chrome://plugins because Flash ignores the proxy.  Can it be said that at this point Chrome is just as secure as the Tor Browser, assuming I always use incognito mode? If not, can anyone please explain how is the browsing any different compared to that on a Tor Browser (what else makes it insecure besides Flash and cookies)? "
590,Why do people need to be SO anonymous online... for LEGAL reasons?,"I don't quite understand this. If you didn't want to have the NSA or whatever spying on you why not just use a VPN? I use PIA and  get a 2mbps speed. Why don't people use something like that instead?   I cannot imagine what people need tor for unless they are doing illegal means. I mean sure it is much better then a VPN but is it REALLY worth a 10KBPS speed?  and on another note, does anyone know average speed of it? It took me about 5 minutes to load one photo so I don't think my 10kbps is far off. "
591,Does windows 10 compromise TOR?,"Does running Tor on Windows 10 compromise my security? And further from that, are there any issues I need to be aware of while using Tor on Windows 10?  "

593,Compile and install (?) Tor Browser Bundle using source code on OpenBSD,"I refer to my earlier post titled Tor Browser Bundle does not work on OpenBSD  As the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) available for download on Tor's official site does not work out of the box on *BSD operating systems such as OpenBSD, could someone show me the detailed steps for compiling and installing (?) TBB using the source code.  Note: I believe TBB is not meant to be installed, right? "
594,No-ip alongside Tor,"Is there a way to resolve Dynamic DNS with Tor so that I can connect to my computer who is behind a NAT ? Do I have to enable the ""no-ip"" service on my router or do I have to make a port forward ? "
595,Hidden Service as client or relay?,"Take a look, what is the difference between Tor-Browser in onion encrypted traffic and Apache service responses in onion encrypted traffic?  Tor-Browser: sent 1% / receive 99%.  It is simply,    Request: ""connect to google.com, Get /"" = 1kb Response: ""!doctype html html itemscope=""... blablabla"" = 16kb   Apache as Hidden Service: sent 99% / receive 1%. Vice-verse Picture!  Is my hidden service hidden against simple attack Weighting-Request/Response?  Most of humans suggest me to use client mode for hidden-service and do not touch Relay for such task. Is it still true? "
596,Tor is making me an exit node despite configuration?,"I am trying to create a non-exit relay. I have edited the torrc file to ExitPolicy reject *:*, but when I monitor my connection in arm it lists my relay nickname as an ""EXIT"" in multiple circuits. Is this what I think it is? Am I an exit despite having explicitly configured the file otherwise? Because it was really disappointing to see how my request was breached so easily, I cannot afford this type of error.  This happens even when I allow arm to configure the torrc for me and I ask it to be an internal relay only. What is causing this, how do I stop it? Man, I've had to jump through so many hoops trying to get this thing going... "

599,"GL-iNET, what does it mean when the LED flashes red?","I'm working with a GL-iNET router, and before it stopped working, it was running their tor firmware from 2/2/2015 (the file doesn't have a version number).  At some point it broke and now when it turns on, the LED flashes red.  I couldn't find a manual for the device, and I'm not that familiar with Open-WRT/DD-WRT (the tor firmware is based on one of these).  Would this be something to consult their documentation about?  What does a flashing red LED mean?  After it boots up, it flashes ~4/sec green for ~3 -4 seconds, then it flashes red ~4/sec.  Periodically, the LED will stay red for a little while longer and then it will resume its normally 4/sec flash rate.  The wifi is broadcasting (I can see the SSIDs), and I can access the web UI via the LAN port (and presumably the non-tor wifi).  I've reset the device before, but I'd like to know what's going on. "
600,Is it safe to install GreaseMonkey on TBB?,I would like to install GreaseMonkey on KBB. I understand that any script might add fingerprinting issue. What if I only install GreaseMonkey?

601,Is the Tor browser always using at Tor ciruit?,"I'm using the Tor browser (4.5.3) and when I press the green onion I can see the current Tor circuit that's in use at the moment. Now, is the browser always using a Tor circuit? Because sometimes when I rightclick and open links in new tabs and then press the green onion to check which circuit the new tabs are using then it doesn't show anything. The first and the second tab can show that it's using a circuit while the third tab doesn't show anything. Now, is that possible or is the browser always using a circuit regardless if I can see which nodes it's using or not?  Just so it's clear that I only have 1 browserwindow open but I'm using multiple tabs. "

I have read every thread and post related to this issue I can find, the only things any of them mention is to either reinstall Tor, which I have done several times, including the latest alpha release, or that it may be a clock issue, I have changed the time one hour back and one hour forward.  None of these things have fixed the issue.  The only things I can find on the net about this are a couple of reddit, stackoverflow and yahoo answers threads. None shed any real light or offer solutions.  Any help is appreciated, even just some links to information with some depth.

609,How does TOR extend circuit to a third node?,"I am reading the Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router article and my question is that how TOR extends circuit to a third node?   On page 7 of the article,left column, it says:     To extend the circuit to a third node or beyond, Alice proceeds as   above, always telling the last node in the circuit to extend one hop   further.   Does Alice talk to OR2 directly to extend the node or it talks to OR2 through OR1?   If Alice talks to OR2 through OR1, then what commands should she use? As we know extend command was used to extend circuit from OR1 to OR2 and seems it can't be used twice.  "
610,Run tor and TBB at the same time with the same ports on same PC,"Just what the title says: is it safe/good practise/etc to run tor as a service (LM17.2) and TBB on the same PC, same time, same ports? Will this be related to that part of the FAQ where it says I have better chance at anonymity due to the ""mingling"" of the traffic?  Alternative: would using tor and TBB with different ports but at the same time (same computer) be an extra security as the same part in the FAQ says?  The thing that bothers me most is how does this (do these two) affect this:     [...] if an attacker can watch all of your incoming and outgoing traffic, then it's easy for him to learn which connections were relayed and which started at you.   This ""attacker"" here sounds like my ISP... "

616,Avoiding exit-nodes with ISP-/country-based blocks of a site?,"Is it possible to avoid exit-nodes where a site is blocked by the exit-node's ISP (or - I guess - government)?  So my questions are:   Can specific exit-nodes be ""turned off""? Can groups of exit nodes be ""turned off"" based on top-domain and/or on location (ie. country)? Is it possible to do the above only for specific sites (maybe specified by using regular expressions); Ie. ""turn it off"" only when visiting sites known to be blocked, but leave them ""on"" for other (not blocked) sites?   If it's possible, how would I proceed to do it? "
617,Mac: how to run multiple instances of Tor browser at the same time with different exit nodes?,"I made two profiles of Tor Browser from the command line and I followed this but it didn't work for Mac. I can run both Tor Browser.app and Tor Browser2.app from different ports now, but somehow I can't run them at the same time.  What I'd like to do is to run one instance of Tor Browser with the default settings, while running another with an exit node of a designated IP address. Is this possible on a Mac? If so, how? I looked into ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data but there was no separate torrc file for each of the profiles I have: there was only one that seemed to be shared across all the profiles.   Edit: although I said I followed the post I linked, there were some steps that can't be followed in my environment. These options didn't exist in my Tor browser's about:config settings.     Modify extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_port to a new port (eg. 9152   for Tor Browser 2) Modify extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_host to   127.0.0.1 Modify extensions.torbutton.proxies_applied to false   And as for this step:     Edit torrc-defaults in \TorBrowser\Data\Tor    I edited that torrc-defaults in /Applications/TorBrowser2.app/Contents/Resources/TorBrowser/Tor/torrc-defaults  And my torrc file is in ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Tor/torrc  My profile data is in ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/[myProfileID].[myProfileName]  And there are folders like bookmarkbackups, extensions, gmp, HTTPSEverywhereUserRules, preferences and bunch of files but not torrc here. (i.e. there are no separate torrc files for each profile, just one shared across all profiles.)  Also, in this post, there's another Answer by mirmir, but a step in it can't be followed on Mac too.      Now open the second Tor browser then TorButton Preferences. Select ""Use custom settings"" then change the SOCKS Port to 9152 and click OK. Browse [website]There's no TorButton Preferences in my TorBrowser.app! "
618,Howto to install a Tor middle relay on a working Windows VPN Proxy?,"I've looked through the existing descriptions and tried many ways to do this - but don't believe it's ever worked for me.  I have a Windows 7 pro machine which has been running for years with only two applications - Open VPN and Privoxy. Both run from a guest account and supply web access &amp; DNS to all other PCs here. This machine runs 24/7.  Would like to install a manually started tor middle relay, but it sems everything I try fails to get the torrc recognized by the tor.exe file. But when I manually start tor.exe with admin priviledges from that same guest account - it indicates it can build working circuits from it's default.  I don't need tor access (have other ways for that) - just wish to provide relay capacity while keeping these activities hidden from our ISP (who I detest). Have a second identical gateway going to a different VPN which I might be willing to convert also - if I could just get the first to work.  Believe I found the main problem....torrc had a hidden .txt suffix (rolling eyes). Now it shows to be reading the configuration.   New problem? It claims I haven't inserted contact information - but I believe I have.

621,Turning off the proxy part of Tor,"I would like to use the tor browser but without the Proxy / Onion element of it. The reason why I would like to do this is because I'd like to use Tor as my main go to browser for normal activities and I have more trust in Tor than in Google Chrome or Mozilla regarding sending private information back from the browser itself (AKA application-level privacy/security).  QUESTION: How can I disable the Proxy part of tor WITHOUT disabling the rest of the security features Tor has?  WHAT I HAVE TRIED SO FAR:  ______[ ATTEMPT# 1]______  Open Menu > Add-ons > Extensions > Disable TorLauncher  After doing this and trying to go on any random URL, I get the following error message:     The proxy server is refusing connections      Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections.         Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.   Contact your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is working.      [IMPORTANT NOTE] I already did try disabling the Torbutton add-on as well, and the same error happened. HOWEVER I do not want to disable the Torbutton add-on since it provides important application-level security, which I would like to keep. I just tried disabling it to see if it was causing some indirect issues.  ______[ ATTEMPT# 2]______  Open Menu > Options > Advanced > Network >  Settings > Selecting ""No proxy""  This was done together with keeping TorLauncher disabled. Now I get the following error:     Unable to find the proxy server      Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that can't be found.         Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.   Check to make sure your computer has a working network connection.   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Tor Browser is permitted to access the Web.      So it seems that the browser is still looking for a proxy server to connect to, even after I disabled that option in the Network Settings.  I have been trying to find something else that might get the job done, but without success. I am still looking. Would anyone happen to know the solution? "
622,How Tor handles nodes designed to burn it,"How does tor handles nodes designed just to screw it.  The way i understand it entry node connects to node 2. which connects to node 3.(exit nodes) now all the traffic is encrypted and encryption i understand. But what if node is designed to attack tor network and make it unreliable and just pass on the wrong traffic. For example if node was supposed to pass encrypted string 'aaaa' instead it passes 'bbbb' just to screw up tor in general and a random tor user. Would tor network be able to isolate the node that is messing up the network, if so how?  How does tor handle it and are there any mechanisms to prevent that? I rly don't understand what guarantees entry node that it will  get data it requested (data integrity) ? "

In other words, while the torproject site will usually give me 3 bridges at a time to try from, is it any useful to have the 3 of them at the same time, as 3 successive torrc lines, or should I select just one at a time, removing/replacing a nonworking's bridge line ?

629,Why do entry nodes not know the originator?,"I stumbled upon the following text in the article about onion routing on Wikipedia:      In this example onion, the source of the data sends the onion to   Router A, which removes a layer of encryption to learn only where to   send it next and where it came from (though it does not know if the   sender is the origin or just another node). Router A sends it to   Router B, which decrypts another layer to learn its next destination.   Router B sends it to Router C, which removes the final layer of   encryption and transmits the original message to its destination.   Now I am wondering how the entry node can not know that it's talking to the originator. Couldn't it simply check the list of all tor nodes and see that the IP is not a tor node? Or did I misunderstand the concept of tor clients... I thought clients are not automatically nodes.   And are the data packages that are being sent between the node always of the same size? I guess otherwise I would be pretty easy to check what is going on.  Please help me and sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker.  Thank you. "
630,Getting WebRTC built into TOR,"Situation:  I have been trying to get WebRTC onto the TOR Browser. I Know this might sound stupid at first, I explained my reasons on why I wanted to do this in my previous post: Getting WebRTC on TOR  Current Progress:  After no luck with finding already made plugins, I decided to try to build it into TOR myself. I'm using the latest version of Ubuntu btw (Xenial 16.04). What I have done so far is:   Download a fresh version of TOR but without installing it Download the version of firefox that the previous TOR version was based off of (firefox 45.9.0), only downloaded, didn't install. Located relevant WebRTC files in the firefox:   firefox-sdk/include/mozilla/media/webrtc/WebrtcGlobal.h  this file has a few #include ...s at the top, which are files that are also located within the firefox downloaded bundle, and some of these refer to other files, and so on.    Questions:   If I copy all the files that are related to the WebRTC file WebrtcGlobal.h would that compose all the necessary files in order to implement WebRTC into tor? If I need more please let me know which, and if I don't need all the ones included, which ones are the only ones I need? After having the right files, where in TOR should I include them? Do I need to modify certain configurations, like media.peerconnection.enabled=false into true, amongst others? Is there anything else I would need to do? As you can see, I am kind of learning as I go along, any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!  "
631,How to specify ExitNodes in Linux?,"You can edit torrc file in Windows version and add something like ExitNodes {US}. And this will make your Tor Browser connect to .us proxies only.  If you add this at the end of torrc file in /etc/tor/torrc and restart Tor service, it does not work.  Using torsocks just hangs or times out and you need to undo the torrc edit to make it work again.  I need to set my torsocks to connect to .us proxy in order to access .us only websites.

632,Tor and Exit nodes - just a question,"Given the fact that exit nodes seem to be implicated with just about every bad story covering Tor - why have them?  Could not the clearweb be left to just continue it's evolution into a corporate cesspool, while onion services evolved to handle everything else (both legit and criminal...but supportive of non corporate interests)?  As I see it, Tor keeps getting a black eye from people who use it to inflict harm on others. Eliminating the exit nodes would remove this trouble and might actually make it safer for Tor users? No chance of accidental exit where attackers congregate.  Those new protections for onion sites have real potential, but this potential is likely drowned out by the continuing propaganda LE quarters use to justify their bullshit jobs. Elimination of exit nodes would eventually ""cut such people off from the money"".  What's the worst that can happen? Hackers being forced to build their own string of VPN links so they can attack clearweb sites? Why would anyone within the Tor organization care? What's in it for them when they protect such people? What is the cost of providing such protection?  Right now, the only way to avoid exit mistakes is to use a VPN provider supporting in house Tor2Web. And of course, that leaves one vulnerable to personnel changes at that VPN provider. Onion clients which ""stayed within Tor"" would be very useful. "
633,Using Paypal with Tor---Ooopsy!,I made the mistake of trying to pay for a VPN service with Paypal while using Tor browser. Paypal said the transaction had gone through. But my bank statement said otherwise. I haven't validated the purchase with the email link sent by the VPN service and do not plan to. Have I blown my anonymity? Have I alerted anyone to my I.P. address and identity as a Tor / VPN user? If so what can I do about this? Is it worth paying for a VPN service by regular means? I do not do any illegal downloading and am a little confused about the advantage of a VPN over and above Tor.    
634,Why orbot isn't updated as with the Tor for windows and why Orfox isn't updated with the latest bundle of Firefox as of the same version in windows?,"I want to know why android version isn't updated with the same version which is available for the windows? Android version is always lower than the tor bundle for windows.  Not only that, even Orfox isn't updated with the latest bundle version as it is available for windows version. Tor bundle including Firefox is always of newer version than android's Orfox.  Also, Tor for windows is more often updated than Orbot for android. Even, Tor Browser for windows is also more often updated than Orfox for android.  You won't believe me that I asked these same questions to their supported emails so often that i also don't remember now how many times i asked them?  So far, no luck getting any answers from them!  As a result, i came here looking for answers. I hope to get satisfying answers from any one of you that why android versions aren't updated as often as windows versions???? "
635,Why aren't the biggest bittorrent file sharing sites using Tor yet?,"From what little I know about how Tor works (I might be wrong about some things), it seems like if more users were incentivized to use Tor for downloading and sharing files, the number of endpoints would increase, making it less likely that your traffic would end up in an evil logging/scanning/sniffing endpoint, and the increased amount of traffic would make it harder for malicious third party to sift through so much data to find someone's specific data packets.  I've seen installers which simplify setting up VPN and whatnot that would benefit user, but which would deter new users if they had to configure everything manually. So it can be done, and regular users may only need to hit ""install > yes > yes > ok"" and everyone on the Tor network would benefit tremendously. It seems they only need to say ""we're moving to Tor!"" and it's as good as done.  So why isn't this a thing in 2017? Are there some hidden downsides to inviting millions of new users to join Tor? And are there some problems associated specifically with bittorrent filesharing traffic over Tor? And if Bittorrent is not a desirable way to share data over Tor, what would be? "
636,Does restricting guard node choice negatively affect anonymity?,"In response to the comment on [website]  Is old version of tor node a bottleneck in the whole tor chain (in   sense of security)? Does it downgrade encryption also between other   nodes in the chain? If my guard uses old tor crypto which knows   nothing about ECC for encryption, does it mean that ECC will not be   used in my tor chain at all? (AFAIK, not, am I right?) Does it have   sense to restrict the choice of guard nodes only by those which run   last stable Tor release?   On May 2nd, 2017 yawning said:          If my guard uses old tor crypto which knows nothing about ECC for encryption, does it mean that ECC will not be used in my tor chain at     all?         So something that predates 0.2.4.something? It's done on a per hop   basis anyway.           Does it have sense to restrict the choice of guard nodes only by those which run last stable Tor release?         If you want to dramatically reduce your anonymity set, then sure.   My question is:  Does restricting the guard nodes Tor chooses actually have a negative effect on anonymity?  Since a Tor user usually connects to the same guard node using a non-anonymous IP address, it seems this should have little effect on anonymity. "
637,What would be the better alternative to Bittorrent file-sharing sharing over Tor?,"I asked this question earlier about whether Bittorrent over Tor is a good idea, and if it is, why it's not popular (turns out it would be a very bad idea). So my follow-up question is now: What would be the better alternative for the purposes of file-sharing anonymously over Tor, preferably retaining Bittorrent's advantages like:   no central host from which nobody would be able to download if it stops working not having to have a complete downloaded file to share what you already have   Or are these features of Bittorrent protocol what causes problems to Tor network? If it doesn't make sense to share files this way, what is the next best way? "
638,Javascript Clarification?,"How does enabling javascript affect whether a Tor user's IP address is revealed if the site is not launching an exploit or attack?   For example, Instagram's privacy policy states that they collect IP addresses in their log file. So does enabling javascript automatically allows a site like Instagram to collect a Tor user's true IP address? Or does enabling Javascript mean only certain information about the browser is collected but not the true IP address?   From Instagram's privacy policy - Log file information:  Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (""IP"") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.  "

642,How does obfs4 work?,"First of all, I am already having a working setup of tor as a systemd service that uses obfs4, and using it as proxy by my applications like chrome and firefox, so this is not a question how to make tor work for me but rather how obfs4 works. I am in Egypt and could not initially make tor work since obviously the government is using some kind of advanced DPI that I couldn't even make my own openvpn server on 443/tcp port. All commercial vpns are blocked too. Tor itself cannot work unless with obfs3/obfs4.  My question is how obfs4 making my traffic look like it's not tor traffic? I want to know because I fear that if my traffic looks very suspicious, it's better for me to return to direct communication since I don't use tor for any illegal stuff anyway (just unblocking some important domains like medium.com and watching porn lmao). Does the traffic is analyzed as if it was some HTTPS connection or what exactly? "

660,Fresh Tor Browser 7.5.5 (2018-06-09) for macOS install crashes on start,"Running macOS 10.13.6 Beta, just thought ""Hey I'll give this whole Tor Browser thing a shot"" (Never really used it) and see what goes. So, 1 download and install later, I start Tor Browser but it immediately crashes (every time).  When clicking the copy log to clipboard button, it states that 0 log messages where copied, so I even can't show you something... Due to macOS beta? Or am I missing something here?  Cheerios, Fabrizio "
661,How do I host a wordpress blog on tor?,How do I go about hosting a wordpress blog as a hidden service? Are there providers who will host it for me? Or will I have to configure it myself? 
662,What universities / labs are researching Tor security?,"Are there universities and labs that are unaffiliated with the Tor Project that are researching Tor and Onion Routing and contributing back to the Tor Project (be it in code, security audits, or just publishing papers about how Tor could be made more secure)?  If so, what labs are out there and what concepts are they researching (and where is there funding coming from if that information is available)? "
663,What are the implications of a Relay hosting a Hidden Service?,"Are there any implications if whilst running a non-exit relay, I also use the same machine to host a Hidden Service?  Specifically:   How will this affect the anonymity of the Hidden Service (in terms of its location being obscured)? What effect would it have on the anonymity of clients using my relay as a middle node, or a guard node? Are there any other side-effects I should be aware of?  "
664,What impact does Tor's bootstrapping process have for attack models?,"As I understand it, Tor nodes and clients bootstrap themselves by contacting over the regular internet some hard-coded addresses to get basic network information.  What are the effects of this design decision for someone facing a hostile network? Could a network administrator block this first connection? Could they impersonate the servers and give false information to the client, such that the user thinks they are secure, whilst their entire connection is compromised? "
665,How does Tor route DNS requests?,"Tor can only handle TCP connections, but DNS is a UDP protocol. How does Tor route DNS requests over its TCP based network? Why can the same approach not be used to route all UDP traffic over Tor? "
666,How are 'Pluggable Transport' bundles different from 'regular' Tor Browser Bundles?,"The Tor Project releases both Tor Browser Bundles, and Pluggable Transport Tor Browser Bundles.  How are these different? How should I decide which bundle to use? "
667,How does Tor's threat model differ from i2p's threat model?,"I2P is an alternative anonymity system, with a very different design - it focuses more on intra-I2P communication, rather than communication with the wider internet. Unlike Tor, every user of I2P is also the equivalent of a Tor relay.  I'm interested in how their threat model differs from the one assumed by Tor.   What kind of adversary does Tor protect against, that I2P doesn't? What kind of adversary does I2P protect against, that Tor doesn't? Are there any adversaries that neither project protects against?  "
668,How strong is the anonymity of a hidden service compared to an average Tor client? How much easier is it to learn the Hidden Service's IP address?,"Another way of putting this: How hard would it be to de-anonymize a hidden service? By ""de-anonymize"" I mean revealing the IP address of whatever server the hidden service is hosted on. Of course, this wouldn't necessarily mean revealing the identity of the person who is running the server (or paying someone to run the server). And there are other complications: it could be running on a VPS, and so on.   But I don't want to over-complicate this. The question is, how easily could an attacker find out the IP address of a hidden service compared to finding a Tor user's IP?  I am assuming that this blog post is still accurate in describing some of the current problems with hidden services that need to be addressed. "
669,How can I prevent someone looking at my traffic patterns from learning that I use Tor?,"Traffic pattern recognition can apparently be used to achieve a high degree of confidence of the origin of certain traffic, based on statistical analysis of exit node traffic.   Is it possible to mitigate this in any way?   I guess it may be possible to try and create behavioral noise on exit nodes but this sounds like a very problematic approach. Are there any other approaches? "
670,Are there any good practices to keep my Tor relay's private key safe?,"Assuming that I run a Tor relay on a virtual private server running linux, are there any good practices to keep my relay's private key safe?  We can take for granted that software packages constantly get updated and upgraded and that ssh access is restricted to ssh keys.   Should I use an encrypted loopback device to encrypt the private key? Are there any other attack vectors I should have in mind ? "
671,How can I configure my network so that when Tor is running no other traffic can leave the box?,"One of the fundamentals of Tor is that it can only really hide you if, when Tor is enabled and in use, you're using it exclusively.  Agents wishing to de-anonymize you can examine requests to different endpoints and look for common or synchronized requests, which suggests that the traffic from a proxied IP address is related to the traffic from the actual endpoint.  So to prevent other components on my laptop from disclosing my location, I'd like to configure the system so it blocks all traffic that isn't going through the Tor relay. For instance, Skype, Gmail, Spotify, or anything else that makes requests to the Internet must be disabled?  How can I configure Tor, or my network, so that only components using the Tor relay can make requests to the Internet? I've used firewall UNIX tools like ufw and ipfw, but automating this would reduce the potential for making mistakes and forgetting to close or block something. "
672,"Aside from disabling Javascript in Firefox, how can I make Tor Browser Bundle more secure?","In a recent Tor security advisory, Roger Dingledine writes:     Consider disabling JavaScript (click the blue     ""S"" beside the green onion, and select ""Forbid Scripts Globally"").     Disabling JavaScript will reduce your vulnerability to other attacks     like this one, but disabling JavaScript will make some websites not work     like you expect. A future version of Tor Browser Bundle will have an     easier interface for letting you configure your JavaScript settings [11].     You might also like Request Policy [12]. And you might want to randomize     your MAC address, install various firewalls, etc.   He makes a few other suggestions, like not using Windows and switching to a LiveCD such as Tails. My question, though, relates to the ""etc."" in Roger's statement that ""you might want to randomize   your MAC address, install various firewalls, etc."" Besides disabling Javascript, installing RequestPolicy, and following Roger's other recommendations, what else can/should I do to harden Firefox?  As Roger states, ""JavaScript is one big vector for attack, but many other   big vectors exist, like css, svg, xml, the renderer, etc."" Okay, so I should probably disable images and CSS then? Short of using a text-based browser like Lynx, what can I do?  I am less concerned with linkability/fingerprinting than I am with security, i.e. maintaining the anonymity of my IP address by not getting owned.  The security advisory quoted above also touches on stuff Tor users can do at the OS level to increase security. This could involve using Tails or possibly a VM-based approach (examples are Qubes or Whonix). There are plenty of other OS options, like OpenBSD, Hardened Gentoo, and so on, each with its pros and cons.  Let's just focus on Firefox, though - regardless of OS.   Even then, this is a pretty broad question. Maybe it should be split into more than one question? "
673,Securely hosting a Tor hidden service/site,"There are some detailed instructions for setting up a Tor site at torproject.org1. It seems that it would be most secure to use a dedicated machine for this task if possible. I've read elsewhere that thttpd might be preferable to Apache and its likely more secure to go with a GNI/Linux over Windows.    Any thoughts on this? Is there a ""standard"" distro and/or web-server that would be best-suited for this task? Or is that merely a matter of personal preference?  Also, what are appropriate and effective security practices, both technical and operational? What can we learn from the recent compromises of Freedom Hosting (perhaps the largest .onion hosting provider) and the Silk Road? According to Wired2, ""the FBI yesterday acknowledged that it secretly took control of Freedom Hosting last July"". The article notes that ""[i]t’s not clear how the FBI took over the servers"". However, the comment that ""the bureau was temporarily thwarted when Marques somehow regained access and changed the passwords"" is suggestive. As details come out in the trial, it would be prudent to identify relevant technical and/or operational failures.  In the case of the Silk Road, it's clear from the Maryland complaint3 that vulnerabilities in Tor were not instrumental in the site's compromise. Even so, did technical and/or operational failures contribute to the takedown, and how might they be corrected?  As new hidden service sites fill these market niches, at least some of the underlying technical and/or operational improvements may become public. There is much to learn about doing this right. "
674,Is it safe to run an entry node server?,"After some research, I found that there are mostly relay (middle) nodes, and less exit and entry nodes. But why? The connection from the client to the entry node is encrypted, so there should be no problem.  So is it safe to run an entry and relay node, instead of a relay-only node? I am especially concerned about security, and legal considerations. "
675,How can BitTorrent traffic be anonymized with Tor?,"This blog post from a few years ago suggests that using BitTorrent services over Tor is a bad idea for multiple reasons. However, it also suggests some fixes to get over these problems.  Is using a BitTorrent client over Tor safe? How do I set it up? "
676,How do torrent clients over Tor affect the network?,"This blog post from a few years ago, suggests that:     The first answer is ""don't run Bittorrent over Tor"". We've been saying for years not to run Bittorrent over Tor, because the Tor network can't handle the load; perhaps these attacks will convince more people to listen.    Is this true even now? Is torrent traffic too much for Tor networks to handle?  Would it be considered bad form to use a torrent client over Tor?  "
677,Can government agencies track what sites I'm visiting when using Tor?,Can agencies such as the NSA or GCHQ track what websites I'm visiting if I'm using the Tor Browser Bundle? What about hidden services? 
678,Are there any vulnerabilities in the process of onion routing?,"In onion routing, messages are repeatedly encrypted and then sent through several network nodes called onion routers. Each onion router removes a layer of encryption to uncover routing instructions, and sends the message to the next router where this is repeated.   Are there any (theoretical or practical) vulnerabilities in onion routing? Are there any known ways to break the anonymity that it offers?   To be specific, I am asking if the process of onion routing can be hacked. "
679,Can Tor be used with applications other than Web browsers?,"From what I can see Tor mainly handles your web browser's traffic, but is there a way to do all of your connections through it? Like email, Dropbox, Carbonite backup, Skype etc?  (Please explain whether this might be a good or a bad idea in the first place. I can understand that Skype might be inherently 'spy friendly' due to it's closed source nature and slow.) "
680,Are there trustworthy third-party audits of the Tor source code?,Was the Tor source code trustworthily audited by a third party to check if it does not contain a back-door?  Are such audit results freely available? 
681,Is it possible to make the Tor onion-routing path longer?,"By default, Tor uses an onion-routing path with three hops: entry, relay (middle) and exit. Is it possible to configure (or, if necessary, recompile) Tor to use more than three hops? This would lessen the probability that all the hops would be under control of an attacker, right? "
682,Does Tor insert random delays or perform packet re-ordering to make the discovery of the communication path harder?,"If an attacker can observe the Tor user, and the website being visited, it is possible to correlate the traffic by looking at time and size distributions of the communication.   Techniques such as random time delays, padding, fake cover traffic, and changing packet ordering may make this correlation harder.   Does Tor perform any of these techniques? Are there analyses if such techniques would considerably help in maintaining anonymity? "
683,Is there a list of applications which are know to leak or not to leak information when using with Tor?,Some applications can either leak sensitive information through the Tor channel or they can make communication outside of the Tor channel which could lead to identification of your computer in the Tor network.   Is there a list of applications which are known for such leaks? Is there a list of applications where such leaks were not observed? Is there an initiative trying to create and maintain such lists?  
684,Are short-lived relays useful to the Tor network?,"I have some dedicated servers which are not used at the moment. However this can change on a weekly basis. Would it be useful to the Tor network for me to configure them as relays during the times they are not used for other purposes? If so, should they be bridges or relays? "
685,New installed TOR Browser does not do anything,"I have had stable TOR Browsers working excellent for years now and never had any problems after installing. Today I did the update to TOR browser 6.0.1 and after installing , same way as always, nothing happened , in the Windows task manager not a single reference to a TOR affiliated process showed., Tried the Firefox exe in the browser folder , nothing happenened. Is this a bug in this version? How do I solve this ? "
686,How to use tor-browser on OpenAFS?,"In order to KISS I'd like to keep my tor-browser directory on an OpenAFS (1.6.18) mount. OpenAFS doesn't support creation of sockets. How to configure tor-browser to use another directory for the socket (I assume tor is the only binary which needs one)? If that's impossible what else could I do?  On OpenAFS I can't start tor-browser because tor fails to start. It doesn't produce a log which is likely a bug which I might investigate and report separately.  After moving the tor-browser directory from OpenAFS mount to btrfs it works as expected, but I don't find the socket with find . -type s which I don't understand.  I'm using tor-browser 6.0.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 "

689,Android tethering: use Orbot or Tor browser on laptop?,"Ok, keep in mind that even though I'm fairly technically savvy, most of what I read on Tor related sites pretty much goes over my head.  But even so; here's my question.  Normally on my laptop I use the regular Tor browser while connected to my home wi-fi network.  Now let's say I use my android, which has a data plan, and I use it as a hotspot while tethering to connect my laptop to the net. If I use Orbot on my phone, but not use Tor on my laptop, is that just as effective? Or is it more important that I have Tor on my laptop?  Perhaps i should do both; use Tor on my laptop AND use Orbot on my phone?  Also, what if I use my Raspberry Pi to connect to my Android's hotspot?  Is that just as  safe as though I was using the tor browser?  Assuming that my phone is using Orbot? "
690,Updating api for third-party developers,"Has Tor an API to get information about the latest version? I want to use Tor with my software for getting access to blocked sites, and I want update Tor automatically. Have tor any solutions of this task for third-party developers? "
691,Google SSID cookie and TOR,"  If you view the linked image you will see that when I log into gmail google stores a cookie called SSID on my system. Is it possible that their javascript requests the SSID of my Wi-Fi network from the network? If I am logged into a hotspot with a distinctive name such as ""L33T H4CK3R UNIVERSITY SECURE WI-FI"" or ""Manufacturer-DeFaUlt-HOmE-rOUtEr-nAmE1234x599"" this could be a security issue that allows someone to deduce my true IP address even if I am using TOR or a VPN. For instance, google has a Wi-Fi hotspot map; they could use that map to figure out my true IP and true location from my Wi-Fi network name.  Could someone recommend libraries I could look at or an approach I could take to program a Firefox or Chrome plugin that would spoof the Wi-Fi network name and other information that is passed to Javascript? "

Mostly the Wikipedia's definition is referenced.  if you have a standard and accurate standard, I would be grateful?  But my main vagueness is the definition of Wikipedia which says:     A darknet (or dark net) is an overlay network that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization, often using non-standard communications protocols and ports.   what does ""non-standard communications protocols and ports"" means? are not Tor , I2p , Freenet ,... standard protocols?

696,Cannot Configure Tor,"Im fairly new to this so don't judge, but Im currently at a workplace on a windows 7 laptop and they've blocked almost every site, including proxies and what not, the way I downloaded tor was by connecting the computer to my phones hotspot. So after I downloaded tor ive tried putting in my ip and port. Im pretty sure the ip is correct, but when im in command prompt and type netstat -a it constantly goes on and on with different port numbers. Im not really sure what im doing wrong or how to find the correct port but can anyone help me out? What do I put in for the bridges, proxy type, ip, and port? Thanks. "

700,Detect TOR network using the IP address,"I have a website.  I just want to detect if the internet traffic is coming through TOR or not.  How to find If TOR is being used to access my website ?  Is there any catalog of IP address that belongs with TOR network ? so that I can cross check with that and ascertain TOR traffic or not.  Dhanyawath,  Raju "
701,Suspcious IMAP traffic between my machine and a Tor entry node,"I was running Wireshark and noticed that my machine sends IMAP requests to 37.187.22.131, which, according to my TorBrowser, is the entry node I'm connected to. Likewise, my machine seems to be receiving IMAP responses from that IP as well. The responses seem to often happen in as low as ~30ms from the request. When I ping the entry node, the latency seems to be ~31ms. This leads me to believe that whatever requests my machine is sending, it is the entry node that is responding to them.  I installed another copy of TorBrowser, using a different entry node, and that doesn't seem to have the same problem. Also, when I'm not running a TorBrowser, there is no problem. The data that is being sent and received does not seem to be plain text either, so I don't think this is actual email traffic.  Does anyone know what is going on? I don't think I have any email services running in the background. Even if I did, why would the entry node respond to the requests? Is it possible that the 37.187.22.131 (and one of my copies of TorBrowser) is compromised? Or is IMAP (or IMAP looking) traffic normal for Tor behaviour? "
702,Tails time synchronization wrong (1 hour early). Has this any practical meaning?,"I just installed tails and after connecting to WiFi I get a pop up message saying that Tor needs to sync system time to work properly. After a while I get a new pop up message confirming that the time is synced and Tor is ready to use.  But the time is wrong (1 hour early). Has this any practical meaning? Is everything working properly even though the time is wrong?  I have tested the connection with check.torproject.com and get the following message: ""Congratulations. This browser is configured to use Tor""  Thanks for help on this matter. "
703,One random exit node/IP-address for each new TOR session (but common for all websites) - how to?,"Is it possible to keep one common exit node for all websites/domains during a TOR session?  And this IP address should be different for each new TOR browsers sessions (i.e. random exit node). I mean that the IP address changes when TOR restarts only.  I need this to test for a real exit IP address by different online services on different domains.  I know that it is possible to restrict an exit node to some country codes or IPs. But this is the manual solution (the manual editing of the torrc config each time), not an automatically selecting new exit nodes from a random pool.  I know also how to keep one individual IP address for each domain, but not the common cross-website IP.  So, HOW to restrict the Tor for one cross-domain exit node, which should be chosen automatically each time when I launching the Tor? "

707,Attackers this ways tryed deanonimyze my TOR onion site and get private informations.How to protect our self using system isolation?,"In this forum many user talk about virtualbox,vmware, to isolate the server from the system.And Protecting Hidden services .onion private key from your host its better to store outside from that isolated place what the server is running.But i think it's not enough.Programs like Xampp,Wamp in windows try to install in system drive C:/.With this is the problem if this happend the attacker will acces the system in virtualbox.And they can install more viruses,and backdoor.I think its a way 1. to put the server in a encrypted file (like a VeraCrypt volume,2.Copy this file in the virtual mashine,+ encrypt the virtual mashine too with full disk encryption but with another keys what use the host mashnine.3.Mount this file and run the serven in a non system patrition drive.4 disable USB ports,block drivers,CD,DVD,ports,in virtual mashine block.Turn on network discovery to protect the system to acces back and forth to acces the encrypted virtual system or non system patrition drives.  How can i give more extra protection to protect the system in virtual mashine if the server are cracked like C99 shell,to block the attacker to acces in the operating system in the virtual mashine?  my resoults: Os:Windows 7  Server Xampp for window 7.1.2 / PHP 7.1.2  Tor 0.9.9.10  Run time 3 week  Service: hidden forum  The server installed in a non system patrition drive!!!  The setup:Another programs blocked.Port 80,MSQL allowed,another program activity blocked with firewall.The server installed in a non system patrition drive.Only the MSQL and Apache runned.  The 1. attack: The attackers scanned all bublic and non public URL-s what can accesable from a simple browser.Like server-info,server-status,and defaultly the hidden server information.They can acessed all links what possible available in normal browse without passwords or cracking the server.  The 2. attack: The attackers saved all this page informations and several times goes back some certain links which can contain major information like: User information,website public change information,. They have been saved and fallowed this status.  The 1-2. attack:Some robots constantly but slowly scanned the website.  The 3. attack:Cracking the server.After the first visitor.About 3 week later they have been cracked my server.They uploded a PHP vírus in the phpmyadmin folder.  What did this virus know?: This virus name was  c99 shell.And the attacker renamed the file to abc.php They can search and download files not just the server but another patritions,portable usb,pendrive etc.Its have a web interface.Its looks like a website or a browser. Before this happend i enable all the xampp server cache moduls. This virus script upload the attackers through the server.But its somhow can not acessed the system patrition drive. "
708,IP address conflict,"I have a modem/router combo with phone service, I also have more than one computer running on my network, last evening not to lone after I closed my browser and pulled me flash drive I noticed that my DELL displayed a window with an error stating that there was a conflict between the DELL and the ASUS machines. After doing some looking around in both machines I did find within my ASUS command prompt and the DELL event viewer they did in fact hold the same address. Is this due to the TOR browser? Does TOR configure the network within the modem/router, or is it individual? I had an online chat with my ISP. Simple fix, unplug the router for 10 seconds, shut down both machines before plugging back in, after power up the issue is resolved. "

710,My hidden service fails to load as long as the Tor Browser is open on the same host,"I use my hidden service as a way to access my home computer from my phone securely and regardless of any IP changes.  Today, I installed the Tor Browser. After I launched it, the hidden service became unavailable both from the computer and the phone. The moment I closed it, I could access the service from my phone again.  Obviously, there is a conflict.  Up until now, I used tor. I configured it to run automatically as soon as the system loads. I don't even remember how I did that, and I mean it. Which is also part of the issue, because I can't find any of the configuration files (with the exception of torrc), otherwise, I might have solved the problem by now.  Now, there's a torrc file in /etc/tor. Apparently, the Tor Browser also has one. Could that be the source of the problem? How do I resolve the conflict?  I suppose, I could just ignore the problem and not use the hidden service when I'm using the Tor Browser, but what if I forget to close it and try to access the computer later?  Edit: renaming ./tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/torrc to something else helped, but that's trial and error, I still am not sure what kind of consequences this can cause. Besides, maybe it's just a single line that causes the problem?  I'm not sure if this is the solution or simply a workaround that doesn't actually help to solve the real problem.  That's what I eliminate by essentially removing the torrc file  DataDirectory /opt/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor GeoIPFile /opt/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/geoip GeoIPv6File /opt/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/geoip6 HiddenServiceStatistics 0   For all I know, this might be important.

713,Exitnodes: safe?,"I've configured the torrc file to use a specific exitnode with strictexitnode 1.  I want to know if this compromised my privacy in any way. If I understand it correctly, Tor would still have two different entry and middle nodes, regardless of the exit node setting in the torrc file, which would mean that 99.99999% of the time the entry, middle node and exit node would not be the same and there would be no way to know my real IP address, even to the exit node owner?  Also, I have sent personal information with HTTPS services, using that node, but since it was HTTPS, if I understand correctly, the exit nodes owners would not be able to see it?  And my last question, the receiver of the personal information could see I have used a tor exit node, is that completely legal? if I wasnt doing anything wrong but just using Tor for anonmity?

721,"Can you create a SSH, OpenVPN, or stunnel tunel from Whonix where the other party is a non-Tor machine and pipe Linphone traffic through this tunel","Basic problem of lets say a whistleblower is that he may not wish the person he is communicating with to know his real public IP and often the 3rd party is a non-Tor user so the use of hidden services is not possible as that person cannot access them if he/she is not connected to the Tor network.  Correct me if I am wrong in this, for example if I were to setup a SIP or XMPP server as a Tor hidden service on my local Tor m/c under Linux, could a non-Tor user make connection to my server without being part of the Tor network?  The 3rd party may be technically incapable of coping with Tor or may be unwilling due to not wanting to draw attention to themself that they are using Tor and thereby automatically raising suspicion in oppressive regimes.  So my requirement is I wish to remain anonymous from the gov, and not reveal my real public IP to the 3rd party I am communicating with by using Tor at my end.  To be more specific by using a Whonix Workstation to access the Tor n/w via the Whonix Gateway (both running on the local m/c in seperate VMs under a Debian host OS.  Of course this question is Tor generic and not specific to Whonix.  I wish to create either a SSH, OpenVPN or a stunnel tunnel between my Tor m/c and the 3rd party's non-Tor m/c.  The 3rd party could be running Debian Linux, Windows XP or Windows 7, it shouldn't matter to the overall concept here.  Once I have an encrypted tunnel, I can then use Local Port Forwarding in SSH or stunnel to run whatever servicei I wish through the tunnel.  In my case I wish to use Linphone SIP Softphone at both ends to make encrypted P2P VoIP calls.   If I were not using Tor at my end, I would have setup my own SIP server on my machine and allowed the remote user to connect to it using any SIP client/softphone.  Alternatively I could use a SIP proxy such as the service provided by Linphone where you get a public number ex: tom@domain.com which means you do not have to worry about your public IP address changing, the 3rd party is routed to you via the Linphone service.  I don't really wish to use any 3rd party serice as I do not wish to introduce additional attack vectors via potential side channel attacks which may allow the SIP proxy operator to do a MiTM attack on my SRTP traffic and he would certainly know the real IP of both communicating parties even if he could not attack the crypto.  If anyone knows of any potential risks/attacks in using a Linphone type SIP registration serice, please let me know to help me better understand the process.  In any case AFAIK only the SIP signalling goes via the SIP provider, the actual data in the form of SRTP if its an encrypted session goes P2P in which case the gov would at a minimum know the IP address of both communicating parties.  Please correct me if my understanding is not correct here.  So returning to the issue.  If I could run the SSH or stunnel server on the 3rd party's m/c I can see that it may be workable as I know his/her public IP and can initiate the session from my SIP client to their SIP client or SIP server.  As an aside, when Tor switches circuits say every 10 mins does the exit node get changed too and thereby a new IP address is seen by the remote server you are connected to.  If its a HTTPS session, am I correct in thinking your session is not lost even if your IP changes?  Imagine if you are connected to fb via https, via Tor, and your exit not changes, obviously fb can use cookies to track you so it can ignore the IP address change, but if the application say a SIP or XMPP session is using ZRTP to do authentication, will it not think a MiTM may be taking place as the IP has changed?  Or the session key, unless its stolen by the attacker, is only residing on the 2 machines at the time authentication took place so if a MiTM took place that attacker would not have the session key so the connection would be dropped by the application or at least the user warned that the session key has changed?  SSH for instance would be affected if the session key changed?  Am I correct in thinking that I cannot have the SSH or stunnel server running on my local machine if I am behind Tor and the other party is not using Tor, as they cannot know my IP address to make a connection to?  Any techniques I am missing which would allow a reverse SSH or HTTPS connection from the 3rd party machine back to my server?  Same argument if I wish to use my own XMPP server instead going down the SIP route to have voice/video conversations.  If you can think of any NAT issues as both parties will be behind domestic WiFi routers which use NAT and in my case I am NATing a Whonix Gateway VM to the host OS which uses a WiFi connection for the Internet.  Thanks in advance, apologies for the long winded question, however this is certain a configuration issue which would be very useful to many Tor users, I have certainly been thinking about it for years as to how to keep a local attacker from finding out the real IP of the 3rd parties I communicate with because if they know their IP then they can put pressure on them to reveal my real ID and location.

723,Hidden tor exit nodes,"I was wondering can I run an hidden exit note that only few people know of it, somehow hidden from others?  If not can I protect it via password or something so nobody else can access it?  Or instead should I use a VPN? Is security the same?  Thank you "
724,"From a metadata perspective, what does an entry node know about its clients?","I am wondering what an entry node knows about its users. I know they do not know where you are sending data or what the data is because of onion routing and encryption respectively. But, does TOR take any steps to mask how large of a message a user is sending or how many packets a user is sending? If an entry node does know how many packets and of what relative size a user is sending, would it be possible for such a node to know what protocols are being spoken? "
725,Safe or Dangerous? Attach image to e-mail delivered via Tor,"For example, someone wants to be anonymous and created a dummy Yahoo e-mail account, now he wants to send an image over the newly created email via Tor. Does this protect his anonymity? Can you someone be traced by attaching an image to emails delivered via Tor? What alternatives does he have? "
726,Is Tor responsible for content on websites?,"I enjoy using Tor very much since discovering it. I find the biggest problem is the prevalence of child exploitation on various .onion sites, while looking for adult porn which I already feel ashamed of looking at. I didn't intend to use Tor for porn reasons and I hopefully have nailed the last nail in the coffin of this bad habit, but it makes me wonder:  Although Tor itself isn't responsible for this content on the websites, but at the same time is the only gateway to them, is not some responsibility in removing child pornography and other exploitation of innocent people partly their/our responsibility?  I don't agree with closing down other services, but to take the innocence of childhood and mix it with the other sections of this website is abhorrent to any decent human, and those that have problems with this need to get help.  I don't know how, as I believe that those who have this problem will find most avenues disciplining them rather than helping them overcome it, due to the stigma, even though it is an illness that needs working with.  Back on subject though, if the perspective was ""fix it or lose it"", would Tor be more inclined to remove access to these sites that do this? "
727,What about Tor light?,"Recently unscrupulous marketers in the U.S. were allowed to collect data from all their customers and resell that data. That's why I'm using Tor for pretty much everything I do.  However, I only need a light type of privacy. In my case my data doesn't have to go from The Netherlands to Canada and from there to Germany (and back).  Would it be a good idea to introduce a light version of Tor? My data would only go to one foreign IP address (and back).   The advantage would be that Tor light should work faster since my data only needs to go to one foreign IP address. Another advantage would be that there's less Internet traffic as well, also because my data doesn't have to visit three countries before getting where it should be.  I imagine that, when installing Tor, users could choose whether or not to use Tor light, but that that choice could be changed later in the settings.  Any reactions? "
728,How to update Tor Browser,"Following the instructions at How to run multiple Tor browsers with different IPs? I now have multiple folders that can host a different Tor Browser instance.

730,Tor updated and now won't work on my system(OSX 10.7.5). Is there a way to get rid of that update?,"The title pretty much says it all.  I've been using TOR for about two years with no problems after any update…..until now!  I'm on a mac(OSX 10.7.5 Lion) and while it's not the newest(or oldest), i run into very few problems. This one is major for me though.  Is there a way, at this point, to delete the update and run the previous version?                               Possibly somewhere in the application package contents there is something to look for??  If not, is there a place to download(safely) any version pre-update? I don't see it on the TOR website.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanx  BTW, This is my first time using the stack exchange so i apologize if breaking any etiquette rules. "
731,What is passed to the Onion Proxy in terms of the OSI model?,"I'm trying to understand at what layer does the SOCKS proxy receive. For example, if I visit a website and make a HTTP get to the web server it is passed through via SOCKS to make the request.    At the SOCKS server or Onion Proxy, after the circuit creation, key exchanges, etc., what does it receive and how does Tor package/wrap the HTTP get request into its cell. I ask this because I created a SOCKS server and read the buffer and it outputted the application data (host, user-agent), so does Tor split those (application byte stream) into 512 bytes cells and add the respective cell headers? Then what about the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) or TCP data transfer. Do those need to be packaged into cells as well? I ask this because does the client connect the TCP handshake or does the exit node handle that? I never quite understood the initiation process. If it's the first, then are the syn, syn-ack, ack packets sent via onion routing individually or if its the latter then does the exit node just pass the data down the stream, so that there is two connections: client onion routing to exit and exit to web server? Relating to questioon 1, how does the web server receive and interpret those cells? I'm assuming the exit node's SOCKS proxy server handling the incoming (?) and outgoing traffic somehow strips the cell data. But not really sure on the details.   Apologies for the lengthy questioning, any insights would be appreciated.   "

733,Does Tor choose nodes from nearby countries to create circuits?,"I am from a European country, and usually the circuits created by Tor include nearby European countries (although Tor sometimes chooses nodes from remote countries, but this is very rare). My question is: does Tor choose nodes from nearby countries by default?  I understand that maybe this is due to latency: if I am in a European country, and Tor always creates circuits like: Argentina - Azerbaijan - South Africa, the connection will probably go very slowly.  So, does Tor choose nodes from nearby countries by default?  Thanks in advance. "

735,Difficulties right off the bat,"What the heck is a relay &amp; an Exit relay? I assume that if I have to pay for bandwidth then operating as an exit relay is both costly &amp; unwise? How can I determine whether I am set up as an exit relay?  I have read all the stuff presented, but clearly it's not intended to help the uninitiated. I gave up attempting to check the Tor download signature file, here again complexity seems to be the objective.  In 2017 no-one should ever have to contemplate using a command line sequence of instructions to simply verify a file has the correct signature. Frankly not understandable to anyone even with some modest IT skills. "

737,Connect from New Country without restarting TOR Browser,"Is it possible to change the IP address without restarting the Tor Browser?  So, each time we start the Tor Browser, it connects through a new node. Would it be possible to do the following?   In a Browser such as FireFox, set the SOCKS5 proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port 9050. Keep the Browser Session running. Edit the torrc file with new value for ExitNodes and each time restart the tor service.   For example:  ExitNodes {US} service tor restart   After this, edit the node to some other country:  ExitNodes {fr}   And then restart Tor service again:  service tor restart  "
738,What is the safest way to keep TBB up to date?,"In the past these questions were asked about updating Tor Browser Bundle:   How can I switch from one Tor Browser Bundle version to another? How do I keep my Tor Browser Bundle current?   For a while now we have had an updater, what I would like to know is: Is it still safer to download and verify the tarball &amp; sig from the downloads page and copy the directory that contains your entry guards into the new Browser (once you have extracted it) than it is to just run the updater?  Not taking the convenience of the updater into account.  My main concern being that unless I am mistaken it is harder to verify that you were not the victim of a MitM attack during the update if you use the updater.  To summarize: I am unsure of how the updater verifies the integrity of updates, but how does it compare from a security perspective against the old way described in the linked questions? "
739,"How to keep (or import) the Tor Browser's history, when updating from an older version to TBB 5.0?","Is it possible to keep (or import) the Tor Browser's history data (not the bookmarks) when updating from an older version to TBB 5.0? And if so, then how?  Background: Using TBB as my ""default browser"" for almost one year now with LinuxMint, I somewhen decided to switch on the browsing history, as well as address completion and decent caching (due to data limits on my mobile internet connection).  I haven't agreed to update ever since though, because the former manual TBB update process would dispose of all the convenient history and completion data :-(  While trying out the new TBB 5.0 I discovered that it has a nice+smooth Auto-Updater (similar to the normal Firefox-Updater) which will probably keep  these data from now on. Now that is great work, Thanks a lot! - But still, how can I transfer my old browsing history into the new version 5.0?  P.S. In case there is NO way - then how can I start-up the old TBB in an ""offline mode"" (i.e. without connecting to the Tor network), to use it just as a reference when searching for an old page address I can't remember any more?  Thank you very much in advance for any reply! Warm regards from Dresden, Germany - Ulf "

743,Is it possible to setup a private TOR relay,"I have a proxy setup on one of my machines which is behind a router. And I need to use that proxy from another network.  But my problem is that I cannot forward ports from the router to the proxy machine. :( So I have no way to connect to the machine from outside.  To avoid this, I thought of setting up the proxy machine as a Single hop Tor relay instead and use only that node from my machine (using Tor).  But I want the relay to be private (only to be used by my machine).  Is this even possible? Or am I over-complicating this? Is there a simpler approach? (with or without Tor).  Why I am not using the standard Tor relays is that I need a stable connection 24*7 and Tor network doesn't seem to be stable always. :( "
744,Does enabling java let my ISP find out what I am doing?,"As the title says: if I enable javascript can my ISP know what I am doing? As in do I become transparent (somehow) to my ISP? I am only interested to know the ISP side, as the tor FAQ (&amp;co) are quite clear on the visited address side.  To give a quick example, suppose I am at a concert, in a crowd, somewhere. If I talk to a person I don't want others to know that I talk to that person or what. Of course, this is only for the case I am enabling javascript. If this happens, I accept that the other person knows.    My apologies, I should have mentioned this is directly (strictly) related to the tor borwser. I thought being in the tor SE would make this redundant,  parently I was wrong. "
745,How to use a specific proxy on EXIT node?,"I would like to know, if there is any way to use a proxy at exit of TOR? I have read a lot of manuals, how to set up exit nodes for a specific country, but that is not what I need. I need to visit a site with a transparent proxy server, but it is not safe enough just to set up the proxy in regular browser. I need to access the site trough the Tor, then into the specific proxy server, and through that server to the targeted website. Is that possible? "
746,Designing P2P application over Tor,"I am building a P2P C++ application that uses tor as a socks proxy to connect to the internet. This P2P app will only connect to other users running the same application, so all the communication between this app and the wild world would be through Tor.  I am very new to Tor, but the first thing I think of would be to configure Tor to create a hidden service (with an .onion url) and that would be the IP for other users to connect to? Is this procedure is safe enough or should I try other methods? Could I connect to a port of that specific .onion url to avoid http requests (myonionurlf2e9k51a.onion:8751)? "
747,TOR traffic correlation: how quickly can you be de-anonymized?,"I know that statistical analysis of the data entering and leaving the TOR network can be used to de-anonymise users given enough time. [website]How long in practice would a 'passive adversary' have to observe the network before he could identify you? Are we talking minutes? days? weeks? And by 'adversary' i don't mean a hacker with a low boredom threshold, i mean e.g. a group with decent resources to throw at the problem. Say e.g. the FBI as a worst case in terms of a strong adversary with knowhow, expertise and resouces. And what kind of things make somebody more easy to 'cull from the herd' as a TOR user? "
748,Can Tor nodes know their position in the circuit?,"It is documented which node knows what.  I'm wondering if the nodes in the circuit know their own relative position. For normal three relay paths, they certainly can infer their position: the exit knows -since it's connecting outside- the middle knows since it's connecting two known nodes, the entry knows since it's connecting a (unknown) client with a known node.  Now, were you to build a 4-hop circuit, would the two middle ones know whether they're in position #2 or #3? My guess is that they would, specially since guards are only used as guards and exits are only used as exits.  From that, it follows you'd need at least 6 hops for some nodes not to know their position, but how is data framed? Can a node infer how many nodes are ahead of it, just from the encrypted payload size? "
749,VPN Router + Tor and 2nd VPN Local Machine Clarifications,"Hello my question is I have my router configured to connect through a vpn (VPN A). Thus all Internet traffic on my network goes through a vpn. If I run tor on a local machine with a 2nd vpn (VPN B), does this cause vpn b to create a tunnel within the tunnel create by vpn a? Also does the tor browser still successfully give me anonymity with this setup?

If the best way around this issue is to first use a VPN to access Tor, which VPN could I use? So many have recently been shut down in China. CyberGhost, SurfEasy, etc. are all blocked by Papa Xi.

Being a sceptic, I wanted to try it myself. I didn't find a ready tool, so I started to examine Stem package. I was able to get the fingerprint of the public key of a random server, but not the public key itself. The fingerprint did not give reasonable address when encoded to base32 and concatenated to 16 chars. Then I read that address is not just a hash of the public key.  3) Apparently information at tor project site is outdated?  4) Could I calculate .onion domain address from a fingerprint or other information I receive from descriptor?

Do you know if the improvements proposed in the paper could be incrementally implemented in the Tor architecture? Or is there some fundamental difference between the two? "
765,How can I start obfs4proxy.exe without starting Tor Browser?,"Under WIN7 platform, when I start tor browser, there is a job running in taskmanager named `obfs4proxy.exe.   How can i start it through command-line since I don't need tor browser?  By the way, I can run tor.exe from command-line, so now I need obfsproxy.exe to run, but when I run it in cmd line, it always says:      obfs4proxy - must be run as a managed transport.   Anyone can help me? "
766,Will Tor keep my info anonymous?,"If I use search engines like Google (within Tor) and visit sites that come up in the search results, will those sites know that I visited them? Will they have my IP or personal information? Or will my information be anonymous? I want to protect myself, because in the past, a hacker/troll got my IP. I performed a search for a project I was working on for school. I clicked on the first result and was connected to an IRC channel. The owner of the channel began harassing me and my husband by sending us death threats, all because I accidentally ended up in his chatroom. I don't want this to happen ever again. Will using Tor protect me and my identity from people like this in the future?  I have to add this information in via editing, because I don't have enough points to comment yet. The threats received were via the IRC channel, email and phone. He threatened to kill me and my husband if I ever joined his chatroom again. Then he called my husband's work pretending to be his father. He said that he needed to know my husband's schedule because he was picking him up at work. My husband's father lives across the country. Then the guy emailed me letting me know that he was the one who called my husband's work. We even filed reports with the police and FBI. The police said that they wouldn't actually do anything about it because they had real crimes to deal with like B&amp;E's. These are reasons why I want to be safe online. Will Tor protect my information? If I use a search engine and click on one of the results, will my information be completely anonymous if I visit that site using Tor? "
767,What is the purpose of the .onion domain?,"I do understand the point of the TOR network in order to anonymize your connections, especially in states where you don't have much liberties. That's probably a good thing.  However what is the point of creating the .onion domain? I mean on it there is only ""illegal""/""bad thing"" (selling drugs, weapons, etc...). If someone wants to write some content in repressive states, he can use the TOR network or VPN to get a hosting in a country where he can express what he wants.  So I understand the point the creation of the TOR network, it probably brings good thing to the humanity. But what about the .onion domain? I can see only bad things from that...  Please explain. Thank you. "
768,Why is it when i go to .onion sites that I'm told that my connection is not secure or encrytped?,"Okay so I'm fairly new to actually using Tor, but I have known about it for years. I have read many things on how to stay secure and anonymous while on Tor. I also have the Tor browser security settings on max, so the safest ones yet also the strictest. My question is how come when i visit a .onion address such as the hidden wiki why is it when i click on the information button on the left of the address bar say your connection is not secure or encrypted? Should i be worried and mainly how do i fix this ,or am i just worrying to much and this is just normal? I'm just excited and want to explore the deep web ,but more importantly do it securely and anonymously. So i will delay my exploration until this issue is resolved. Thank you all in advanced if you can help me with this issue have a great day.  "
769,Tails storage size,"From the limited amount I understand, tails runs on the ram of the computer you boot it to. So what decides the storage capacity? (Regular storage, not persistent storage.) For instance, when i download a file it is automatically saved to the file Tor Browser, not Tor Browser (persistant). Does that mean that the file is stored on the ram, therefore the capacity is dependent on how much ram the system has? Minus however much the os is using? Or is it stored somewhere else? "
770,nginx leaks my hidden service port number,"I have my .onion service running:  [website]When i try to open wrong link, my TorBrowser shows me an error like this:  Firefox can’t establish a connection to the server at oeptyn6jtusgda63.onion:7541.  Is there some way i can prevent nginx to leak my server port number?  I have learned myself, that nginx first send redirection (http code 301) that leaks my port number. Is there some way i can disable it?  UPD :  This happens when i try to access some directory, like this:  [website]"
771,What is up with these longer onion addresses?,"Some number of years ago, I heard that one of the reasons that Tor does not allow anything longer than a 1024-bit RSA key as an onion service's private key is because the address would be a lot longer, meanwhile they're already uncomfortably long and hard to remember.  But I just came across this question regarding CloudFlare's new access channel to their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver over a Tor Hidden Service, and the appearance of the address shocked me: [website]How on Earth is the address that long? I don't have the resources to test right now, nor have I found any explanations online, but this looks like the result of the Tor Project implementing longer RSA keys for hidden services. Is that true? If not, what is going on here? The address is valid and accessible, I was able to check that. "
772,Configuring my Tor browser to use more than three relays (nodes),"The title of the question speaks for it self. Can I configure Tor to use more than three relays (nodes)? I suppose that it won't be possible inside the native Tor Browser, because that can only use three. However, is there maybe another browser, which can connect to the Tor network and use e.g. four relays or more? "
773,Does tails leave any history on the live boot usb?,"I was just wondering if tails leaves any history on the bootable usb itself? I know most of the processes and etc are all done with the cpu and ram, and once the computer is turned off history is gone. But wasn't sure on the USB part? Does it leave any browser history or anything on the usb, if the usb ever got compromised?  Thanks "
774,Detailed Understanding of Tor's connection establishment,"I am really new to Onion Routing and Tor and I have just started reading about the topic on Wikipedia and the Tor Protocol Specification. Most of the concepts are explained very well but I have problems understanding some of the more complex points.  To begin with, how exactly does the connection establishment work?  In the torspec it says that there are at least three possible handshakes (v1, v2 and v3) that differ in the way they exchange the certificates. But do the relays (or the client and a relay) really exchange the certificates upfront or do they perform a TLS handshake first?  In a Tor-design paper (see link below) in section 4.2 (page 5) there is a figure that shows a (simplified) two-hop-circuit. The figure focuses on the encryption of the circuit, which is very interesting to see. What I would like to do is (mentally) draw a figure that includes all communication paths during the connection establishment, e.g.: the TLS handshake, the certificate exchange, the ClientHello, the Tor protocol version that is used, and so on.  Are there any other figurs, specifications or papers that clarify that process? Or can anyone explain this in a short, but detailed way?  Link to the Tor Protocol Specification: [website]Link to the Tor-design paper: [website]"
775,What kinds of attack can a bridge carry out?,"I have been recently doing some research on anonymity implications of using a bridge, and wrote a tool (not very well written though) for setting up a malicious bridge node. However, I am not clear about the attack power that such a bridge has.  Questions:  Does a bridge have any extra attack power other than being the guard-and-dirguard node?  Are there other uncanny attacks that a malicious bridge can perform?  What if something like GFW launches massive MITM attack against bridge connections (since the fingerprint in bridge lines doesn't always come in handy and is often dropped)? "
776,No traffic on obfs4 bridge,"I am running an obfs4 bridge on my raspberry pi since 10 days now and haven't seen a single client since then.  My torrc looks like this:  RunAsDaemon 1 ORPort 9001 ExitRelay 0 BridgeRelay 1 ControlPort 9051 CookieAuthentication 1 ServerTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy ExtORPort auto   From the logs I can read that the obfs4 service is listening on port 39147, so I have port forwarded it along with port 9001.  The self-test is also positive:  Jul 07 13:38:56.000 [notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor. Jul 07 13:39:00.000 [notice] Performing bandwidth self-test...done.   Is this completely normal behaviour and due to the fact that bridges are not listed publicly? Are there simply not many obfs4 clients around? Or is it a misconfiguration?  I'd really like to contribute to the tor project as best as I can, and due to having low bandwidth running a bridge seems the only way. "
777,How to use tor safely?,I have the orbot app on my android but my biggest concern is the dangers of using tor. I want to use it for researching &amp; information but hear the horror stories of hacker and stuff. Also and i can be wrong as i don't know much about tor but don't other people traffic pass through my network so if someone is doing shady stuff i can look like it's coming from me?   I just want to use it for the huge information it has and really would like to skip the major draw backs. Any advice? I use tunnel bear vpn is that good enough to stop hackers and such?

784,Connecting to Tor via infected android phone (hotspot),"So I the only way I have access to Internet right now is via my android phone, I am pretty sure it's compromised because the adversary is a bunch of people with high technical knowledge. I tried to wipe the partitions and install a clean rom but this isn't the topic I want to discuss here.  I only use Tails os, so all the traffic is encrypted, my concern is can that traffic be intercepted and/or deciphred when it goes through my phone?  As far as I understand the purpose of tor is to encrypt packets sent and received from my machine, how likely is a hacker can read that data and know what websites I'm connecting to?  Tails give me peace of mind since it runs on ram and I do not have setup the persistence storage feature so all I'm worried about is the data in the tor browser?  For the sake of simplicity and because I don't have enough details about the type of attack, let's say I install an app like wireshark or similar on my android phone, what type of data can I get? "
785,Using VPN to hide TOR,"I've read discussions where some people advocate starting VPN first, then TOR and other recommend start TOR, then run the VPN.  Whichever way I connect, if I go to whoer.net or stilllistener.com to check my anonymity they always show the IP of the last TOR node.  Never the IP of the VPN.  Is this normal?  IF at least one method should show the VPN IP, what do I need to check / configure to make it happen please?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you. "
786,using Tor in regular OS vs Whonix/Tails,"I was wondering, what exactly are the differences between using Tor Browser in a regular Linux distribution such as Debian, versus using it in Whonix or Tails, in terms of privacy / anonymity?  If there actually are differences, would it also be recommendable to just run Whonix / Tails as a VM within a regular Linux OS? "
787,Tor router validation,"my question is how does Tor validate routers? There are some specifications that mention that there are ""validated"" nodes, which have a ""valid"" flag (e.g. [website]How does Tor determine whether a node is valid or not? I couldn't figure it out of that reference.  If you have an answer, please also provide a reference. "
788,How does an OR create keys?,"Unfortunately, I couldn't find any reference to that question. Does Tor implement an own key generation for the RSA keys (and the other keys) or does the OR use an external implementation for that?  And if they implement it by themselves, how does the algorithm work exactly? "

793,Orbot - prevent startup IP leaks,"I know that Android leaks during startup, before it has loaded iptables from a firewall. This of course is a big issue when trying to hide the true IP from an app in Orbot / Orwall.  This might sound odd, but if these leaks only happen during startup, wouldn't it be possible to just wrap the phone in some standard tinfoil if you need to reboot it (which is like once a month for a lot of people)? Would this suffice to prevent any connections until it's booted and iptables are loaded? If this actually works, it would prevent a lot of headaches trying to fix the impossible. "

I tried reverse tethering app ""reverse tether"" (in the screenshot) and test connected to non tor virtual machine and it connects OK, but as soon as I route that VM to whonix GW, reverse tether app don't connect. (Both whonix GW and WS connects to tor)  I am not very knowledgeable about networks, so if someone can help what IP addresses (desired IP, gateway IP) should I set in reverse tether app in android, so it make it connect and work? Or which settings should be changed so I can finally connect android to Tor?   "
795,Is it useful to use ISP's DHCP to regularly change IP address of bridge relays?,"I maintain a few Tor middle relays on different broadband connections, so I’m relatively familiar with running the Tor software on small Linux and FreeBSD servers.  My next project might be to set up a bridge relay, since I assume they’re a quite scarce resource. I want the Tor network and its users to get the most out of the bandwidth I can donate, so here's a thing I've been pondering.  To my understanding, bridges have a tendency to get blacklisted by oppressive entities relatively quickly.  So I’m wondering: would I provide a useful service to network at large by hosting a bridge relay and then changing its ip address every now and then, for the purpose of having a ""fresher asset"" to offer the network?  Specifically: it would be trivial for me to set up a bridge relay on a broadband connection. I could do something simple like presenting a different MAC address on the WAN interface to get a different ip address from the ISP’s DHCP service, and perhaps even automate this process to take place at random every 30-90 days.  I mean: Is there a sufficiently large variation in how sophisticated adversaries are in blocking bridges for users who need them, for the Tor network to make actual use of bridges with IPs that fluctuate within a single ISP’s regional address space?  Or is this a futile exercise that just would get traffic to and from my ISP’s entire customer IP address space filtered and scrutinized by the kinds of networks that already force its users to rely on Tor bridges?  "
796,Could Someone attack tails firmware through tails?,Could Someone attack tails firmware through tails?  I have noticed that some applications on OS does not require administrative privilege. Such is the browser add-on such as the one that can be used now to download tails. So will it be better if we broaden the administrative privilege granting requirements to include more security for the OS. If someone send a payload to the tails OS which will it or will not result in that payload flashing my firmware. Most such payloads may some may not or they contain a flash utility. Would tails prevent such utilities from working without administrative privilege set?   If not is it possible for tails to broaden the administrative privileges to include such utilities from functioning with administrative privilege set and not without super user rights set Or just remove this function or code all together?  In the case of UEFI there may or may not be an added method of reaching the firmware. Most prior Linux kernels did not support firmware updates. Now there have been improvement in the kernel to include UEFI updates. Most new kernels and some old ones still as well support firmware updates. Does tails remove the code that courses such updates?   If not is the case would it not provide more security for the OS if such function code be removed from the tails OS?

798,How to get into Tor network if provider is using deep packet inspection?,"I have been using Tor on Linux for at least 5 years, without a problem from within enterprise network. I have set Tor network like a year or two ago to only use 80 and 443 ports to get pass the enterprise firewall and to always use brides with Obfs4 proxy. Now I got into a problem of not being able to connect to Tor network.  Few days ago my Tor connection stopped working. I got information from reliable source that enterprise bought new specialized firewall and now it is using deep packet inspection on ports 80 (only allowing pure http) and 443 (only allowing pure https). The intention was to get rid of TeamViewer installations that are using ports 80 and 443 to bypass VPN server. To overcome this problem in Tor configuration wizard I have removed only use 80 and 443 ports to be used by Tor and my Tor connection was working fine up until now.  Now I can't establish Tor connection again. I got information from reliable source that enterprise is in next stage of filtering and has start fighting against using Tor network.

799,"Implementing the tor protocol, based on tor sources and a few clarifications","Im trying to implement a simple c# application that is based on tor protocol, without identity changes every few minutes etc. just to create a circuit and make a request. I created the onion hidden service, and i want to try make a http request to it and receive an answer first. I have read all the specs, and i looked up the tor source code, but its really hard, because it is using very low-level C. So far what i understood from the technical point of view is this, if i want to fetch the main page of my onion hidden service i have to:   1) Choose a random directory server that is serving onion routers microdescriptors ( there are 10 hardcoded, but 1 is serving only the bridges )  2) Connect to dir server, fetch a consesus document /tor/status-vote/current/consensus/ using HTTP protocol, close the connection. 3) Parse the list of onion routers, construct the    curicuit from 3 nodes. 4) Parse the entry node with the attributes    Fast Guard HSDir Running Stable Valid 5) Parse the exit node with    the attributes Fast Exit HSDir Running Stable Valid 6) Parse the    random middle node? Is it just a OR in the list without Exit or    Guard attributes? Or any OR with attributes Exit or Guard can    also be used as a middle node? 7) Create a tcp socket and connecto to    the parsed entry node with the given ip port. Then Create a cell packet with the command CREATE with the payload of Diffie-Hellman handshake. Receive a command CREATED wit the encryption key. 8) Form a relay cell packet with command RELAY_EXTEND containing the ip port of the middle node, and encrypted  half handshake for the middle relay, with the key we parsed from previous action, send it to the connected entry node, receive an answer as RELAY_EXTENDED packet, parse new encryption key from it. And use it later to encrypt last diffie hellman handhskae payload. 9) Do the previous action, send RELAY_EXTEND, to the guard node, but with the address of the exit node, and encrypted diffie helman handhskae with the key we received from middle node. 10) I guess that is it? The curcuit is ready? Now i can use a relay cell packets,sending them to my guard node socket connection, encrypted with the key i received from exit node with RELAY_BEGIN to connect to hosts, RELAY_DATA to send data to them?

805,Does tails have a penetrable firewall?,Does tails have a penetrable firewall?  Currently tails firewall has a very complicated structure to it. It is difficult to say if the firewall is penetrable or not. One might think it is not when it is.  Currently tails firewall allows both encrypted and unencrypted TCP data to go through it. This is evident as tails still has the unsecured browser. Tails may be made a more secure OS by preventing the firewall from allowing unencrypted data. This may prevent a local hack against tails or an attack directed against tails from the ISP or an attacker hacking the ISP to hack a tails OS. There are some OS that are used on routers that  can route based on protocol. It may be possible to route of TLS/SSL data. This is called policy based routing. Policy based routing is present in DD-WRT routers. This routing method combined with dropping all the packets that are not in the policy may result in a pure encrypted data. I am not saying to make tails a routing OS but use something similar to this function to make tails OS more secure. Using this in tails OS or something similar like that may prevent the unintended (unencrypted) data packets from getting through the firewall in tails OS. This may make tails a more secure OS. Yes this will mean that the unsecured browser will need to be removed from the tails OS. I believe that the Unsecured browser is hardly used on tails and would not be missed. I for one have  never used it. If you need to keep the unsafe browser for captive portals then you could may be have it be included as an option on start up like the browser used for hidden services and start tails in an unsecured mode.  Would it be more secure if tails were to drop all TCP unencrypted data? Could this be done to tails firewall?

Can somebody explain how the check.tp.o query works, for normal users, so its clear why this happens?  In particular, what are all the cases that can lead to false negatives? I think the two big ones are ""the exit relay makes outbound connections from a different IP address than it lists in the directory, and the Tordnsel tester hasn't caught it yet or otherwise has a bug"" and ""that exit relay only came up recently so check doesn't know about it yet"".  When users encounter one of these false negatives, should they use a separate ""IP check"" website like ipchicken.com to check/verify?   Why did TBB 3.0 switch to using a local homepage instead of using Tor Check? What are the benefits? "
818,Why do some websites reset my session?,"When I visit some web sites, there is some strange behaviour. First I can browse through the page without any problems. Then out of nowhere I land again on the main page. After this happened I can browse again like nothing happened.  Is there a chance that this comes from Tor usage (I have only encountered this behaviour while using Tor.)? If yes, is there anything I can do about? "
819,How do I know if my bridge is actually useful to the Tor network?,"I set up a Tor bridge a couple of days ago, but it sees hardly any traffic.  How can I check that I did everything right and my bridge is actually registered in the Tor network?  And can I find out if it's actually useful? "
820,May I do security inspection on exit relays?,"If I decide to run an exit relay may I run security inspection (Intrusion Prevention System, anti-spam, anti-malware etc.) on the traffic leaving the Tor network? Would this be considered legally and ethically correct? Can I let the Tor users know that there is such a security policy on the exit relay? "
821,How can Tor users and Tor Network protect themselves from an exit node that is actively logging or manipulating exit traffic?,"Tor Exit nodes are the last hop in the circuit a Tor client establishes to reach a service in the Internet. Exit nodes handle the actual traffic of the client, either it's encrypted or not.   That means that exit nodes are able to perform logging or various traffic manipulation attacks, harming client's anonymity. An attacker could intercept data or swap them. Even if the client uses SSL to the destination an attacker could try to bypass that using a known attack on SSL.  Is the client able to detect a malicious bevaviour from an exit node? If the client does detect it is there a way to report and possibly block that particular exit node? Has Tor Network found a way to protect itself by such attacks in an automatic way without user's intervention ? "
822,"How can one make Tor faster, when willing to to sacrifice anonymity?","It's clear, with special configs of this kind, anonymity will suffer. But if one is aware of that and willing to accept that...  How can one make Tor faster?  How can one use only fast relays? Will that actually help? "
823,How to use Tor behind a http-only proxy?,"A proxy supports only http. No http""s"". Connect method not supported.  In other words, a client can only visit http port 80. Anything else is unsupported.  Can Tor be used in such an environment? How?  EDIT: This questions is not about DPI. It is about the requirement to set an upstream http proxy in Tor's torrc proxy settings. "
824,Can ReachableAddresses be on separate lines?,"Can ReachableAddresses be on separate lines? Like this:  ReachableAddresses accept *:80 ReachableAddresses accept *:443   Or does it have to fit into one? Like this:  ReachableAddresses accept *:443, accept *:80  "
825,How can website fingerprinting be prevented?,"Recent research [PDF] has shown that website fingerprinting works with Tor.  Website fingerprinting = Determine what website is visited based on certain characteristics even when encryption is applied.  Users:  Can users alter their behavior to prevent or make fingerprinting more difficult?  Websites:  What can websites do to make it more difficult for an adversary to fingerprint their users?  Tor/TorBrowserBundle(TBB):  Are there effective, at least, efficient techniques that can be implemented to make it more difficult or even impossible. For example ScrambleSuit aims to be more sophisticated than current pluggable transports. Would it help regarding fingerprinting of websites and be feasible to deploy on the whole Tor network? "
826,"When I click ""New Identity"", why do I sometimes end up with the same exit relay?","Three variants on the same question:  If I click ""new identity"" in Tor Browser to get a new circuit, why does my new circuit sometimes have the same exit relay as the last circuit? Doesn't that hurt my anonymity?  Does clicking ""new identity"" replace only my exit relay, or does it replace the whole circuit?  What is the difference between clicking ""new identity"" in Vidalia and clicking it in Torbutton? Which should I use? "
827,Why doesn't the Tor Browser Bundle include CAcert root cert?,CAcert is a community based approach to create a certificate authority. Many sites use it (i.e. CCC). However the root certificate is not yet present in major browsers and also not in the Tor Browser Bundle. I consider them as a trustworthy organisation and really would love to see the root certificate in any browser.   How hard is it to include it into TBB? Why isn't the root cert included into TBB?  
828,OnionBrowser for iOS -- how secure is it?,"Currently it seems there are no torproject.org ""officially sanctioned"" solutions for iOS. However, there is a browser called OnionBrowser that passes check.torproject.org and is able to access hidden services on the tor network.   So my question is, do we know how secure it is compared to running tor from Vidalia or even Orbot?  Aside from the following warnings provided by OnionBrowser:     Caveats:   HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tags will leak &lt;video&gt;-related DNS queries and data transfer outside of Tor.      Javascript cannot be disabled, HTML5 Geolocation API cannot be disabled.   I guess one concern I have is how often the other tor software is updated and the inherent lag with availability of updates from both the developer and the App Store itself.   Otherwise is there anything I should know about using this to access  Tor?  Is it ill-advised  in scenarios where security or anonymity is important? "
829,What can I do to reduce risk of malicious traffic leaving my exit relay besides setting the exit policy?,I am considering running an exit relay. Unfortunately this opens possibility of legal issues and traffic restrictions from my Internet Service Provider. See Abuse FAQ and Legal FAQ.  There is a nice blog article recommending what to do: Tips for Running an Exit Node with Minimal Harassment.   I can set the exit policy to limit potentially problematic ports and and IP addresses reachable from the exit relay using ExitPolicy option in torrc. I can limit the bandwidth by using *Bandwidth* options in torrc. I should not perform security inspection on the traffic leaving the Tor network because it is being considered bad. See May I do security inspection on exit relays?   Are there other means which I can use to limit possible malicious traffic leaving my exit relay?

831,Tor time-size attack,"What makes it impossible for spying agencies to track whom the user is communicating to by guessing to which packet coming in corresponds a packet going out, based on the very small difference in time and the size of the packet? Is noise caused by the huge amount of transactions the only element that prevents it? If so, wouldn't the client picking a path composed of only low-traffic nodes compromise it? "

833,What exactly are Tor DNS servers?,I am using Tor for a while and I don't understand what exactly are it's DNS?  I have a few website that can't be open when I use Tor because it's DNS server can't find it's IP! Can't we change it's DNS or do something to find my website without using my ISP DNS server's? My OS is UBUNTU + Tor browser bundle with Firefox.  Can we saw what DNS server the Browser using with addon or something? 
834,Does caploader able to identify Tor traffic in the network?,I found this blog post which says that they were able to identify Tor traffic by using a software called caploader?

836,Tor Exit Relay safe to use?,"I have gone against advice and set up an exit relay. Let's face it more are needed and I am happy to help, I have unlimited broadband and can not think of any better way to use it!  I wanted to know, is it ok for me to continue to use the same PC for normal internet use? Or should I use an entirely different PC for my own use? Is it safe to use your own personal PC or Laptop as a Tor Exit Relay? And also for shopping etc? Or is it unsafe to use a PC assigned as a Tor exit relay for personal use? "
837,How does Tor transparent proxying work?,"I would like to configure my wireless router as an ""anonymizing middlebox"" for guests. I have read the directions here.  The tutorial, as I understand:   Creates a wireless network and assigns it to a firewall zone named 'transtor'. It then adds rules to REJECT all incoming and forwarding traffic. ACCEPTs incoming traffic to UDP port 67 for DHCP. ACCEPTs incoming TCP traffic to Tor's transparent proxying port and DNS proxy port. Then configures PREROUTING redirections (using firewall.user) to REDIRECT all DNS requests to Tor and all TCP traffic to Tor's transparent proxying port.   The thing I don't understand is in the last bullet. As far as I understand:   The client wants to connect, say, to google.com:80, therefore it looks the address up. The DNS request gets redirected to Tor's DNS port, which then returns Google's IP. The client then tries to connect (IP of Google):80, which the firewall REDIRECTs to (IP of Google):9040. The SYN packet then gets rejected by the router, because it would be forwarding traffic. If (by some miracle or DNS trickery) Tor would actually get the packet, how would it know to what port the packet was originally destined to? Or to what host, for that matter; the packet now has (router's IP):9040 as its destination.   I don't ask for a solution to a problem, I just want an explanation on how this particular setup is supposed to work and what I am missing. In the 3rd point I considered the case in which Tor's DNS always returns its own IP, but then how does it know what host:port the new incoming SYN is for?  Thanks in advance for answers. Also, I have already asked this question on Network engineering, where it was closed as off-topic. If this is also not the right place to ask this question, please kindly tell me so before closing and offer an alternate place if possible. "
838,Can intermediary nodes learn the length of a circuit?,"This should be impossible because of the layered encryption, but some documentation suggests that this can somehow be done.  From Section 5.6 [1] of tor's specification  When speaking v2 of the link protocol or later, clients MUST only send     EXTEND cells inside RELAY_EARLY cells.  Clients SHOULD send the first ~8     RELAY cells that are not targeted at the first hop of any circuit as     RELAY_EARLY cells too, in order to partially conceal the circuit length.  RELAY_EARLY cells were introduced to prevent arbitrary-length circuits to be established, as described in proposal 110 [2]. But even that one does not provide a reliable answer.  So why 'partially conceal'? How could a middle-node of a circuit gain information about circuit's length? Is there any more research about this available somewhere?

841,Trusting the Tor Browser Bundle with credentials,"I am aware that a login to google or whatever other site will leave me unmasked and destroys my anonymity.

844,External IP Address Changed - Tor has determined your relay's public IP address is,"When I restart my PC I get this........ ""[Wed 10.

If that is not correct, please consider setting the 'Address' option in your relay's configuration."".  Although my IP address is not static and changes when my modem re-starts I have never had a problem being an exit relay. Is my relay still working? Or do I need to add the address in relay config every time it changes? I thought Vidalia would automatically notice the change and do this itself. I have also disabled Mcaffee net monitor for the Tor exit ports. Is this OK or should I re-enable net monitor? "
845,Multiple adversaries able to deploy large numbers of relays; do they dilute each other's effectiveness?,"I note that when researchers analyse some particular types of attacks on Tor security, they assume a SINGLE adversary who is capable of deploying a significant number of relays that will eventually be selected as guards and exit relays. If that is a realistic assumption to make for the purposes their analysis, then out in the real world there are probably at least three adversaries interested in attacking Tor, each of which is capable of deploying large numbers of relays for that purpose.   The interesting thing about this is that these ""big"" adversaries are likely to be attacking real client groups who will have very little overlap in their membership. If that assumption is true then it seems at first glance that the more ""big"" adversaries out their deploying relays, the smaller is the percentage of relays any one actually controls. Is that dilution effect significant?  Put another way, a client who is worried about being attacked by a particular, ""big"", adversary actually benefits when other ""big"" adversaries add large numbers of relays. It gives our client a better chance of selecting a guard NOT controlled by their adversary. It does not matter if the selected guards are controlled by other adversaries since we assume they are not interested in our client.  Is that argument too simple minded? "

The other Tor globe is incomplete - it has almost none of my bookmarks. I do remember having an issue trying to export the bookmarks html. I may have dl the browser twice.  But I opened my apps folder and dragged the truncated Tor to the trash and emptied it. It's no longer in my apps folder, but dang, there it is again on my dock! My apps folder now has one green Tor globe and one purple and white onion labeled TorBrowser_en_US.  What's up with that? Is there a way to stop it from happening? I don't think it's causing any glitches in my websurfing, but I don't really know how Tor is supposed to work. For example, I'm thinking it's normal to get search results from several different language sites - predominantly Polish, Romanian, Dutch, and Norwegian - though the results themselves are usually in English.  Thanks all. "

852,"Uninstalled Tor, now can't even get to the site to dl again","I was having problems I already asked about (2 Tors in my apps folder and dock), so I decided to uninstall everything and start over. Only today I've been unable to access the Tor site, from any browser (Firefox and Safari) or search engine (Google, Yahoo, Bing). All I get is the spinning wheel and then a can't find the server/problem loading page error message. Tried thru CNET and PCMag and got a TextEdit file. IsItDown tells me repeatedly there's no problem with the site. I have read that ComCast is blocking Tor, but I have Time Warner - are they blocking it too? Is the site under maintenance since it's Sunday? But why wouldn't I then be at least able to get to the site and get a maintenance message?  I fixed it. I had to change my DNS - for some reason the TWC one stopped working - does this mean TWC is blocking Tor? I changed to Google's open DNS. All of a sudden I could access the site and download TBB. Now I have Firefox ESR 24.8, and only one Tor in my apps folder and dock. Yay! For some reason, the Tor icon in the apps folder has the No sign over it, but no matter, it works! Took me quite a while since I'm no techie, but I read somewhere changing the DNS might work, didn't even know what a DNS was, found out I didn't have to change it for my network (my wife would kill me), just for my computer. I still have Tor on my laptop - wonder if I have to change the DNS there too. Anyway, I got it back - I use Tor for privacy, not because I do illegal things, but because I think it's creepy to be followed around and reported on.

853,Will routing Tor through a proxy help avoid cloudflare (and how to do it w/ TBB?),"I've been running into cloudflare issues quite a bit when browsing with Tor and it seems to be becoming more and more of an issue. Sometimes I get captchas, sometimes I don't, but regardless it's becoming quite a headache just to try to casually browse semi anonymously. I don't particularly trust proxies and VPNs are as good as their privacy policies I guess but I figure that if I am trying to keep myself private and not so much data traveling back and forth (I do not log into sites etc or do other serious stuff with the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB), I save that for TAILS).  So, this is a two parter:   Would running Tor -> Proxy help hide the fact that I am using tor from cloudflare? (It seems to me it would but I wanted to check) How does/can one setup the TBB to route Tor traffic through a proxy? I of course found the option ""this computer needs to use a proxy to access the internet"" and the Preferences -> Proxy Settings but (and forgive me, I do not really understand this stuff) it sounded to me like those would give me a Proxy -> Tor setup which would still give me the cloudflare problem.

856,Is the “Ron's Coffee” Tor-related hack technically possible in episode 1x01 of Mr. Robot?,"In the episode 1x01 of Mr. Robot, Elliot confronts the owner of Ron's Coffee. He basically states that the man is hosting illegal (child pornography) content served in the form of a website that the customers of his coffee shops can access from the shops' Internet connections. Elliot also briefly describes the owner's use of “Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous”. So, the details are not known, but we can imagine that the guy set his website up as a hidden service.  What bugs me is the moment when Elliot states that he could trace traffic between the coffee shop and the illegal servers, saying: “Whoever is in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me the one in control”, implying that he runs one or more Tor exit nodes himself, and that he managed to do either or both of those 2 things:   somehow “forcing” the traffic from the coffee shop to go through the exit node(s) he runs; monitoring packets going through the exit node(s) he runs and tracing them back to their original senders.   Either of those is impossible if I get Tor's innards correctly.  I mean, as far as my understanding of Tor goes, it's not possible to trace a user from the exit node back to his/her origin address, and that's precisely the point of onion routing. The only origin address you can get at the exit node is the address of the direct previous node in the chain. So even if you control an exit node, you can't tell who the incoming packets really belong to. You'd have to control a pretty heavy bunch of nodes for the routing of a user to hypothetically pass only through your nodes from entry to exit. That wouldn't even be as simple as that, because the selection and order of the nodes in the chain are random, aren't they? So you'd have to own a really big number of nodes in order to get only a very, very slim chance to trace a user from A to B.  So, is Elliot's hack really technically feasible the way he says he did it? Couldn't it be some kind of counter-propaganda to undermine Tor and its efficiency (especially given that anti-Tor proponents' main argument is that Tor can be used to cover up criminal activities)? Or maybe this is just some kind of simplification for dramatization's sake (which would be a little lame, even though I guess most of the show's viewers are not tech-savvy)? Or maybe I'm missing something about Tor's general flow of operation? "
857,What's the difference between Tor and Vidalia?,"I was reading a document, and it had two commands to execute:   sudo apt-get install tor, and;  sudo apt-get install vidalia   What's the difference between these two commands? For running a Tor hidden service, we need to have Tor installed on the server, but what is Vidalia used for? "
858,How does Tor protect against flooding with artificially long circuits,Since the path and the length of a circuit can be chosen by a modified client an attacker could make it arbitrarily long and thus multiply the the impact of his traffic on the network by the amount of hops.  Is there any limitation besides possible packet size limitations and timeouts? And what would the practical limit be?  I assume there must be some counter measure. Otherwise someone would have already done this.

860,Why is Tor button for Chrome so much faster than the official Tor browser?,"I use regular Chrome, Chrome Canary with Tor button (connected to tor from MacPorts) and Tor browser on the same computer. Obviously regular Chrome is the fastest but Canary/Tor button is just slightly slower (like you would be using an average mobile broadband connection rather than 100 Mbit fiber). However, Tor browser is significantly slower. Why is that?  I don't ""push"" Canary nor Tor browser by having tens of windows and hundreds of tabs open, instead I use one window in either browser, always with less than 5 tabs.  Furthermore, Tor browser regularly hangs. You just can't open a new window or tab, clicking links or other common tasks. It is currently in this state and the only (?) thing that works are the menus - they work as expected but when you select a commando there, nothing happens. My copy of Tor browser also frequently use a lot of CPU and the only way to fix this is to kill the daughter process.  Why this big difference in general speed between Canary/Tor button and Tor browser? And more generally, is Tor browser unstable? I use Firefox occasionally and it never shows the instability I experience with Tor browser. "

So I have to execute this python script via Torsocks, like torsocks python3 code.py.  My question is whether this is safe?

867,If multiple users connect through the same Tor router can data be correlated?,"Let's say I setup a transparent/isolating Tor proxy (dedicated machine/router), through which all traffic is forced before going out to the Internet.  There are a five machines ""behind"" that Tor proxy, all used by different people to surf the web.  Now the question is, what data can the various endpoints (hidden services or clearnet) gather and could they link one user's traffic to another one's?  If one user tells his identity, could adversaries derive that the other four people must also be at that same location (or at least come from the same proxy)?  (So far, I've found this answer, basically indicating that, for high anonymity, all users would have to use a different SocksPort/TransPort on the proxy. I hope that's outdated though, since it would mean that the described isolating proxy concept would require high maintenance - setting up one TransPort per user.) "

873,"When only using HTTPSProxy in torrc, will also directory requests get routed through that proxy?","It's not possible to use Tor behind a http-only proxy (not supporting the ""connect"" method.  Tor's manual says:     HTTPProxy host[:port]      Tor will make all its directory requests through this host:port (or host:80 if port is not specified), rather than connecting directly to any directory servers.      HTTPSProxy host[:port]      Tor will make all its OR (SSL) connections through this host:port (or host:443 if port is not specified), via HTTP CONNECT rather than connecting directly to servers. You may want to set FascistFirewall to restrict the set of ports you might try to connect to, if your HTTPS proxy only allows connecting to certain ports.   When one is only using HTTPSProxy, will also directory requests get routed through that proxy?  When one's goal is to route all of Tor's traffic through that proxy is it required to use HTTPProxy and HTTPSProxy or is using HTTPSProxy alone sufficient? "
874,Why does Tor use only one hop instead of three hops to connect to a directory server?,"The Tor manual says:     TunnelDirConns 0|1      If non-zero, when a directory server we contact supports it, we will build a one-hop circuit and make an encrypted connection via its ORPort. (Default: 1)   Why only one hop? Why not a regular three hop circuit? "
875,Could I run the hidden service software(e.g webserver) in a different system than the one Tor is running?,"Running a hidden service in a secure way can be a really complicated matter.   Ideally the system where the hidden service software (e.g. a web server) lives should not have a publicly routable IP address on any of its network interfaces and should not be able to learn its real public IP address. That leaves out the solution of NAT since a system behind NAT although has not a publicly routable address can easily find its real address.  A solution would be an isolated system with all its connections routed through Tor. For example another box running Tor could server as middle-box/router for the isolated hidden service host.   If a user followed the traditional way to set up a hidden service in the isolated box then she would end up running Tor in both machines, routing one tor instance though another thus having terrible effects on latency and bandwidth.  My question is : could the user run the hidden service's software for example an Apache Web Server instance in a box different than the one running the Tor instance ?  If not, is there any other feasible solution that could fit the scheme described above? "

(I'm assuming that if I click on them and the browser goes to where I ask it to, then the transport is working).  However, I'm a wee bit concerned that if the transport doesn't work, does the Tor Browser Bundle simply default to 'basic Tor' instead, thus making me visible for using Tor?  Or will it simply just not work at all?  And on the same theme, if I start using pluggable transports and some time during the session it stops working, will the browser revert to 'basic Tor' or will it stop completely, forcing me to start the whole Tor Browser Bundle again using some other transport?

How can I use a tool (similar to OpenSSL's s_client) to extract the public key from an onion for experimental use?

How will government know which second nodes were connected with exit node? It will ask it from provider. Is it real to find X that way or not? I don't understand all aspects of Tor's work. Hope, asked a question clearly. Thanks.  "

903,Is using a private bridge a suitable alternative compared to a VPN for connecting to Tor entry nodes?,"I am a Tor newbie and considering deploying my own private bridge to connect to the Tor network.  Normally I would connect to Tor via a VPN to prevent the entrance node from knowing my clearnet IP but after reading about private bridges, I am considering dropping the VPN method all togther.

904,"How come Shopify recognizes my local currency with Tor browser!? (no log-in, no address entered)","I recently stumbled upon this online store [website]So how come do they know my currency is CAD even with the Tor browser? (I know they know because there's a message on top of the home page that says ""Free shipping for orders of $50CAD or more"").  The Tor browser is run with the medium security setting (in order to access the necessary Javascript) and the exit server was in Netherlands.  Any clues? "
905,Do users have to mind the port number that entry node is using?,"When using tor,I sometimes also use wireshark to see if unexpected ip is connected or not. Is it less anonymous to use tor and wireshark at the same time?  And I noticed that protocols between my pc and entry nodes differs depending on them. They are tcp,tlsv1.2,pop,IMF and so on. Are they just judged by the port they are using? Whatever protocol wireshark shows,is it correct that users don't have to mind it? Or is it better to pick up entry node manually that uses port 80 or 443? "

909,Tor and stem library : non consistent error message with wrong password,"I'm writing a little program trying to connect to Tor (v0.2.9.10) using the stem library (v1.5.4).  I've taken inspiration from this page : [website]For now it looks like this :  #!/usr/bin/python  from __future__ import print_function import os import sys import getpass import stem.connection import stem.socket   if __name__ == '__main__':   try:     controller = stem.control.Controller.from_port()   except stem.SocketError as exc:     print(""Unable to connect to tor on port 9051: %s"" % exc)     sys.exit(1)    try:     controller.authenticate()   except stem.connection.MissingPassword:     try:       pw = os.environ['torpassword']     except KeyError:       print(""Please configure the 'torpassword' environment variable"", file=sys.stderr)       sys.exit(1)      try:       controller.authenticate(password = pw)     except stem.connection.PasswordAuthFailed:       print(""Unable to authenticate, password is incorrect"")       sys.exit(1)   except stem.connection.AuthenticationFailure as exc:     print(""Unable to authenticate: %s"" % exc)     sys.exit(1)    print(""Tor is running version %s"" % controller.get_version())   controller.close()   When the right password is given, it works, it displays the Tor version as it's supposed to do. When there's no password I get the message I'm expecting : Please configure the 'torpassword' environment variable  The problem is when I'm trying with wrong passwords to see how it reacts, but I get different messages everytime and I'm bit confused about that. For example :  [dev@l]#$ torpassword=test ./test.py  Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""./test.py"", line 28, in &lt;module&gt;     controller.authenticate(password = pw)   File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/stem/control.py"", line 1071, in authenticate     stem.connection.authenticate(self, *args, **kwargs)   File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/stem/connection.py"", line 618, in authenticate     raise auth_exc stem.connection.AuthenticationFailure: Received empty socket content.

Is it a problem in the Tor server ? Not handling a wrong password the right way ? (not so likely in my opinion) Is it a problem with the stem library ? (could be, but I doubt it) Is it a problem with my code ? (much more likely, but I can't see why)  Thanks for your time.

910,Tor encryption combination,"I'm trying to understand exactly how Tor builds a circuit with encryption. I've read the Tor design literature and have a pretty good grasp on it, however I'm left with the following misunderstanding.  When Alice, the client, goes to build her circuit, she will choose a node, say Bob, from the list of nodes distributed by Tor. She will find Bob's corresponding ""onion key"", which is I believe a public 1,024 bit RSA key (please correct me if I'm wrong). Alice generates the first half of a Diffe-Hellman key exchange, encrypts it with Bob's onion key then sends it to Bob, who decrypts it, generates his half of the DHKE and sends this to Alice along with a hash of the new symmetric key which they will use to encrypt future messages, which is known as a ""session key"".   Question 1: Does Bob send this message back to Alice in plaintext? I know that by nature of a DHKE even if an eavesdropper obtains Bob's half of the exchange he still cannot determine the secret key so I'm not sure if there is a need for encryption from Bob back to Alice at this point but if so, what type of encryption is it?  Also, if my understanding of the Tor encryption model is way off or there are any errors in my explanations, please let me know, if you can. Thank you. "

912,How does Tor hide IP address if IP is essential for routing,To establish connection with Tor node I need to send my IP address. Otherwise it will not know where to send reply. How is this better than ssl connection over proxy? Is this only helpful as obfuscation scheme because it's impossible for government to have access to all tor nodes?  I read about encryption of application layer. But some node needs to receive unencrypted version for the whole onion routing to initiate. If government would ask access to this node the whole process would be exposed. 
913,Can Tor's IP sharing be dangerous?,"I am novice to Tor, but before using it I have gone through lot of websites. An article explained that Tor is dangerous the following reason:   Consider an IP 1.2.2.2 which was assigned by Tor to user X and he used it for an illegal activity then he closes his Tor circuit after accomplishing it, Later an innocent Y comes in and is assigned the same IP 1.2.2.2 by Tor, If user X is a government suspect and the IP he got at the time of doing illegal activity (1.2.2.2) was targeted by the NSA, what would happen to Y when Y retains that IP for a day? Could he be arrested by the NSA  because of having 1.2.2.2 though he claim himself as innocent?   This lead the article's author to conclude that Tor is dangerous. "

915,A weird Tor relay,"This might feel funny or you might think I have gone crazy but I want to share this anyway.  Yesterday I have just turned on my Orbot and saw the logs to know what are all the relays I have been connecting with. Here comes a creepy thing, my logs shows the below while forming Tor circuit which I bet could trigger questions to any common man:  Circuit (4) BUILT: NationalCrimeAgency here comes some checksum like bits then CLOSED :NationalCrimeAgency   What Orbot have to deal with NationalCrimeAgency???? It makes me crazy (it should for everybody). I just closed that session and then reopen it then I got different logs like:  Circuit (7) BUILT: beirchangaming Circuit (8) BUILT: beirchangaming &gt;PirataEsse&gt;blanqui NOTICE:Tor has successsfully opened circuit........   You may say it was just a name of Tor rely it is not a real NationalCrimeAgency or whatever. Here the question is I have read in most article say Tor is even difficult for NSA to crack but again the question is what happen if spy agency or hackers with mischievous claw run a Tor relay and spoof all data of innocent peoples which it came across? Are we in the illusion of Tor privacy but not in actual privacy? "

920,Security for relay on Home network,I want to host a relay to help out the network. I am looking into the possibility of doing it on my home network. Two concerns have come up during my research. The first is I would potentially be using a computer that I currently use has a HTPC. I am wondering how much the information presented on the link below would apply to my situation. Is encrypting the rest of my files necessary? If they aren't necessarily confidential? Would it be unwise to say login to my bank account on this computer once I am running a relay? I guess I am just wondering am I somehow increasing my attack vector if I am running a relay? Or is it just additional attention that makes security important?  [website]My second concern is in regards to having my IP blocked by certain websites. Is there anything I can do to combat this or reduce the effects? From the information I have read it seems like website blocking isn't that widespread but I just I am just apprehensive to run a relay if I might be blocked by websites I need to visit such as my bank. (this might be a poor question feel free not to answer if its too opinionated.)  From what I've gathered it does seem preferred to just rent a VPS and I might consider doing that but I guess I would like to know the viability of using my home network since I have a server already running 24/7. 
921,Is it good or bad idea to use tor always?,"Am I less or more secure, if I use tor when I do not need anonimity?

Why does site.com (sometimes) recognize this ""new Tor circuit"" as associated with the same username rather than a new, currently anonymous connection?   I assume ""New Tor circuit"" request specifically forces new Tor exit node (new IP address). The url is generic (not site.com/username-abc123.html). JavaScript disabled. It seems that TorBrowser has allowed site.com to put cookie or other identifying feature on this browser session that persists across ""New Tor circuit"" request.   Is this expected behavior for ""New Tor circuit for this site""? "
923,Why does orbot's source code contain binary files for iptables?,"According to a ticket in your bug tracker, the source code for Orbot contains binary files for iptables.  To me, this sounds like Orbot is built off of some closed-source code. How then could this portion be scrutinized? Should we be worried about this? "
924,How may I run multiple Tor relay instances in a single Linux machine?,"Suppose I have a Linux machine (for example Debian) with more than one public IPs, sufficient bandwidth, memory and CPU resources.   How may I run more than one Tor relay instance in that single machine? Should there be different users that start every instance? How about the different torrc configuration files?   Finally are there any implications from running two or more relays in a single machine ? "
925,Would running Tor client and Tor relay simultaneously harm my anonymity?,"If I run a Tor relay in a machine and at the same time I use the same instance as a Tor client, would that harm my anonymity ?

926,Is there any bridge beetwen Tor and Freenet? Is there way to bridge Freenet site like a Tor hidden service?,"Is there any bridge beetwen Tor and Freenet?   Is there a way to bridge Freenet site like a Tor hidden service ( onion domain )?  E.g. setting up site in Freenet network means, that this site splitted like a slices of garlic among many unknown users of Freenet.  Setting up hidden service in Tor network, means that it will be reached with onion's multi-layer encryption routing, only. There is point of failure similar to ordinary Internet - one physical server.  Is there way to setting up Freenet's hidden site, that will be reached via .onion domain from Tor network?  To obtain at once garlic's fragmentation and onion's routing.  "
927,How safe are Tor users?,"Given that Silk Road was just shut down, an article was published stating that:     Tor Can't Always Keep You Safe; Just Ask Silk Road ... careful traffic monitoring and a little math you can figure out who connects to what on Tor. - Reference   Another article - nearly a month older, claims something similar:     Not Even Tor Is Safe From The NSA’s Prying Eyes ... The problem boils down to this – around 90% of Tor users are still using older software which can be hacked. The good news is that the latest version of Tor, version 2.4, isn’t believed to be ‘crackable’ by the NSA, as it uses something called elliptical curve Diffie-Hellman ciphers that are thought to be beyond its capabilities at the moment. - Reference   Additionally, another states:     Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users, somebody's going to notice. So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on. - Reference    Are the articles referenced above true in their claims?   What I can gather from this is that safety boils down to the habits of a user themselves. Are they using https, what information are they sharing online, what associations are being made.. etc. Related.   Assuming all safety precautions are taken into consideration by the user, how safe are Tor users - regarding anonymity? Does Tor still present a threat to the NSA?  "
928,Freenet distributed hosting model: Could it be ported to Tor?,"I've always wondered why Tor uses a server-based model of content storage rather than a Freenet-style, distributed, encrypted, plausible-denial model.  It seems that it would be much more robust and secure, almost like an anonymous BitTorrent, if that's possible.  Is this a future goal?  Is it possible? "
929,Why isn't there any such option - middle-relay behind NAT?,"Why is it still required have two open ports, DirPort and OrPort, for a relay?  Imagine such a situation. A Tor user with unlimited network traffic and with that kind great bandwidth stay behind a NAT router without the ability to forward two ports, or e.g. no external IP address in the provider's VPN configuration, or public modern Wi-Fi cafe, etc...  It is obvious that the anonymity of a relay operator, while browsing, is much better than the client's.  This should be enabled by default for high-bandwidth connections.  Why do I point out the possibility of incoming traffic to such a middle-relay? I'm just fortuitously found for myself, that the onion hidden service isn't required in any open ports.  In the same way, with only one hop, not a three hops, any relay behind the NAT router would share its bandwidth with the network. That means, the bandwidth of the whole network will grow 100 times and the anonymity of such clients-middle-relays will grow!  Complexity of code for this is +100 lines at maximum.  Current state is: 5,000 relays vs 500,000 clients, 1 x 100.  Under ""Middle-relay"", I mean ExitPolicy reject *:* "
930,"If I have tor running for a while, how often will my ""identity"" change?","Say I don't ever click the ""New Identity"" button, but just have the regular browser bundle running for some days.

932,Why does hard coded node 'Faravahar' have a different geolocation (USA) than registrar (Mauritius)?,I was editing an IT Security stack exchange question to add geolocation information to a Tor question and I noticed that one of the 10 hard coded directory authorities is ambiguous about its location:     Is Faravahar of ./src/or/config.c at Line 859 hosted in   Mauritius as implied by Tor whois or in Washington D.C. as implied by standard geolocation services?   This could of course just be the usual differences between the location of a NIC registrar and an actual server; but then why is Faravahar (154.35.32.5) the only hard coded node using a registrar not of the node's hosting country? I'm curious.

Now: how good this really is for hiding me using Tor? 1. how can i be sure the entry node or bridge isn't malicious ? And if it is, what information can it get ? Just my ip address ? 2. what information my ISP or GFW can get when connecting by meek or obfs4. How can i be sure they really don't know this is hiding Tor traffic? 3. if i wanted to be sure, should i use a VPN before connecting to Tor? Are there obfuscating VPNs?  4.

936,Is it possible to choose a version of TOR that works with a site?,"Question from a newbie.   Here's what's going on. I updated to the latest version of TOR, and then at the site I most visit, they would not even recognize the latest version as a ""Firefox"". They asked me to log in again from the previous device I used (which was of course, the same device, but with an earlier version of TOR).  Other issues I faced associated with the latest version:   (1) the network I choose, (after left clicking the blue ""choose a new Tor network"" button once) changes the network not once but 2 times after I press the button, making it difficult to choose a preferred exit node.   (2) Like I mentioned before, the site does not even recognize latest TOR as a ""firefox"", making it difficult to log in. Asks security questions a couple of times, then didn't allow me in.Never happened with earlier versions.  (3) Some of the dialogues like whether I want to block HTTP canvas cookies never show up!  What I did: dumped the latest version of TOR, went back to the TOR 4.5.1 (luckily I had that exe installer file still on the device) and though the site allowed me in, many functionalities at the site are gone. Difficult to navigate.  Question(s): Can I choose to update to a somewhat higher version of TOR, without upgrading to the latest version?   Can I pick and choose which version I want? Is there any place where I can get more recent (but not the latest) installer exe files?  Thanks. "

944,Security of Tor bridges and Captcha,"Tor's current CAPTCHA implementation is easily crackable through bots - whether through paid human labour or automatic algorithms with 99.8% accuracy[1]. Although the algorithm by Google is for reCaptcha, the same results could plausibly be applied to Tor's CAPTCHA, which isn't necessarily as secure or hard to read. Can this be done? And surely the NSA and other government agencies have more resources than Google.   So is Tor's Bridge-getting system or are we all being spied on?   Any captcha can be cracked through manual human labour Government agencies have resources to perform massive amounts of human labour Therefore any CAPTCHA cannot be used   ispo facto we're all being spied on  And IP-limiting services wouldn't work because you could just use Tor to keep changing your IP. Perhaps we could block Tor end nodes, but there are always private end nodes.  Example CAPTCHA for reference:   "

946,Is it possible to find hidden service IPs by compromising an end node of a client connecting to it?,"So the TOR works basically by sending a encrypted packet across multiple computers.  The packet is encrypted such that only the first computer on the relay knows the user's IP, and the last computer knows the destination IP (i.e the requested website).  Would it be possible to find the IP of .onion websites by intercepting the packets at the end node?( Its possible to see the first destination from the packets being sent out by the computer)  And since the TOR Browser is F.O.S.S, could it  be possible to configure TOR to use 3 local servers to act as relay nodes, and intercept the packets sent to the last one, thus exposing the destination IP?

Also, I understand that added applications can be reinstalled each time by caching them at persistent storage and appending them to live-additional-software.conf, but my point is not reverse of this, i.e. actually keeping the packages and removing them at startup. I straight out don't want them to be present and use space in my flash drive.

948,Tails firewall rules with static IP configuration,Tails firewall rules with static IP configuration  Please note that this question is in relation to the connection it self. The unencrypted part of the connection not the part of the connection that goes through tor.    I am interested in knowing whether the tails firewall has two different rules sets for static IP/manual as apposed to DHCP connection?  If the Internet connection in your computer is set to static IP/manual can a server/router that has both static IP and DHCP working that is acting as the gateway server that has got hacked send packets (offer and acknowledge replay or options reply in-terms of DHCP)  to the computer that can go through the firewall that is will the firewall drop these packets since I have set my Internet connection to static IP?  Does the static IP connection (Connection between the router and device connection establishing  application only) work as a loop back only or is it unidirectional in-terms of packet used to establish a connection?   Once the connection ( static IP) is set and at a later sage if the router gets hacked can the router sends packets back (static IP connection establishing packets only)  to the device that is connected to it will these packets get dropped by the firewall?

950,Is there any reason an ISP can't block the BridgeDB?,"Keep in mind that my knowledge of Tor Bridges specifically is fairly limited (I basically only know that a bridge is an unpublished guard node that you can use to enter the Tor network without anybody realizing it at first, assuming your adversary is not using DPI. I know nothing of pluggable transports).  But take this scenario for example: We're behind the Great Firewall of China, which blocks access to all known Tor nodes. Th obvious fix to this is to go to [website]Why can't the Great Firewall be modified to block access to the Tor Project's website? I understand that it uses SSL, thus cannot necessarily be directly blocked, but firewalls can be configured to spoof a DNS request and return an invalid IP address, can they not? This would block users from accessing the Bridge Database and they would not be able to access Tor without someone from outside the firewall sending them bridges in some other way. What is stopping them from blocking users from downloading the Tor Browser Bundle? This is essentially a duplicate of the question above, but I'd just like to know if I'm missing any facts...  "

959,Tor TLS cipher suite negotiation and fingerprint defense,"In reading this bug I can see that, in the past, Tor has been fingerprinted based on the cipher suites negotiated in the initial TLS handshake. Originally it looks like a copy of the cipher suites in a version of Firefox negotiating with Apache were used -- the goal being that it mimics a standard browser. The result of the bug was that the cipher suite was updated to look like other browsers.   My questions are:   How effective is this solution? The pluggable transports page shows why this isn't perfect, but is there any information on whether it's currently being used to block connections? While a variety of suites are offered only a few can actually be used by Tor. Would a plausible active attack exist where an adversary could force force negotiation using an unsupported cipher in order to verify the host is a Tor node?  "

962,Probability for using a malicious entry-relay with and without Entry-Guards?,"Im trying to figure out, what the probability for choosing a malicious entry-guard, depended on the amount of Relays and the fraction of malicious Relays, is.   In the tor-faq it says for using NO Entry-Guards:     Suppose the attacker controls, or can observe, C relays. Suppose there are N relays total. If you select new entry and exit relays each time you use the network, the attacker will be able to correlate all traffic you send with probability (c/n)².   So w/o Entry-Guards its pretty easy: A OP has the probability for choosing a malicious Entry-Relay of (c/n).   And for using Entry-Guards it says:     (...) Thus, the user has some chance (on the order of (n-c)/n) of avoiding profiling, whereas she had none before.   Note that this probability for using Entry-Guards is for NOT choosing an malicious Entry-Relay as a Guard. But this cited probability is not making that much scenes to me. Can somebody explain to me?   Or, to give it a general touch again: Whats the probability for choosing a malicious Relay with the use of Entry-Guards depended on the amount of Relays (n) and the fraction of malicious Relays (c) ?  Disclaimer: I know there is a lot of literature about that topic. Especially the paper ""Changing of the Guards: A Framework for Understanding and Improving Entry Guard Selection in Tor"" is good for understanding up- and downsides of guard-nodes (This Tor-Blog article is a good place to start, too! And for the start of all this you need to review the paper 'Locating Hidden Servers').  But all the statistics in the literature I found about it, were differing between variable guard-parameters and what I am looking for is the difference between using and not using guards. I know that there won't be a easy answer, because this differs between just named guard-parameters. But I guess and hope that we can abstract from them. "

965,Torbrowser over an SSH tunnel with SOCKS 5,"I am trying to use Torbrowser without the tor network, but instead trying to use ssh as a socks proxy (ssh -D).  Using Torbrowser without any proxy (neither tor nor ssh) works fine. As soon as I add the ssh socks proxy, I am seeing the following behavior: the first web page usually loads fine; in one of the next pages Torbrowser seems to load forever on some of the elements; after the 3rd or 4th page, it hangs on the entire page, loading forever (well, too long for me to wait anyway). Doing the same with Firefox 52 ESR works fine; only Torbrowser 7 has this problem.  Any ideas why this might happen? Maybe it is due to the socks extensions in tor?  Let me emphasize that I am not trying to run tor over ssh or vice versa. Essentially what I am trying to do is to use an ssh tunnel in place of the tor network.  tnx "
966,Optimal configuration for an obfs4 bridge,"In response to the blocking of Tor in even more countries and organisations, I decided to set up a (private) bridge. I would like the bridge to:   be accessible to users with strict outgoing connection filtering (in particular, blocking of access to non-standard ports) be as difficult to discover as possible (consider scanning of known ports for Tor protocol)   What would be the configuration of the bridge to best address these goals?  Namely:   What numbers to choose for OR and obfs4proxy ports? Does opening a DIR port on a bridge make sense, and if yes, on which port? Which ports to forward on the router? Does using IPv6 provide any benefit over just IPv4?   How to run an obfs4 bridge? provides some highlights but does not exactly answer the questions I have. "
967,Clarification of Risks to Anonymity,"My goal is to get a clear sense of what is required to maintain anonymity.  In a sense I'm mapping the flow of traffic in my head and trying to understand how certain traffic might interact in ways that aren't obvious. This is to say nothing for topics such as statistical analysis and analyzing totally disparate traffic streams.  For example, I've seen a number of people answer questions about Tor Browser and P2P and I want to know if I've correctly identified erroneous thinking.  Here's what I've understood:   Q: Where does encryption and connection begin? Your ISP is your ISP.  Unless your connection begins elsewhere then that is the point of concern. Tor connection runs encrypted through your ISP. Using other programs in conjunction should generally not affect anonymity of Tor Browser.  Basically all the Tor traffic is anonymous. The traffic from another browser or program may be unencrypted.  Encryption has to begin on the system you are using. So there are several handshakes between different relays.  What does my ISP see?   My first concern here is that when I use Test Tor Network settings (about:tor), I do get various IPs that are not assigned by my provider.  However, after entering several urls directly, with Google as search provider, I was directed to a captcha at Google asking to identify as a human, showing my IP.  At first I thought that it was my actual IP but I realized it was various changing IPs including IPv4 and v6 (Onion menu).  I ignored them and I can go to google.com search page with TLS 1.2, but once I enter a search query, whether from this page or url bar, I am directed to either the captcha, or if I ignored the captcha, then I get     Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network. Please try your request again later. Why did this happen? (link)   I'm not sure if I should keep answering captchas identifying my address to Google, or if this is unnecessarily paranoid because I'm just letting Google know that it is legit traffic.   My connection with my ISP isn't private.  For that would I have to configure a VPN directly from my cable modem, meaning all my headers would look like a connection from me to VPN and that's it?  Or what would this mean?   As mentioned any program outside Tor Browser is operating normally.  A lot of people have asked about torrents. This would run from the client and is not private. But I understand PHE (protocol header encryption) options are available for different clients.   How are layers added to my anonymity? 1. I'm on my computer 2. using Tor Browser 3. insert VPN 4. What if My VPN is at 2 and Tor is at 3, what does my ISP see? I created a mail account I use only with Tor.  All accounts I use are separate from those I use on other browsers.  Although I use a password mgmt pluggin. I think I should also avoid logging in from Tor with the same account. What are some ways to analyze my traffic and remain anonymous while doing so?    Realized there is a lot I don't understand.  If anyone could deliver answers in an ordered list to paint a picture of how this works that would be great.  I will continue reading documentation.  Also links are appreciated. "
968,Circumvent methods when Directory Authorities censored,"I recently become interested in researching about the Tor network and as I read, there are 9 directory authorities which are hard-coded into the Tor software and they are like phone-book which gives the client a random list of tor relays and servers and a list of them is also available at : [website]In other document I read about if all of this Directory Servers become compromised then relays work as a cache to give the clients a list of Tor servers so it is probably not possible to shutdown Tor network completely without Directory Authorities (another article said that clients also have a small cache of Tor Servers addresses).  So my question is what could they do to circumvent filtering of above addresses in countries which completely filter Tor Network traffic ?  In other words what do obfuscation methods (like obfs4) do to get a list of Tor relays and servers when the above hard-coded addresses is censored and the client never talks to Directory Authorities before ?

969,How to kill Debian-gdm user processes?,"I am using tails under a VM. I am having problems when the keyboard buffer sharing stops working, and I have looked into the process list and I see two instances of the spice /usr/bin/spice-vdagent. One of them is owned by the currently logged in user amnesia and the other is owned by the the Debian-gdm user. And each user has their own Xserver running.  Is this normal? Why doesn't the Debian-gdm user die after login? Is there a way to make it exit? Logging in as root and killall -u Debian-tor helps, but is there another way? "
970,Effects of CVE-2017-9445?," [website][website][website]What does this mean for tor browser users? How might this vuln be used against the tor browser? Could this be used to manipulate the first hop between users and the guard node?  (I know nothing about netsec, ossec -- obviously.) "
971,How to send Tor traffic through ssh tunnel?,"I want to use TOR in such way:     Tor Browser --> local Socks5 proxy --> VPS (connection through ssh   tunnel) --> Tor Network --> Internet   Questions:   How to setup such a connection?

972,not https or secure connection - ISP reads?,"If you surf over Tor Browser and go on websites that are not https or secure, can your ISP see those sites?  If not, can people see those sites wirelessly, pcap wireshark etc? "
973,How a node get a exit flag?,"I read this article and I understand how a node can become a entry guard but I didn't found documentation about how a node become a exit node?  Where I can found documentations or articles similar to the article about lifecycle of a new node?  I check this post. It says for the exit node:     A router is called an 'Exit’ iff it allows exits to at least two of the ports 80, 443, and 6667 and allows exits to at least one /8 address space.   That means a new node configure it's machine with these ports open and enough adress, it's become automatically a exit node? "
974,Tor 7.0 or 6.5.2 not starting at all after Win 10 Update an even after new installing,"last night a windows update KB4022716 was installed automatically but now Tor won´t start at all. A windows failure dialog pops always up that Tor ist nor working properly and will be closed.  Unfortunately I havn´t used Tor for the last two weeks so I am not sure but assume that the problem could be the Win update.  Even deleting the tor folder and installing in a new folder doenst help with the actual 7.x version of tor. Also the older version 6.5.2 doesn´t start after new installation anymore.     How can I get some information what could be the problem? Where do I found a log with inportant information about the possible problem? If anyone know this failure help would be apreciated.   Thanks.  Sam  Update: In the windows logs I found the following which ioccurs several times there:  Name der fehlerhaften Anwendung: firefox.exe, Version: 45.9.0.6241, Zeitstempel: 0x00000000 Name des fehlerhaften Moduls: cmdshim32.dll, Version: 10.0.1.6223, Zeitstempel: 0x58fbd220 Ausnahmecode: 0xc0000005 Fehleroffset: 0x0000135b ID des fehlerhaften Prozesses: 0x894 Startzeit der fehlerhaften Anwendung: 0x01d2f23c1718c742 Pfad der fehlerhaften Anwendung: C:\Internet\TorBrowser\Browser\firefox.exe Pfad des fehlerhaften Moduls: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmdshim32.dll Berichtskennung: 5339f314-9801-4b86-883d-29c0a77e0e4c Vollständiger Name des fehlerhaften Pakets:  Anwendungs-ID, die relativ zum fehlerhaften Paket ist:   Does this information help, I am unsure.

975,security problem?,I have two versions of TOR on my PC. If I use the one that has security settings at medium - so I can log in here for example - I am getting a continual stream of something from this site: www.cyber-consultancy.nl I watch the modem lights and the stream does not stop as long as the browser is online.  If I then go to my more secure version with max security this does not happen. So I am left wondering if this agency has been hired by someone to test TOR security holes?  Any thoughts?

977,How do I take my Tor node offline permanently?,"I run a Tor node on a virtual private server, and for various mundane reasons I do not want to continue operating this particular VPS. In other words, I will be removing a Tor node from the network. Are there any steps I should take in advance of shutting down this node for the last time? E.g. any way to advertise to the network that the node will no longer be available? (If there would even be a point to that)  The server in question is not an exit relay at this time, but in general, I'm interested in knowing the answer for both exit and non-exit relays, if there is any difference. "
978,Daily or monthly traffic limit recommended?,If I can only offer a small amount of traffic e.g. 20 GB per month for my middle relay would you recommend to set a monthly limit or a daily limit?  Setting the traffic limit to 20 GB would mean the relay is running one or two days and hibernating most time of the month. Setting it to 660 MB per day would make it run every day for approx. 2 hours and hibernating the rest of the day.  Would you recommend to set the monthly limit and let TOR do the balancing or give a small daily portion?

980,counting number of Tor users,"Does the number of directory requests, reported for estimating the number of Tor clients, count the number of requests irrespective of whether or not the consensus was successfully downloaded by the the client? Can someone point out where exactly in the source code the counting is implemented?  ticket 18203     I think the reason is that we're counting a response as soon as we consider the request as valid and start sending a response document.    But why not count after the client has successfully received the consensus. What happens if after successfully downloading the consensus, the client cant make a Tor circuit, Does the client try to download a consensus again or just retry with another circuit? "

983,Net Neutrality Implications,"If the ""net neutrality"" thing is stopped, will it affect Tor users?  What about Onion services?  I am not qualified to add more details on ""net neutrality"" so feel free to add to this post "
984,A server behind a physical Tor gateway to hide its location,"Is is technically possible to run a server, that is accessible only through Tor via SSH, and be able to hide its physical location from an adversary who happens to gain a root access?  In my world-view a common technique to discover a physical location of a computer is by looking at its ""public"" IP and query a geolocation database. A computer is unable to determine its ""public"" address unless he asks another computer on the Internet.  So is it safe to assume that by placing the server between a physical Tor gateway (i.e. OpenWrt router) and a router I could protect it from being discovered since all traffic would go through the gateway?  When I am talking about a Tor gateway I mean existing solutions such as anonabox. "
985,Why is the start tab page of the Tor Browser empty?,"  Why isn't there any information on the newtab page in the Tor Browser, like an FAQ, atlas, tests of anonymity for browser, News/RSS reader, etc.?  What is the advantage of not showing information like this by default? Why is it empty? "
986,Can Tor connections between hidden services be aggregated using ifenslave? (... and might Mevade be doing this?),"Using ifenslave on two endpoint Linux servers, it's possible to aggregate (aka bond or team) multiple tun or tap interfaces (e.g., tun0, tun1, ...) into a single link, combining bandwidth (less overhead) and improving reliability. SSH or OpenVPN can provide requisite tun interfaces, and either can be routed through Tor between hidden services.  Four questions come to mind:   Would this work? If it would, how many such tun interfaces could be aggregated? Might this be what all those Mevade bots are doing? Is this hypothesis about Mevade testable?   Edit:  With six OnionCat links and MPTCP, I can transfer (bbcp) at ~50 Mbps. With multiple targets, source servers can push ~200 Mbps. It's obviously not very anonymous. But it's probably more anonymous than using VPN services. That's for servers with gigabit uplinks, by the way. Methods are here.  If you're going to be eating up relay bandwidth, it's only fair to contribute. There's little risk or hassle in running entry guards or bridges, and middle relays. Each of the OnionCat links uses two of each. Or you could contribute to TorServers. "
987,What does the Tor Browser Bundle do to prevent the linking of sessions?,"What changes are made to the Tor Brower Bundle or what does it ship with to prevent a website from linking user session together, including fingerprinting on the device such as browser or system characteristics?  Tor does not aim to hide the fact that one is using Tor, but it aims for unlinkability. Websites can however try to identify a visitor and then link session by simple technologies such as cookies. Does the Tor Browser or something that gets shipped in the bundle prevent session linking through cookies?  Cookies are familiar to most people, but the browser provides lots of other ways to enable a website to link sessions. Does the Tor Browser or another component prevent session linking through device fingerprinting? "
988,Why is a longer guard rotation period with fewer guards better than the other way around?,"Tor introduced guards, which are - oversimplified said - relays the client picks and holds for some time as the first hop, to protect the client against the so-called 'predecessor attack'. Entry guards prevent the client from connecting to the majority of the network in a short amount of time.  Now there's some planning towards increasing the guard rotation period and reducing the number of guards a client picks for that time-frame.  How are fewer guards per client better then more guards? Why is a longer rotation period (a client sticks with its guards longer) beneficial for the client? "
989,Tor Anonymous Level Mixing,"Tor's website advises against mixing levels of anonymity, but does this apply across browsers? That is, can I browse websites in Firefox, chrome, IE etc without exposing my Tor traffic in Vidalia?  Edit: What I had originally meant with ""mixing levels of anonymity"" is actually ""mixing modes of anonymity"" ([website]"
990,US govt funds Tor development while NSA attacks it,"How does this work? Moreover, isn't it dangerous that ""As of 2012, 80% of the Tor Project's $2M annual budget comes from the United States government, with the Swedish government and other organizations providing the rest"", as stated in the wikipedia page? Going by the record, NSA actions are expected, but the contradictory motives of the institution are not.  To put it succinctly, either their funding is going to bear fruits, or the NSA attacks. Certainly not both. "

I wonder if there's some magic, so if I know the .onion address I can check whether there is an up-to-date service descriptor magically out there in the Tor network? "
993,Tor fingerprinting on NSA Egotisticalgiraffe document,"On page 11 and 12 of this document: [website]they say it's easy to dinstinguish Tor users from non-Tor users because of Torbutton. They are probably using some user-agent+javascript stuff. But still, if someone wants to distinguish Tor users from non-Tor users, why not look up their IP address? If the IP is from an exit node, then we have a Tor user! Why do you think they aren't looking at the problem that way? Or I'm missing something.. "
994,Is running Tor over Tor dangerous?,I've read somewhere that running Tor over another Tor connection is not only non-productive but actually dangerous?  For example: say I were running TBB on my machine and was running Whonix in 2 VMs on the same machine. Would it be better or worse or indifferent to map the whonix gateway's network connection to the host machine's Tor SOCKS5 proxy? 
995,How does misconfigured time affect Tor?,Tor users and Tor relays across the world have different time zones.   How does misconfigured time affects Tor operation either on client or server side? Is there a time skew margin in which Tor still operates well ? Could a misconfigured time zone in client distinguish her from other Tor users? 
996,Randomized testing of Tor options,"When looking at the Tor manpage one sees lots of different options.  They range from general options to some which are specific to relays, hidden services etc. I'm asking myself if each of those options will play well with any other. Does the Tor project some kind of randomized testing of options? Like enabling a random set of options and try to start the Tor client (I would call it option fuzzing ;)). Is this something which is worth doing and how can this be done? "
997,Can I run an exit relay through a VPN service?,"Is it possible to run an exit relay through a VPN service? As long as the service provider has approved this, is it otherwise workable?

What is the best methodology to make my connection secured as a rock :) is it Tor over VPN or VPN over tor!? I read about the VPN over Tor is more secured and very good! How to implement the best of them! From the first line I said I will buy a new router that will support the VPN protocols so all my traffic will go through the VPN using my router ... so how could i use that new router to make the best anonymity &amp; privacy for my connection .. i think if i used my new router with active VPN this will be Tor over VPN, right !?  "
999,Register .onion as gTLD?,"For some weeks in 2012, ""arbitrary"" gTLDs could be applied for at ICANN:     On June 20, 2011 ICANN's board voted to end most restrictions on the generic top-level domain names (gTLD) from the 22 currently available. Companies and organizations will be able to choose essentially arbitrary top-level Internet domains.   According to a search on [website]Does the Tor project plan to register the .onion TLD with ICANN?   Would the Tor project have any privilege to claim this TLD, so that no one else may register it beforehand?  If someone else would register .onion and create domains matching those of hidden services, we’d have two incompatible systems.   (EDIT: see also the related questions ""How would a registration of the .onion gtld impact the tor network?"" and ""What happens when I visit a .onion website"".) "
1000,Is it posible to choose what entry node you want to use?,"If I know of an entry node that I know the device running it is not malicious or being watched, do I have the ability to only use that as an entry point?

1001,Why is Tor written in C?,Why is Tor implemented in the C programming language?  Was that decision a matter of luck or taste of Tor's inventors?  Are there any advantages of implementing this kind of technology in C? 
1002,Are low bandwidth DoS attacks performed over the Tor network a problem to be considered?,"For low bandwidth and slow DoS / DDoS attacks (for example Slowloris, SlowLoris and PyLoris) the Tor network seems to be very useful medium. For free it offers two important things to the attacker:   Nice amount of exit relays Anonymity   The low bandwidth attacks do need neither high bandwidth nor low latency which would be problematic for many other types of DoS / DDoS attacks. On the other side the list of exit relays is known so it makes blocking of an ongoing attack easier.   Is there any other serious obstacle for such attacks over Tor? Are there known cases when was the Tor network abused for a successful low bandwidth attack? Were any counter-measures against such abuse considered? I can imagine for example limiting number of exit-relays a single Tor client can create circuits to though such a limitation could be overcame by modifying the Tor client or running multiple instances of it.   There is a related question: mitigating anonymous DOS (tor combined with pyloris) "
1003,Tor hidden service on Raspberry Pi,I want to set up a Tor hidden service on a Raspberry Pi. What is a good way to do that? Maybe start with Occidentalis v0.2 by Adafruit?  Is there a special tutorial for the Raspberry PI? 
1004,Is it possible to run a secure email network using SMTP over Tor?,"I have thought about some of the security issues inherent in email.   For example that even if the body is encrypted the headers are plain text so metadata is available.  I was wondering if this could be mitigated by using Tor and SMTP hidden services?  Could you send an email from me@abcdefg.onion to you@hijklmnop.onion using standard mail programs and hidden services / transparent proxy? It would seem feasible to me, but as I can't see that anyone has suggested it I figure there must be some problem with the idea. What is stopping this from working?  Or is it happening and I have missed it? "
1005,How are the exit and non-exit packets in the Tor relay system recognized?,"Relay setting in Vidalia has two options for relaying: ""for the Tor network"" and ""inside the Tor network"". The options enable relaying either just inside the Tor network or additionally out of the Tor network (exit).  How does the Tor relay recognize if the incoming/outgoing packets are going to leave the Tor network (exit)? Do non-exit packets have a special form different from the exit packets? "
1006,Why is the amount of incoming/outgoing traffic different on a non-exit relay?,I noticed something when letting a relay (non exit) run for a few days: The amount of traffic sent is larger than the amount received. This is confirmed by looking at the tor log and also by looking at ifconfig. Examples of one day:     [...]I've sent 556.92 GB and received 456.66 GB.      [...]I've sent 670.04 GB and received 546.71 GB.      [...]I've sent 861.17 GB and received 687.35 GB.       [...]I've sent 1060.14 GB and received 849.68 GB.   Why is that? From my understanding the relay has to forward any traffic it receives from a client or an entry node to the next relay or the exit. Any reply will also flow through the relay the other way around. Shouldn't the amounts of data roughly match? 
1007,How to protect against DoS but not harm Tor users,"Often when websites want to protect themselves against Denial-of-Service attacks, they will limit the number of requests one IP address can make in a given span of time. Sometimes this practice adversely affects Tor users because the high volume of traffic coming from one exit node may look kind of like a DoS attack. Human visitors to this site who use Tor will then get a message telling them that they are not humans at all but vicious attack robots. This is bad for Tor because Tor users doing nothing wrong can't go to sites they like. This is bad for websites too because those websites lose visitors (and clicks).   Is there any way for websites to protect against DoS attacks in a Tor friendly way? Is there any way for Tor traffic to be less DoS-y? "
1008,Can I use TOR for chat or e-mail with China?,"Sirs, Forgive me but I'm an unsophisticated end user unlike all the experts here.  I live in the USA.  I have a friend in China.  The ""Great Wall"" of China blocks all our attempts to communicate; e-mail, chat, if it's online you name it.  We only can communicate through an expensive proprietary chat service.  *****Can I use TOR to e-mail and/or chat with my friend in China?*****  How do I do it?  I assume my friend in China has to sign up too.  Is TOR available with instructions in Chinese?  I would be most grateful for any assistance.  If it works, I will be more than happy to donate to TOR.  Thank you in advance. "
1009,Will reloading tor service affect ongoing run of a torsocked program?,"On a computer, when running in a terminal emulator window  torsocks myprogram1   if I run in another terminal emulator window  sudo service tor reload torsocks myproram2   will that affect the running of torsocks myprogram1?   sudo service tor reload is supposed to change the exit node, and thus IP. Will it change the IP used by torsocks myprogram1?   Thanks. "
1010,Are Google’s captchas often downright impossible to solve for Tor users because reCAPTCHA is *lying* to them?,"(Stack Exchange’s system tells me that my question appears to be subjective and is likely to be closed. But judge for yourself if this is the case.)  Do you remember when Google used text captchas only? When you were confronted with them whilst browsing with your normal browser (for example the normal Firefox browser), they were usually pretty easy to solve and did not cost much of your time. But once you were using a Proxy server or a Tor exit node, things could have become very complicated. Some text captchas were downright impossible to solve because it wasn’t even possible for a human to decipher the letters reCAPTCHA wanted you to enter. Unfortunately, I cannot find an example on the Internet right now which shows how they looked like but they consisted of unreadable computer-generated gibberish – and the characters were distorted to utter disfigurement.  Today, things tend to be different since Google uses its Street View pictures for captcha generation. But the problem still remains to be (pretty much) the same.  That is, when browsing with your normal browser, solving a captcha like this should succeed most of the time:    If the squares are numbered as  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   , I pick 1, 4 and 9.  The next step looks like this    and I pick 1.  After clicking on 1, it looks like this:    The captcha has obviously been solved correct and I click on VERIFY. But what does Google give me as an answer?    This happens more often than not when using Tor. Sometimes I have to solve four or five captchas in order to proceed. It rarely happens during normal browsing.  Therefore, I suppose that reCAPTCHA is lying to Tor users and making it artificially and unnecessarily harder to solve captchas. This has nothing to do with “stronger protection mechanisms”.  Do you think that this assessment is correct? And if it is correct: What can we as Tor users do about it? "

1018,How to run the tor browser through a second proxy after Tor?,"My arch-nemesis, Akamai, is interfering with my ability to live my daily life.  I'd like to use Tor Browser to connect to a website that blocks Tor IP addresses by using an open proxy after Tor.  It doesn't matter which protocol to me, so if the method only works with one protocol, that's fine.    This question is very similar, but it doesn't specify browser, and Firefox has too wide of a fingerprinting surface for my application.  I'd like to use Tor Browser's fingerprint from a different IP address.  I have tried the following:   cd Browser; torsocks ./firefox --safe-mode would work in theory if you changed the proxy settings, but in practice, it never actually launches. Web-based proxies are right out.  I need an SSL handshake with the remote host to even consider conducting business over the network. cd Browser; proxychains ./firefox --safe-mode is liable to leak DNS information, isn't it?  I recall reading that proxychains doesn't use remote DNS resolution, and just runs a regular dig command.   Any suggestions?  If there's something like proxychains that runs as its own proxy server and I can just set the proxy to that in --safe-mode that might just solve the problem, but for the life of me, I can't find that.

1020,TOR How does middle node know which chain a packet belongs to?,"""Tor works like a chain of proxies, where each proxy only knows about the next hop and the previous hop.""  I presume that a TOR node may be part of more than one circuit though, how does it know which packets belong to which chain, does each chain have an ""ID"" of sorts? Surely that would compromise security.  If we have chain X: A->B->C and Y: D->B->C  and B receives a packet from C, how does it know which entry node to send to? "

What is apt-get upgrade doing - the name seems identical: tor (0.2.8.6-2~d80.jessie+1)? Will it upgrade the binary or the source package?

Facebook has notified me that twice in the last 24 hours I have logged in from different African and Middle Eastern locations. I can't believe that someone in Dar es Salaam, and someone else in Saudi Arabia, have really logged into my account. So, what Tor anomaly is making Facebook think I am logging in from there?   P.S. I wanted to set Facebook as a tag for this question, but I don't yet have enough cudos here to create it. Facebook is a rather important website. Why doesn't it already exist as a tag on here? Can someone create it for me please! Thank you :-) "
1026,Iterate through List of Exitnodes,"I am working on some kind of Exitnode Scanner (Like SoaT from Mike Perry). I have downloaded the list of all running Exitnode-IPs and I want to use each IP to build a 3-hop-circuit (or connect directly to it, using 1-hop) with this specific IP. Fetch some data from a website and use the next IP in the list to do the same.  I am mostly using Python for this. I use the stem module to get a new identity:  def newc():     with Controller.from_port(port = 9051) as controller:         controller.authenticate(PASSWORD)         controller.signal(Signal.NEWNYM)   Is there a way to make sure it connects through all exits (no duplicate) using stem? Adding all IPs to the torrc does not relay solve the problem, I guess.  Or (maybe easier) can I use e.g. proxychains to connect to this one node (IP) and fetch a webpage using bash? My start looks like this:  proxychains wget ARGS -O PATH URL   Thank you very much and have a nice day =)  Edit: So I found 2 possible ways, both not working at the moment. One is using the ""ExcludeExitNode"" option in the torrc. I tried starting tor with ""launch_tor_with_config"" but I will get an error stating that Tor is already running. If I kill Tor, I get no such response anymore. To workaround this problem, I edit the torrc file and add one line (adding one IP at the end for every iteration). Sending the HUP signal (to make tor reload its config) results in 'received empty socks content'. Any ideas to resolve this?  The 2nd option was going with the .exit (dotexit) address. It tells Tor to use this specific exit node for a chain. Problem here is that Tor needs to resolve it with its own DNS-Server (not the one that my system uses), which I couldn't configure. So I stepped away from this idea as well. "

1030,Tor's circuits behaving in an unusual manner,"As I understand it, Tor uses the same circuit for about 10 minutes or as specified in the MaxCircuitDirtiness option in the torrc file. However, I noticed something strange while trying to use curl to fetch a site while running tor on a separate terminal window.   Initially, the circuit being used was this (with the torrc file set to use an Exit Node in France).  Circuit 2 (GENERAL)  |- F25BCD77AB5BBA6F5A4D233DD57A51660ECCB9D6 (cleve, 46.166.167.46)  |- 94FE042E75138ECD76A3B7D6C30A83C6AA71463A (snakeplant, 178.62.180.121)  +- AFF2FC5C6F793B6E147EB93C1897D6DDA49E54FD (Wix, 5.196.66.162)   Where Wix is supposed to be an Exit Node in France.  I figured this out by first listing the current circuits inside tor, and then using a script to list down the exit node currently being used (Both by using Stem's API). Since the Exit node being used for my connection was Wix, I figured that this was indeed the circuit being used.   However, suddenly, after a a minute or two, I decide to fetch another request, and this time, the exit node came out to be a node in Germany:   And then when I repeat the request again, Tor switches back to the Wix circuit. Here's an image of that:    When I listed down the circuits at that particular time, I noticed a one-node circuit with this particular (which is listed as a Guard node on Atlas) in the list:    A similar thing (as in a sudden switch between the normal French exit-node being used) happened with another node (named clive above). This node too had a one-node circuit, and in addition it was present as a Guard node in all the other circuits in the list.   Could anyone please let me know what could be going on? Why doesn't Tor's circuit stick to the node in the country that I had specified in the torrc file? Why does it suddenly switch to a node in Germany? Or Lithuania in the case of the other node. Does Tor use one-node circuits sometimes on its own? Does this kind of thing normally happen?  Thanks.

Why does dig working, resolving onion domain into ip address but host, wget, nslookup, chromium... and other doesn't? Most of mysterium with onion domains only. Every other domains are resolving successfully and highlighted on lo side in Wireshark successfully by any network-tool or even chromium...  Probably, it is because dig is most robust tool to resolve ip addr, then what is wrong with other? Why are they not so smart? "
1037,Why does TransparentProxy working with `nameserver 127.0.0.1` but doesn't working with iptables redirects?,"This my second question is a continuation of my first one.  Setup is default Kali 2 and configured anonymous user from TransparentProxy manual on it.  While I'm using nameserver 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf - everything is fine. All console network-tools like dig, nslookup, host, etc, are working normally with resolving *.onion domains into IP addresses.  But, If dhclient rewriting /etc/resolv.conf with my local DNS-servers, this idyll disappearing...  As you can read from my first question, I'm catching DNS-requests with Wireshark on lo-interface. dig to *.onion domains - redirected to lo by iptablres well, but other network-tools - not.  Why does iptables redirect works with every other domains, but does not works with *.onion and requires nameserver 127.0.0.1?  Or  My question may sounds like: Why does nameserver 127.0.0.1 exists in TransparentProxy configuration, if iptables already configured to redirect every DNS-request to any IP-address to loop-back:53?  EDIT: Specially for @canonizing ironize:  $IPT -t nat -A OUTPUT ! -o lo -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner anonymous -m tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040 $IPT -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner anonymous -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53 $IPT -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner anonymous -m tcp --dport 9040 -j ACCEPT $IPT -t filter -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner anonymous -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT $IPT -t filter -A OUTPUT ! -o lo -m owner --uid-owner anonymous -j REJECT   Anyway, I can not find difference between *.onion domains and other... And how does this difference depend on /etc/resolv.conf. "
1038,Using Whonix Gateway to host web server?,"Is it okay to use the whonix gateway to host an onion?  And simply point the hidden service to a debian workstation like ""10.152.152.17 12345""? Generally it seems best not to modify any of the whonix preconfigured settings. So I'm not sure if using the gateway to host a web server is good or bad for security. For example, if the web server in the debian workstation gets compromised, is it better that I'm using whonix or would that make it easier for an attacker to pivot through my network? Or does it not make a difference at all? "
1039,Hidden Service Communication with clear net,If a hidden service has to communicate with the clear net but doesnt want to either appear to be coming from a known tor exit and masking its true IP what would be the best way to achieve something like this?

1047,Xmission Tor node Warrant info?,"I have a client who is thinking of switching to Xmission (a local Utah company) for website servers, and was reading a Guardian article about Xmission's stance on privacy, and I'm very impressed. They take people's privacy very seriously and have sided with the constitution as far as I can tell, but there's one issue I'm wondering about:  They have a webpage that shows the requests they get and the outcome, such as but I noticed some of them say ""No Info"" and they're only for anon.xmission.com, which is a Tor ""exit"" node, whatever that means. I don't use Tor, but I'm curious what ""No Info"" means, why it's only for those requests, and what exactly Xmission is doing in regards to that. Are they complying to warrantless searches or are they being honest that they have no info on it? I'm not even sure what info exactly they don't have (contextually). They would know what their response and its outcome would be.  Here's their outcome page: [website]Here's the Guardian article: [website]I found this forum looking for Xmission Tor info; sorry if this isn't a good enough place for this question. Xmission's customer support isn't available right now and it seems I need to have an account with them just to contact them online.

1049,Tor & dns cached,"On linux with wireshark I saw a lot of dns activity including a request for a site I am pretty sure I visited with Tor browser bundle earlier a few days ago. Not visited with regular firefox. However dns request made without Tor browser bundle running. Coincidence ? My mistake seeing things not there ?  After looking into the strange (lot of) dns activity it seemed to me it was caused by nscd. After removing nscd from the system, traffic went relatively quit as far as dns.  Also I set both  network.dnsCacheExpiration and  network.dnsCacheExpirationGracePeriod  to zero to kill any cache dns activity.  Could it be that nscd can leak what sites are visited with Tor browser bundle? Maybe illogical, but just to make sure. "

Ignoring of course that some applications still will leak identifying information, would this technically work? If some applications would still see my Tor firewall's external IP address as my PC's ""real"" address, could I then put my Tor firewall behind yet another firewall like this:  PC &lt;--------------> Tor Firewall &lt;-----------------> Y.A.Firewall &lt;----------> ISP/internet  10.0.0.2........10.0.0.1...192.168.0.2.......192.168.0.1...W.X.Y.Z  and have programs on my PC think my ""real"" IP address was 192.168.0.2 instead of W.X.Y.Z?

1053,Relation between ORPort and ServerTransportListenAddr,I am working on setting up a Tor obfs4 bridge. If I understand it correctly ServerTransportListenAddr allows me to choose a port (and an IP) to bind the Pluggable Transport to. However I also need to set an ORPort and Tor logs that it does reachability tests.  Doesn't this defeat the whole point of using a pluggable transport and obfs4 in particular? Couldn't an attacker just look for the normal ORPort and thereby detect the bridge as such?  Do I need to forward the ORPort? 
1054,How hard should tor aware applications try to share tor daemons?,"How advantageous to anonymity is it for different tor aware applications to share a tor daemon instance?    Examples :    I’m running both TBB and Pond does it improve anonymity much for both TBB and Pond to use the same tor instance?

1057,Is the paranoia about verifying signatures really required?,"On the site about trusting the tails key, there is a lot of information about verifying that you have downloaded the genuine Tails signing key. I was wondering whether this paranoia is justified.

Are there any recorded cases of someone being the victim of a man-in-the-middle attack while downloading the tails key? Are there any known malicious versions of tails that have some key associated with them?   (for the record, my download of the key is here: [website]"
1058,Will Tor automatically change path if one of relays goes down?,"If yes, is it default behaviour or some configuration parameter should be set?  If not, how can one determine and resolve this? Obvious way is to write a script, that simply checks availability of some page and sends NEWNYM signal on error.  Maybe there is simpler solution? "
1059,Can the Tor network be used as a VPN?,"Could you setup a VPN, but instead of using VPN servers, use the Tor network. That is, could you create a client that intercepts all your online packets and data (similarily to a VPN client) and forwards them through the Tor network (rather than a VPN server) before returning them back to the user?  This seems, like an interesting concept but is it possible? So far, I've managed to complete simple tests such as accessing urls over Tor, but that is about it. (I'm using Python by the way) "
1060,Why does Tor publish IP addresses of exit nodes?,"I am new to Tor and currently trying to understand the architecture of onion routing. However, I came across this TorDNSEL which makes it possible (for a tool using TorDNSEL) to  detect whether traffic is coming from Tor exit node or not? This way websites can check the source IP against a list of IPs of exit nodes and block the traffic accordingly. I am not entirely sure why Tor publishes the exit node IP addresses publicly. Is it how Tor is designed or is it more of a ""courtesy"" to the websites/organizations who wants to block Tor traffic?  Any response would be much appreciated. "
1061,Web of trust for Hidden Services keys,"Is it possible right now, with the current version of Tor, to use a distributed web of trust in Hidden Sevices' public keys, meaning:   Public keys are uploaded to public keyservers Users can search for them by human meaningful names Users can download keys, sign them and share certificates, thus growing web of trust .onion addresses may then (RLY?) be derived locally on user side from keys   In effect users would have   Convenient bookmark lists, with human meaningful names to use in browsers and shareable peer-certified bookmarks. Easy-to-check trust level for a particular Hidden Service a user is interested in.   By “is possible right now” I mean “end-user class software for Tor key managing does exist” (AFAIK, Tor still doesn't use OpenPGP, so GnuPG, etc. won't do). Getting “1.” done seems to be pretty trivial, if only (RLY?) is true. "
1062,"Does opening files in Office ""Protected View"" de-anonymize my browsing?","I have read and understand that you should not open files like PDF and Microsoft Office while using Tor because they can access the internet and reveal your real IP address without your knowledge. I occasionally visit links to Microsoft Word documents (.docx) that then contain URLs in them that I would like to open using Tor.  I have noticed that Word opens in ""Protected View,"" whenever it opens a file from the internet. Does ""Protected View"" prevent the files from accessing the internet? Is there any other reason why opening a file in ""Protected View"" would be unsafe or not anonymous?  I run Tor on Windows 7 and 8/8.1 machines with Microsoft Office 2010 and 2013. "
1063,Which pluggable transport works on RHEL6/RHEL7?,"A cheap VPS is a lot more cost-effective that running a bridge on Amazon's AWS.  This implies that the transport mechanism has to be built on the VPS, and added to the bridge configuration.  But which secure transports (that is, not (obfs1/obfs2/obfs3) can be built on a RHEL6/RHEL7 system?  I long for the days when the pluggable transports were written in plain C.  Now they seems to all be in some specific version of a scripting language or in some esoteric language that is unsupported by Red Hat.  Any advice on running a secure pluggable transport on RHEL6/RHEL7? "
1064,Is there a possibility to host multiple hidden services on one .onion address?,"Is there any chance to host multiple services (like a webserver, XMPP server, ssh server) behind one .onion address? Or do I have to create a single hidden service for each service/server? "
1065,Best advise for Tor users?," Do Tor users have any particular concerns, as opposed to general web users? E.g., the owner of an entry node might decide to send malicious code back to all Tor users, or the owners of an exit node might decide to infect all Tor users who visit a site that their government does not want them to see. Infection would be for the purpose of piercing anonymity, rather than for financial gain. Why doesn't China, or any other government or entity e.g., set up nodes to infect dissidents?  "
1066,Risk of running TB and FF together?,"I've seen such warnings, but haven't seen explanations of why it might possibly be risky to run the Tor Browser at the same time as running Firefox -  just general thoughts about how the 2 browsers might be sharing something. What, if any, are the particular reasons for concern?  Also, would any of the FF forks (Waterfox, Pale Moon, etc.) be better on that concern than FF itself?  "
1067,Why are these Tor Directory URIs invalid?,"I set up my web server to proxy my dirport to port 80 (to try to make things easier for folks who are firewalled) and found something interesting.  The following requests were proxied successfully with code 200 (by count):   12 /tor/server/d/[...]   9 /tor/server/authority.z   8 /tor/server/authority   5 /tor/keys/fp/[...]   4 /tor/status-vote/current/consensus/[...]   2 /tor/status-vote/current/consensus-microdesc/[...]   1 /tor/status-vote/current/consensus.z   1 /tor/running-routers   1 /tor/micro/d/[...]   However, all of these were code 404 (by count):    8016 /tor/status/all.z      4 /tor/server/fp.z      4 /tor/server/d/[...]      3 /tor/status/all      1 /tor/server/d.z      1 /tor/micro/d/[...]   At first I thought something was up with the way I'm doing the proxy, but if I hit port 9030 directly and try to fetch /tor/status/all.z, all I get is a blank page, so I'm assuming it's not a valid URI.  That being the case, why the very high count?  Is it a 'legacy' URI that is no longer valid, but being requested by older clients?  (I know it's at least v2 because it's behind /tor/.)  Just trying to understand the very high number of failures...  Thanks,  Rodney "

1070,How to mitigate layer 7 attacks on hidden services?,"I've observed the following:  The Tor client establishes reverse connections to random relays and any further hidden service traffic is tunneled trough these connections.  This means:   There are no new connections that could be rate limited by a firewall. It is not easy to monitor the connections for malicious traffic, like an unusual large number of requests from one of the relays.   As security folks will know, layer 7 attacks are anyway difficult to mitigate but how can it be done in this case? How can you detect a flood originating from one of the relays?  The other question is, would it hurt the hidden service functionality or anonymity to ban ""misbehaving relays"", thus abused circuits temporarily?  And why isn't there any information about this issue on the web? Am I overlooking something? "

Can I do this. If so how? What do I type in terminal?  "
1072,Can some one ping tails/tor,I know that my traffic is encrypted and Tor scrubs my information on its way to the first node. Only a bad node may get my IP. How about when my data is in transit.

1073,control tor via perl script,"I installed tor on a ubuntu-server with the command  sudo apt-get install tor   and I also installed socks:  sudo cpan LWP::Protocol::socks   After this i wrote a perl script to read websites using the tor network, which works very well (simplified example):  #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new('agent' =&gt; 'any user agent string'}, ); $ua-&gt;proxy([qw/ http https /] =&gt; 'socks://localhost:9050'); # Tor proxy $ua-&gt;cookie_jar({}); my [tex]ua-&gt;get('[website]print $response-&gt;content;   As said before, this works very well, but there are some servers who block some tor exit nodes. Instead of sending the expected content with http-status 200 (ok) they send the status 403 (forbidden). But some minutes later the same server sends 200 (ok) together with the expected content, so I'm pretty sure that the problem are exit nodes who's IP addresses are blacklisted.  I know, that tor itself changes the route (and so the exit node) as far as I know every 10 minutes. But in the case, that a server sends 403 because it has made bad experiences with the concrete exit node that I'm using in this moment, I don't want to wait 10 minutes to get another exit node that hopefully is not blocked.  I want to change my perl script into something like this:   #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new('agent' =&gt; 'any user agent string'}, ); $ua-&gt;proxy([qw/ http https /] =&gt; 'socks://localhost:9050'); # Tor proxy $ua-&gt;cookie_jar({});   my $code = 403; my $content = ''; while ($code &gt; 399) {     my [tex]ua-&gt;get('[website]    [tex]response-&gt;code();     if ($code &gt; 399) {         #####################################         #  TELL TOR TO USE A NEW EXIT NODE  #         #####################################     } else {         [tex]response-&gt;content;     } } print $content;   Note, that this example is simplified: Not all http-status above 400 are usefull to change the route, and there are also some other reasons, that make it necessary to tell tor to use a new exit node.  My question is:  a) How can a perl script tell tor to change its route? b) What other possibilities are there to control tor from a perl script? "
1074,Usage and purpose of variable-length cells?,"The Tor protocol version 1 uses 512-byte cells to obfuscate traffic patterns:     Traffic flowing down the circuit is sent in fixed-size ``cells'',   which are unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node (like the layers   of an onion) and relayed downstream.   yet it seems as though protocol versions 2-4 allow variable-length cells (see the spec linked above, search for variable-length).  Are those ever used in practice? What is the purpose of variable-length cells? "
1075,WebSocket over Tor,"I've been researching for many hours, but haven't found a definite answer. Is it possible for a client to connect to a hidden service with websocket?  If so, how can I learn more? If not, is there an alternative that will allow socket communication besides http from a client to a Tor hidden service? "
1076,Using stand-alone Obfsproxy in OSX,"There are many different applications that try to bypass censorship by Obfsproxy, but in OSX, how we can communicate with Obfsproxy as we can easily do in Linux? Terminal says -bash: obfsproxy: command not found  Also, how can I ask Obfsproxy to use a socks proxy before connecting to the server? in TBB's GUI, I can set proxy rules but in stand-alone Obfsproxy, I have no idea. "
1077,Why does a restart cause a relay to lose the Guard and HSDir flag?,"Why does a restart cause a relay to lose the Guard and HSDir flag?  I understand that the Guard and HSDir flag are based on time in the network. However, why is it important when the last restart happened?  Isn't it counterproductive if a relay loses these flags, because it or its OS gets updated and therefor has to be restarted?  Also couldn't that be easily faked? While time in the network can be checked against historical data isn't it hard to check for constant uptime without restarts? "
1078,Website seems to know location / Orbot & Orfox,"I have been using orbot/orfox on an android/cyanogen tablet. However, a website seems to still know my location. I would like to prevent this, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I am not torifying apps, only using orfox. I will start a new orbot session, then check the browser, which shows a different IP. Then I visit the site using a private tab. After this I clear the browser data. The next time I visit, I follow the same procedure. However, the site remembers my location (like town, not just nation). I haven't whitelisted the site in NoScript. I clear the data on in orfox regularly. I don't mix modes of anonymity.  Can the site be storing something on my device to ID me? If so, is there a way to remove this and prevent its recurrence? Or is there some sort of personal info I might be leaking?  Thank you in advance for any help! "
1079,Location fetch of a website via Firefox while mobile hotspot is ON throghTOR,"I understand that for best security Tor needs to be used along with Tor browser. Sometimes I do not use Tor browser and I configure Firefox to use SOCKS5 proxy. The following happened while I was using Tor via a SOCKS5 Proxy with Java scripts etc enabled. I do this only when I am not concerned of my privacy.   I had given my PC a wifi hotspot through my mobile phone and I visited this Microsoft Maps link refereed by a Facebook page.   [website]In this link was a request by Firefox that asked if I like to allow my location to be shared with this particular webpage. This webpage was supposed to provide me directions to a dining place.  I curiously pressed ""allow"" and surprisingly the exact location of my home was pointed out. I would still like to emphasize the fact that I was using Tor as a SOCKS5 proxy with DNS too routed.  My laptop does not have a GPS device but my phone which offered the Wifi hotspot did. But effectively, my mobile hotspot which was powered by mobile service provider Dialog has given away my true location to my PC. I am keen to know how this transfer has happened.   Thank you.   P.S:  I also found out my mobile Wifi hotspot leaks its location to Firefox on laptop via a location service provided by Mozilla as well. [website]I was able to precisely get my location (pointing right to my home) from this.   P.P.S:  I believe this situation is more specific. The mobile phone gets location from a method called cell tower triangulation. I want to know if my mobile phone can leak out its location (which is figured from cell tower triangulation) through its hotspot to Firefox.   Let me please prove my view point that Andriod Wifi Hotspot has leaked my data.   1. while being in the same place, I used my home Wifi routers accesspoint to locate my self via Mozillas Geolocation service. The perimeter of my area pointed was extremely large!    Then I did the same while through my Wifi hotspot of the andriod device keeping the home routers Wifi ON. It was pin poiting right at my home.    Is this proof that Andriod Wifi hotspots leak location information via Cell Tower Triangulation? "
1080,"How can I safely use Tor without the ""Browser bundle""?","I am a complete newbie, just started using Tor. I was reading an article on the internet about how to maintain as much anonymity as possible while using Tor, and it said: ""Don’t use Tor Browser Bundle""! Moreover, the article stated that some guy who was running some popular hidden server was arrested because physical location of his server was found because he used the Tor browser bundle.  Is there any other Tor as opposed to Tor Browser Bundle? I downloaded Tor from the only choice I had on the official web site and it seems to be the so called browser bundle. So where do I get the Tor that is not the browser bundle, or did the article refer to stand alone version? "
1081,How Tor handles cookies?,"Could you explain to me how Tor handles cookies? Thing is that these cookies can carry any and all information about my computer. Things such program details, length and count of every single session on my computer can be transferred directly to the company's web site regardless of how anonymous I am?

1082,Data saved in Onion Routers,"I’m an aspiring writer, working on a spy-thriller novel with Tor as part of the plot. Is it hypothetically possible to hack an individual Onion Router to discover the location of the previous router?  In the novel, the bad guy will communicate using Tor. The good guy will then discover the bad guy's identity by backtracking through the bad guy’s Tor circuit, hacking each router, one-by-one, until he reaches the bad guy’s computer. It is essentially a ‘treasure hunt’ with Onion Routers as clues.  Moreover, I want the protagonist to physically travel to each router to hack it. That way I can fit in cool locations. For instance, the exit router could be in the mansion of a Russian mobster. So the protagonist travels to Moscow and breaks into the mansion and hacks the router. The exit router then tells him where to find the middle router: an opera house in Vienna. So he goes to Vienna and tries to break into the opera house. Etc., etc., until he reaches the bad guy’s computer.  To sum up, then, is it possible (even hypothetically) to hack each router individually, after the data has been sent? Please help! I realize that this is an atypical request, but I would be grateful for any advice! "
1083,Why is my middle relay not picking up much traffic?,"I have been running a middle relay on a Linode VPS for many months now (atlas report).  My only bandwidth-relevant torrc setting is AccountingMax, set to 2 TB. The available bandwidth advertised by the provider is 1000 Mbps.   In practice, I don’t even reach 100 GB of traffic per month. Is this normal? Did I configure the node properly? "
1084,Does Tor bundle discards cookies from a window or only from a session?,So in firefox privacy mode afaik once you close a private window all cookies and other information related to the sites in that window are deleted independently of any data on the regular firefox window(s) you may have still open. The Tor browser has no private windows but does it discard cookies and other data from a window once it closes? or it only does so if you close the Tor browser altogether and/or ctrl+shit+U for new identity (which also reloads the program)?  What if you ctrl+shit+L for a new circuit? does the data from that specific site/tab get discarded or not? 
1085,Hacking Tor in my spy/thriller novel,"Question: What are plausible circumstances in which one could hack an individual Onion Router to discover the location of the previous router?  Reason: I’m an aspiring writer, working on a spy-thriller novel. My plan is that the good guy will find the bad guy by backtracking through the bad guy’s Tor circuit, hacking each router, one-by-one, until he reaches the bad guy’s computer.

That router then reveals the location of the middle router: an opera house in Vienna. So the protagonist goes to Vienna, breaks into the opera house and hacks the middle router. Etc., etc., until he reaches the bad guy’s computer.  To sum up, then, what are circumstances in which one could hack each router individually to find the original sender? Circumstances can be exceptional, but must be believable.  Here are some (bad) ideas of mine:   The bad guy live streams a ticking time bomb, keeping the circuit open. The bad guy has preselected the routers and left clues to where they are. The NSA has a device that keeps the circuit open for 24 hours. Something like a cold boot attack, but with circuits instead of RAM.    Please help! I realize this is an atypical request, but I would be grateful for any advice!  "
1086,How does Tor turn HTTP requests into 512 byte Tor cells?,"I understand that Tor cells are 512 bytes each, and that they are encrypted by TLS, and that they pass through a TCP connection from the client through Tor to the server.  But how do packets work one level above that? Let's say Tor Browser (Firefox) makes an HTTP GET request to stackexchange.com. How does it go from this HTTP request to individual Tor cells?  Is the request simply broken down into these cells or does something more complex occur?  Moreover, who initiates the multiple TCP connections through the Tor network?  Thanks guys,  Steve "
1087,Do I need a firewall with Orbot on an Android?,"I've been using Tor and Orbot on my laptop and Android for almost a year and I'm totally satisfied on both devices.  On my laptop, I run an aftermarket firewall that I've used for many years, and it doesn't conflict with Tor. However, I'm curious if I should run one with my Android? If yes, which one?  I downloaded a NoRoot firewall app recently, but after configuring it, it wouldn't allow some apps to open, and it slowed the internet even more. That app also states that it operates like a VPN.  Suggestions? "

1090,Should use same ISP for Tor and Real life?,"Should I use same ISP for connecting to Tor and for connecting to my real life sites like email and other sites where my Last Name and First Name figure ? I know about VPNs, Bridges and other things but on Whonix website they typed ""They won't help against Global Adversaries"". Also I've read on Hidden Wiki that is better to use your own router and ISP than a hacked Wifi. Soo my question is should have 2 ISP providers one for real life stuff and other to connect to Tor or no ?  "
1091,IP address and staying anonymous?,"What identification information does Tor strip besides IP addresses? I realize that, by filtering through ORs, my IP address is no longer identifiable. But what other ID information, besides the data itself (eg an email in which I write my address), can be found if not for Tor? "
1092,Does it matter when you connect to TOR?,Does it matter when you connect to TOR Network ?  2 cases: 1. You connect to TOR after 10 minutes after you connect to your real facebook/bank/email account. Is it harmfull to connect to TOR as like that ? 2. Second case is it dangerous to connect to TOR at 2:00AM-5:00AM when most of people in your state does still sleep and are not online ? 
1093,Does TOR client (Expert Bundle) work as an exit node by default?,"I have downloaded TOR Expert Bundle standalone application. Does it work as an exit node by default?  UPDATE. Related: Does running the Tor browser turn me into a (exit) relay?  Important. My question is solely for TOR Expert Bundle, not for the TOR  Browser. It's crucial to have a separate question as official FAQ don't transparently state this. "
1094,What do ORs 'know'?,"It is often said that each node 'knows' the preceding and proceding nodes. But what identification information does the node have exactly? Just the IP address? Also, as a result of what protocol does it get that information.  Thank you!! :) :) "
1095,How does Hacker News remember my login between windows when I'm using Tor Browser?,"Somehow Hacker News (and maybe other sites) remembers my login despite my closing the windows and changing Tor routes. How? Here's what I do:   Start Tor Browser 7.0.2; open some websites in tabs. Go to [website]Hacker News now shows my username at the top right. I also check the exit node by clicking the onion button. Close the tab showing Hacker News. Tor Browser is still running with other sites loaded, but no tabs have Hacker News loaded. Open a new tab, without changing identities, and load [website]Hacker News shows my username at the top right. Click the onion button to check the route and exit node: Sometimes no route is shown at all (?!); other times it shows a different route and exit than in step 3. Check cookies: Tools > Options > Privacy shows: Always use private browsing mode and Accept cookies from sites are both checked. Click Show Cookies, which shows no cookies at all. Also, via NoScript, JavaScript is disabled for ycombinator.com (and no other hosts try to load any JS).   It seems to me that step 6 shouldn't happen. There is no cookie, and my IP address has changed. I'd be surprised if Hacker News uses browser fingerprinting or other tracking and I haven't seen signs of it ... but maybe I should be surprised. More likely, there's something I don't understand about Tor Browser. "
1096,Orbort Tor android,"Does Orbot act as a firewall on android devices or any other devices it operates in and if not are there any plans to build a firewall by the organization that makes orbot?   By virtue of the fact that is has the ability to block and direct all incoming and outbound traffic through its VPN function which in turn only communicates with the entry tor nodes, a hacker would have to go through exit nodes relay nodes and then entry nodes to gain access to your device wich is virtually impossible with tor right? "

1105,Would Tor remain anonymous in a post-quantum future?,"I'm writing a near-future sci-fi novel where general quantum computing has been developed and SSL has been replaced with a security protocol based on quantum key distribution (QKD). Tor would still be able to establish circuits based on QKD. What sort of attacks would be effective, given the speed of quantum computing? Could NSA perform statistical attacks fast enough to expose the whole network? Would there be a different class of attacks available to someone with fewer resources than the NSA?  If this is too off-topic or beyond your knowledge-base, where would be the appropriate place to ask this? "
1106,"Why does Tor use three hops, instead of two?","With onion-routing a relay in a circuit only knows its predecessor and its successor, while a ""normal"" proxy is just one hop, so that it knows who connects to it and where it has to connect to.  Wouldn't it be sufficient enough, from the anonymity point-of-view, to have just two hops, guard and exit? The Guard knows where the request is coming from and the exit where it is going to.  Why does Tor use three hops, instead of two? "
1107,Where along the path is encryption used?,"This question is born out of two questions that I saw coming up.  Is the connection between my computer and the Tor network encrypted?  How does Tor encrypt my traffic before it sends it to the server? Does it even do that?  Please explain, where encryption is used!

I want to use my MacBook as transparent proxy so that it can share the Tor connection through Wifi for cell phones.  I follow the instructions on TransparentProxy, but failed. For Linux systems it’s easy to make an anonymizing middlebox that I have pasted test with virtual machine. But for OS X, the Tor client didn’t implement transport and only supports NATDPort.   Is that NATDPort the same as Transport? It seems not because it does not work when I used the NATDPort instead of Transport. So is there any method to implement that?    "

1111,How many Tor-like networks are around?,"I'm about an idea, onion routing.  Are there a secret or governments or a half-secret projects with similar technology?  For example, DARPA-BAA-10-69 is a project called ""SAFER"" (May 20, 2010).     The goal of the Safer Warfighter Communications (SAFER) program is to   develop technology that will enable safe, resilient communications   over the Internet, particularly in situations in which a third-party   is attempting to discover the identity or location of the end users,   or block the communication.   Is it a fork of earlier(Navy's) version of Tor?  Is there any fork of Tor? For example Navy's version. Or Navy use a torproject.org? "
1112,Would anoNet-style darknets of Tor hidden services be workable?,"Reading user329's question about running a secure email network using SMTP over Tor, I was wondering how standard email transport could be implemented among hidden services.  And then I remembered anoNet. Wikipedia says: ""anoNet is a decentralized friend-to-friend network built using VPNs and software BGP routers. anoNet works by making it difficult to learn the identities of others on the network allowing them to anonymously host IPv4 and IPv6 services."" However, if the underlying VPNs are routed through the Internet, there's little or no anonymity involved.  It would arguably be possible to create anoNet-style darknets based on Tor, comprising networks of Tor hidden services, linked by TCP-based VPN or OnionCat tunnels. Given such networks, implementing any Internet service would be trivial.  If such systems were implemented, would the networking overhead be unworkably large?  Such systems would facilitate high-throughput abuse of Tor. How could that threat be mitigated? "
1113,Would relay with temporary keys live the same great as with constant keys?,"I'm on Debian-like OS.  Directory /var/lib/tor/keys/ contains secret_id_key and secret_onion_key RSA keys.  Would my relay work the same with 5Mb/s of bandwidth if I remove these keys each reboot, simply by /etc/rc.local ?  rm /var/lib/tor/keys/* service tor restart   Say, I will start the relay fresh each time I boot. Am I losing any bounties from network like guard, etc...?  Will my bandwidth been used in the past be the same? E.g. When rebooting everyday. Or does warming-up of a new relay required more than 7 days?  Should I clean anything else? "
1114,Chromium browser bundle,"What is the current state of porting the TBB from Firefox to Chromium?  Several years back the Tor Project blog mentioned work by the Chromium developers to implement the needed APIs; since then, nothing.  Chromium seems to be far more advanced than Firefox in many respects: it has process separation, full sandboxing, and generally robust security.  The Chromium Project is open-source, and therefore arguably safe from government interference and backdoors, and user tracking should be a simple matter to remove. The blog post claimed that a good deal of work had been done to this effect, and that if the APIs were completed, the functionality would in fact be much simpler to implement than in Firefox. Also, with Opera now based on Chromium, it would seem that working on a Chromium bundle would make porting to Opera, SRWare Iron, and many others simple.   Has this work stalled? If so, why? Is there any chance it will continue?   Links:   [website][website]UPDATE:  I've reviewed the link mrphs provided and done some research.  It seems that of the five blocking issues listed, most are obsolete, fixed, or on the way there, and only one major problem remains for which there is no workaround.  It would be nice to see the Chrome bug list reviewed for updates.  UPDATE:  According to the conversation around that last major problem, a custom Chrome build would make it feasible.  It seems that the Tor Project is waiting until they can make an extension-only version of TorButton for Chrome, rather than a fully custom fork like Firefox.  Interesting thought: if something this simple became possible for Chrome, would Firefox be dumped?  In summary, progress is happening, but largely stuck on a few issues. "
1115,How should I verify Tor downloads?,"When I go to [website]What are all the things that I'll need to download to safely verify Tor? Once I've downloaded those things, what are the steps that I need to take to verify everything, and what will let me know that I've done the verification right? Are there any other steps that I can take to make extra certain that nothing has been tampered with? Finally: once I've downloaded everything and verified it once, will things be any easier or have fewer steps when I go to update my Tor Browser? "
1116,What is the overall safest way to use Tor?,"I have reason to believe that I my status or activities place me at particular risk. I would like to do everything that I can to keep safe while using Tor. I think that I should get a dedicated computer, but I don't know how to set it up, or stay safe while using it.  What are the things that an at-risk person like me should do to set up a particularly safe computer to use Tor on? Are there any risks that I should remain aware of, of that this setup won't protect me from? Are there any things that I should make sure always/never to do when using a setup like this? "
1117,How can I set up the most useful Tor node?,"I've heard of Torservers and Noisetor. I've considered donating to them, but I want to avoid consolidating the Tor network in those two organizations, so I'd like to operate my own Tor node. (I also think it might be more interesting and educational to run my own node than just to donate every month).  How can I make sure that my node is as useful to the Tor network as possible? Are there steps that I should take to make its network contribution more useful? Are there things that I can do to make my node more secure? Are there things I can do to make it less likely that someone will try (or succeed) at taking down my Tor node? Are there things that I should definitely make sure not to do when running my node? "
1118,Tor use frequent entry nodes after each launch,After launching Tor I can see in my firewall logs there are always few IPs that i'm connecting to. Is this something normal?

1121,VPN versus Bridges,"What are the advantages of running Tor after a VPN as compared to using an Obfsproxy bridge?  For example, assuming the goal is to prevent an eavesdropper on the local end from noticing Tor usage, it would stand to reason that VPN addresses would be more readily recognized than those of Tor bridges; it would also stand that Tor bridges typically exist over a broader number of countries and are harder to monitor, particularly Obfsproxy, due to camouflage.  In addition, VPNs can almost always be forced into revealing user information on government request.   Are there any real benefits to using a VPN before Tor that cannot be achieved by bridges?   Is there a benefit to stringing together multiple VPNs that cannot be achieved by increasing the number of relays per circuit?  Does it suffer the same drawbacks?  "

1127,Will hibernation cause my relay to lose the Guard flag?,"My relay's outgoing traffic is limited, so I had to enable accounting. The limit hasn't been reached for a while now and recently my relay received the Guard flag.

1130,CloudFlare's captcha screen insurmountable,"CloudFlare's captcha screen appears more and more often during Tor browsing. First they ask for a CAPTCHA and that's ok. Then there's the copy/paste confirmation string. That should be the last obstacle, but instead I'm back again to the same screen, re-doing it in an endless loop, that is quite frustrating. I'm not alone with it; there are others with the same problem.  Not only are they invading our privacy in a much worse way than normal trackers do (certainly much more difficult to block), they also make it impossible for us to freely and flawlessly surf the web!  CloudFlare and all the similar services are the new-generation of trackers: with the excuse of being protective against all kinds of DoS attacks, they are quickly conquering a very big slice of the internet! And whenever you try to visit a site that they serve, your request will go straight to them first, and therefore logged and shared too. There is no way to block this unless you avoid visiting all the websites it serves, of which there are quite a lot actually....  I feel like the usability and user-experience of Tor browsing is exponentially decreasing due to these kinds of issues. Has anyone else noticed this problem with CloudFlare? What do you think about it, and what the solution could be? "
1131,"Brave Browser's Bundled Tor reveals browser through search, is this a privacy issue?","Description  When using private window Tor mode I was surprised to see that Brave passes a browser identifier in the url of the search.  It seems having &amp;t=brave in the url makes identifying the user easier.  Since any tor nodes monitoring the URL address can tell which browser you're using (and Brave currently only has around 5 million active monthly users, of which only a small percentage use Tor).  Steps to Reproduce   Open private browsing window with tor Right click on highlighted text Click on ""Search DuckDuckGo for"" View url and see &amp;t=brave       Alternatively you can search using the URL bar which will also append &amp;t=brave to the DuckDuckGo URL.  Question  Should this be considered a privacy issue? Could Tor exit nodes use this information to narrow down the possible identity of a user based on knowing they are using Brave? "
1132,How secure is Tor?

Just how indecipherable would a hard drive encrypted by Veracrypt be and has this level of encryption ever been defeated by a global or state actor?   "
1134,Does suspending TAILS then removing the USB drive increase security?,"Let's suppose my goal is to prevent someone from tampering with my TAILS session while I'm absent from my laptop, and let's suppose that shutting down every time I go for a walk isn't an option.  The lock-screen password is good, but let's suppose that it is not enough for me. There could be a security hole that bypasses the lock-screen or someone could know my password.  Does suspending the laptop then physically removing the USB drive provide better security? On a first glance, it seems pretty secure:   If the lid is opened without inserting the USB drive first, the laptop will immediately shut down, and the attacker wouldn't even know why (they could just assume I used the webcam or something else to detect unauthorized persons).  If I notice the laptop is turned off when I come back, I will be alarmed and I can check for signs of tampering or consider buying a new laptop. If they install a 'fake TAILS' on the laptop and turn it back on, I will notice that all my session state is gone and I will also be alarmed. If someone wants to open the laptop without triggering shut-down, they'll need to a) know that I am using TAILS in this way, b) own the same brand of USB-drive that I used, and c) know which USB port I plugged the USB drive into. Even after this, they'll still need to break the lock-screen. Installing a hardware backdoor surely must be a bit more difficult while the hardware is still turned on, and if they ever accidentally open the lid just a little bit, it's game over. No one can install malware on my TAILS USB if I carry it with me at all times.   Am I missing anything? Why isn't this a widely recommended practice? The only minor downsides that I see:   you could accidentally trigger shutdown yourself. the session RAM can still be read physically on the hardware-level (but this could be prevented if there was an option to suspend to the USB stick instead of to RAM).  "

1139,Differences between Onion Routing (Public Key) and Tor-Circuit (Session Key),"I have a hard time understanding how a message is transmitted, when the Public Keys are used and when the Session Keys.   Tor Client connects to a directory server to get a list of active relays &amp; exit relays with their policies (address, public key). I verify these list. Tor Client automatically chooses three relays with a compatible exit policy I start building my Tor-Circuit One-Hop at a time. I send a Create Cell to the Relay 1 (Is this encrypted with 1 Layer through the Public Key of Relay 1?) The First Hop and the Tor Client establish a temporarily Session Key through the Diffi-Hellmann-Key-Exchange The Tor Client requests Relay 1 to extend his Tor-Circuit with another Hop to Relay 2 (Is this encrypted with 2 Layers through the Public Key of Relay 1, Relay 2?) A second Session Key is established between the Tor Client and Relay 2, trough the Tor-Circuit. (Also encrypted in 2 Layers?) The Tor Client requests Relay 2 to extend the Tor-Circuit with another Hop to Relay 3    If this step isn't encrypted with 2 Layers (with the PK of Relay 1 &amp; Relay 2), Relay 1 would know the address of Relay 3, or does it encrypt the Create Cell(R3) with the temporarily Session Keys.  If it uses the Session Keys to encrypt why would we need the Public Keys, to identify the Relays?  I thought the Session Key is only used for the response and the Public Keys for the Request, or do I understand something completly wrong?  In my current view the Request has three layers of Encryption with the Public Keys, on each layer it reveals the next target to forward the message. (but the relay already knows the next target, since it had to establish a tor-circuit)  The request is encrypted at each relay with the temporarily Session Key, the Client then can decrypt all three layers since it established these Key with the respective relay.  I'm no nativ english speaker, so I hope its understandable. "

I am able to connect from the one based on the newer version to the one based on the older version, but the other way around seems not to be possible.  Is this a known incompatibility? From what I can quickly notice it seems like they decided to switch from RSA to EdDSA (more specifically Ed25519), but shouldn't this change be backwards compatible? Also, since I am able to connect from the new Tor to the old one, why shouldn't it work the other way around? "

1151,"De-anonymization in Tor, just a matter of time?","Simple question. Doesn't the way Tor works make a de-anonymization more likely the longer you use/run Tor?  From my understanding, you are fully de-anonymized when X controls both Entry Guard Node  and Exit Node.  With the way Tor works, you are tied to a fixed Entry Guard for quite a reasonable time. If you are unlucky, you might get connected to a bad Entry Guard Node owned by X. From now on, it is only a matter of time until you are randomly connected to a bad Exit Node, also in control of X. This is due to Tor keeping the Entry Guard stable for a reasonable time but very frequently changes the Middle- and Exit Node.  Did I made any error in my thinking? If not, unluckily beeing connected to a bad Entry Guard Node would just need a certain amount of time until Tor randomly connects you to the bad Exit Node belonging to the malicious Entry Guard Node.  I hope someone can clarify. "
1152,Excluding Entry Guard Node's Country from Exit Node?,"With the way Tor works, you are tied to a fixed Entry Guard for quite a reasonable time. If you are unlucky, you might get connected to a bad Entry Guard Node owned by X. From now on, it is only a matter of time until you are randomly connected to a bad Exit Node, also in control of X. This is due to Tor keeping the Entry Guard stable for a reasonable time but very frequently changes the Middle- and Exit Node.  I have been wondering why Tor doesn't come with a solution for this by default. For example: If I would be connected to an Entry Guard Node from the UK, wouldn't it be a very smart move to go to  "" User > Tor Browser > Browser > Data > Tor > torrc ""  and add the following line to the torrc file:  "" ExcludeExitNodes {UK}  StrictNodes 1 "" ?  If we assume you are connected to a bad Entry Guard Node owned by X, wouldn't it be extremely unlikely that X also runs an Exit Node from a different country?  My solution would prevent the Exit Guard Node from being from the same country as the Entry Guard Node. Doesn't that solve the mentioned problem? "

1155,Does Adding or Removing Search Engines in TB's Search Bar Affect Annonymity?,"Suppose I add or remove a search engine from Tor Browser's search bar; will my anonymity be compromised?  I've tried to research this by running Panopticlick before and after installing a search engine.  Although my Panopticlick ""score"" (number of bits of identifying information) seems vary a bit every time I run it, even with no changes at all to the browser (the uniqueness of my screen-size-and-color-depth setting changes by a few hundredths of a bit each time, even if I don't alter the setting at all), I see no consistent change in score before and after installing an engine.  This holds regardless of whether installation of the engine entails installing an actual add-on, as, for example, the S3.Google Translator does.  So I conclude that Panopticlick probably is not capable of answering my question.  In the same vein, does adding bookmarks to my TB compromise anonymity?  What about changing a setting, such as the name or location of the download directory? "

1157,Is the Tor project interested in implementing support for Capsicum?,"One great new feature of the 0.2.5.x branch is support for Linux seccomp. There is a similar project that's cross-platform (FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, Linux for now) called Capsicum.  It is a project supported by University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, grants from Google, the FreeBSD Foundation and DARPA. Its goals are similar to seccomp, but the Capsicum project utilizes approaches quite different from how seccomp does things, potentially preventing a different set of attacks.  While the FreeBSD implementation is the furthest so far with Linux development  still not being in mainline yet there are a number of applications (ping, tcpdump, gzip, Chromium (wip)) already supporting Capsicum. According to a presentation  of the project adding support for Capsicum tends to be easier, than for adding seccomp support.  Is anyone working on this right now? Are there any plans on supporting it? And most importantly is there any reason to not support it? "

1162,Using Tor Proxy through other aplications,"Before I proceed, I would like to mention that I understand that Tor browser integrates unique features such as not loading certain html canvases, scripts and a whole bunch of additions to make browsing more anonymous. I always use Tor when complete anonymity is required although I don’t use it as my daily driver, yet!  As long as I am okay revealing my IP to anybody else, it is tempting to use other applications through Tor proxy as I have a belief doing so prevents my ISP from reading my data that travel encrypted through the Tor network which otherwise are sent/received unencrypted. I also appreciate the special feature that can route all DNS requests through Tor. I believe this feature improves  anonymity by a massive step and stops ISPs from logging where we go on the internet as both data and DNS are encrypted!   Question 0:  Would there be others methods ISPs can use to track where we go on the internet? (I don’t mean installing spyware or forcibly installing any malware)   Question 1:  If I use Tor proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 through Firefox,Chromium will there be any traffic leaving my browser unencrypted that can be viewed by someone else the middle (MITM)?   As per my knowledge, SOCKS5 + SSL + Remote DNS through Tor Network should encrypt all my Firefox traffic unless evil add ons, Adobe Flash or Java content reject to adhere the SOCKS5 Proxy I forced my Firefox to listen to. Please be kind enough to share your knowledge or correct me in this regard.  Question 2:  I understand the Tor browser traffic is more anonymous than the Firefox traffic that uses Tor.  But is traffic coming out from Firefox (using the Tor proxy) easier to be decrypted than the traffic coming of the Tor browser?   Question 3 :   Would those packets coming out of Firefox too (using SOCKS5 Tor proxy)  will hop through the same Tor circuit with the same exact hops as Tor browsers' traffic? "

1164,sudden change in port number of closest relay when changed to pasing traffic of Firefox through Tor network,"I understand to obtain the complete successful results out of Tor, is it mandatory to use Tor browser bundle. But sometimes, for a general user, Firefox is much tempting to use for many reasons as a daily driver and TorBB when complete anonymity id required.    I have been monitoring my traffic and I’ve noticed some changes when TBB runs and when Tor is used with Proxychains + Iceweasel(firefox).(Note:the entry point may change every 2 weeks approx, comments welcome as to why)  When TBB is running the entry point relay always has port: 9001. (the ip changes but it is always on the same port) But when some other application uses TOR network the entry point relay is different from the TBB's. It tries to establish connection on the same ip but a different port.  Usually Proxychains(also privoxy) or firefoxs' TCP/IP packets connect to relay whose port is 443.  Question 0:  I´ve checked and both are trusted entry points(relays) but why are the ports different?  Question 1:  What causes this change?  Question 2: How to stop this change?  Question 3:  Does this mean that packets generated through Tor browser are differently encrypted?  "

And sadly, I'm the last relay, so sites that the criminal visits logs my IP. Then the police gets this IP (so mine). What would happen?  Hypothesis:   I'm arrested. But what then? I'm ""clean"".  I'm arrested as a partner in crime. But Tor usage isn't illegal, is it? I'm freed because it wasn't me. I just said that I was using Tor. But they have no way to check the truth of that, huh? So supposedly if the criminal didn't used Tor, he could have said to the police when he get caught that it wasn't him, he was using Tor (even if he didn't) and the relay did it.   PS: what about minor crimes such as pirating movies? "

If I add the following boot options:     vga=normal nomodeset   Tails will boot properly, but it choose to use 1280 x 768 resolution.  I can't select a higher resolution because no better resolutions are displayed in configuration's screen.  What should I do to get a higher resolution?  Perhaps there are boot options to enter?  I never have this problem before because the older versions of Tails displays the expected widescreen resolution properly. "
1170,Windows Tor Browser Bundle check if relays is off,I read an article (about that Tor underground raid)) in  that articel they said that installing the Tor browser bundle could be dangerous as it acts also as an relay and that illegal data could be streamed by my PC.  But as far as I know the browser bundle only installs a new Firefox browser with Tor addon.  I talk about the offical bundle from there: [website]But now I feel a little unsafe...  Does anyone have more informations on this? And how can I make sure that there isn't a relay active? 
1171,"Reason behind ""clearnet warning"" when posting URL links on onion websites","When browsing onion websites e.g. discussion forums, quite regularly I will encounter links to clearnet http/https addresses along with an explicit Clearnet Warning along with the URL.   What is unclear to me is what precisely the warning is referring to. The frequency with which I see it makes me wonder if I'm misunderstanding the threats to browsing with TBB:   Perhaps clearnet browsing reflects a threat to anonymity that is not had by ""sticking to onion websites"" only?   OR   Does posting a clearnet link on an onion website give adversaries a new possible vector to exploit and deanonymise Tor users? That is, if the adversary can compromise the server hosting that domain, they have a honeypot for all visitors of this new URL, one which had not existed prior to the new link being created? I presume an individual accessing the URL with an appropriately con   OR    Does the threat relate to exposing visitors to potential deanonymization via correlational attacks?   If explanations 2 or 3 are more correct, is it true to say that the Tor user who first accessed the clearnet URL and posted the link was not vulnerable (at least threat 3), whereas the Tor users who subsequently visit it are?   Moreover, will an appropiately configured TBB e.g. Javascript disabled, mitigate the majority of these dangers from the offset? I apologise for the peculiar question -- from the context in which read them, it seems that posting clearnet URLs is tantamount to a faux pas.  Previously related questions These questions have been previously asked and although they relate to similiar topics, but do not explicitly address the question I am asking here:   Which provides better security/anonimity: .onion or https? Is Tor's security compromised if other services are connecting in the clear? Relates to non-browser related activities  "
1172,Optimize Tor Hidden Service,"there is VERY little to find about optimizing a website which runs in the Tor network. Besides installing the Tor daemon, what can you do? Are there any tricks like connecting it to more relays than the standard config does? Anything?  Unfortunately I can't run my website over multiple servers. The only optimization I did so far is reducing the size of all images so the user doesn't have to download so much. Sites like -for example- Grams load really quick. They must have done something to achieve that.  PS: I'm using nginx, it's optimized. Server is strong. The bottleneck is the connection to the tor network. I'm aware that it will never be as fast as in the clearnet, but i'm sure somehow I could do better. "
1173,Is a Public Exit TorRelay on or off by default?,"Looking at this releases for windows:  Are in any of these releases public exits on by default?   In his post @SamWhited assumed that they are off.   But looking at Point g of Configuring a Tor Relay:     If you want to allow others to use your relay for these services, don't change anything. Un-check the services you don't want to allow people to reach from your relay. If you want to be a non-exit relay, un-check all services.   So these bundles generate an exit policy by default?  I just feel a little panic because I'm, unsure weather i could have installed the bridge bundle a week ago instead of the browser bundle and that this could have resulted in an accidental public tor exit :-( "

1175,Stetting up a Tor Bridge in Amazon EC2 - Amazon AWS,"Its been around 2 months since I had been using Tor and I am in love with it.   I want to try running a Tor relay using the Amazon EC2 account I signed up today. I am pretty new to this service but after proper understanding of the tutorial on [website]I am on the free year, so I think running this machine int too hard to afford as Amazon provides 720+ hours of free monthly up time for an instance  for all new user for one whole year. This I believe creates great opportunity for people who cannot contribute to the Tor network with cording to truly support the community.   Question 0:  But the keyword here is 720 hours of up time for one month. This is almost the amount of hours in a month. So for a first year free Amazon user, running a single instance that has Tor in it is all he/she can run for free for a month. Am I right?  Or is there a way we can run two? i.e. one dedicated to Tor and keep another n ON state? (disregard expenses that might occur on both due to processing which are unpredictable)  Question 1:  I followed the guide provided on the [website] and noticed that we are only    creating a linux virtual server Creating Key pairs to SSH the virtual machine later Applying security settings to allow SSH,HTTPS, 40872 and 52176 ports.   Now I haven't noticed Installing Tor in any of those steps recommended. So how come allowing these ports will actually Enable me to run a Tor relay? Does any Linux flavor has Tor build in?   Does it mean when I am running Tor in my Laptop (running Tor version 2 which I received for Trisquel version 7 - latest) is actually running as a Tor relay too?  Yes, I do use the browser bundle whenever complete anonymity is required. I just find it easy and so convenient when Tor automatically loads at system start up without any browser.   Is there a specific flavor required to be chosen During the Amazon Instance creation? I couldn't find the place it was recommended on the previous Tor guide to create a Tor relay.   Question 2:  I am still understanding Tor and I am a newbie. I also know that Tor works based on encryption and not on trust. So I too would like to run a Tor Exit relay on my Amazon EC2 account. I mean its my server and I think Amazon shouldn't have any problem me running a Tor Exit node on it. yes I know the increased amount of data that it may cause me but If I successfully run it, probably I may have a chance convincing some people who are heavy Amazon users to run exit nodes.  so the question is, should I follow the same procedure that is provided on the Tor website for creating a Tor Exit relay to prepare a Tor exit instance in my Amazon EC2 account?  love Tor!

1178,"If everyone used Tor, how would websites protect themselves from malicious traffic?","This question came after seeing CloudFlare captchas, forums outright banning Tor IPs to protect themselves from malicious traffic, and all manner of hurdles where sites simply don't want Tor traffic.  This gave me a theoretical question - if everyone was using Tor, and sites couldn't distinguish between users based on IP, how would they protect themselves from spam and malicious traffic? Would they simply have to accept that there is nothing they can do?  Or would it be in such an alternative reality world that you need to enter a captcha for every site you visit?  I found some similar questions, such as How to protect against DoS but not harm Tor users and How to best help site operators protect themselves from Tor based abuse?, but I believe that mine is a little different because I'm curious what would be done in a theoretical scenario where everyone uses Tor, so blocking it is not an option.

I imagine this is beyond my control, so my primary question is about data leakage, and there is a secondary for any recommendations on how to fix or prevent this from happening, short of an update.

1182,How can Wget be configured to work with Torify securely?,"How can I find out how to configure wget to work securely with torify? The official documentation for doing it seems outdated.  I'm using Ubuntu Linux 16.04, with tor installed from the repositories, but using the stand-alone browser bundle is accepteable as long as it can be used through the command line/scripts.  I know that I can use torify wget [url] and it will download file/s, and I know that using the suggested method from this post (getting public IP address) that running this:  wget [website]and then running this  torify wget [website]do successfully return different IP addresses.  But a lot of sources always imply that it's not that simple and other identifying information could be leaked by wget.  This link (which seems official) specifically mentions configuring wget for torify  There it says for Unix/Linux to edit /home/user/.bashrc and add these lines:  http_proxy=[website]HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy export http_proxy HTTP_PROXY   And then it says to edit /etc/wgetrc and add these lines:  http_proxy = [website]use_proxy = on   But doing that causes torify wget to fail with this error:  Connecting to localhost (localhost)|127.0.0.1|:8118...

1183,Simple questions about logging in to sites over Tor,"I'm a Tor newbie that wants to use Tor to log in to a few communities online, and I have a few questions about the safety of it. Before you say anything, I won't use sites like Facebook that know my real life identity, or sites that are very important (like online banking). I'm generally not doing anything too interesting over Tor and don't expect to be especially targeted by hackers or law enforcement.  As I understand it, when logging in to a website, my username and password can be stolen when I send them through Tor. What is the likelihood of this, and steps can I take to minimize such risk?  If I change my password immediately after logging in, will that prevent hackers from getting in, or will Tor continue to transmit these details while I use the website?  I understand Tor reroutes my traffic every 10 minutes. Will this also re-transfer my details, making it more likely to get routed through a malicious node the longer I stay on the site? Can I prevent re-routing, so that only 1 exit node can potentially see my details, instead of 100+? Besides, some websites automatically log out if the IP address changes, which is just annoying.  Can I store a cookie with my login details on my computer, so that I don't have to log in every time I start the browser? I understand that this will somewhat reduce my privacy.  Or would it be better to leave the Tor browser running throughout the day, so that I only have to log in once? Would that not compromise my anonymity, in other words, the longer I stay on the site, the more likely the NSA or someone else will connect the start node and the end node?  Thanks for any replies. "

To prove the point they then used their brute force technique to make themselves all six HSDirs for Facebook’s .onion site    So they were able to make themselves the servers (facebook) entry nodes? Is this as devastating an attack to general users?      The HSDirs change each day because the site’s digest, which is based on its ID and the date, also changes (in a deliberately predictable way) every day.    Why the hell is anything about Tor's design predictable? Wouldn't randomization be our friend with these types of anonymity tools? I'm sure the complex work that goes into developing the tor network justifies the ""predictable"" nature of the vulnerability but even a basic user such as myself can see how randomizing as many variables as possible can be beneficial.   "
1185,TorButton Warning and SSL,"A little new to Tor, been taking a closer look at how requests happen in the browser. At the top when I open Tools >> Web Developer >> Browser Console and start browsing the web I notice a few things:   I get this TorButton warning every few seconds:  ""Torbutton WARN: no SOCKS credentials found for current document.""    Can anymore tell me what this means and if it's critical?   Also noticed a lot of this when browsing to sites with DigiCert SSL certificates:  ""getFirstPartyURI failed for [website]""getFirstPartyURI failed for [website]""getFirstPartyURI failed for [website]And this for sites using LetsEncrypt SSL:      ""getFirstPartyURI failed for [website]Can anyone tell me what this means? And why it might be failing?   In NoScript >> Advanced >> HTTPS >> Behavior, it's possible to force SSL everywhere. I kinda like this idea. I'm considering adding ""*.*"" so force SSL on every website. Sure, many sites still don't support SSL but likewise HttpsEverywhere doesn't apply SSL to some sites that support it. So I'm kinda in the middle here. Would anyone recommend against forcing SSL everywhere? This might make my tor traffic more identifiable in some way, right?  "
1186,"SSL, Mixed Content","[website]  Mixed active content is content that has access to all or parts of the Document Object Model of the HTTPS page.

1187,How exactly does Tor prevent ISPs from viewing internet activity?,"From what I understand, I am connected to the internet via my ISP. Therefore, all my internet requests are going from my computer through my ISP to wherever. So, my question is, how does Tor prevent my ISP from seeing these requests? Does the Tor browser encrypt the requests that are sent from my computer before they reach my ISP? "
1188,Is the obfs4proxy.exe supposed to run on an Athlon-XP?,"Will the ""obfs4proxy.exe"" compiled for ""Win32"", as extracted from the official Tor-browser download, work normally on an AMD Athlon-XP ?

1189,Additional Tor security at the client's network perimeter,"I have been studying Tor and its related security issues recently, and have some questions.   Aren't the most effective recent attacks on Tor, actually attacks on the browser (or plugins), rather than the Tor network itself?  My understanding is that the recent exploits involve a script or malware forcing the user to make a direct connection outside of Tor, using his or her own IP address.  Following this,  Couldn't these attacks be prevented by using a packet filter at the network perimeter?  In other words, whitelist the Directory Authorities and the entry node, and block everything else at the client's network perimeter.  I've tried getting Tor to operate this way and it seems functional, once the TBB loads the relay list and makes an initial connection.  If I enable the filter before starting Tor, however, then the relay list doesn't populate (Vidalia), and the connection doesn't initiate.  Finally, Is there a way to configure Tor such that it will operate automatically upon startup through a packet filter like this, without having to temporarily disable the filter to get it started?   Something like this wouldn't defend against end-to-end timing correlation attacks, but my questions concern security on the client's end of the network.  Edit (09_15_2016):   Yes, I understand that the network itself is going to be a weak point that can't be solved by a security appliance at the client's end of the network.  I have tremendous respect for our friends at the 3-letter acronym agencies, and have no sympathy for the people snared in the described sting operations.  At the same time, I'm concerned that the attack was too easy.  I believe that uncovering a user's identity should be costly enough in resources and effort that it will cause law enforcement to think twice before attempting it.  It shouldn't be a trivial operation that can be carried out on large numbers of people on a whim. I'm reading this carefully to make sure that I understand.  Yes, I see now that I overlooked the obvious direct connection between the client and the directory authorities.  Good catch.  If traffic to any one of them could be viewed, then the connection itself could be used by malware to encode information, revealing the client's IP address.  I've used Tor before with only one directory authority white-listed.  In this case, I suppose the malware would have to signal to all nine DA servers, and the attacker would have to hope that the server(s) they could see would be the one(s) that is(are) white-listed.  The direct connection to a DA server is a weakness, since there are only 9 of them, they are well-known, and hard-coded into Tor.   Here's a follow-up question for you:  After loading the relay list on startup, is it possible to block access to all the DA servers?  Would this prevent Tor from building new connections properly?  Unfortunately I can't test this right now (haven't gotten approval from IT to run Tor yet).  If it works, then this would force such possible malware to try other means for signaling.  It could try identifying the guard node from within the system (if the compromised system is the same one running Tor or handling the network connection) and then exfiltrating this information and compromising the server's connection as before; or alternately by signaling to all guard nodes, with the attacker hoping that he's monitoring the one that happens to be white-listed (there are a lot more guard nodes than DA servers).  Am I missing anything in this scenario?  In the interest of disclosure, we (at work) are looking into what we can offer the Tor community.  I'm doing some initial background research to see if we can justify putting internal funding towards it.  Initially the thought is to start at the client network perimeter with a hardened packet filter, then progress inward incrementally towards a stripped down and custom hardened OS.  Obviously I still have a lot to learn.  Edit (09_15_16):  I think you're judging me too harshly.  I wouldn't be entertaining this project if I liked the way things were being done.  If everyone who accessed Freedom Hosting was filtering their network connections like we're discussing, then probably none of them would've had their IP addresses snagged, even with an outdated TBB...on Windows no less.   At the same time, Tor is about freedom of speech and association to me, not the freedom to trade dirty pictures of children.  I don't like to discuss this, and I really wish I knew better examples of a Tor user's local network or system (not the Tor network as a whole necessarily) being compromised that didn't involve these indefensible scenarios.  Any ideas?  Both you and I know that the same types of attacks can (and will) be used in the future, but against journalists, people with unpopular opinions, people who generally desire privacy, government agents themselves, and so on.  I'm trying to prevent current exploits, and even ones that haven't been discovered yet.  I can't go to upper management with Freedom Hosting as an example, though.  I'd feel personally nauseated doing that, and I'd get some strange looks anyway.  Anyway, I'm going to try Tor on my home system to do some testing.  I'll be using the access control list on my firewall router as the packet filter.  I moved out to the boonies, and only have limited broadband wireless on a hotspot.  However, I can run Tor on computer #1, connect to computer #2 through the router, and then route the traffic through computer #2 to the wireless interface.  At least I hope I can do that...  I wouldn't recommend that setup for anything other than testing, since it's not very secure. "

1192,Anonymity considerations of HTTP referer field,"I was just reading about security risks associated with the referrer field and the ticket generated on Tor to probably disable it for anonymity. But I don't really understand the security risks. I have two questions, both concerning the unlinkability property in anonymization.  Scenario 1:  Let's say I'm using Tor and I go to site A and we are both using HTTPS. The communication between my computer till Exit Node is encrypted by Tor and from Exit Node to website is encrypted using HTTPS. No one can know I'm visiting website A and website A doesn't know my identity.   Now I go from website A to B, website B will know I came from A due to the referrer field. But it wouldn't know my identity. So no linkability. How would this jeopardize my anonymity?  Scenario 2:  Consider Scenario 1 using HTTP. Now data sent should be considered compromised as any one can see it between Exit Node and Website A. But what about my identity? If I don't reveal my identity in the data, they don't know with whom to associate it with. So still no linkability. Am I right? "
1193,Setting up Tor Relay on Ubuntu,"I'm having some issues getting my relay up and running with Ubuntu. I have one running on Debian with no issues, so hopefully someone can give me a hand.

I'd like to make it more random.  Thank You. 
1195,How to check if Tor is working and debug the problem on CLI?,"  I have installed Tor on a command-line only environment without the browser, so I can't use check.torproject.org with a browser. Tor is used by a script to request data from clearnet.  The tor service is used by Privoxy proxy forwarding in order to relay data to my script. It's been working perfectly for months now, but a problem has just occurred in the setup which is preventing my script to access Tor.    I used to use torify/torsocks to see if tor is working, but sadly it appears to be glitchy and torify curl [website]I am using a RHEL-compatible linux OS, and have ARM installed. (Which shows no problems at all.) Tor is set in client-only mode.    Please guide me on how to check Tor status from command-line, and where to look for errors to get my connection back.  Additionally, how can I determine if Tor is blocked by my ISP and whether if I need to use bridges? How can I set up bridges on torrc using command-line?  UPDATE: I noticed my server's time had gone out of sync. If you have a similar problem, make sure your machine's time is correct. Here's what I did. "
1196,"Why did NoScript in my TorBrowser change to ""Allow all scripts Globally"" on its own?","Today I noticed that NoScript in TorBrowser has allowed all scripts globally! I've had them disabled by default ever since I formated the disc. I didn't change any NoScript settings. Both my laptop's and desktop's Tor Browser changed to ""Allow Scripts Globally"" today on their own.   Tor Browser 6.0.5 was released 5 days ago, but the release notes didn't mention the above behavior.     I had initially installed Firefox, then NoScript (with ""Forbid Scripts Globally""), and finally Tor Browser. Could it be that NoScript from my Firefox interacted with Tor Browser?   Or have both my machines been compromised? "
1197,"Connect directly with Tor Browser (as in, bypass Tor)?","I recently decided to pay for CryptoStorm anonymous VPN as an extra layer to my privacy protection - so that all requests including UDP requests are automatically masked. As I understand it, all traffic through the VPN is routed through the Tor network as well.  So I don't think it's necessary for me to be additionally running Tor locally (correct me if I'm misunderstanding something here).  However, I would still like to use the Tor browser, as it takes care of many other security concerns - like protection from WebRTC detection and other JavaScript-based vulnerabilities.  Is there any way to run the Tor browser without proxying through Tor? I tried setting ""No proxy"" in the network settings, but it just says ""Unable to find the proxy server"" - suggesting the browser is hard-wired to run through the Tor proxy.  Or if it isn't possible to connect directly with TBB, is there another browser (probably another fork of Firefox) which would cover all the same client-side security concerns? "
1198,"Is there a ""reason"" for Orbot-tethering?","I'm wondering what would be the case to use Orbot-tethering?

(or not?) Also if I'm using my daily OS with Tor Browser Bundle, will it be the same case as above? Maybe Orbot-tethering will be useful for someone who has no freedom to choose his OS or browser, but in this case I doubt he has the choice of his network/internet connection.   So when will/should Orbot-tethering be used? Are my cases/thoughts wrong? - Will Orbot-tethering add some ""extra-security"" in some cases? "

I tried some stuff with bridges and ""Fascistfirewall1"" but as I know nothing about all this, I most likely have made it worse. "
1201,Can Tor make your browsing faster?,"Especially using OrBot on the phone Tor sometimes feels faster. Since I am not sure on how to really measure this I have been thinking about what the reason for this could be.  I have the following theories:   Everything goes over a single connection and using fewer connections speeds up things, if the exit node is better in handling this. The exit node might have a DNS cache that already knows about the hostname I am looking up. Potentially it even has an HTTP cache, speeding things up further. The connection from me through the circuit and eventually  to the website I am accessing is a better path than from me directly to the website. This could potentially be due to the connections between the data centers of the nodes (special lines). Stuff that Tor or the Tor Browser blocks or requests that don't have responses, because they block Tor. OrBot/The Tor Browser take fewer resources.   Has any research been done on that? Are any of those clearly impossible? Is there a good way to measure that? Just doing a small script testing download speed is probably not enough, most websites load a lot of resources, sometimes even third party. Has this probably been measured by OONI? Is there maybe a project related to making Tor faster that analyzes this? "
1202,Would ssh hidden service be very slow?,"Over at one of the guides on setting up hidden ssh service via tor, [website]  and then ssh-way youronionhost.onion server .

1213,Are there Tor modifications that do NOT expose uniqueness?,"Add-ons like Flash and VLC and others are more obvious, and the general notion stands that “any add-on is a risk to make your online fingerprint unique”, but I'd still like to think a simple Appearance add-on might be retained internal to the code (although I know that even the window size you surf with is broadcast, and makes you stand out from the crowd.  [Why on earth can't we override that window size value with a bland fake hard-coded value?)  Anyway, so specifically, will adding my favorite ~”SuperFudgeChunkPurpleMonkey”~ Appearance add-on from Mozilla.org leak to every website I visit?

Also – I like to customize and drag the Onion and NoScript buttons to the right side, and remove the Search bar entirely because I habitually use the URL box itself.

So is this mode of viewing broadcast at all?  To be clear, can it uniquely identify me ABOVE AND BEYOND the fact that I've already maximized my window by doing it, which itself broadcasts my ""unique"" screen size.  At that point does hitting Full Screen mode make any difference? "
1216,Performance issues in single guard for hidden services,"From what I can read in this recent post in the Tor blog, Hidden Services use one single guard, just as regular clients do. How does this affect the performance of hidden services? I know that since the single-guard proposal was implemented, the conditions on bandwidth that a node has to satisfy for becoming a guard are much stricter than before. However, for hidden services such as Facebook's, it seems that despite the load-balancing at the web server, the guard could become the bottleneck. Is there any analysis done on this? "

1219,"Can a client accessing a Tor service bypass a firewall, and if so, why is it possible?","I was reading this article ""Nine Questions about Hidden Services"". It's an interview with an individual who develops hidden services for Tor.  One of the questions (#4) is ""Do you run an onion service yourself?"" and part of the developers response to this is:     Also, onion services have a property called NAT-punching; (NAT=Network   Address Translation). NAT blocks incoming connections;it builds walls   around you. Onion services have NAT punching and can penetrate a   firewall. In my university campus, the firewall does not allow   incoming connections to my SSH server, but with an onion service the   firewall is irrelevant.   So I am interested about the claim that an onion service can penetrate a firewall.  Looking at the developers answer, it seems to me that he is talking about a situation where we have:   Server A. This one is on an internal network and runs a Tor hidden service. Server B. This one runs a firewall that controls access between the internet and Server A.   Based on that the developer says that the firewall is ""irrelevant"", it seems like regardless of the settings on the firewall, the Tor service can be accessed through the internet. To me this seems ridiculous but maybe I am wrong in something.  The questions I wanted to ask:   Is it true that the Tor service can bypass a firewall, and if yes, why is that? If the Tor service can bypass a firewall, how can that be mitigated?  "

1222,Manually check the SSL cert to avoid MITM on https?,"Let's suppose I go to [website]I download the SSL cert, then download the SSL cert from the same webpage, not through Tor, and do a binary comparison.

I am assuming the genuine cert for example.com has not been compromised.  I looked at plugins like convergence, but my questions relates specifically to checking the cert manually. "

They say their contribution will help to greatly expand and improve the Tor network, yet despite all the recent spin on the truth about privacy that Mozilla is putting out with version Firefox V.42, they are still responding to government info requests, and would not hesitate to allow eyes on their nodes. This brings up an obvious question:    Tor seems to allow anybody to host a relay. How is this safe?     If I was a fed, I would host many relays and just fish all day.   "

1229,"What does the logged Tor warning ""Onion address foo requested from a port with .onion disabled"" mean?","I am experimenting with different ways to Torify DNS requests for applications that do not support SOCKS5's RESOLVE or SOCKS4a, themselves. One simple way to do this is to configure Tor itself to resolve DNS requests using DNSPort 127.0.0.1:53, then tell your system that its DNS resolver is the localhost (with echo ""nameserver 127.0.0.1"" &gt; /etc/resolv.conf or whatever is appropriate for your operating system).  In doing so, and then tailing my Tor's logfile (having been configured with SafeLogging 0 and Log notice file /tmp/tor.log or similar), I noticed that each time an application that doesn't explicitly use SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 with remote DNS resolution requests DNS resolution of a .onion address, a line appears in my Tor log like this:  [warn] Onion address FOO requested from a port with .onion disabled   I'm aware that .onion addresses actually don't have IP addresses associated with them (of course) but I still don't understand exactly what the warning means and, oddly, searching for the log output text produces exactly 0 results on various popular search engines.  Thus, two questions:   What does the warning mean to Tor? And is there a way to configure Tor so that one ""enables"" the .onion on this ""disabled"" ""port""…whatever that means? Also, is there a way to change Tor's behavior regarding this apparent configuration.   Thanks in advance. "

1231,Why TOR is considered like asynchronous?,"I read a article that describes the caracteristics of anonymous communication protocols.  One of their is the synchronization. A protocoles can be asynchronous or synchronous.  This is the definitions on the paper:     A connection is asynchronous if the establish-   ment of connections and relaying of messages is   initiated by a user without any timing coordination   with other participants.      Connections are synchronous if they begin and   end at specific timings and messages are also re-   layed at specific moments in time, based on some   timing coordination between network entities.   Authors claims that TOR is asynchronous but I don't understand why?  TOR is a anonymous network for application in real time like browsing or IRC.It can not be asynchronous for this reason.  Unless I misunderstood the definition of asynchronous?  The article is available here. "

1243,Gmail and Yahoo access using Tor,"I used the firefox add-on ""Export Import Cookies"" to import cookies and logs into email accounts like gmail and yahoo with Tor Browser 6.5 successfully, but that does not work in Tor Browser 7.05. In Tor Browser 7.05 I tried the ""cookie Wizard with Witelist"" add-on for import cookies and although cookies are imported, websites behave as if cookies do not exist and I can not get into my email accounts. I can not use a phone number to login because that breaks my anonymity. I need to import some cookies to enter the email accounts using different IPs because without those cookies the security of the email prevents the login if the IP is not the same used in the creation of the account. I do not understand why cookies are successfully imported by the ""Cookie Wizard with Whitelist"" but Tor Browser and the sites behave as if cookies were never imported. I can see imported cookies in ""preferences> privacy> Show Cookies,"" but the sites can not find them.

I would like to create a PoC, but I'm not completely sure if it's theoretically secure enough to accomplish this, so I'd like to run it by this forum.  Hosting ""web"" hidden services with static files (such as html, css, js, etc) would be the easy part; it's exactly like p2p file sharing, but    how could it be possible for Tor relays to execute the application code? how can the web application hold stateful information for users? can data be tampered by one of the many clients hosting the web service? is it possible for Tor to support the load balancing? how can the website be updated by the developer? is there any other problem that I'm not aware of?

In Linux, if I start the Tor browser bundle using the start-Tor-browser script, and then shutdown the browser, Tor and Vidalia stay live.   Why do the two bundles behave differently? That is, what design considerations went into making the behaviour different in the two bundles? Are there any security implications of the different behaviours that would lead a user to prefer one bundle over the other?  "
1253,Is it dangerous to use Tails without persistent entry guards?,"Being a LiveCD with no persistent storage by default, Tails currently does not use persistent Tor entry guards. In a recent post on the Tor blog, arma discussed the possibility of ""improving Tor's anonymity"" by increasing entry-guard persistence.  Is it dangerous to use Tails without persistent entry guards? From discussion on the Tails wiki, I gather that there's some tension between making entry guards persistent, and the ideal of complete amnesia. Is there unavoidable tension between being incognito and amnesiac? "

On the other side, as it is a vanilla (I mean non-rooted) Android from a Google device, does it make sense to use Tor? Anyway I will send a lot of logged in data to Google or other organizations.

1258,Entry guards and separate identities,"I have just finished reading the posting on arma's blog about entry guards and I'm trying to reconcile what I have read there with what I (think) I understand from other postings about Tor.  First, I assume (please tell me if I correct or not) that a new set of guards is selected each time a user initiates a Tor session, so the remarks about retaining guards for periods of 6 to 12 months would suggest that some Tor sessions are of extremely long duration. Is that correct, and are there any statistics about the distribution of duration of Tor sessions?  Second, there are several warnings, in other Tor guides, not to mix different identities in the same Tor session. I understand that to mean that, if I use a pseudonymous identity of Frank in one session and access websites that recognize me as Frank, then I should not also use the pseudonymous identity of George (to access the same or different websites) in the same session. Again, is that correct?   Third, how does one reconcile the apparent desirability of maintaining guards (and, therefore, presumably a session) with the ""don't mix identities"" warnings.  I would very much appreciate some clarification both of whether my understanding is correct and of the apparently competing risks/benefits. Alternatively, if there are particular documents that I should read to clarify a misunderstanding or to answer my own question, then I would appreciate a pointer to those docs. "

Also, I wonder if I should make some kind of wrapper around my program, or around the zeromq messaging library. I suppose I might be able to get zeromq to use a certain (Tor)proxy. But if so, what kind of proxy information should I use?  Could anybody provide some hints about where I could start? (example code would be great) "

1261,Where to with Tails when Vidalia dies,"This question is prompted by the answer that was given to my question about the different behavior of the Tor Browser Bundle in Linux and Windows.  If the Tor Browser Bundle is to dump Vidalia with the move to TBB version 3.x, what will happen with Tails? Vidalia seems to be the foundation for the torifcation of the whole of the live distribution in Tails? Without it, how will users interact with Tor (e.g., request a new identity, look at the network map, look at messages etc), particularly with non-browser applications that don't have TBB's Tor button? And given that Vidalia is not being maintained, what is the best method for Windows and Linux users to be interacting with Tor? "
1262,Good DNS services for exit nodes,"Open DNS and others hijack failed DNS lookups. Some DNS services censor or block access to sites due to government or corporate coercion. Is there a list of preferred DNS servers, ones that don't censor or hijack the lookups that Tor exit nodes can use?   If there is no list of preferred DNS servers, can we build one? "
1263,How do onion addresses exactly work?,"I understand that the .onion address is a public key of sorts, but not much more than that (I can vaguely guess, though).  When nobody knows the IP of the .onion address, how do requests reach it? Are they bounced between nodes in the P2P network till someone decrypts it with the corresponding private key? "
1264,How many distinct Tor circuits are possible?,"Given the current relay census, and assuming a standard Tor Browser Bundle installation, approximately how many distinct Tor circuits are possible? Once entry guards have been chosen, approximately how many distinct circuits are possible using those entry guards?  Also, what is the method for making these estimates? "
1265,What libraries exist for writing a Hidden Service in Java?,"What libraries exist for programming Tor Hidden Services in Java?  I am looking for a Java implementation of the Tor Rendezvous Specification that allow you to implement a service using an existing implementation of the protocol. This library would let you implement a call back and handle the Tor protocol for you the same way you can extends the class Servlet and have the servlet container handling the HTTP protocol for you.  If possible, please provide links for the libraries home page, sample code and tutorials. "
1266,Does Tor take node age into consideration when building a circuit?,"I've seen this for a while, but in my experience Tor seems to select well stablished nodes (whose uptime is >60 days) but in the specifications this is not shown. It's just that the current list of nodes doesn't grow/chage? Or is there some other mechanism in play? "
1267,Tracking User Location using Entry Guards?,"Let's say that someone moves a Tor instance [1] from one internet access point [2] to another one. And let's say that an adversary is logging traffic from both access points. The adversary could log, that some user Tor client has chosen X entry guards out of Y available entry guards.  How unique is that Tor instance's set of entry guards?  When the user moves to another internet access point, couldn't the adversary be pretty sure, that it's the same user?  This is getting problematic if the adversary can at some point link the identity of a specific user to a set of entry guards, because the adversary can now monitor from which location this user connects to the Tor network?  Would it be better to have a separate installation of Tor (and therefore set of entry guards) per internet access point?  [1]: For example an installation of TBB on a flash drive or so.  [2]: Different ISP's, WiFi hotspots, VPNs etc. "
1268,How can I run multiple obfuscated services on a machine?,"I would like to add an OpenVPN service (for personal use) to a machine I already have an obfuscated Tor bridge running on (for shared use).  I would like the option to access this VPN through obfsproxy, while still allowing for Tor to have its own managed obfsproxy (both running obfs3).  Is this a problem?  Do I simply fire up a new, non-managed obfsproxy instance for the VPN? "
1269,Is it dangerous to watch videos full screen on Tor Browser?,"When watching HTML5 videos on Tor Browser, is it dangerous to go full screen?  Can this be used to find out my screen resolution?  Especially wondering this for Youtube. "
1270,Do exit node operators risk being charged with downloading or trafficking child porn?,One of the most common reasons I hear for not running an exit relay is the risk of it being used to access child porn and the owner of the exit node being accused or charged with downloading or trafficking the material. How significant is this risk? Does running a reduced exit policy mitigate this risk? Are there instances of exit node operators being convicted of child porn charges? 
1271,.onion Domains DNS lookup,How does Tor resolve .onion Domains? Are there also some central DNS servers in the Tor network that store these records? Is there a chance that two hidden services generate the same domain name? 
1272,How to connect to a remote socket through Tor in Python?,"Using normal sockets I can stream a list of numbers (updated every second) from a server to a client. This works perfectly fine. Now I want to do the same using Tor. Using Socksipy I am able to make HTTP requests to a web page (using this code).  So from that starting point, I tried to build a piece of code that connects to a remote socket through Tor like this:  import socket import socks socks.setdefaultproxy(socks.PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5, ""127.0.0.1"", 9050, True) #s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s = socket.socket = socks.socksocket s.connect(('&lt;the ip address here&gt;', 46956)) s.sendall('Hello world') print(s.recv(1024))   If I uncomment line 4 and comment out line 5 it all works fine, but running it like this results in an error saying: TypeError: unbound method connect() must be called with socksocket instance as first argument (got tuple instance instead).  So my question: What am I doing wrong here? How can I connect to this remote socket through Tor?  Also two other questions:   Is there no better way of doing this? By using stem.socket for example? How would I be able to build the public socket that I want to connect to, using a Tor hidden service?   Any information or hints are welcome. "
1273,Is it safe to enable the SSL Observatory feature of HTTPS Everywhere in Tor Browser?,"Assuming I select ""check certificates using Tor"", can I safely turn this feature on without compromising my anonymity?  Will this protect me against (or warn me about) a malicious exit node trying to perform a mitm attack on TLS connections? "
1274,Traffic in port 9050 in a relay (denial of service attack?),"I've set up a Tor exit relay (0.2.4.17-rc, debian testing) in my VPS, and it's running well (about 20Gbs/day).  But a lot of traffic (about 50%) is using port 9050 for incoming connections. It's something more than random scans.  Because I am worried, I've run tcpdump and the packets length is about 50-60 bytes long. It seems like DOS or flood traffic: external IP tries to connect and my server refuses (RST, ACK), each time.  My Tor relay (OR) port is 9001, and, of course, SocksPort 0 in my torrc.  Do you think something is wrong with my relay? Why that traffic if my only Tor port is 9001? Should I block that traffic using iptables? "
1275,How to upgrade to whonix 7 while preserving our sensitive files?,"I read on the Whonix website that in order to update from Whonix 5.6 to Whonix 7, I had to download the image again. While I have no problem with that, how can I update my virtual machine while preserving the files I currently have? Is it as simple as downloading the image then setting the virtual hard drive to the old drive file, or is there a way to transfer the files securely between the virtual machines? "
1276,Using Torrent via Tor,"utorrent doesn't work from my institute computers. Can I bypass this restriction through Tor to download torrent files? If yes, how? "
1277,Is there a way to defend oneself against a timing attack?,"Is there a way for an end user to protect oneself against the timing attack when using Tor?  For those, who are not familiar with it, a timing attack involves an adversary populating the Tor cloud with the nodes under their control, with the goal to likely be the first node that you contact and also be the exit node. The latter part is actually made easier by Tor, since it allows people to opt-out from being an exit node. With such a setup, the adversary begins to record times that you send a packet and also the time when the request packet leaves the exit node, and perform statistical analysis on your traffic and the traffic of the requested resource with the tor network.  Is there a way to introduce an artificial delay or some other mechanism to make a statistical analysis more difficult? "
1278,"How to edit the torrc in ""NT AUTHORITY\LocalService"" account?","As the title say, how can I do it ?  I has made a decision to uninstall Vidalia and use only tor.exe to run as a relay. I have tried to install Tor into the service so it is not going to disturb me. But every time I tried to install Tor service, it will run using ""NT AUTHORITY\LocalService"" account. Tor said that the torrc is stored into service user (means ""NT AUTHORITY\LocalService""), I tried google to find the directory of ""NT AUTHORITY\LocalService"" but found nothing. So anyone have any idea on how can I change the torrc for ""NT AUTHORITY\LocalService"" user ? "
1279,How would a registration of the .onion gtld impact the Tor network?,"The title pretty much says it all.  What effects would a gtld registration of .onion domain have on the Tor network, is this something to worry about? Or is it something to welcome and slap a web2tor proxy under its entire namespace?  Is it going to impact the security by the percieved notion to the general public that using a regular browser to visit someobscurehash.onion provides you with anonymity and protection? Or that the website you're hosting under your freshly registered domain name (or hash -- are we really silly enough to register a domain name like that) is safe from evil governments and corporations (provided whoever registers this tld would allow registration of its subdomain)?  Thoughts anyone? "
1280,Whonix problem with others IPs,"I have a problem with two other IP addresses. Whonix-Workstation shows a different IP than the Gateway? Is it obliged to be this way?  My host OS is Kubuntu, and on it I have VirtualBox running whonix-gateway and whonix-workstation. The loaded Whonix-gateway shows a different IP than whonix-workstation. Should these two systems (gateway and workstation) not be associated with same IP address? "
1281,Is a hidden service's onion address shared with any third parties while hosted?,"If I run a hidden service would my onion address get published or become available to anyone without me telling them the actual address? Or, if not, when would my onion address' existence become public knowledge?  The distributed hash table mentioned at [website]My main concern here is that just by running a hidden service an attacker could come to learn about its existence (even if I don't make it public knowledge) and that they then could start sending identifying traffic to my node as a way to find my location (assuming they also were my first hop into Tor or my had my ISPs traffic logs).    tl;dr   If I created a hidden service and began to host it but I never told anyone the address could anyone aside from me come to learn of the onion address? If I connected to the onion from a remote location would the address then become known to any third party?  "
1282,"Which kinds of relaying Tor servers are available as ""rendezvous points"" and ""introduction points"" for hidden services?","There appears to be several kinds of nodes (Tor instances acting as servers relaying traffic for others):   Clients with Relaying disabled (Included in this list only for completion, as their IPs are not published, so they cannot be used). Private bridges (I presume these cannot be used as ""rendezvous points"" and/or ""introduction points"" as their IPs are not published?) Public bridges (I am not sure if these are actually configured any differently than the line below (Middle Relays)). A Relay with exit policy reject *:* (these servers IPs have their IPs published, so perhaps they qualify for use as ""rendezvous points"" and/or ""introduction points""?) Exit nodes (these servers IPs have their IPs published, so perhaps they qualify for use as ""rendezvous points"" and/or ""introduction points""?) Any others that I missed?   I am interested in discovering what qualifies and or disqualifies a node for use as an ""introduction point.""  And I am equally as interested in discovering what qualifies and or disqualifies a node for use as an ""rendezvous point.""  Based on my reading of the documentation I currently believe that ""introduction points"" are all hosted on exit nodes, and ""rendezvous points"" will only choose a ""Relay with exit policy reject *:* (middle nodes)"" "
1283,Why should users not use the same browser for both I2P and Tor?,"In several forums and articles that I have read people say that the best security for users that want to run both Tor and I2P is to use separate browsers for each. What are the security and anonymity risks of configuring the Tor Browser Bundle to also work with I2P? Would some of this possible Tor/I2P-leaks be negated if the user disabled Firefox cache, cookies, and/or javascript? "
1284,Why doesnt this page load?,"I can't get the following page to load although i've tried lots of things.  [website]I am running 4.0.1 web bundle (Windows 7). The main part of the page loads but not the youtube playlist video part.  I' tried:   allowing scipts in noscrip; delete noscript from the addons; installed quick java - activated js, ja and f; several new identities; installed Tor version 4.0 and 3.6.6; tested the page in chrome and firefox - worked there; installed adobe flash for firefox and set it to allways activated in tor; normal youtube playlists work;   Nothing worked. ill update this when I find new possible solutions or the final solution.

1286,"Safe to login to personal accounts (email, Amazon, etc.) when using Tor?","Is it less or more safe to login to personal accounts (email, Amazon, etc.) when using Tor, compared to not using Tor?   For example, using Tor browser, or Firefox/Chrome with Tor extensions.  What are the cons and pros?  Will my account information be recorded by the machines in Tor network that I am connecting to? "
1287,Probability by bandwidth: Using multiple or one Relay with equal total Bandwidth,"Is there a higher probability, if an attacker is using one OR of bandwidth 5 MB/s than 5 ORs with each 1 MB/s?   If you calculate the probability of picking a certain OR, you can use the weighted Bandwidth, because a OP is picking random ORs for the circuit, besides other characteristics proportional to its weighted Bandwidth. If you want to calculated the probability whether an malicious OR will be picked, I would draw the conclusion, that you can use the total of malicious (weighted)Bandwidth.  Example: Lets say the attacker Bob uses a 5 ORs, each 1MB/s bandwidth (total bandwidth 5 MB/s). And attacker Lucy uses only one OR with a total bandwidth of 5 MB/s. Would there be a difference in terms of probability? What is more likely? An OR of Bob being picked or from Lucy? "
1288,Are Tor version and Tor link connection version same?,"Tor version format is explained in this link. In Tor specification (section 4.1), I found what they call ""Tor link connection version"" which based on my understanding could be one, two or higher.. my questions are these two versions the same? If not where can I find information about the tor link connection protocol version? If they are same, is the minor number corresponds to the link connection protocol version?   Thanks in advance! "
1289,How to tell my Tor Browser to use a certain relay as entry point?,"I am running a Tor relay on a remote server that is hosted in a professional server farm about 1000 km away from my home. I am absolutely sure, that this Tor relay is secure because I am root on this server (which is a virtual root server), because I did install the Tor relay, and because there is no other user on that machine than me.  There are many scenarios for attacks against anonymity of Tor users, and many of them include a modified software running a Tor relay that records traffic of this node and compares it with traffic from other nodes.  So I think I could lower the risk of being victim of such an attack by telling my local Tor browser to use my own Tor relay as my entry point.  Here are my questions:   Is it true that I can avoid some attack scenarios with my strategy without being target for new ones? Even if my server is a virtual root-server in a remote server farm?   Where can I find the settings to tell my local Tor Browser Bundle to always use only the IP-address of my own relay as entry point?  "
1290,No http:// in the URL bar of my search results using Tor browser,I'm a first time user of Tor.  My search result using the Tor browser does not include the [website]Am I using the browser wrong? 
1291,Is any body aware if the people whose pages were seized illegally have sued or intend to sue the FBI?,"According to this analysis, many of the sites taken down by onymous were legal:     There are almost 200 sites that have been seized that are not mentioned in any seizure notice or press release. These include the (real) sites for Fish Squad, Exposed, Hack the Planet, Cash Machine, DOXBIN, Pink Meth, OnionSphere, Mr Ouid’s Forum. That list includes personal websites, forums or other sites that had no outward appearance of illegal activity, and they are also not mentioned in any court or press documents. These sites were seized with what appears to be no, or little legal justification.   Is there any indication of the people whose webpages were taken down apparently illegally have sued and/or intend to sue the FBI and/or any other entity over the apparent illegal seizure? Is there any indication of Class action lawsuit being prepared in this matter? "
1292,How does torcheck know I'm using TBB?,"When I go to [website]But when I go there using another browser (non TBB) I get a positive (orange) result that says I am using Tor, but not TBB:    How does check.torproject.org know I am using TBB? What implications does that have on my anonymity on the internet? What else can anyone (read: ISPs, governments, corporate IT personnel, etc.) know about me when I'm using Tor? "
1293,Do I have to uninstall my other browsers before using Tor Browser Bundle?,"I'm new to Tor and not a computer whiz.  I use IE and Chrome, or have done until now and have no idea how many cookies are around.  Will my searches on Tor Browser Bundle be totally anonymous with the other browsers installed?   Basically, how do I ensure anonymity not just in Tor Browser Bundle but also throughout my computer? "
1294,What is the Tor network exit node IP address turnover?,"I'm curious how frequently do the Tor network exit node IPs change?  More specifically, approximately what percentage in a given month still remain in use the next month?  Or do all typically stay in use and just new ones are added? "
1295,What is the risk of Guard-Exit node in Tor compare to Guard and exit node separately?,"It appears that having Guard-Exit node in Tor increase the probability of deanonymizing the client compare to Guard and exit node separately. To put it in a nutshell if a node at times could become your Guard node and at other times could become your exit node even in a same session (look at this question  for reference   What is the risk of guard relay and exit relay being one and the same?), it might be able to integrate these information and thus facilitate client deanonymization. For further reference also please look at this question Why adding Guard-Exit (EE) node in Tor yeild more catch probability than adding guard and exit node separately?  Under these circumstances, why would Tor allow Guard-Exit node? "
1296,Are server-sent-events (SSE) supported over Tor?,"Server Sent Events(SSE) are a new alternative method to enable browser-server communication. Since Mozilla is supporting this initiative in their browsers, can we use SSE with the Tor Browser? What about SSE compatible browsers operating over Tor in general? "
1297,Strange window anomalies when starting Tor Browser,"I recently updated to Tor Browser 4.0 and found that this new version has a number of oddities in the realm of how it draws its window.  Please examine the attached screenshots.    This screenshot shows how the Tor Browser window first shows up on my screen after a fresh install.  Note the blank spaces at the bottom of the window (resembling a status bar) and at the right edge.  Both of these anomalies go away if I do anything to resize the window, or even just minimize and restore the window (forcing a redraw) - so the inconvenience is minor, but still, this shouldn't be happening.    This screenshot shows the changes after installing the Classic Theme Restorer extension and restarting.  First, note that the window is considerably shorter than on the first run; this has nothing to do with CTR and happens on the second run even when the first run is shut down without doing anything.  Why can't Tor Browser properly save and restore my desired window height?  Second, notice that the blank spaces at bottom and right still appear, even now that CTR is creating a new toolbar at the bottom of the window.  Third, notice that the old style of main menu button at upper left that was recreated by CTR does not appear to have enough room for the words ""Tor Browser"".  (Unlike the others, this particular anomaly never does resolve itself, no matter what I do.)  Am I doing something to cause these strange behaviors?  Is there something unusual about my computer that could be causing them?  Is there some sort of incompatibility between Tor Browser and CTR that I'm not aware of? "
1298,How to detect Tor usage with Wireshark?,"I use Tor inside a Virtual Machine. I run Wireshark on my Host. I want to detect Tor usage (for learning/studying) with Wireshark but don't know how?

1305,Is it safe to stop using Tor after illegal activity? Other security questions I cant find answers to,"Is it safe to stop the Tor browser and network, and start using something like internet explorer or google chrome after?

If me and my brother use a laptop each (as in 2 total) and I have Tor and am buying drugs, and he is not and is watching youtube or searching google , am I at risk? LASTLY something particularly worrying happened, after browsing with Tor for a day, I stopped, deleted it, and went back to google chrome and my un hidden use of internet, I went to youtube and noticed all the recommended videos and channels, they were specifically from genres or themes of the sites I had visited, like completely japanese channels and videos, about guns, and various things I had searched about while using Tor... *note I never used google,fb, gov sites or anything like that. So is this a sign I compromised myself somehow leaking my IP address? The recommendations were from only what I did on Tor. Am just lucky not to have been spotted by authorities?  "

1312,Relay cell size moving backward,"I have been studying the papers on Tor and Onion Routing for my thesis and I have been trying to figure out how the whole cell size works.  In the OR paper it is made clear that when a cell moves in the forward direction, every time an encryption layer is removed, the size is kept the same with the use of padding. This is not mentioned clearly in the Tor paper, but I believe that it is the same there as well.  How does it work in the opposite direction (backward)? In the OR paper it says that in every node, an encryption layer is added on the cell and the initiator receives a cell with multiple layers of encryption. But, is there a use of padding here as well, in order to maintain the size? And how do it work for the second and third node?  Do they remove padding in order to add a layer of encryption?  Thanks! "

I have a Windows 10 computer (Fully up to date) with Virtual Box installed. Within the VB I have Linux Mint installed, set up and ready to go. I have also downloaded the Tor browser from the official website. However when I boot the browser it asks me if I want to just connect and go, or if I want to configure the browser if I have a VPN running. Thing is my Host Windows 10 system has ProtonVPN installed and active. So my question is do I need to configure the Tor browser even though the VPN is on the host? If I do need to configure it, how do I do that? Thanks. "

1318,Track Tor circuit via ISP logs,"I have some question about the very basics of tor, as this keeps bugging me now for some time:  As far as I know every tor node is only aware of the ip address of the following node. For example the guard node knows where the next relay is, but does not know the exit node (as this information is hidden from it by encryption). The same holds true in the other direction, i.e. from exit node to guard node. This ensures that if let's say somebody gets access to the exit node the actual origin still remains hidden.  Now imagine the following scenario: All three nodes lie within countries where let's say law enforcement or agencies are known to cooperate (maybe the EU). Let's also assume that there is very little traffic over these nodes. Isn't it then possible for an attacker like law enforcement to first acquire logs from an Internet Service Provider for the exit node, figure out to which ip the exit node sent data in a specific time frame, then check the logs for the second node and so on? Does anonymity in this scenario depend on the amount of traffic making correlations in ISP logs difficult or impossible? "

1322,Does your internet provider see that you're using TOR?,I hope this doesn't sound like a stupid question but can your internet service provider see that you're using TOR?

1323,Why is the pub-key of diffie hellmann from Alice (OP) to Bob (OR) encrypted?,"For building a circuit Alice contacts Bob (OR) and send her pub diffie-hellmann key encrypted with Bobs pub key. Bob sends his public-diffie-hellmann key and the session key hashed (""only"" TLS encrypted...) back to Alice.  Encrypting the diffie-key with Bob public's key makes some kind of authentication because only Bob can know Alice public secret and calculate the correct hash. Why is it done that way? In my opinion it is against the diffie-helllmann protocol where p,g,g^(a) are public and authentication is done by signing.  Bob could just sign the answer and everything would be the authenticated.  Could this be some kind of ""proof-of-work"" to harden against ddos attacks? "
1324,Increasing number of middle relays weakens the anonymity?,"Tor nodes build encrypted TLS sessions between neighbors to multiplex circuits of users. Multiplexing helps to anonymize users (?).  With an increasing number of middle relays multiplexing becomes rare (because Guard nodes... and Exit nodes are some ""predefined"" set).   Can it happen that with an increasing number of relays (often middle relays) timing attacks become much stronger? (maybe I could use netflow, etc. ...) Extrem case: each circuit has it's own middle relay. "
1325,"Does Tor still monitor ""shadow"" relays?","I've been researching methods to monitor hidden services for a university project. I came across this paper which talks about injecting relays as hidden service directories to gather onion addresses. To make this affordable, the researchers take advantage of what they call ""shadowing"".   From the paper:     However, by inspecting the Tor source code we noticed   that while only two relays per IP appear in the Consensus,   all running relays are monitored by the authorities; more   importantly, statistics on them is collected, including the   uptime which is used to decide which flags a relay will   be assigned.   This would allow them to get the necessary flags to get the HSDir flag for more than two relays on a single IP.     Our approach is based on shadow relays described   in the previous section. An attacker can use this artifact of   Tor’s design as follows. She can rent 50 IP addresses and   run 24 relays on each of them for 25 hours thus running   1200 Tor instances in total; 100 of them should appear in   the consensus. The fingerprints of the public keys of the   relays should fall into every second gap in the fingerprint   circle. At the end of 25 hour time period all of the relays   will have HSDir flags but only 100 of them will appear in   the consensus and the rest will be shadow relays. The idea   is to gradually make active relays unreachable to the Tor   authorities so that shadow relays become active and thus   gradually cover all gaps in the circular list during 24 hours.   I was wondering if this technique is still possible given that the paper is from 2013 and this might have been patched since then.  Additional question:  Now that the ""stable"" flag is a requirement to get the HSDir flag, how long does a relay need to run in order to get the HSDir flag?  From the Tor documentation:     ""Stable"" -- A router is 'Stable' if it is active, and either its Weighted      MTBF is at least the median for known active routers or its Weighted MTBF      corresponds to at least 7 days.   Does this mean that 7 days of uptime is not a requirement for the ""stable"" flag? "

1328,How ToR meek client works?,"Before posting, I've already read these suggested links: meek-client ..  pluggable transports so my question is not duplicate. Rather it is an extension to that question. Meek client hides your ToR traffic from your ISP but it's working is quite complicated. in short it works like this How meek works In this picture you can see that Intermediate fronted server is decrypting the packet and forwarding the forbidden.example-> which is meek server itself. I understand ISP can't do this as it is encrypted request but the fronted server can easily block this ""not allowed"" domain because it knows that the request is made for meek server. Why the Content Delivery Network Fronted server is not blocking client request for connecting to meek server?? Either fronted server is not intentionally blocking it or it doesn't know that the forbidden.example request is actually a meek server. How it actually works? "

1332,Running TorBB on host machine while running Whonix VM setup as guest on the same physical box,"I've currently set up Whonix VMs using Virtual Box on OS X 10.11.6.

Could it be dangerous for my anonymity to run TorBB+Bitcoin-QT setup on host(OSX) machine while running Whonix VM setup at the same time?  I guess the best way is to transfer somehow my bitcoins to Whonix Workstation, and set up there something like a thin wallet (electrum or multibit)?

1342,Why openVPN doesn't implement Tunnelblick's xor patch to hide openVPN traffic from DPI?,"Tunnelblick created a patch for openVPN client and server which can hide your openVPN traffic from deep packet inspection. According to tunnelblicks-an open source VPN provider for MacOSX The option can be useful to avoid having OpenVPN traffic detected by monitoring or censoring mechanisms such as the Great Firewall of China. The option ""scrambles"" each buffer of traffic before it is sent between the OpenVPN client and server. The patch is attractive because it is so easy to implement: simply apply the patch to both the OpenVPN server and the OpenVPN client and add a single, identical option to the configuration files for each. Using obfsproxy is more complicated because it involves running another, separate program on both the server and the client.  But openVPN developer refused to add this. According to them we especially discourage using such an approach when there exists a far better solution, used by the TOR community. It is called obfsproxy and can be used together with OpenVPN without needing any re-compilation of OpenVPN.  My question is you already know that Tor is slow and when it is used with pluggable transport like obfsproxy or meek it becomes slower. Now openVPN developers also want us to use this then don't you think by adding a obfsproxy server, VPN will become slower as Tor? How is it a far better option?Is there any security reason they refused to add this?  Full article source can be read here "

My question is that why there is such difference in size (74 bytes difference)?   In my own testing, instead of TOR packets with size of 586 bytes, there are packets with size of 543 bytes in TOR traffic and packets with size of 565 bytes in Obfsproxy traffic.   My question here is that why doesn't TOR or Obfsproxy generate 586 bytes? the size that reported in lots of papers like this one ?   In my own testing on TOR traffic, from 9939 packets that were sent from client to server, there were 2648 packets with different sizes than 543, like 126,1086,1629,4101,612 and so on.    If TOR cell size is fixed, then why are there packets with different sizes than 543? (why don't all of the packets have the same 543 bytes in size?)  Relating to above question, there are lots of packets with size of 1460 bytes in backward direction (from server to client). So what happens to the fixed cell size? "

1349,How would I block exit nodes correctly?,"I'm attempting to advise another party on how to block just requests from Tor exit nodes, not non-exit relays. I think I understand the correct data sources to provide to them, but I'd like confirmation that this is the correct approach.  Constraints   They need the data in bulk, not query-dnsbl-per-request They need to check the actual request IP, not the advertised IP of the node While this is primarily web traffic, I'm not sure we can assume just ports 80 and 443 While I'm sure the Tor community would like them to not block Tor exits, I think that's non-negotiable due to their business model. However, getting rid of these false positives is no doubt an improvement for everybody.   Resources   I've found [website]I've found [website]What surprises me is that the former is not a subset of the latter. I would expect that some exits do not allow 443, so they'd only be on the TorDNSEL List, but anything on the Bulk Exit Query for 443 list should be included on the TorDNSEL List. It's possible that the mismatch there is due to exits that have inbound and outbound traffic on different IPs.  Partial solution  My inclination is to advise the other party to combine the following data sources for their blocklist:   TorDNSEL List Bulk Exit Query for 80, 443, 8080, 8443, and other ports that are relevant to their business, using... what IP?   Remaining questions   How would one get Bulk Exit query data agnostic of destination IP? Does Bulk Exit use advertised or actual addresses? Their docs imply the latter (and mention using TorDNSEL for this), but then why the mismatch? Is there anything I'm missing here?  "

1352,What prevents CircID collision from happening?,"When a Tor OP wants to extend a circuit, it sends a relay extend cell to the last node on it. This node then sends CREATE cell to the desired destination node, choosing a new CircID (used to identify the circuit uniquely) not already used between the node sending the CREATE cell and the destination node.  What will happen in the hypothetic case when, say, 2 different circuits with different middle nodes share the same exit node, and the two middle nodes choose the same, colliding CircID when sending CREATE cell to the common exit node?  Following the spec, this should be a possible scenario, because each of the middle nodes doesn't use the randomly generated CircID already to this exit node. The collision happens only on the exit node and there is no way for the two middle nodes to know about it.  How strong is the entropy behind CircID generation and is it the only defence measure against CircID collision? "
1353,Unstable websocket over Tor,"I'm working on a Java application that uses websockets to communicate with a hidden service. So far I've managed to get it all working but websocket connection is unstable. Here's what I've done:  First, I've installed Tor and added this to torrc:  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:9001    I've got a working websocket server on a local machine listening on port 9001. Next, I need a local HTTP proxy for websockets, not SOCKS5 so I've installed Polipo and added this to it's config file:    proxyAddress = ""127.0.0.1"" proxyPort = 8118  socksParentProxy = ""localhost:9050"" socksProxyType = socks5   So I've got Tor with a hidden service, working websocket server, Polipo and a websocket client all on a same machine - for a testing purposes. And at last, here's a pseudo code of what my program is doing:    val server = ""ws://xe5qeboadaaatzuz.onion:80"" // hidden service on a same machine factory.proxy.setHost(""localhost"").setPort(8118) // using Polipo HTTP proxy val socket = factory.createSocket(server) socket.onDisconnect = wait 5 seconds and reconnect socket.connect   And here's an output I'm getting:  [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-5] connecting... [ReadingThread] socket has connected [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3] OPEN [ReadingThread] Got response: [""ok"",""hello""] [ReadingThread] Got ping frame [ReadingThread] Got ping frame [ReadingThread] Disconnected [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-5] java.io.IOException: The status code in the response from the proxy server is not '200 Connection established'.The status line is: HTTP/1.1 504 Couldn't connect: Connection refused ...

On average connection lasts for a minute or so. It also happens periodically when I connect to echo.websocket.org. Is this an inherent property of Tor network or am I missing something here? Perhaps some settings in Polipo's or Tor's config could resolve this?    UPDATE When I test the same setup on Android using OrBot's localhost:8118 as HTTP proxy my websocket connection is stable. But my question about how to achieve the same stability in Linux environment still stands. "

So, my question is, is there a way to make the Tor browser only use one alternate IP address, and potentially have the IP Address set in only one country, to reduce the chances of this occuring again?  If this isn't possible, or incredibly difficult to do, is there a way to change the location of my alternate IPs to only be positioned in a single location?

If I try to add my proxy however, I get the ""Unable to find the proxy server"" error page.  If I use the same exact proxy settings in a normal Firefox browser, the connection works.

I understand that if I have a Facebook account with real name etc., I am not anonymous to Facebook once I log in, no matter whether I use Tor or not. But using Facebook from the Tor browser will still protect my anonymity to servers outside of Facebook, right?  Should I always keep a second normal browser open to use Facebook or can I do this in the Tor browser without compromising my privacy (on any other site I visit)?  Or put differently, can I just substitute my regular browser with the Tor browser without becoming entirely religious or a zealous vegan about my normal browsing habits.

1370,Source media support,"The latest Tor Browser update seems to have disabled streaming video using Adobe flash, resulting in the message ""Media not supported on browser.

1371,"TOR and Orbot, possibility to add in dynamic AES encryption structure before data is send out?","I read on the documentation about the security issues on TOR, that it is ok if the website is running on HTTPS, but how about on Orbot and site that is not running on HTTPS?  Even if it is running on HTTPS is it 100% sure that the end node can not expose data that is sent out?  I am just wondering for the Orbot app maybe even TOR, what if an encryption is added for the data passing back and forth.  For example:  1.)Encryption for data  2.)Onion layers are added  3.)Onion layer removed  4.)Decryption  It is similar to what the ""HTTPS"" is doing, but about for Orbot? And if for example a unique private key is used and AES-256 encrypt dynamically for each browser? Even if a server is compromised, or malicious end node, would it make it more secure?  I am just trying to understand and look at why the security part is mentioned a lot through out the internet. And if there are anyway to improve the structure for a more secure experience.  "
1372,"Tor, Bridges, and DNS Leaks","Recently I've been looking to follow good-practices while browsing the internet (e.g 50%+ of my browsing in through a VPN, 10%+ is through Tor). Now, I am looking to increase my regiment by tinkering with/using security-focused linux distributions (e.g Tails).   However, I have some concerns:   There have been recent research articles that focus on deanonymizing Tor ([website]DNS Leaks are possible via Tor (see: Google - I cannot link more than two URLs if I have reputation &lt; 10 points) Linux Distro Whonix can protect against DNS leaks by virtualizing the Network Adapter (independently from the work station).    My Questions:   Do Tor Bridges help against DNS leaks? Can Whonix be used in conjunction with another distro such as Tails? Would it be possible to have the Whonix gateway persist on Tails?  If Whonix cannot persist on Tails, can the Whonix Gateway be on a bootable USB that is plugged in parallel to Tails and accessed via Tails UI?    Note: I understand Tails is all about amnesia, but I am inquiring if there is a client-side capability to write to Tails or access Whonix Gateway through another USB port on the host computer. "

The email account is a regular one (no .onion kind of thing), hosted by a big evil company I have no control over (say, for the sake of the argument, a gmail account).  As far as I understand it, the interest lies in preventing people (say, the sysadmin of the wifi network or my Internet service provider) from knowing I’m downloading and uploading emails. But maybe I get something wrong…  Useful? Harmful? Thanks in advance for your explanations. "

And my understanding is that retaining access logs is a legal requirement of at least some industries and countries currently, and could easily be enforced everywhere.   So unless the tor network used servers that refused to log access, then the tor network is not anonymous? "

1390,Choosing computer hardware to run Tor relays - (CPU RAM cable HDD SSD etc),"I am thinking of buying a computer to use only for running Tor relays from England in the United Kingdom.  I am writing to ask for advice on which details of the machine make a difference to the effectiveness of the machine when used only for this purpose.     I would be installing Ubuntu or another Linux distro on the machine, but am only asking about hardware in this question, assuming that the choice of distro is not related to the choice of hardware.  If that assumption is incorrect, please let me know.        The internet connection is via a BT Home Hub, and the relevant speeds BT have told me about are 55 Mbps to download and 10 Mbps to upload.    I am considering buying a Lenovo Thinkcentre M93.  They are office desktop machines which would cost in the region of £100 to £200 secondhand, and have an Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processor.  I would use the passmark.com website to compare the power of the CPUs.  I would guess that the power of the processor will matter, but have no idea how much difference it would make to have a passmark rating of 7000 rather than 4000.    Is the number of physical or logical cores important, or the passmark score per physical or logical core, rather than the total, if a Tor relay only uses one physical or logical core, as I have seen mentioned somewhere?    Would the the amount of RAM will matter up to a point?  I do not know if the relevant point is 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB.    Would the type of ethernet card or connection matter?    Would the amount and type of storage matter, HDD or SSD?  I would guess that anything over 80GB would be fine, and more would not be better over that level, but again am not sure.  I would presume that SSD is better than HDD, but again am not sure.    The machine would be connected by cable to the BT Home Hub.  Does the type of cable matter, category 5e, 6, or 6a?  (These are the category labels in the UK).    Am I thinking along reasonable lines, or should I be looking at gaming machines rather than business ones, or a different family of CPUs than Intel Core?   With thanks in advance for comments and help based on knowledge and experience.   "

"
1393,Content Delivery Networks and Tor,"For a number of reasons not critical to my question, I've decided that my website, currently on the clear web, would serve my users more effectively as an .onion site.  I'm still researching Tor basics and how to bring this to fruition. But there's one aspect I can't seem to wrap my head around:  Q. In the Tor model, what plays the role of CDN (content delivery network, e.g. Cloudlare) ?  My website has a fairly large amount of static HTML/CSS/JS/PNG files. They rarely change. The script embedded in the .js files makes AJAX calls to the site to retrieve data and update the DOM. So the caching of static elements is pretty crucial. I'm using Cloudflare for that task right now.  In the Tor model, what layer/entity would do the caching of static content? I can tell from the explanatory diagrams, that there's an ultimate 'exit node' that would contact my site on port 443 (https). But would it contact my origin server directly without going through a caching layer? If so, presumably I could add additional IIS servers to pick up the load but even then, is there a way to load balance it? In other words, is there a way to point MyDomain.onion to an array of servers instead of just one?  I'm confused as to how to distribute the load if there's no CDN in place. Please enlighten me.  Thanks,  Festus "
1394,Tor Not Working every time I start it,"Every time I start the Tor browser, I get this red screen with this message:  ""Something is not working. Tor is not working in this browser"".  I have to close Tor and reopen it for the message in red to disappear.  In addition, I can no longer use duckduckgo.com for search queries.   Every time I search for something, I get this blue screen with this title "" NoScript XSS Warning"".  What is the issue here? Is it possible that someone (maybe my employer) hacked their way into my Tor browser?  Thank you for your feedback on what are the causes and how I can I solve these 2 issues. "
1395,Tor file descriptor usage at 100%,"I am running a non-exit Tor relay for the last few weeks and it is working but it is not maxing the Internet pipe. (The server is >2 weeks old, so not a problem of age)  The problem is that it seems that Tor's file descriptor usage are at 100%. Nyx shows this:  file descriptors: 4074 / 4064 (100%)  I am running the server on an unprivileged LXC container and it just works fine but this is what is bugging me out. Is that number of file descriptors acceptable, or should I raise it? How does it get filled? Doesn't it get (recycled?) at certain times?  I have enough RAM and CPU as they are idling at 15% usage. By the way, I am running a directory. Don't know if that affects to file descriptors usage.  I haven't been able to find any answer to this matter. Hope you can help me. "
1396,"How are certain websites able to override the specific exitnode you chose, and can a fix be made to stop it?","I've followed the instructions in the posts about using a specific exitnode, and I've added the following to my torrc:  ExitNodes 719FD0FA327F3CCBCDA0D4EA74C15EA110338942 StrictNodes 1   As you can see, I've specified the exitnode by fingerprint rather than IP, which is 185.220.100.252  Now, this works fine when I go to [website]Is this a security hole I have discovered, and if so, can we close it so such sites cannot hack my choice of exitnode?  Or, is it because StrictNodes 1 doesn't apply to ExitNodes and only ExcludeNodes?  If this is the problem, can someone tell me how to specify the same restriction using ExcludeNodes?  I.e. something like this:  ExcludeNodes !719FD0FA327F3CCBCDA0D4EA74C15EA110338942 StrictNodes 1   so I want to exclude all nodes BUT that specific fingerprint.  Is there a syntax for this???  Thanks.

1397,Can't access NoScript from browser page,"Tor Browser 8.5a10  NoScript 10.2.4  MacOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra)  The NoScript menu is missing from the address bar, so I cannot allow/disallow scripts on the web page that I am currently on. I can choose NoScript from the context menu, but it does nothing - the NoScript dialog does not appear.  I can view NoScript preferences from the Add-ons preferences page, but that doesn't help on a page-by-page basis.  Is anyone else seeing this? Anyone have any thoughts about what's going on?  EDIT: I tried downloading a new copy of 8.5a10 and a new copy of 8.0.8.

1398,Cycling introduction points,"Is it possible to cycle your selected introduction points after X time has passed so new introduction points can be selected? If so, how would I achieve this either within the current functionality of Tor or with some sort of external script/add-on?  You may ask why would I need this? I operate a small hidden service that has been subject to a Tor DoS attack recently, along with some more prominent ones, which was overloading my Tor process at 100% CPU, it was possible to prevent this by excluding the relay the attack was being sent through via the node's fingerprint. The attacker then changed up their method of attack and I do not see anything in my logs anymore, however the service is completely unavailable. I shared debug logs with Tor project and there was nothing identified. It has been suggested that the introduction points could be identified and attacked. I want to test this theory and see what the outcome will be. Please someone with any knowledge on this provide some insight into how this could be achieved, thanks! "

Screen resolution (screen.height, screen.width)  3. Window size (window.height, window.width)  4. Pixel density (screen.pixelDepth) 5. Color depth (screen.colorDepth) 6.

Language 15. session storage supported 16. local storage supported 17. codecs 18. DRM 19. DNT enabled 20. indexDB supported    Do we need to install any other plugin/addons in order to encounter above lists. Apart from Tor browser, in case with any other normal browser how should we need to prevent them?  Could someone can explain in brief regarding how does tor protects with regarding  to the above list of Fingerprint vectors? In case if not what must be the necessary configurations needs to be applied to make it completely secure? "
1404,How do we extend our privacy on TOR circuit?,"The Tor Browser bounces your communications data through distributed network of relays by encrypting traffic in at least three layers selected from thousands of volunteer computers, thus making incredibly difficult for anyone to trace you and your activity and identity  that has been masked by Tor.  Tor functions like a layered series of proxy servers that route your traffic in a zig-zag around the internet before it reaches your destination (the layers give rise to the name, which stands for The Onion Router).  There are at least three hops through data travels.  The entry node, which inevitably knows your IP address The middle (or relay) node, which prevents the exit node from finding out which entry node you used and makes it very hard to correlate this information The exit node, which knows what site you are connecting to, but does not know who you are  What if a malicious Tor node may keep limited logs and that parts of it may be under surveillance.  But since it’s not completely secure, because they previously had to rely on exit nodes.  Since Exit nodes can also see your traffic and may attempt to modify it.  But unfortunately it’s unlikely that resources will be spent tracking down your browsing habits running on a high-profile user and these exit node bandwidth is the scarcest resource in the Tor ecosystem.  What measures should be taken in-order to avoid the above circumstances. What must be the additional softwares needed to be installed to combat against privacy?  How do we need to configure those Exit nodes? Does Onion Service really defend against the above scenario? "

English: Server Not Found / Hmm. We're having trouble finding that site. German: Server nicht gefunden / Seite wurde nicht gefunden English: Problem loading page / The connection has timed out German: Seiten-Ladefehler / Fehler: Netzwerk-Zeitüberschreitung   I understand how DNS is working and i think i understand how the connection from a user to a hidden service is working.  As far as i understand it the first error message means that the client is searching for a specific onion address on the responsible HSDir relays but none of these relays have the descriptor of that hidden service so they are not answering (or are they answering with a message that they dont have that hidden service descriptor?)  The second error message means that the responsible HSDir relays for that specific onion address are pointing to the responsible introduction point(s) (guard) of that hidden service but when the client is waiting for a message from the hidden service (from the chosen rendezvous point) he dont receive one.  Can someone tell me if i understood it right?

1419,How to prevent normal Tor browsing looking automated?,"As an experiment I've tried using Tor Browser for everyday web browsing. Many sites either block me or ask me to complete endless Captchas.  I understand that by blocking ads/cookies/scripts etc.. that I don't look ""normal"", but even in Standard security mode with JavaScript fully enabled I find the browsing experience impossible on some major sites.  I understand that sites know my IP is a Tor exit node (and that some are behind Cloudflare/WAFs that block Tor on purpose), but when I'm doing normal human browsing it's strange to be accused of suspicious/automated behavior.  Are there techniques to mitigate being treated like a bot?  I notice that every domain name gets a different circuit. I presume this is also the case when multiple domains are serving a single webpage. Is there a way to disable that temporarily? "

1421,About Traffic Confirmation Attacks,"As you all know traffic confirmation attacks, time correlating the end links of a TOR connection, is a known vulnerability against TOR. I have a university project on these correlation attacks, but the problem is I have no pcap traces, no data about the traffic. I would like to have traces for different TOR traffic, so that I can correlate the end observations. Do you know any database for research purposes like this? If not, what would you recommend? Thank you for your help. "
1422,"When talking about a hidden service, what does it mean to have an encrypted descriptor?","What is an ""encrypted descriptor?""   What are the pros and cons of using one?   In what version of Tor did they first become available?  Are they automatically used (i.e. default)? If not, how do you enable the use of one?  Note: The current Hidden Service design allows a single node to upload a descriptor to the set of applicable Hidden Service Directories. This descriptor describes how a client can establish a connection with the hidden service. I think that an encrypted descriptor would mean that only those with the decryption key could learn the details required to contact that hidden service. Does this feature exist? "
1423,What is the reasoning behind keeping hidden service onion RSA keys at 1024 length?," Is the cost to performance of using larger key length not cost effective? How would it negatively impact anyone if some hosts decided to use a larger key length (i.e. Why isn't anyone free to manually use a larger key length if they so choose for their hidden service)? In terms of brute force resistance how does the current 1024 length RSA keys stand up against AES 128 used by several HTTPS sites. Is perfect forward secrecy built into the encryption used with hidden services? If not, are there plans to include it in future Tor versions? Are there plans to eventually increase mandatory and/or default onion RSA key length beyond 1024? And if not, when might we see this topic become reviewed (for example, is the current strength and implementation of the protocol considered good enough that we should expect no further work done on it in several years time?)?  "
1424,Are there any Tor Cloud alternatives?,"Tor Cloud makes running a full-time bridge in the cloud fairly easy, and using Amazon's EC2 means there are plenty of locations available at a moderate price. This means though that a lot of Tor-eggs are going into one Amazon-sized basket. Are there any major non-Amazon alternatives?  As diversity is so important for the Tor network it would be great to have similarly simple options for other cloud/VPS providers, without being locked into a single option. How difficult would it be to port the Tor Cloud AMI from Amazon to something like a Linode StackScript or a DigitalOcean Droplet?  Failing that, is there anything similar to the Vidalia Bridge Bundle for Linux servers that could easily be installed onto a commodity VPS and left to run? "
1425,Searching for Tor hidden networks,"What resources are best for search .onion networks within the Tor? Unlike the web where you can search for a domain or portal, what equivalent systems are available for search for Tor specific networks basically .onion networks/sites without actually knowing their address? Must you know what they are already to go to them directly or is there a master listing/search/or directory for them? Based on subject or whatnot?  I have read this questions and the answers but I am looking for a resource or method to look directly within the Tor network layers. "
1426,Does traffic exit Tor at the same node for all ports?,"Exit Relays can be set to allow traffic to exit the Tor network only over certain ports. Vidalia even makes this super-simple by giving options like ""Normal, unencrypted Web browsing"" or ""IRC clients and servers"".  This answer notes that:     Tor chooses an exit relay which actually allows you to exit the Tor   network. Some only allow web traffic (port 80) which is not useful   when someone wants to send emails.   What happens when a  user is passing traffic over multiple ports? It wouldn't be uncommon to receive email over IMAP whilst web browsing, or even to visit a page serving a mix of HTTP &amp; HTTPS content. Would Tor have to find a single Exit Relay which allows all ports needed, or is it possible that traffic might exit a different node for each port? "
1427,How to calculate optimal Relay Bandwidth & Throughput,"Setting up a Tor relay on a VPS/cloud is a relatively straightforward process, which is great for people who enjoy that warm-fuzzy-i'm-making-a-difference feeling we get by contributing bandwidth to the network. However, most providers have a monthly limit on how much bandwidth you can contribute before charging extra, and that's something most of us would like to avoid.  Luckily torrc includes a really handy setting called AccountingMax that will cause your relay to go into hibernation when you hit a certain limit. With a 1000GB/mo VPS plan you could set a conservative monthly limit of 900 GB (or a daily limit of 30 GB) and Tor will automatically stop serving well before you dip into extra costs.  The only downside to this is that your relay won't be very stable. For a certain amount of time every day/month your server will be idle, thereby limiting the amount of consistent help you can contribute. I've used the RelayBandwidthRate setting to limit my bandwidth in an attempt to find a balance where I'm always relaying but never going over my limits. However, as throughput rates tend to fluctuate I'm not really sure if my settings are optimal.  Is there an easy way to determine what AccountingMax / RelayBandwidthRate / RelayBandwidthBurst settings are optimal for a given monthly cap? Would traffic ever be consistent enough to to come up with a simple table that could be included in the setup guide?    tl;dr  Essentially I'm looking for something like this:   "
1428,How is relay information obtained after running Tor?,"Let's assume that the NSA can't attack all Tor nodes at once, and someone using Tor is anonymous this way, but how does Tor actually download these secure Tor nodes when we open it?

1429,How many preemptively built circuits?,"I want to know how many preemptively circuits Tor can builds. I got confused about it when I read ""Tor Path Specification"".  According to this article, at the startup Tor builds 3 clean circuits, but somewhere else it says Tor builds 2 circuits for each recently seen ports (If there are 12 or more clean circuits open, it doesn't open more even if it has more predictions.)  What does Tor actually do when preemptively building circuits? "
1430,Can Tor change circuit while accessing a webpage?,"In that case, it should download the page from the beginning because the TCP connection was closed, right? If it's not the case, how does Tor know when the site has finished loading? "
1431,What does Tor do with streams?,"I am a bit confused about handling streams in Tor. When we visit a website like Youtube the browser sends more than 100 requests to more than 20 different hosts. If we consider each request is for a TCP connection and, for the sake of anonymity, we cannot attach two streams to the same circuit, we need a bunch of circuits just for visiting a website.  I do  not know what Tor actually does with streams. Are all streams for a website attached to the same circuit? or are they attached to distinct circuits? or Can we reuse circuits?, I mean, does Tor attach several streams to the same circuit?   "

1437,Exit Nodes in restricted countries,"The British government has recently announced plans to require censoring of ""terrorist"" and ""extremist"" websites (1)(2). It seems UK residents may soon find themselves joining the ranks of those needing to use Tor more regularly for accessing content that the government may deem too extreme.  If those of us running exit nodes in the UK end up having our own access restricted then anybody elsewhere trying to access blocked content will end up with the same problem by proxy (no pun intended), no matter where they are in the world.  Extrapolating a bit, I begin to wonder about countries with similar blocks elsewhere in the world. Is it even worth running an exit node if there's a chance Tor users will just end up getting blocked when trying to access content that they're trying to use Tor to view in the first place?  This question discusses options for DNS-level blocks, but if things go a level deeper and IPs (or even blocks of IPs) are blocked then what can we do with our exit nodes? "
1438,Why isn't Do Not Track enabled?,"Why isn't Do Not Track enabled in Tor Browser Bundle by default? I'm aware that it's ultimately up to each site to decide if they'll honour the request, but wouldn't it be sensible to go ahead and enable it for the sites that do?   "

1441,selecting a tor node from a particular country,"This is of interest, and was asked earlier about Netflix, but I'd like to do this for a low-bandwidth application. That is, if I'm in the U.S., and I'd like the site I'm looking at to see that my request is from the U.S. If I were to use ExitNodes to do this, what would that .torrc line look like? On a Mac OS, where exactly does that .torrc file go?   Now, I understand that this would hugely constrain my available network, and wouldn't be advisable if I didn't have to do it, but I'd still like to understand how to do it. Sure would be nice if there were a more user-friendly way of selecting that option.  "
1442,Why can't I boot TAILS without a writable drive installed? Is it possible to do so?,"I use Tor through Tails, which I am running from a DVD.  It works fine with the hard drive in place, and works fine with the hard drive removed but a USB memory stick in one of the other USB ports, but it crashes when booting up if there is no writeable drive connected. Clearly it needs to write something, which I guess explains why it has to delete when I close down.  Is it possible to work around this? It seems obvious that if there is no writeable media at all, there is no risk.  Update.... have tried it with the latest version of Tails.  Does not work.  Perhaps something to do with the hardware?   It works fine from a USB.  Its a mystery.   Of course it is on-topic!  And it is reproducable by anyone who has the same equipment.  Sorry but using a VM doesnt cut it.  Finding what the problem is might reveale a security issue, who knows.

1445,Using TorBrowser with MadMAC's and DNS Crypt products?,"Has anyone here used the TorBrowser with either the products MadMAC's or DNS Crypt?   I'm currently testing or rather trying out both to determine if they offer me any added anonymity to my web surfing. I'm still a newbie about DNS leaks and using the TorBrowser (correctly) as well as VPN's and still have a lot to learn. With that said, does anyone know if using MadMAC's and/or DNS Crypt at the same time I'm using my TorBrowser will help my anonymity on web surfing or am I just making things worse?  Re: MadMAC's, in summary it's a script to randomize your machine's MAC address (and host name) in Windows on every boot. It was discussed on the IronGeek website. [website]Regarding DNS Crypt, for those unfamiliar, it helps eliminate DNS leaks and appears to eliminate DNS leaks whether I'm connected to a VPN or even just a regular high speed cable connection with my ISP. Please note I have observed when using the website ""DNS Leak Test"" to test my TorBrowser for DNS leaks, I tend to see lots of DNS leaks and become concerned, but maybe that is normal because of the way Tor is set up; there's going to be these DNS leaks and maybe am I just over reacting based on how Tor works?   I do have to say when using DNS Crypt, I'm not sure how much data is going back to OpenDNS to track, though. Couple of other things I do is when I'm not using DNS Crypt, I usually change my Windows 7 preferred and alternate DNS Server Address for IPv4 and IPv6 to an OpenNIC or other public one listed on ShieldsUp website instead of having these configured automatically, which means the DNS Server Addresses are my ISP's. I also turned off my Teredo connection for added security.  Thanks! "

1448,"Whonix - How to get Java Plugin installed/working on Iceweasel? + GUI, Troubleshooting questions","I need help installing or messing with certain things on Whonix.  Most important is getting Java to work on it in the browser. I've installed Iceweasel and Chromium, and JRE 8 and JDK6 (long story...), but I don't know how to get a Java plugin installed and working. If I could just install things by double clicking on them or right clicking to get a menu option of having them run as administrator this would be a lot less trouble, which is why I pose this question first. Ubuntu's like this too until you change a settings item or two reachable within the GUI, but I can't figure out a way to do this AT ALL on Debian/KDE/Whonix!   So, how do you install Java and its plugin properly on Whonix step by step? I installed Iceweasel and Chromium after realizing that Java doesn't work on Whonix's patched Tor browser, so is that it? So, how exactly do you install things via the GUI interface like through double clicking on it as in windows, or can you even make it let you? And how do you also, for example, do things like run installation files as 'administrator' or root I guess in the case of the Debian KDE Whonix is based on from the GUI? I'm learning to use commands like ""cd"", "".."" and so forth, but they're still kind of annoying and I'm worried not all apps are best installed via command line.   Secondly, I seem to have issues getting Sip phone clients working on Whonix. I've set Linphone and Jitsi up, but Linphone just says registration is failing and Jitsi's doesn't ever seem to connect either but with no error warning for either, even though the Sip registrars I'm using have worked on my desktop via VPN in the past. I also have issues with setting up VMWare Horizon. It installed seemingly successfully via the commandline according to some instructions I reviewed for Debian but it won't open.   Is the problem that the Sip registrars don't want to accept transmissions via Tor? And is VMWare Horizon not working due to some harsh limitation of Java on Whonix done for privacy reasons or can Horizon be made to work on it without too much trouble? If these DO work please link any step-by-steps if you know of any.   Thanks "

This would be great as it would help me avoid being blocked from sites that don't play nice with Tor, without having to use a VPS/cloud machine or web proxy just have the ability to do banking or voip over Whonix.  If this isn't advisable for me to attempt or there isn't any guide, do you know of any good web proxy or that I could use on it instead for banking, a quality premium one which accepts bitcoin? "

1452,How do ISPs filter out Tor traffic when using a Tor Relay,"Tor website says that an ISP may perform Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and figure out that I am using Tor.   References:   [website][website]As per my knowledge, a Tor generated data packet leaving my computer only has the destination IP and destination port which can be read by any third party. How can any kind of inspection at all understand that I am using Tor?  I understand that it is possible an ISP will figure out that I am using Tor if they have my Entry Nodes or Bridges IP address stored to be a Tor enter point. But I am fine with it. Totally. But what worries me is how can a deep packet inspection produce results I am using Tor?   If the packet leaving my computer is encrypted, then it should not be vulnerable to any type of inspection according to my vision. So this simply confuses me. "

Thank you "
1454,Tor tracking sites,"I have read about people posting about Tor sites that have the intent upon tracking users or attempting to find information. Is there any information about the proliferation of these types of 'spy' sites? Is the understanding (based on any known facts) that there are very few, far between Tor endpoints that do this or that there would be a large percentage based on the base of users? It is entirely possible that this is not possible to know, so I understand that, may be the answer regardless. "
1455,How to cover Tor usage with both front end and back end hidden by VPN and/or Proxy?,"If one decide to cover the usage of Tor from both front end and back end (meaning both from ISP and the destination page) using VPN and/or Proxy, What process should one go through? For example the following scenario:  User ---> VPN1 ---> Tor ---> VPN2 ---> Destination address  or  User ---> proxy1 ---> Tor ---> Proxy2 ---> Destination address  This is in a case when Tor is used via Tails.  For the purpose of this question Both VPN1, VPN2, Proxy1, and Proxy2 are assumed to be free of charge. Therefore, there is no money trail.  What is the details of the setup required to be able to do this? "

1457,"Warning!!! Many of directory authorities are compromised and taken down, This is a horrendous security risk, Who has done it and why?","Warning!!! It appears that many Directory authorities are compromised and taken down, This is a horrendous security risk, Who has done it and Why? There are currently 9 directory authorities. More than half of the authorities must be online and they must reach a consensus on the current state of the network every hour for them to create and publish the hourly networkstatus-consensus (the list of all the known relays). If some of the directory authorities were compromised and taken offline then the remaining DAs will continue publishing the consensus and the network will continue operating normally. The one performance impact will be seen by new clients. When they first try connecting to the network (download and launch Tor Browser for the first time) they will try connecting to one of the directory authorities and download the networkstatus consensus from it. If some of the directory authorities are offline, it may take some time for each connection to timeout (while the client connects to an unavailable authority), but eventually the client will reach an operational authority and it will then be able to use the Tor network as usual. If more than 5 DAs are taken offline then this is a horrendously large operation and the necessary corrective actions must be taken to ensure the network remains operational.  A new client have tried Tor for the first time on Dec 20 2014, and it took more than 20 minutes to connect to an online directory authority. How many directory authorities are down? Is there any information why so many directory authorities are down? Following please find the partial list of directory authorities that appear to be down and up:  154.35.32.5  appear to be down  86.59.21.38  appear to be down  194.109.206.212 appear to be down  183.233.166.170 appear to be down  218.22.79.38  appear to down  131.188.40.189 appear to be up  Please provide as much information as possible because this appear to be a substantial security risk.

What is the time interval around that instant for which I can deduce that address was an exit node?   From the Published time to the LastStatus time (around 8 hours)? From the Published time to the instant the address was verified (around an hour and a half)? Or maybe I have no guarantee that the address was an exit node except for the instant it was verified?   Even in case I can get no guarantees, I'd be happy to know if I can at least get a time interval for which the address was probably an exit node. "
1461,Launching a Distributed Denial of Service attack on a hidden service,"Recently, I have seen more and more forums, image boards, and market places that are shifting to Tor for the safety of their users.  This undoubtedly brings the many attackers that dislike these people with them.  This brings me to a simple question, could a person (granted that they have enough bandwidth, and the attack is layer 7) launch a DDoS attack that would be strong enough to bring down a web server, but not slow down the network.  How would they do it?  I know botnets have run over Tor, and I know that Tor has used in the past to hide DDoS attackers (mainly skids).  In addition, how could someone protect against a DDoS attack within the Tor network?  Given the nature of Tor, is it even possible to set up a firewall that would prevent against it? "

1467,Separate Linux user account that can use the Internet only via Tor?,"For using Tor, I would like to use a separate user account on my Debian system:   Every Internet connection from this user account must go through Tor. If something can’t be sent using Tor, it should be blocked.   Is this possible? If yes, is this advisable? Are there any pitfalls?  I can’t use a live system or virtualization, and I’d imagine (assuming that it’s technically possible) that a Tor-only user account is a suitable way to hinder applications leaking my IP address. "
1468,How to change the entry node?,"When Tor changes circuit it only changes middle node and exit node, the entry node stays the same since the Tor started, so I guess the entry node is limiting the traffic if  you make too much traffic, right? So changing the entry node is the idea for speeding up the Tor, I don't want to restart it to change the node that may cost too much time on connecting to the network, anybody has anyway? "

1470,Are these specs (VPS) good enough to run a Tor relay?,"I want to run a bunch of Tor relays, and so plan to buy 10 $5 VPS's from a company called Beastnode. I have had an amazing experience with this company for game servers and websites in the past, so I hope that it'll be fast.  The specs of the VPS I plan to buy is as follows: • 512MB of RAM • 25GB of SSD space (though I doubt this matters?) • 2000GB (2TB) of Bandwidth.   I don't really understand all this bandwidth/s thing on Tor relays, as that 2TB is how much I can use before having to pay bandwidth fees. Is 2TB enough bandwidth overall, and how can I limit how much my relay uses OVERALL (or individually, if you have any recommendations)?  P.S. I would like my relays to be a fast relay. "
1471,Tor browser user-agent strings,What is the current user-agent string(s) of the Tor browser? What user-agent strings has the Tor browser (and older Tor software) used in the past? 
1472,How should one use a Tor or a proxy service on a virtual machine?,"When I'm running a virtual machine, say VirtualBox, if I wanted to use a proxy or service like tor or a VPN, if I only use that on my guest machine, would that be enough? No proxy, service, VPN, nothing on the host machine.   For example, host machine running Win7 connecting directly to the internet. Guest machine running WinVista and using tor to browse internet  Does not having anything on the host machine make a difference? I have noticed when using a VPN on a host machine to get a different IP, but nothing on the guest machine resulted in the guest machine also having the new IP, since I assume the internet is coming through from the host. "
1473,Access local router in Tor Browser?,"I have Tor Browser installed with virtually default settings, nothing advanced tweaked at all like proxy, security or network settings.  I just tried to access 192.168.0.1 from within my computer's Tor Browser and noticed it wouldn't work:    I can access Google, at [website]Why is this? Would other typically local IP reservations like 10.1.1.1 similarly not work?  I am also thinking of exclusively using Tor Browser for everything I do web-wise (and/or using Whonix), so am wondering how this would be practical when committed to Tor. "
1474,Hidden Service : To hide from isp or not to?,"My goal is to host a hidden service using Tor and Whonix.  My computer is running debian with Whonix on virtual box.  The question is, what is the best practices? Should I allow whonix to hide my Tor usage from the ISP or continue using Tor as when I was not running a hidden service? (Thus, ISP was able to observe that I am connected to Tor network).   "
1475,How to change Tor exit node when using multiple SocksPorts?,"I'm using Tor with multiple SocksPorts. Does anyone know how I can programmatically change the exit for each SocksPort separately?

1477,Can I permanently blow my anonimity on Tor?,"I am new to Tor. I'm not using it for anything illegal or suspicious, I'm just trying to protect my privacy as best as I can from my ISP, NSA, etc. (primarily my IP address, and anything that could give up my personal identity).  I accidentally logged into YouTube, Facebook and Twitter via Tor yesterday. Have I permanently blown my cover? Have I only blown it for yesterday's browsing? Do I need to buy a new computer or clean install my OS? I'm moving across the country (US) in a couple weeks - does that help my case at all?  Also worth mentioning: The accounts I logged into were WORK accounts. I'm a comedian so I use social media to connect with fans. These channels are in my name but I don't use them for personal/private communication. Also, I'm not the only one with access to these accounts, so is it ""possible"" that someone who works for me logged into the accounts (manager, agent, assistant)?  To sum up: How big of a mistake was this? And if it was a big one, are there steps I can take to reverse it? "
1478,"In Tor Browser, I connect to the exact same entry node all the time, unable to change it","I've been using Tor Browser Bundle for a long time, and it used to always pick a different circuit for every site, including changing the entry node for every circuit but then it just suddenly became static with the entry nodes. The version didn't change, it was the latest one and behaved ""normally"" (as it always used to) before starting doing this.  My entry node always stays the same, and doesn't change, even when connecting to different sites, even after using New Tor Circuit for this Site. Even after restarting Tor Browser, the entry node is still the same, for every circuit.  The circuits themselves do change and are different each time, just the entry node always stays the same. It's driving me crazy. I've even reinstalled Tor Browser multiple times, that actually did change the entry node I was connecting to, but again, it was the same one for every circuit and every site.  I don't really see a security risk in this but it seems suspicious since there was no update before this started.  Why is this? Is this normal Tor behavior now? "

This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!

Reading through the occurrences of 192.168 in the torrc sample and the man page didn't make the answer clear.  Therefore: Which torrc setting corresponds to the answer in the above referenced question (options […] advanced […] network […] connection settings […] choice to not use a proxy for 192.168...)? What do I have to set in order to allow local connections? "
1482,consequences after having logged into a non-tor account,"I know I am not supposed to log into accounts that I ever used before without Tor since then I will give up my anonymity for the website. However, what happens afterwards? If I then visit another website, will it also be able to know it's me or am I anonymous again?  I know that this question has probably been asked here before, but the closest answer I could find was the first one in this question. It states that after having logged into for example facebook, all sites with a facebook-button will be able to recognize me. But what about the one's without a facebook-button?  I am also sorry if this question might seem a little stupid, I am new to Tor and I am still figuring things out! "
1483,Usage if I don't need anonymity but want to help others?,"What is the recommended way to use Tor when I don't need anonymity myself, but want to help increase the anonymity of the whole network so that others can benefit?  I'm not sure I can express my question properly, so let me explain the thinking. There are many guidelines what to do and what not to do in order to remain anonymous. For example, users should not login to Google while using Tor because then the other traffic can be linked to it, compromising anonymity.  On the other hand, it seems to me that the whole Tor network becomes more anonymous if there is as much ""normal"" traffic as possible. So should users like me (who are personally not bothered about anonymity) follow different recommendations and use Tor for as much normal activity as possible, to make it easier for others to hide? Or is that not wanted because it wastes resources but doesn't help anybody?  I couldn't really find any guidelines for users who just want to increase the overall network anonymity but don't need anonymity themselves personally.  Edit: I already run a relay without problems, can also recommend it as a way to support the Tor. So I don't need help with setup, just clarification about my own client usage and how it affects the anonymity of others. "

I have tried using a L2TP connection to Private Internet Access (at their recommendation), but that didn't work as well. I am going to set up a whonix VM station, but I doubt that will work as well, since it uses Tor exclusively.  Does anyone have experience with these types of devices or recommendations for keeping my browsing private? Is there any way I can use Tor or a VPN?  Multiple VPNs can be tricky apparently, and I (sys admin locally) do not have control of this device.

Then will the Exit Node have both my IP Adress and what i am sending ?  In this principle it looks like the each node can send ip adresses he knows  outside Tor and where he get it to another nodes (like DHT) in some software or just by IP packets.

I only use the TBB when surfing onion sites, but close the TBB when done. I keep the relay going 24/7.   I know all the controversy regarding BitTorrent over Tor so please spare me the comments against, etc. I actually run the relay partly to defray the load I put on Tor via BitTorrent.   So, since I set my Vuze proxy settings for '127.0.0.1' and 'port: 9050' and 'Socks5' for both tracker and peer to peer, my thinking is that having all this Tor relay traffic co-mingling with the BitTorrent traffic would make any sort of traffic analysis of my Internet much more complicated. Especially analysis of anything I do while using the Tor Browser Bundle. Any comments on this?   Also, when I set my Vuze to use those proxy settings, the SOCKS icon is green in Vuze while the firewall icon turns red (meaning firewalled). I have UPnP in my router and my Vuze. I am able to download files with the Vuze status as such. But I'm not seeding very much, and it's messing up my ratio. Also, I have Vuze set to randomize TCP/UDP listening ports and to use same ports for TCP/UDP. But when I use the 'NAT/Firewall Test' for my Vuze ports, it says the TCP port ""timed out"" or the connection is ""refused,"" while the UDP port is ""OK!"" In fact, any port I test will always come back ""refused"" or ""timed out."" But once I un-proxy Vuze, the firewall icon turns green almost instantly.   How can I get Vuze to work right with Tor? I'm thinking it's a matter of the half-open connections limit? I have Vuze set to 20 ""max simultaneous outbound connection attempts,"" and 950 ""max outstanding outbound connections.""  Thank you! "

1497,Enable plugins on Tor,"There are several questions on how to enable plugins on Tor, all answered.  My question is simple, how can I add Flash and/or Silverlight plugins in Tor and make sure they actually work, and please don't give me that ""oh your security is blown"" talk.  I would actually like to see these plugins working, even if just as a proof-of-concept, because everyone says it supports them but they are disabled by default, but after trying everything I could find, it still doesn't work.  I've whitelisted sites, I've installed 32 bit versions of the extensions, enabled them in noscript, etc., but my add-ons page always comes up empty.  If this is not possible, we should stop saying it is and just accept it isn't.  If it IS possible, then please help me checking what I have to do that I haven't done yet.  How can I use silverlight with Tor?  Why can&#39;t Tor Browser use Adobe Flash Player?  Can Tor be used with Netflix or Hulu?  Silverlight not working     "

1499,been tampered? been filtered ? or just a network settings messing around?,"I'm using qubes for some times now.  after some weeks to correctly configure my setup, I want to figure it out why sys-whonix is not working correctly with my setup.  so I closely look at the other threads with one same criteria, the message in the logs : (""server rejected connection"")  one in particular attracted my attention. So I've tested some advices on this same website. So I've connected through the wifi access point from my phone and through my LAN wired network. The differences are heavy.  first some informational point:    the LTE data network and my VDSL2 Line are from the same provider which is Proximus in Belgium (important point to dissipate any doubt about the fact if I'm in a restricted area or not).   My LAN Network is organised with VLANs through managed switches and then through a router which is connected wiredly to an ISP box/router but its my router which does the PPPOE connection not the ISP box.   I didn't do a DMZ zone for this qubes client but the router/firewall rules are pretty basics My work/personal life are sort of mixed with the justice department and to my knowledge there are no specific filters from ISP in belgium but I could be wrong if I am don't hesitate to correct me. I have pinged all the bridges and all except one answered.

So with the LTE network I had immediately a connection. Between the two tests I've of course restart tor and ask it to reconnect. When I was on the wired network like always, I had some but mostly no connection. You can notice it in the logs and through the timestamp too.  So is it my ISP preventing me to go to Tor? Is it a problem with my router setup ? Is it something else in my wired networked? Does these messages of server rejected connection come from the bridge itself or is it a generic message from ARM? What should I do to have access permanently to Tor through my wired network? Which tests should I do and how to proceed? Should I add pages and pages of bridges?

1501,Configuring Tor to provide relays for users in specific countries,"I have looked for a relevant answer to this question and not found it, so am asking the question myself.    I am asking this question because my most important motive for setting up a Tor exit relay is to help people in countries where censorship and surveillance mean that it is really difficult or dangerous for them to use the internet to discuss historical, political and religious issues, however non-violent their approach or activity.    One key background experience which explains my view of this issue is that in the 1960's I lived in a country where it was illegal for bookshops to import and sell ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" in English by George Orwell, or any other book written by him.  It was not illegal to own a copy, or read it.  This was in Europe, but not in central, southern or eastern Europe, in case anyone is wondering.  Of course this did make me pay attention to the novel when I was lent a copy of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"".    Is there any effective way that I can specify the countries where internet users can use my relay?  I would not be aiming to stop internet traffic passing through any countries, just ensuring that the users of my relay are in some countries that in my judgement have a greater need to use Tor more, rather than others that I would judge need it less.    Or does the way Tor works as a system overall mean that any narrowing of the range of countries where users will use my relay will be automatically compensated for by the Tor system, so any change of this sort to my relay can have no overall effect on users, even if many other users made the same changes as those I am asking about?    So do I just have to accept that helping some people to watch cat videos in a secure, private and anonymous fashion, or others to do something I would regard as rightly illegal as well as morally wrong, as the inescapable dead-weight cost of helping others to achieve the ability to discuss and learn about important issues as free adults?    I can accept that there might be nothing more that I can usefully do to increase the objectives that led my to run a Tor relay, but I definitely would like to know whether that is true or not.    It would be useful to know the answer when other people question or challenge me about my Tor relay helping criminals to hide their nefarious activities.   "

1503,How to configure Tor Browser to run securely?,"A couple of months ago, I was looking at a youtube video and there were some steps to make Tor secure. For example it was suggested that the users should check that pop up windows are blocked, choose never remember history, select the option warn me when sites try to install add-ons, select block reported attack sites and block reported web forgeries. Furthermore, it was suggested that the users deactivate from the No-script options Java, Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, other plugins, /, ,  and @font face.   Today I visited the website of Tor and looked at the security tips, [website]In the first tip it says "" It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you're browsing with Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor.""  Does this mean that I don't have to apply any of the aforementioned changes? Is this because there was a recent update of Tor? Or the above changes do not make any difference?  Thank you very much "

How can I set and save an addon's settings in Tor Browser?  EDIT:  So I played around with this some and it seems that my addon's data is stored in a JavaScript file under the browser-extension-data folder.

For the most part the relay takes care of itself with me checking it's operation periodically throughout the day. Until it happens.. I lose all Administrative functions with arm. Meanwhile, the relay seemingly continues to function as normal. The only solution I've found so far is to stop tor, and arm and do a hard restart. It's then good again for who knows how long until it happens again.  I've intentionally left out computer specifics as the computer itself is not the issue.

1517,Running parallel Tor servers with different exit IPs with nodejs app,"I have a small node app that makes requests via Tor. My goal is to have a different exit IP for every request. in the torrc configuration file one can set MaxCircuitDirtiness 10, which will make it change exit ip every 10 seconds. This is the minimum value that can be imposed. However, if I want to make 1 request/second, this is not enough.   So I am figuring out how to configure &amp; run multiple tor servers such that I have different exit IPs, which is already discussed here. But it just doesn't seem to work. Someone already mentions this in a comment on the accepted answer.  I have followed all steps: I have in my case 4 torrc files with seperate ports, 4 datadirectories (permissions are fixed), I start 4 different Tor servers all loading different config files.  I wrote a small app in nodejs to show that it doesn't work.      var Agent   = require('socks5-https-client/lib/Agent');     var request = require('request');     var cheerio = require('cheerio');     var url = ""[website]    function makereq(port){         request({             url: url,             strictSSL: true,             agentClass: Agent,             agentOptions: {                 socksHost: '127.0.0.1',                 socksPort: port             }         }, function(err, res) {             if (err == null){                 $ = cheerio.load(res.body)                 var ip = $('p strong').text()                 console.log(""Request through PORT "" + port + "" with EXIT IP ""+ ip)             }             else {                 console.log(""Something went wrong"")                 console.log(err)             }         });     }      var ports = [9050, 9060, 9070, 9080];     counter = 0     setInterval(function(){         makereq(ports[counter])         counter++         if (counter == ports.length){             counter = 0         }     }, 1000)   Naturally, my question: how do I get this set-up to work?

1519,How do I restrict exit to one country while running under Tails [2.6]?,"I recognize that the first part of this question resembles others here, but those answers DO NOT appear to work!

It's that way because: it's much clearer that all are listed, and thus easier for anyone else to modify to suit their needs; it's also slightly future-proofed as codes come and go; it prevents an adversary from using those against Tor by claiming to be one of those ""unused"" codes.}  Then I enter systemctl restart tor which causes Tor to recognize the newly modified torrc, and to remove the circuits generated prior to the restart.  Thereafter, Tor will invariably build two US-exit circuits, as desired; BUT it will ALSO invariably build the next two exits in Europe.  Then as I watch circuit usage, Tor doesn't seem to use those European circuits unless I access hidden services.  Tor will then continue to build primarily US circuits, but seems to nearly-always keep at least a couple European ones open.  So it may be that Tor in fact is NOT using those circuits for the rest of my traffic.    When I first read what may be the relevant portion of the [manual, included below], {And I had read and noted [Roger Dingledine's comment]:      2  ""(Re Sam's comment above, StrictNodes no longer applies to the ExitNodes config option. It only applies to excluding nodes.)"" – Roger Dingledine Feb 8 '15 at 10:22}    I presumed that StrictNodes 1 would apply to ExcludeExitNodes as well as to ExcludeNodes.  However, it now seems to me that Tor is behaving as if StrictNodes 1 DOES NOT APPLY to ExcludeExitNodes!  If that is currently the case, PLEASE switch it back!  Users will retain much more anonymity, if they have to exit from a specific country, if Tor allows their circuits to merely exit in that specific country {by using ExcludeExitNodes} instead of forcing users who need to exit in a specific country to exclude ALL nodes outside that country {by using ExcludeNodes}.  Or else choose to be tied to a specific exit by using .exit, which might limit anonymity more, and would also break https {I was told that by sigaint support, and that's a no-go for me}.     StrictNodes 0|1      If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is necessary to perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfill a .exit request, upload directory information, or download directory information. (Default: 0)   And when I reread again:     ExcludeExitNodes node,node,…      A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to never use when picking an exit node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network. Note that any node listed in ExcludeNodes is automatically considered to be part of this list too. See the ExcludeNodes option for more information on how to specify nodes. See also the caveats on the ""ExitNodes"" option below.   and:     ExitNodes node,node,…      A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to use as exit node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network. See the ExcludeNodes option for more information on how to specify nodes.      Note that if you list too few nodes here, or if you exclude too many exit nodes with ExcludeExitNodes, you can degrade functionality. For example, if none of the exits you list allows traffic on port 80 or 443, you won’t be able to browse the web.      Note also that not every circuit is used to deliver traffic outside of the Tor network. It is normal to see non-exit circuits (such as those used to connect to hidden services, those that do directory fetches, those used for relay reachability self-tests, and so on) that end at a non-exit node. To keep a node from being used entirely, see ExcludeNodes and StrictNodes.      The ExcludeNodes option overrides this option: any node listed in both ExitNodes and ExcludeNodes is treated as excluded.      The .exit address notation, if enabled via AllowDotExit, overrides this option.   It still seems to me that the behavior that I am seeing by Tor is NOT that which is described in the manual.  However if Tor actually ONLY uses the countries listed in ""Onion Circuits"" {which should have been excluded by ExcludeExitNodes} to build otherwise ""NECESSARY"" circuits, I would prefer hearing that from someone who knows that to be the case.  And it would maybe be less painful to other noobs if the manual was updated accordingly so as to be very specific regarding ExcludeExitNodes.  Or maybe I've found a bug that should be reported??  P.S.  There were six links above, but Stack Exchange does not allow noobs to write competently here.  They state: ""You need at least 10 reputation to post more than 2 links.""  I removed the last four. "

1522,Tor bridges and how they avoid censorship,"Censorship to the tor network is an option as the ISPs can detect an attempt of connection to one of the known tor nodes, as these are public. But if I as a user of the tor network can gain access to the ip addresses of the bridges how comes that the ISPs \ companies who makes the censorship cant? As i understand it, when using a bridge the packets should go through an additional station which is the bridge, which makes the bridge the ""entry node"", which means that my ISPs can see that i try to talk to an ip address which is a bridge and block me the same way they do with the normal tor relays.  So how does the bridges keep themselves undetected from censorship? "

Why has the second drive been encrypted and how do I get the data back from that USB drive?  The drive is not normally encrypted, it’s just a drive I use to transfer data between machines.

1533,onion.id question,"Recently I went to visit a clearnet site ""deepdotweb"" and was met with a seizure notice. Not surprisng. Anyway I got to poking around a bit more and it seems like there is a bit of chaos going on in regards to the .onion marketplaces and such....ddos, extortion, exit scam, seizure heating up just in time for summer.   I downloaded tor browser on my macbook to see what all the buzz was about...surf the forums etc. Had a hell of a time getting it going. Still doesn't work right in my opinion.  So I was poking around on another clearnet site and double clicked a .onion link on accident and the webpage loaded. Of course the URL was titled ajdklfjal.onion.id. (safari) I then clicked on the forum link that was on the page and was met with an error through cloudflare that showed my IP address pretty plainly and when entered into my url box sent me to the page to change my router settings (yikes). Left immediately.   I then visit the same site that had the url on it...only difference now is that I was accessing it in the tor borwser bundle. So I just kinda did the same thing, double clicked the link etc. However the url is still fdsoifusdnl.onion.id. Clicked the forum link and was sent to a similar error page only this time my IP seems to be hidden. IP entered into the URL box and says ""This is a tor exit node""   My question &lt;&lt; Clearly it looks like my IP address is hidden through tor. But is it really though?? The actual site realated to the forum I was trying to access still shows klajdfkd.onion.id. And forum still shows an error.   Im familiar with the ""anything.onion.id"" security risks...""id"" obviously means identification or identifier. But does that risk disappear when loaded through the tor browser or does the "".id"" still reveal information???  Thanks. Sorry for the long post.  "

1536,What could be the cause for strange size(s) of TorBrowser window?,"I tested my TorBrowser with websites like panopticlick. Then downloaded and installed a 2nd TorBrowser to test against.  a) the window size is supposed to be a multiple of 100. but I get slightly different values.  b) the two browsers don't return the same window size - they aren't identical.  TB1: 1004x820  TB2: 1004x801  (one website reports back 988 instead of 1004, and obviously both browsers are running on the same hardware and display)  Any ideas what is going on here? How can my TB become identical to others again? "
1537,Does the Tor Browser store images on a local hard drive,"OK, I am a total newbie and this is probably a dumb question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.  If I downloaded the TOR browser from the website, the recommended manner that I'm told to do, and I don't make any changes at all...  If I were to go to a site ran by someone like Wikilieaks and the page contained image files of classified documents, would those images be stored on my local hard drive just as if I was using Chrome or any other regular browser?    Meaning if someone were to come along later and run a forensic program on the computer, would they be able to know I looked at the photographs of the classified documents Wikileaks had posted?  Or is that stuff not stored to the local hard drives?  For those of you who are veterans of TOR, forgive me for being such a newb.  I'm just trying to figure out if this is really as secure as I've heard that it is, and if I were to look at something like what I referenced if it was putting me in serious danger. "
1538,My hidden web service requires calls to multiple servers. Better to differentiate by hostname or port?,"I'm currently running a clearweb service accessible at [website]The site links to content, both static (e.g. images, jquery libraries), and dynamic (e.g. ajax calls) on other servers in the same domain. So, for example, the site may retrieve data from:  ajax.mydomain.com static.mydomain.com etc.  It's become apparent that for my own protection, and the protection of my users, we'd be better served if the site were made available via Tor as a .onion site instead of hosting it on the clearweb.  Here's the issue though:  It appears that the Tor protocol has no concept of a ""subdomain"" -- which leaves me with a couple of options for handling the multi-server access issue:  (1) Use three private keys  In this scheme, I'd have three private keys and hostnames:  abcd.onion (formerly www.mydomain.com)  efgh.onion (formerly ajax.mydomain.com)  ijkj.onion (formerly static.mydomain.com)  I could make this work but I do have a couple of concerns:  First off, Tor has no way of knowing that these three domains are owned by the same entity so presumably cookie sharing between domains would be an issue, since a cookie from abcd.onion would be treated as ""third party"" to efgh.onion.  Also, wouldn't Tor have to spin up a totally different route for each of the .onion domains? If so, wouldn't this significantly increase load time ?  (2) Use one domain, but three separate ports  In this scheme, I'd have only one domain but three ports:  abcd.onion:80 (formerly www.mydomain.com)  abcd.onion:81 (formerly ajax.mydomain.com)  abcd.onion:82 (formerly static.mydomain.com)  tor.exe and torrc file would be housed on a single/dedicated VM and configured to route ports 80, 81, and 82 to the appropriate servers on the VLAN.  I'm leaning toward option #2 since there's only one private key to deal with but is that the optimal solution for a single website that requires access to multiple .onion servers ?

1539,Why does Torbutton circuit view not consistently show the correct exit node?,"Making an arbitrary number of new identities will eventually cause the circuit view in Torbutton to show the wrong exit node.    This is a screenshot I took to show the problem. Notice Torbutton thinks my IP address is 104.167.102.244 and in Canada. check.torproject.org says it is 195.154.111.124 Atlas says that exit is in France  This is not related to architecture or OS nor to my network or even to machines owned by me. Also the problem is not limited to check.torproject.org and it has nothing to do with JavaScript.  When testing this I found that the number of new identities that are needed to reproduce this varies. Sometimes it happened first time other times I spent 10-15 minutes creating new identities in order to 'break' circuit view.  This has been happening over multiple versions of Tor Browser and doesn't seem to affect anonymity because the ip addresses are always Tor nodes. So it is not 'breaking Tor', just the circuit view.   Is this a known (or unknown) problem with TorButton's circuit view, or have I misconfigured something? Or something else entirely? "

1542,Decrease number of hidden service hops?,"Is there any way to reduce the length of a hidden service's path to the rendezvous point?   Bob's hidden service &lt;---&gt; Introduction Point Alice &lt;---&gt; Introduction Point tell Bob to contact me at Rendezvous Point Bob &lt;-&gt; Rendezvous point   Sometimes, Bob's hidden service does not need anonymity, but wants to be accessible via Tor anyways. (For example, ahmia.fi is also accessible as msydqstlz2kzerdg.onion). In such a case, it might be beneficial to limit the length of Bob's circuit to 1 (as indicated by the length of the arrow in step 3). Is that possible?  This is similar to How to decrease number of Tor hops?. and Accessing Tor hidden services over a single hop circuit, but those wanted to limit the number of client hops. This question is about the number of server hops. "
1543,All connection default to .onion.to Why cant I get just .onion,"I am now running tails. The latest version.   Before Xmas I could browse .onion sites easily just by downloading the tor browser on to my linux system. Since the New Year, I have found some sites are not available and I get a banner across the top of the pages of those sites which are available, from Tor2web.  Research tells me that tor2web is a web proxy service for tor. I didn't install it, or ask for it and it is the same problem on all devices I use on my network. Can I assume that my ISP is now directing tor traffic through Tor2web?  Research also suggests there are many other proxy sites for tor out there and they convert my .onion addresses to cached .onion.to addresses (or a similar extension). Research suggests that I should the remove the extra .to extension and a direct connection can be made. That didn't work for me.   I have used bridges with obfs4 and still get to onion.to sites. I have now installed Tails (rather than just the tor browser) with bridges and obfs4 and I  still cannot get through to .onion sites, I can only get onion.to sites. Does anyone have any more ideas of what is going on and how to solve it, that is, to get a direct Tor connection to .onion sites?  I have scoured for answers to this, but can't find any. Let me know if you can direct me to a comprehensive solution.  Thanks "
1544,"Tor connection from 1st to 2nd computer, then from 2nd computer, a 2nd Tor connection to browse web (for increased untraceability)","Requirement: set up a two-leg Tor connection (using Tor twice). End user works on 1st computer, connects thru Tor to a 2nd off-site computer (could go thru VPN, SSH, or SSL as well), and then from that 2nd computer, goes thru Tor a second time to browse the web anonymously.  Intended purpose: to increase the level of untraceability and anonymity. The set up is this:  End user on 1st Computer > Tor Connection > 2nd Off-site Computer > 2nd Tor Connection > Browse the Web  The 2nd computer is at an off-site location, and the 2nd computer would be impossible to trace back to the end user, even if it were found. So this means if the 2nd Tor connection (between the 2nd computer and the websites being browsed) gets hacked, only the 2nd off-site computer will be found, but not the 1st computer.  So this set up uses Tor twice in 2 legs as a double precaution against being traced. This set up is like using Tor with a virtual machine, but using a physical 2nd computer in place of a virtual machine, and using Tor twice, in two legs.  What is the best way to set this up? Any suggestions?  The 2nd computer will be a Windows 10 or Android device. "
1545,Tor circuit display in Tor Browser - how can it?,"If all the nodes in a Tor circuit aren't supposed to know about each other, how can the Tor Browser display the whole circuit? If it knows all the addresses in the chain, can't someone else pull that same information out of the packets and make the relay thing moot? Would that be how some agencies have been able to ""break"" Tor by placing what they call ""malware"" on websites to backtrace the origin IP? I know, a lot of questions but I think they're all related and I'm trying to understand how all this stuff works. "

1548,Bridges - How to prevent a big adversary to learn all bridges,"Bridges exist in the Tor network to circumvent censorship by not publishing them all at the same time or as a full list.

1549,My add-ons are not updating when tor browser is restarted,"My add-ons are not updating, no matter how many times I restart tor browser. In my add-ons tab I have these messages:  HTTPS-Everywhere will be updated after you restart Tor Browser.   NoScript will be updated after you restart Tor Browser.   Tab Mix Plus will be updated after you restart Tor Browser.    And in the grayed-out section at the bottom of the add-ons tab I see the updates have been downloaded, but not installed over the old versions:  Tab Mix Plus will be installed after you restart Tor Browser.   DownThemAll! will be installed after you restart Tor Browser.   NoScript will be installed after you restart Tor Browser.   HTTPS-Everywhere will be installed after you restart Tor Browser.    What is stopping these updates and new add-ons? What can I do to fix it?  PS: I tried a fresh install of TBB, but the same issue prevails. It seems to have crept in somewhere as new versions of TBB were produced.   PPS: It would be good if a Tag was available for HTTPS-Everywhere.  Additional info: OS is Windows 8. Tor installation is on external HD. Updates to Tor itself are successful, but I'm stuck with outdated add-ons. If anybody knows a way to force TBB to accept the add-on updates I'd very much appreciate it.  More info: I copied my Tor Browser folder to a different external device and ran it from there, but the add-ons have still failed to update. I conclude this problem is not specific to a particular external device. As I had the same problem on a fresh installation, I also conclude it's not due to peculiarities in my installation. Ron, thanks for your suggestions (I don't have the ability to Comment underneath) but I'm not sure how they apply to my situation. No other versions of Firefox have trouble updating add-ons. I don't use Zone Alarm. Downloading the updates is not a problem. Applying the downloaded updates is the problem. I'd be happy to hear your further suggestions or clarifications, but StackExchange makes it very hard to respond to each other. What I'm doing now, editing the initial post, seems the only mode available for me to communicate. "
1550,Can someone use WiFi snooping to see data I send through Tor Browser when I'm not using SSL?,"(NOTE: I've read other similar questions, but I'm not at all certain about this, therefore I'm asking.)  I travel a lot, and I generally use public WiFi spots and hotels/hostels/boarding houses etc. access points.  I'm a reporter. Sometimes I send my communications to email services and websites which don't use SSL cryptography (no https, just http), and though I KNOW this is not smart, I have no alternative.  What I want to know is if someone locally sniffing the network could read what I send to unprotected (no https) websites. If I send multimedia, pictures, audios etc., can they see/listen to them? Can they see what sites exactly I'm loading?  If so, what would take them? Just being connected to the same network? Having direct access to the router?  Is there anything I can do about it?  Again, I'm talking about people using the same network, snooping locally, and thinking about the data just after it leaves my PC and after it leaves the end node.  Thank you! "

1552,I can't register on twitch.tv with TOR beacuse image captcha loops itself,"I am having a need to register a twitch.tv account with TOR (my static IP got blocked thanks to my brother) but i am experiencing issue with account creation. The form doesnt allow me to go forward beacuse of really bad design of ReCaptcha ""I AM NOT A ROBOT"" button that after getting clicked requires me to repeat and repeat the procedure of clicking road signs. I think it has something to do with constantly changing IP. I even replaced  SocksPort 9150 IPv6Traffic PreferIPv6 KeepAliveIsolateSOCKSAuth   with  SocksPort 9150 IPv6Traffic PreferIPv6 NoIsolateSOCKSAuth   as described here: How to prevent a circuit from changing between browser tabs? but i kept those IPv6 stuff in torrc-defaults file. Even after changing those prefs i STILL experience same issues with ReCaptcha. Any solutions? "
1553,Attempting to undertand Tor and it's relationship with SSL,"I'm a mathematics student trying to understand Tor. I have little knowledge of networks and how exactly they function.  Up to now I (think I) understand the basic functionality of Tor. A route is generated first from the consensus list, and the packet (the message) is sent through that route. The packet is encrypted multiple times using the public keys obtained from the consensus list, and each relay strips away a layer of encryption before sending it on to the next relay (side question: how does this work with bridge relays? Is the message sent to a bridge relay first and then into the public Tor network, or does it move exclusively through bridge relays?). This means that the destination IP and IP of the sender are never in the same header of the packet and this is what gives Tor its relative anonymity.  Very often however I notice that SSL is brought up when discussions regarding Tor are made. I understand that SSL encrypts the data sent between the client and the server. But if this is the case I don't see how SSL is related to Tor, since they seemingly function on a different layer.  Edit: More specifically, I'm reading about how Iranian and Chinese authorities did ""Deep Package Inspection"" (i'm assuming this means that they looked at the contents of each packet) to look for SSL. Is this because SSL is used by default with encrypting the different layers in an onioned packet? If so, is there a reason that looking for SSL was enough to indentify a Tor connection? "
1554,Browser configured but still unable to unblock websites,"I have downloaded and installed Tor. Now, I wanted to use Tor to visit some of the blocked websites that our government had mistakenly blocked. So, I changed the proxy settings in my Firefox to point at localhost:9150.   Now, when I check my IP address, it is masked, but I'm still not able to visit the blocked website.   If I use the Tor Browser Bundle, however, I am able to visit the site.   So what is the difference in the settings in my Firefox and the Tor Browser??  PS: The blocked website I am trying to visit is github!! Yes, it was banned in India recently but soon the ban was lifted. My ISP is lazy though. They are still blocking it.  "
1555,How is data sent back from exit node to me?,"I understand how the client sends the data through Tor to the sever. Onion routing  Basically, it selects a set of nodes to form a circuit, say nodeA nodeB nodeC.  It then encrypts the data this way:  1. Encrypt it using nodeC's key, append server's address. 2. Encrypt it using nodeB's key, append nodeC's address. 3. Encrypt it using nodeA's key, append nodeB's address.   The data then travels the circuit this way.  Me -> nodeA (decrypt it) -> nodeB (decrypt) -> nodeC (decrypt) -> Server  1. I send the data to nodeA. nodeA decrypts it and will now know where to send the data next. 2. nodeA sends the data to nodeB. nodeB decrypts it and will now know where to send the data next. 3. nodeB sends the data to nodeC. nodesC decrypts it and will now know where to send the data next. 4. nodeC sends the data to the server.   What I don't get is, when the server replies, how is the data encrypted and/or sent back to me.  1. Does the exit node know who I am and sends the reply back the way I send the data to the server (construct a circuit)? 2. Is the session maintained, if so, how is the data encrypted between the nodes?  "
1556,"Will disabling caching in Tor Browser increase anonymity, or decrease it?","I have stumbled upon the idea of disabling cache - completely.  On one hand, I am thinking that due to having to load all elements afresh when visiting a page, I appear more like a fresh 'New Identity' (thus decreasing linkability and trackability across Tor IPs within one Identity), EVERY single time I load a page; but then I'm wondering how much of a fingerprinting issue it also raises, decreasing anonymity instead.  Is it a case of an anonymity trade-off? (An analogy would be: using an email masking service where you're trading having 1000 websites all knowing your email address and having it stored on all of their vulnerable, breachable servers, for ONE website having the outline to your entire digital life and storing those same 1000 sites in one solitary but juicy basket, on THEIR potentially, equally breachable server.)  Would it be a similar trade-off here?  Perhaps it depends what other anti-tracking add-ons and settings you have enabled. For me, I have:   NoScript set to global blocking Third party cookies blocked via FF settings Self-Destructing Cookies with default set to expire 'after you close the tab' (so I assume with such cookie sanitizing I will more properly look like a truly fresh user on every given page) RefControl with default set to 'no referrer' (again, making sure that I truly come across to every page as if I've literally entered the URL into the address bar and visited the page for the first time, ever) RequestPolicy to massively sandbox every domain I visit to keep other domains from knowing I'm visiting that domain (via blocking third-part cross-site images, scripts, css, scripts, objects, etc.) layout.css.visited_links_enabled set to false in about:config (to plug this in case you have enabled history) FlashBlock and BetterPrivacy HTTP Nowhere to block EVERY HTTP connection in the entire Tor Browser (short of direct handshakes to establish a domain's HTTPS with the Firefox default trusted CA store)   And the only exception to all this stringent blocking, is custom (often temporary) whitelisting/unblocking for sites I want to use more functionality on, which largely thanks to RequestPolicy are still very much sandboxed even with things like JavaScript and session cookies enabled.  So although it's very unusual behaviour, I'm guessing that it still gives stronger anonymity for each individual site I visit, via my stringent blocking of cross-site object tracking. I simply come off as a phantom user, someone maybe visiting the page from a saved bookmark, just with a Tor IP / User Agent / HTTP_ACCEPT Headers, no previous identifiable cookie, and a few other 'blank' returns that just make me look like a total unlinkable (but unique) ghost, to that one site.  To me, that's anonymous, IF that unique behaviour can't be linked, by that website's sysadmin, to other sites, which unless there was some collaboration or communication between the two (and it would have to be so for every single site on the web, two-way), I don't think is likely.   Or is the issue, that parties like the NSA, who are hoovering EVERYTHING up in their servers, will be the ones that can detect this extremely unique fingerprint across multiple sites, and so this being useless against the NSA and I should just fall back to 'crowd anonimity' once more?  Is it a case of, would I rather look more anonymous to the NSA, or more anonymous to each website that I visit on the Internet?  If so, is there a set of behaviours that can then combine the best of both worlds, with more knowledge of how TBB's default crowd behaviour of cache expiry, cookie settings, session length (how quickly things are 'reset' by default in TBB already), and other such fingerprinting considerations, work? "

1559,How can we get more community-operated (non-NSA) Tor relays set up?,"One of the greatest threats I can see to the anonymity of the Tor network and its users, is NSA/GCHQ (etc.)-operated Tor nodes.  No matter how state-of-the-art 'good practice' a Tor user adheres to - in not mixing modes of anonymity, keeping fingerprinting and trackability to a minimum, and using encryption to a maximum - if the NSA has enough nodes under their belt, then they can (some of the time), piece together the dots of the anonymity network and de-anonymize communications taking place in it.  The obvious best thing to fight such NSA compromise of the Tor network, is to use 'people power' (there are more of us than in the NSA), to create as many of our own non-NSA relays (even if on small pipes and not always having 24/7 up-time), and hold as much of our own stake in the network, as possible.  What can one do apart from already hosting a relay yourself?  Is there a foundation to which one can donate (or even partner on charity events) which then sets up Tor community-controlled nodes to expand the network outside of NS control?  What activism, evangelism, or community-building could one do, or join?  (This would be activism/evangelism specifically for more non-NSA nodes being hosted mind you, not so much more Tor users, even though that would be of great benefit to Tor anonimity and potentially indirect benefit to more relays being set up anyway.)  Further to this, is there some big decision that the Tor Project could make that automatically increases the amount of community-hosted relays (thus everyone outside of NSA's anonymity) - such as making all Tor users contribute a bit of (p2p-style) middle node bandwidth to the network whenever they're connected, which might be in such a way that the user's browsing isn't even slowed down?  Perhaps this final idea is one of the best we could do to truly combat NSA Tor network takeover: a vast increase in Tor Browser instances of end users hosting the middle node infrastructure, where there's by virtue of the size of the very Tor user base, more control of it by the community, than by malicious sniffing adversaries such as the NSA.

1563,"Is it possible to have ""username@site.onion"" addresses and FULLY avoid DNS with email?","I'm only just starting to look into email on Tor - and so far I'm only finding either email hosts whose sites (including webmail login) are hosted on .onion addresses, or whose POP, IMAP and SMTP servers can clearly be connected to in the .onion namespace (even from your thunderbird mail client) - but how about having a .onion address in the email address itself - and doing away with DNS entirely?  Is it possible to have an email address like username@servicexxxxxxxxx.onion, and thus have full .onion &lt;--> .onion email address correspondence?  I can think of obvious advantages, such as avoiding privacy and security issues associated with the standard DNS infrastructure (with sniffable DNS lookups, or spoofing), as well as relying less on or even completely doing away with the less secure system of HTTPS SSL/TLS certificate trust validation entirely, as well as further obfuscation and safety (from both the Clearnet in general and specifically malicious Tor exit nodes required to use it), by being fully insulated within the Tor network itself - especially if the .onion email services were configured solely to be a hidden service and not be DNS-referencable at all.  Has it been done before - are their services that indeed offer it now - or has the idea not actually been explored before?  There still is a use and need, for non-real-time, long-storage (until message retrieval), text correspondence - so OTR instant message (or even IRC using persistent BNCs) surely cannot satisfy the need for all 100% Tor, DNS-free, reliable text communication of this type - especially when people are used to email and clients like Thunderbird.

1564,Two instances of Tor behave differently,"I have a local and a server instance. My task: Run multiple Tor instances.

So I started my Windows OS and tried to open my USB drive contents but a message appeared saying ""You need to format your disk again in order to use this USB"". So I formatted the flash drive using the default FAT32 format but I was shocked to discover my USB space was not 16 GB; it was 6.8 GB, which means the encrypted partition of some 7 GB is not appearing. I again installed Tails on that 6.8GB space but when I started Tails again there was no encrypted partition appearing there either. So how can I empty my USB once again? How can I delete that encrypted partition? Also for future reference, how do I deal with the encrypted partitions using Tails? "
1566,Does hosting a Tor hidden service also on clearnet DNS reduce privacy/security for the Tor user?,"I am wondering about the anonymity and security differences in visiting an .onion site, from the user's perspective, between one that is ONLY a hidden service, and one that also points the same webserver to clearnet DNS - whether its DNS face has HTTPS or not.  (Also - some .onion sites / URLS offer HTTPS with the .onion URL anyway, and it's a self-signed certificate - I assume - on TOP of the HSP end-to-end encryption that already exists.)  There are many sites which offer an .onion URL counterpart to their clearnet domains:   Riseup.net has an .onion equivalent for all servers and URLs they offer and operate. Tor Project itself has an official .onion address to access its site, here. (at least it doesn't work at this time, perhaps it has been removed or for the time being is inactive.) Whonix.org until recently, (and not again until a certain issues with hidden service scability are fixed), also offered their site to be accessed via a .onion URL. The Pirate Bay has an official .onion mirror which it has been operating since 2012. Wikileaks from time to time have also had mirrors set up by either an endorsed partner of theirs, or possibly other supporters. DuckDuckGo has an official .onion URL from which to use its service, [website]But when a connection is made between a Tor user and a hidden service that also hosts that same webserver in non-anonymous DNS namespace (i.e. revealing the hidden service's outfacing IP), involving DNS lookups outside Tor, and with security protocols totally separate to Tor, do any of those clearnet 'compromises' somehow translate to the user connecting only to the hidden service side of the webserver? How insulated is the Tor-facing 'side' of the webserver from the clearnet-facing 'side'?  I can't imagine DNS lookups occur (and thus DNS metadata being snoopable by standard backbone sniffing), but I can think of data on the server database (user account details) being more vulnerable due to having less hops (or no hops) between its domain name and its real server IP (and no Tor encryption compared to simple server proxying either), and also wonder whether serving HTTPS on an .onion domain somehow translates to the user downloading the self-signed certificate from  the server's DNS space instead of onion space too.  If the service can manage only operating in .onion namespace, is it advantageous, from the users' point of view? "

1581,How can I set up the fastest network for a Tor relay?,"Say I set up a server in the cloud as a relay, how can I set it up so I get maximum speed out of the network?  And how fast can a Tor-relay get with optimal bandwidth/response time?    "
1582,Would Tor work if it became very large?,I wonder whether there would be any problems if Tor grew to serve a large portion (e.g. 5 or 30 %) of internet (web) usage?   As I understand it Tor is helped by new nodes at the moment – but is there any limit when its usability or safety would decrease?  
1583,How can I optimize the connection bandwidth and response time for Tor-browsing?,"How can I achieve the optimal connection for using Tor as a client, in terms of bandwidth and response time, given infinite resources?  Can I set up a server with very strong connection and do a VPN into it from a client machine (eg. browser on a laptop)?  Could I connect to low-latency nodes only? Etc. "
1584,Why can't I link to .onion domains from Wikipedia?,"When I try to save a Wikipedia page I've edited to include a relevant and useful link to a .onion site, I get an error message ""Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikipedia's blacklist.""    This error was first bought to my attention when someone tried to edit the assassination market article to include a link to the hidden service that's subject of this Forbes article. They assumed it was censorship because of the subject matter, but I've found I can't link any .onion URLs.  So, what's going on? Is there a Wikipedia policy to block all Tor sites, or is this a technical limitation? "
1585,McAfee Blocked Incoming Anonymous Proxy,"McAfee blocked an incoming connection from an anonymous proxy 37.130.227.133, does anyone know if my PC is now at risk somehow? I was under the impression that this shouldnt happen. Anyone have any input what this means? This happened after I was browsing sensitive information with javascript enabled on the 18th. Also my broswer froze and was displaying strange characters on some Tor sites following this. Anywhere I should look for malicious script on my PC? Im tech illiterate, any info would help. Thanks. "
1586,Many exit nodes unable to download from file hosting sites,My country recently blocked quite a number of popular file hosting sites (e.g. uploaded.net) at the IP level.  Using Tor circumvents this but I'm finding that most (nearly all?) Tor exit nodes are almost always past their free download limit on most of these.  I do try again and again after getting a 'new identity' but the process is laborious and most exit nodes are already past their limits. Is there any way I can work around this issue without subscribing to a 'premium' account on these sites? 
1587,Tor can't access its dir?,I've tried to set up a tor hidden service on /var/hidden.  And after chmod-ing it to 777 and chown-ing it to debian-tor it still won't work. Why is that? Why doesn't it have permission to write to that directory and it has to write the default /var/lib/tor? 
1588,How do I turn JavaScript off in Tor Browser Bundle 3.5?,I've updated to the latest Tor Browser Bundle but the option to turn off JavaScript seems to have disappeared. What is the correct way to turn off JavaScript now? I tried to set JavaScript enabled to false in about:config but several sites still report JavaScript is active on my browser. How do I turn it off? 
1589,Tor -> VPN or VPN -> Tor,"I'm trying to decide which method is safer, Tor -> VPN or VPN -> Tor. Lets suppose both exit nodes are compromised(Tor and VPN). They were set up by the government and it's goal is to spy on users.    The first example of this image (Tor -> VPN), the Tor exit node would only see the previous node, and the Entry one(me) would be safe. Right? The VPN would never find out about me.  In the second example, the VPN knows who I really am and that I'm connected to a Tor network. Could they in anyway trace a profile of me and know everything I do?   I'm not so worried about reports coming from internet since I will browse ""safe websites""(I hope) and either way, my identity is secure. "
1590,Why tor browser doesn't recognize many emojis?,"Here is how I view emojipedia.net using tor browser :    many of emojis aren't recognized by the browser, However emojis in services like twitter work well because the service (twitter in this case) provides it own demonstration of an emoji in form of an image.  Why this problem is caused? Why firefox (which tor browser in based on it) doesn't have the same problem? Any solutions? "
1591,I2P HTTP/HTTPS proxies doesn't work,"I'm totally new to I2P and trying to configure it so that I could browse ordinary web-pages (eg Linkedin which is blocked in our country right now). At the time of writing the only thing worked properly are .i2p sites like DifTracker:    I use Arch Linux x64 (4.13.9-1-ARCH) with Firefox. Let me list the steps I did:  1. Set port forwarding on my router:   The port number I took from Network configuration -> UDP port. The second line is the same just for Windows.  2. Set the following proxy settings in Firefox's preferences:    3. Check if I2P tunnels (""outproxies""?) work. As you can see the network status is OK at the sidebar:     Finally, I tried to go to reddit but Firefox says proxy server refuses connections:    Any ideas? "
1592,censorship and tbb exit nodes.,"The three gifts that tor and tbb give are anonymity, privacy and no censorship or so I believed. For last few days/weeks I have been observing that quite a few domains don't work on tor anymore. While part of the answer may lie in domain takedowns and I suspect many are, but does censorship apply to rules of exit node. Just for e.g. let's say I'm sitting in Sri Lanka, using tor circuits out of any of the 140 countries where tor has a presence, for e.g. say using Germany as the exit node by chance. Now would censorship of Germany be applied to the requst for a site or am I mis-understanding something ?  I do know that in-between it's all encrypted communication through and through (https) but still is some leakage possible ? "

1596,Why use a rendez vous point instead of a introduction point?,This is maybe a obvious question but why a client need to use a rendez-vous point instead of directly use a introduction point for communicate with the hidden service?  It is because introduction points are published in HsDir and consequently a attacker can more easily deanonymise clients and servers if the introduction points are used for a long-term communication?

1602,Tor router and exit nodes,"I just finished a project to make a Raspberry Pi into a Tor router and I am curious about technical aspects of Tor that I do not understand. I know how to switch the exit node in Tor Browser during a single browsing session and I think the exit node changes whenever I close and open the browser. However, when one uses Tor for something like the router example, when and for what reasons might the exit node change? For obvious reasons, I am concerned that the exit node would remain constant and degrade anonymity. In an ideal world, I would prefer to have the router change exit nodes at a random internal of up to 10 minutes.  Thank you! "

Once I logged into eduroam with my ID, does administrator copy my info such as Mac address?  Then, if they have my mac address, does it mean even if I use guest wifi, they still know it is me who is using it if they identify my mac address?

1609,Google Recaptcha not working in TOR Browser,"In our website we provide Google Recaptcha V2 for users during login process, and the user must clear the Recaptcha verification before they can login else the user cannot login to the website.

To protect our users we can't process your request right now"". This prevents our TOR browser users from accessing our site.  Is there any way by which we can specifically allow the TOR users to bypass the Recaptcha verification so that they can login without any trouble? Or are there any alternatives Recaptchas (apart from Google Recaptcha) that are TOR friendly? "

1622,How sending form data over HTTPS using TOR works,"I understand in general how TOR works, with creating a circuit from the client using 3 random nodes in the TOR network - the entry node, some internal node, and an exit node.  My question is about how HTTPS works with TOR, and specifically whether or not the data sent to the end server is actually secure.  The way I assume it works, the HTTPS session is created between the exit node (the 3rd node in the circuit) and the target server, but that means this 3rd node can actually see all the data I'm sending as cleartext, including any form data (e.g. credit card numbers, passwords etc.), it then takes that cleartext data and uses the HTTPS/SSL protocols to send it securely to the target server.  Am I wrong/missing something? Is all the data I'm sending to the end server visible to the TOR exit node, even when browsing to an HTTPS connection?   To be 100% clear - I'm talking about a case where I'm using TOR to connect to an HTTPS website OUTSIDE of TOR, as connecting to .onion addresses already ensures e2e encryption without the need for HTTPS.

1625,Making Data Transactions Ambiguous,"I just signed up on the TOR StackExchange. Let me preface my question by warning everybody that I am not a technical expert and apologizing in advance if some of my assumptions are incorrect or naive.  From what I understand about TOR, a user could potentially be de-anonymized in the following scenario (however improbable it may be):  A TOR circuit consists of 3 nodes connecting the user and the clearnet. If, hypothetically, all 3 nodes were compromised (or even the entry and exit node), being operated and monitored by an adversarial entity, then it could be ascertained that a certain file of a known file size was downloaded from the exit node. If several milliseconds later your Internet Provider has a record of you downloading a file of the exact same size and this information can be statistically determined, well, your anonymity is more or less compromised.  My question is, couldn't something along the lines of the following scheme be implemented to combat this?  Suppose at every node, as well as on the user's computer a random amount of ""noise"" data was tacked on to the packet before its encryption. Too prevent too much data from being appended and causing lag within the system, the data would need to be within a determined range, between some minimum and maximum value (a minimum value would not hide the actual size of the meaningful data packet well enough, one might argue). Then, at every step in the proxy chain, the data is unscrambled by a random amount (again within a given range of permissible values) is subducted and/or added on to the noise, repackaged, and sent along. Would this be possible to implement, and would it successfully spoof adversaries endeavoring to conduct malicious statistical analysis?  I do not know if what I have proposed is nonsense, technically impossible to implement, due to some consideration of which I am simply not aware. My ignorance may be apparent. But if it is possible, why not implement this as part of the TOR infrastructure? It would serve to strengthen anonymity in this increasingly Orwellian madhouse of a world.  Of course, someone has probably thought of this all before. It would then have been rejected for good reason, I'm sure. I appreciate any feedback on this matter. Thank you. "

1631,What's keeping [insert dictatorship here] from blocking all bridges after first use?,"I'm curious as to why the following method isn't used by state-level censors to detect ALL kinds of Tor bridges, even obfuscated ones, and automatically block them for their population:   You run mass surveillance on your people's internet communications,  so you know which ip:port destinations they connect to. You build a (very large) list of all such ip:port combinations you encounter. You run a cluster of well-connected nodes that don't do anything but try to connect to these destinations using all tor bridge protocols (maybe using heuristics to discard unlikely targets) Whenever one of the nodes gets a working connection to the Tor network, the ip:port combination is added to the list of bridges to block.   Is this infeasible because of the cost/effort/required network bandwith? Or because there are much simpler solutions? Or for other reasons?  This question might be related. "
1632,ZeroDay exploits and how do we stay safe from them,"Tor is a browser that guarantees anonymity if used properly. But today I stumbled upon a piece of code which is claimed to be a Zero day exploit for Tor browser.  It can be located by the following link.

But, we have no choice other than these services either. Right now, this exploit is still active and working.  My question is specific. Can there be a method to use the internet securely without failing under these zero day exploits?  p.s. in a case like this, shouldn't we at least put a notification via Tor Browser to its users asking them to refrain using the service until everything is fixed? I understand it may take away the trust from some users, but its better than exposing them. "

1642,Why does Tor Browser auto-reset DisableNetwork setting to 1 after Tor Browser Exit?,"1.) Why does my Tor Browser auto-reset the DisableNetwork setting to ""1"" after Tor Browser shutsdown for a clean ""Exit""?   2.) How should I stop this settings auto-reset behavior so I do not have to re-edit the torrc configuration file every time I want to start Tor Browser?    3.) Does my manually resetting DisableNetwork to 0 before I restart Tor Browser harm my Tor online security settings in any way?  I run WinXP Home SP3 with local Administrator rights &amp; the latest MS patches are up to date with the latest Tor Browser version 5.5.1.  As far as I know, the McAfee Anti-Virus software I have installed does not interfere with Tor Browser or its settings.  I have enabled the MS Security Center to enable ports 80, 443 for Tor Browser and obsf4 use.    Whenever I successfully open Tor Browser and eventually close Tor when I am finished, the DisableNetwork setting always auto-resets from 0 to 1 for no apparent reason.  All other Tor Browser settings and changes are correctly saved, but not the DisableNetwork setting.  No file or app error is listed in the WinXP system/app event log and DisableNetwork is not located in Firefox's about:config.  The only Tor Browser listing for DisableNetwork is in torrc settings file.  This unannounced DisableNetwork settings change prevents me from restarting Tor Browser unless I manually edit the Torrc file.  As a result, I only have 2 or 3 options to successfully restart Tor Browser.    The first option is to edit the text file c:\documents and settings\test user\desktop\tor browser\browser\torbrowser\data\tor\torrc to change the DisableNetwork setting from 1 to 0.  Tor Browser will then run correctly after I make the DisableNetwork setting change. However DisableNetwork will later change back 1 when the Tor app is closed.  The second option is more tedious &amp; time consuming, where I have to reinstall Tor Browser through a TorProject.org update or upgrade. Upon successful startup, I then have to reconfigure Tor Browser as if it is a totally new install of the software.  A third option after Tor Browser shutdown could be to create a batch file to copy a pre-saved torrc file that includes DisableNetwork 0 to overwrite the original torrc file.  However, this is a temporary workaround and not a solution to why the DisableNetwork setting changes.  Any suggestion would be appreciated!  I have experienced this same DisableNetwork settings problem when using Tor for the past several years... "
1643,"Which node(s), if any, in the circuit for a hidden service, can see the URI of a request to a hidden service?","I understand that all of the communication between a client and a hidden service (.onion) takes place within the Tor network and is therefore end-to-end encrypted. What I am wondering, however, is how the URL / URI of a given request is handled. If in my Tor Browser I see this;  [website]Are there nodes within the Tor circuit that can see that I am attempting to access a page with some potentially identifying information in it?  Is the whole URL obscured from leaking sensitive info? Or even part of it? "
1644,Me -> My own VPN -> Tor,"I know there is a lot of question regarding VPN+Tor and this is a bit different.  I use a VPN to connect to the internet for multiple reasons, mostly to encrypt my traffic on local networks (public wifi, ...). The VPN is on a dedicated server I own and run a linux distribution I fully control. I am the only one to have access to that server.  The problem is that my VPN IP address is strongly linked with my identity : the IP address is linked (with direct and reverse DNS) to a domain name related to my name (eg. john-doe.com) . So whenever I use my VPN the website I visit can know my identity. Thus all my online activities can be linked (and easily, just with my IP) to my real identity.  I could remove the DNS informations but it's usefull for various services I use on that server.  I could also set up a fresh server with no DNS name but in that case it would still be possible to track me (with fore efforts) by contacting the server hoster which has my payment data.  My Idea is to use Tor on that server so all internet from the VPN connection would be routed by Tor. Will it be a good idea ? How to do that ? Should I use a fresh server with no DNS information or I will be safe with my current VPN ? "
1645,Traffic monitoring with Tor,Is there a downloadable application that will put a Tor node traffic monitor visual on my screen? Even just a go/no go activity level? I am still on about how much access and/or control the exit node owner can potentially have considering that I understand that the whole raison d'etre for Tor is complete (or as complete as possible) privacy for the user. 
1646,"Azure ""security rules"" for tor-middle node","I trying to set-up a tor middle relay on Azure.  I've an Ubuntu instance, tor is all installed and has bootstrapped fine, but it won't form a circuit and the ORPort is unreachable.  I assume this is a firewall issue, and digging around on portal.azure.com I found the instances security rules.  Has anyone got a good how-to for setting the MS Azure rules up? failing that what ports do I need open (is it just the ORPort and 9050?)  Thanks "
1647,Does a tor message keep track of number of nodes it's gone through?,"Let's say you have a message. Does it include the number of hops it has passed through? If no, what is stopping it from just being passed around indefinitely and never reaching an exit node? If yes, does this mean the first node it is passed to knows the originator, and if malicious would send it strait to an exit node and watch the exit nodes traffic?  "
1648,Is it dangerous to have Tor exit node?,"If I buy VPS and create Tor exit node there what would happen if someone did bad thing using my exit node? (terrorism, hacking goverment sites etc) VPS provider will share information about me to FBI or another goverment organizations or just will send abuse and block my VPS because it's obviously that I'm just an operator of exit node, not terrorist? "
1649,Tor circuit selection,"Quick question - is it possible to 'exclude' or 'bypass' certain Tor Circuits?  Example: At this moment it shows the circuit as France - Netherlands - France. What I am wondering is, can I tell Tor to never use France in it's circuit selection? Reason being simple, France has notoriously slow servers and it slows down the whole browsing experience... "
1650,How to easily verify certificates on .onion versions of clearnet sites?,"According to various sources (like this question) DuckDuckGo has an onion site. However,   I can't easily find any mention of it on their clearnet site (but I stumbled across a special search result page) and the certificate used on the onion site is not valid for the .onion address, only for *.duckduckgo.com and duckduckgo.com.   Verifying that the .onion certificate is the same as the official one and not from some CA breach is not easy: it seems Firefox doesn't show certificate details in the Page Info when you get a certificate warning. I was finally able to compare them using this command (You can ignore the SSL session differences):  meld \     &lt;(openssl s_client -connect duckduckgo.com:443 -status &lt;&lt;&lt; '') \     &lt;(torify openssl s_client -connect 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion:443 -status &lt;&lt;&lt; '') &amp;   What am I supposed to do as an end user in this situation? Not use HTTPS? Ask DuckDuckGo to update their certificate &amp; web site? Verify the certificate manually each time? Or have I misunderstood how .onion sites work?  (DuckDuckGo is just an example; I'm sure there are other .onion sites with the same issues.) "

1652,Is there any Legal Issues with Tor in Brazil?,"In Brazil, your ISP, according to the law, must keep a track of the connections you do with your IP address from your network. This track is used to prove that ""you"" (or someone using your WiFi, or some virus, or someone who infected you with a Trojan, or someone with a laptop in those conditions that used it in your home, but, for our law, ""you"") did something in your network, when someone breaks the law and there's an IP record of the source.  So, what if someone uses Tor for sharing, e.g., kid's porn, and some file transfer happens by your network's node? Would you be in trouble? Is there any way to avoid that? "
1653,How can a new circuit happen without closing all tabs?,"Using the current version (3.5) of the Tor Browser Bundle, how can we switch to a new circuit without losing all tabs and activity?  I understand the reason of ""New Identity"" means everything is closed, for if you wish to change to a new activity completely separated from the former.  But this is not the only reason to want change to a different circuit. Some times we may have to change when a circuit is slow, or if it does not allow certain traffic on policy. To lose all tabs for this is a huge burden.  Before losing Vidalia we could use this to change circuit easily. Now I cannot find a way.  Does anyone know how to fix this? "
1654,Why is there no Tor Bundle 3.5 for OS X 64bit?,"I have 2.3.x for OS X 64 bit and recently got a notice to upgrade to 3.5, the only options were Windows and OS X in 32 bit and Linux 32 or 64.  What happened to the 64 bit version of Tor for OS X?  Is it still under development?  How do I get a notice about it added to the download page? "
1655,Cannot post comments on sites using Facebook social plugin,"I have a Facebook account that was successfully registered from behind Tor (not using my real name, of course). I am unable to post comments on sites that use the Facebook social plugin. There is no error message returned. I am able to login to Facebook, and the comment appears on my screen as having been posted, but it isn't visible to others. I have tried using one other Facebook account, but get the same results. This has been a problem with all the Tor Browser Bundle versions that I have used. I have tried disabling HTTPS Everywhere and NoScript, but it still doesn't work.  Has anyone been able to overcome this problem? Are there hidden settings in the browser that I need to change that would permit my posts to go through? "
1656,HTTPS problem with Tor Browser Bundle 3.5,"I've noticed after running Tor Browser Bundle 3.5 for a few minutes that it will refuse the connection to HTTPS websites.

1660,How do I verify that a relay is working with IPv6?,"After upgrading to Tor 0.2.4.19 I configured a relay to support IPv6. I was a bit surprised to see nothing regarding IPv6 in the logs at startup, but I can see that Tor is binding to the configured IPv6 ports. As I don't see connections being made to Tor over IPv6, how can I verify that the relay is working with IPv6?  Is there some kind of relay overview which shows IPv6-enabled relays? "
1661,What's the hidden services threat model after a key compromise?,When a hidden service private key got compromised and an adversary uses our hidden service to serve its own TCP stream can we detect it or can he do that silently or sniff on our hidden service's traffic?  What can an adversary do when he/she owns our private key? 
1662,How to use a common screen size?,"Using the Tor Browser, one thing I've noticed while looking at the EFF's Panopticon browser fingerprinting tool is that the screen size reported matches the dimensions of the browser window. While this makes sense in that it is ephemeral, it also results in some unique screen resolutions that are easily identifiable.   So, a couple of questions:  a) Is there a tool to resize the Tor Browser to a specified screen resolution?   b) Is there a way to force the Tor Browser to return a common screen resolution, regardless of actual browser size ?  "
1663,Why was my relay given the Guard flag only for it to be removed an hour+ later?,"My relay 'angrykitteh' (the kitten is now quite frustrated!) was blessed and granted the flag 'Guard' by the Directory Authorities as its uptime is more than 8 days and the bandwidth is deemed acceptable and fast enough. Great.  The atlas link given shows a slight peak in the 'Guard probability' but dropped immediately afterwards.  Suddenly, only an hour (or two) after being granted the flag, it was gone!  Here's the consensus now, after I discovered the flag was gone: consensus after my Guard flag disappeared [website]Why was the flag removed? Why are some authorities still voting to give me it? What changed? "
1664,How to keep people from knowing you are using Tor?,"The fact that someone was using Tor was enough to make him a suspect in a recent bomb thread The time he connected to the Tor network was circumstantial evidence, and he proceeded to confess.  The point of this is, just knowing who is using Tor is a threat to anonymity. So my question is this: How do I prevent people from knowing I am using Tor? "
1665,How to protect a hidden service against DDOS attack?,How to protect a hidden service against DDOS attack? I did some research and found that it is possible to do load balancing with HAProxy. Is there any other solution that could be implemented? 
1666,Why did the option to permanently allow javascript disappear from the NoScript menu in Tor Browser?,"I recently updated Tor Browser and now I can't permanently allow javascript through the NoScript menu. All I see in it is ""Temporarily allow all this page"" and options to disable already enabled sites. If I want to enable it on the current site, I have to permanently enable all the page and then disable what I don't want, and these exceptions are not stored permanently. Plus it is time consuming. Why did the original options disappear? How can I easily enable javascript for websites like before? "
1667,How many descriptors can be retrieved in one request using the descriptor digest?,in the Tor dir-spec.txt I can see a note stating that due to squid proxy url limitations it is only possible to download 96 descriptors when using the fingerprints.  Does this also apply to the digests? Or is it an other value for them? 
1668,Configuring Firefox to access Tor network and SSH tunnel server,"I would like to access the Tor network (hidden services/.onion sites) and Http sites using Firefox. I currently route Firefox and a download manager to access Http sites through an SSH tunnel server. I can also access the Tor network with the Tor Browser and access .onion sites. But I haven't figured out how to route Firefox to access both the Tor network (.onion) and Http sites seamlessly. I  have tried to configure ProxyCap (Freecap for Mac) to do this but am not sure how to configure it to enable Firefox to do this. Everything I've tried has only been partially successful. I've read that generally you want to route traffic according to this protocol ...Firefox -> Tor -> Proxycap -> SSH server to prevent DNS leaks, etc. Is this correct? If so what are general configuration settings?  "
1669,Genymotion Android Emulator,"I'm using Tor with a VPN (from privateinternetaccessTM), so I thought I was doing pretty good at maintaining anonymity, until I tried to use the Genymotion Android emulator. It links directly to my network and tracks my IP address.  There is a screen to enter http proxy info and port settings (see pic below) - is that advisable?  Where do I get the values to enter - Tor or my VPN?   "
1670,What info can be gleaned from Tor traffic over a local network?,"Or put another way, what does Tor traffic look like when monitored over a home router? Would info like URL/DNS lookups be visible? What would the URLs and packet headers/contents look like?  And if there's a way that I could see this for myself, that would be all the better. "
1671,CloudFlare won't let in even though I solve the captcha correctly,"Usually when I try to reach sites from Tails, it often get CloudFlare's captcha, and after solving it the sites work for about 10 minutes.  But now it behaves like if the captcha is entered incorrectly each time. I've tried more than 20 times, on multiple sites.  Is it something broken in CloudFlare, in browser or there is some subtile policy change that blocks all Tor users pretending they never can solve the captcha?  Update: The issue seems to be re-opened. Where can I report CloudFlare problems to CloudFlare from within TAILS? "
1672,Is Ubuntu amnesic like Tails?,"Is using ubuntu amnesic as Tails and therefore prevent fingerprinting? Can I use ubuntu as an alternative to Tails? I think ubuntu too only use the RAM and destroy all memory after shutting down, and hence fulfill the purpose of Tails. "
1673,Can an IP address get you caught?,"We need to use java scripts on some sites because we need them in order to get the task done. Suppose some site get my real IP address by using some java script attack, then how dangerous it can be? My IP address is a static not a variable one. It is different everytime and shows location several miles away each time than the last time. Maximum it shows a city and the name of my ISP. If my adversary is someone like the NSA or FBI can they use this info to get me? Edit: I am using Tails and it protects against the fingerprinting. So even they install something on my system for attacking me in the long term, it will get deleted everytime I reboot or shut down my system, right? "

1681,"Tor dying on Raspberry Pi (circuit creation storm, out of memory)","UPD: this question was regarding an older version of Tor (0.2.4.24). With a newer version (which was 0.2.7.2-alpha for me) the problem disappeared.    I am running Tor (0.2.4.24) relay on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian). Once every 5-10 days the Tor daemon disappears and I have to restart it manually. I looked into the recent occurrence and found the following.   Atlas says there were bursts of activity before the disappearance:  The bursts occupied the entire relay bandwidth (80k). dmesg says there were too many connections:  [Thu Jan 29 16:24:22 2015] smsc95xx 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: kevent 2 may have been dropped ...  several lines like this ...

1682,Is (provider rotating) DNSCrypt inside Whonix superior privacy-wise to defaulting to Tor exit nodes' DNS?,"I use Whonix.  I am interested in making clearnet traffic as private from third parties other than the sites I visit, as possible. This not only includes the NSA, but also third-party DNS providers which may log, and even likely be willing to share this information with NSA (such as Google's DNS or OpenDNS), but even just by virtue of hte traffic being unencrypted over the Internet and thus, no matter how well-meaning, still sniffable by anyone on the pipes between you and the DNS provider(s) used by your particular Tor exit node at the time.  Whonix's wiki advice on running DNSCrypt within the VM makes a good point that using DNSCrypt for Tor browsing may not be as advantageous as one may first think.  But if you trust a DNS provider (or a rotating array of them, such as the DNSCrypt community), who not only promises to be logless/less logging and is smaller, security-focused, generally donation-based, AND uses a protocol that at least doesn't broadcast your queried sites with a megaphone on the wires while you communicate with it, wouldn't it still be better?  The question is: do I share what websites my (rotating) Tor IP addresses visit, with MANY highly insecure DNS providers (distributing the inevitable across many providers, even though it's totally sniffable, poisonable, and most likely logged), or with ONE highly secure DNS provider where the traffic is indeed far less likely to be leaked, logged, or sniffed?  It is mind-boggling to think through the ramifications of either choice, privacy and anonymity-wise. NSA would have more information with unencrypted DNS requests to later match to other inevitable clearnet metadata like HTTPS requests between your rotating Tor IPs and the servers you request to start HTTPS sessions with - and of course, all other unencrypted TCP traffic you may visit already. (like apt-get updates)  My idea is to make a simple script (in configuring and restarting dnscrypt-proxy) to rotate through different DNSCrypt providers each day or logon session (or activity that I want to seriously de-correlate to other ones, if uncomfortably close in time to  each other), distributing the 'power' and required trust aptly warned on the Whonix wiki, to several providers and not just one.  Could that be combining the best of both worlds and be the very best solution for DNS privacy and security, on Tor? "
1683,Why after restaring Tor in TAILS the GUI thinks it is not started?,"After starting TAILS, there is GUI that shows Tor status.  But after I do /etc/init.d/tor restart as root (because of sometimes it gets stuck due to clock jumps), the ""Vidalia control panel"" shows ""Tor is not running"" and Tor-browser warns ""Tor is not running. Do you really want to start?"", even tough it is actually running and tor-browser works if I press ""Yes"".  Why does it happen? How do I restart Tor correctly on TAILS? "
1684,Tails OS: Disable administration password after booting Tails with adminpasw,"I want to work on tails without admin passwd, but i do want to config my torrc file and a proxychain. I want to do this without leaving traces on my usbstick (like customized torrc file). Is it possible to disable adminpassword after booting with admin password?  If no, is it possible to customize tails like:removing admin privileges on the torrc file so I can edit the torrc file without admin password. As second: fix an preinstalled Proxychains 3.1 on my tails usb?  btw: im not using the tails installed from tails (no encrypted volume etc).

1687,Non-tor service over tor,"I'm struggling to find information on how to route non Tor services over Tor.  Say i wanted to run a GPS tracking server as a hidden service, I could create a hidden service and point that to the listening port of the tracking server (e.g. TCP 9001). The tracking server would then have a .onion address.  On the client, (any OS that will work) how could I force traffic to be routed to the hidden service's .onion address? I'm thinking something like, tell the client software the server is at localhost:9001, then use something like torsocks to forward all traffic for 9001 to the .onion address. Is this possible, even if it is potentially unsafe?  I'm new to Tor so please forgive me if it is a stupid question! Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance "
1688,What do local network adversaires see?,"Suppose I am at an institution and download the Tor Browser (they now know I am using Tor) for research on a highly controversial subject.  If I use the downloaded Tor browser immediately and visit for example [website]Also suppose I am connected to the through an ethernet cable, using their computer (assume they do not have their own certificate installed. that is I am not being MITM).  If they review their logs and no law enforcement is involved, what can they know?  Do they know I am viewing example.com or do they only know I am connected to a Tor node?  Can they see what I am viewing (the actually web content)?  What if I visit HTTPS websites?  Is there anything I should know before doing this research? (research is on legal stuff: not CP and the like)  Assume I will only visit clear text websites - not onion sites  I also do not care that they know I am using Tor "
1689,Hosting Tor and Web service on separate machines security issues,"I've read that it's best to host Tor and your website service on separate machines and then point your torrc file to your web host (host where website files are stored). It's quite possible that my Tor machine and web host will be geographically separate. Assuming my web host has a public IP of say 41.14.44.11, I would change my Tor host machine settings to:  HiddenServiceDir /Library/Tor/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ HiddenServicePort 80 41.14.44.11:8080   My question: Does this mean that my Tor machine will have to go out onto the clearnet to connect to my web host and then receive the data back from the host and then serve it to my visitors, essentially making it a sort of ""exit node"" to connect to my web host? This would be very bad for security and anonymity. The data between the Tor host and web host will also be plain text unless SSL is implemented between the two, correct? Or how would you ensure encryption for the data from the web host back into Tor?  Would it not be possible (and better) to also set up Tor on the web host machine and then point the Tor host machine to the .onion link of my web host, thus keeping all the traffic inside the Tor network and essentially turning the Tor machine into a sort of proxy while still making it secure so that if my Tor service was to be compromised my webhost would still be safe? Like so:  HiddenServiceDir /Library/Tor/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ HiddenServicePort 80 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion:8080  "
1690,limit tor socks server to a certain hidden service,"I have tor running on a pc, with its socks server listening on localhost port 9050.  I would like to limit the socks server in this way:  socks requests (from clients) should be allowed only for a given hidden service url, and blocked for any other request.  Is this possible with tor? How can I do it? "
1691,Backwards Compatibility on the Tor Network,"How big of an issue is backwards compatibility on the Tor network?  The reason I ask is that my Onion v3 hidden service is set up and ready to go, however I am unsure when to discontinue my Onion v2 service.  Do most people use a fully up-to-date Tor browser or is it common for ancient versions to be used?  Thank you. "
1692,Still running old version of relay after apt-get upgrade,"Noob question.  I got the message ""Please upgrade! This version of Tor (#.#.#.#) is not recommended, according to the directory authorities. Recommended versions are...""  So I ran apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade (I'll have to look into unattended upgrades someday) and my tor relay got upgraded to 0.2.9.14 but it seems 0.3.1.9 is already released. Why wasn't I upgraded to 0.3.1.9?  Is there just a delay before it gets to Debian repositories? It just seems really far behind.  I'm running Raspbian Stretch Lite on a Raspberry Pi 3.  Update, I can see from Debian's package search that I have the latest version for Debian Stretch.  Search is here: [website]I'm still feeling outdated though. I want my relay to be better than everyone else's! :P "
1693,New update and settings (newb),"I have just downloaded the latest updated version 7.0.11.  I have noticed some setting changes in the preferences.  History : ""Use Custom Settings For History"".  I thought this would have been set to the ""Never Remember History by default""? Im sure it was set to that on the older version.  *""Accept Cookies Always"" was ticked and also Accept Third Party Cookies"" ""Always"" was ticked. I would have thought it would be Never by default?.  Also when browsing there was a dropdown option by the Onion on the left of the browser that gave you options to Always Allow (Scripts?)(sorry cant remember what it said) for this page/site once or Forbid Scripts Globally or something along those lines if anyone can follow that. I cannot see this any longer.  While using the older browsers in the past when I got to a short link (sorry again) it is a link where you have to wait for a count down before you can proceed. it would not say continue as proxy detected. The only way past this was for me to choose to allow the script for this page only. But using this latest browser it did not say this any longer, the short link just went through ok.  I have been using the browser today but only just noticed these settings and wondered would it have been a problem Browsing being able to be Tracked today especially having the scripts being used on all sites if it was as as I have said, there was no option to choose.  I also didnt really want my history/cookies showing/kept without having to clear them manually etc. Thanks for any help and please use NewB replies if possible :)  EDITE 1 Ok when I downloaded the browser bundle before, I put the search ""Tor"" in google which gave me this [website]When I downloaded it from the TOR link, when I said I could not see the scripts option on the left, it was because on the version I downloaded it was on the right of the window??  Now if I go to the link you posted and download from there the window is back to how it used to be with the scripts option on the left next to the green onion? [website]Also if you go to both options to download and then click on the Home tab the headers/banners are different? but both download windows look the same but give you two different browser windows. In either one of them I download. all the changes I made to security etc is still the same on either download. A bit confusing if you can follow all that. I should say Im on a Mac running Yosemite.  EDIT 2 I have downloaded the browser using both options and they are both the same now. but the were definitely different slightly. Wish I had taken a screen capture now. Do you think the one could not have been the real browser bundle? but woth went to the same download url One the first one the privacy slider was at the top like it has always been on the older versions, but on the link you gave the slider is at the lowest setting. Funny how the privacy slider was at the top but the main browser window was different with the script option on the right of the screen  Last Edit Ok last question..I hope and I do really appreciate your help. If I delete the tor browser bundle and also delete the tor browser bundle and secure delete them on my mac, is there any trace of tor left on my mac, as in thumbnail images etc (nothing dodgy)  I may re-enstall it at a later date. Thanks for all your advice/help. "
1694,How to know if exit nodes are the bottleneck,"I've read that the exit nodes are the bottleneck of the tor network, and I've also read the opposite. Did the answer change at some point or is it changing often?  What is the best way to determine if the exit nodes are the bottlenecks right now and/or just ""recently""?  Ultimately I'm wondering if I'm wasting my time by adding non-exit nodes if they're not needed, or if I'd be wasting my time trying to safely set up a new exit node when a new non-exit would help just as much. "
1695,Multiple outgoing connections from Tor browser,I see a lot of unknown outgoing connections from tor.exe to different IP addresses (about 6-7) every time Tor browser first connects to Internet after its installing. Only Tor entry guard remains with the following connections to Internet. Is it normal for Tor browser? What are these IP addresses? Is it possible to forbid them in my firewall and leave only Tor entry guard for higher security? 
1696,Bootstrapping of Tor takes so much time,"Currently, I'm trying to bootstrap Tor on Whonix. The screen says as below.  Bootstrapping Tor... Bootstrap phase: Starting 0%  However, it's been 30 minutes since this started. Does bootstrapping Tor usually take such a long time? Or is this only happening because of some kind of trouble on my computer?  I would appreciate it if you solve this matter for me. Thanks. "
1697,DNS in Tor and Tor Browser,"If I look for DNS leaks when using Tor Browser, I find none. For example, if I connect to [website]In contrast, VPNs on Linux always seem to leak the DNS. Despite testing the advice of numerous different purported solutions (such as this, this and this) I have found none that works, perhaps because the answers to the questions are (or appear at least) to be provided by people who have found ad-hoc solutions rather than by experts in OpenVPN. In particular, no modifications of the relevant OpenVPN config files seems to inhibit leakage of the DNS. Although cursory check with dnsleaktest.com often suggest that the DNS is not being leaked, using the more extensive test that's provided shows that the DNS is actually being served by my regular ISP.  In Windows, the situation is a bit better with regard to using a VPN. The supplied desktop applications of several VPN providers have an option to use their own DNS servers, and no leakage is apparent. Likewise, inserting block-outside-dns into the relevant OpenVPN config file (under Windows) seems to solve the problem.  Questions: (1) Does Tor itself prevent the DNS leak, or is it the total environment provided by the Tor Browser bundle that prevents it? (2) How is the DNS leakage prevented? (3) Is the method transferable to preventing the DNS leak when using a VPN with Linux?  Just to be clear, I'm not the least bit interested in running Tor in conjunction with a VPN, either before, or after the Tor connection. I'm interested in knowing what, if anything, I can learn from Tor that might be transferable to working with a VPN. "
1698,What hidden services does my relay node know about?,"I built tor from source and am running it as a relay (not exit node) and also as a directory server.  It is my understanding that after a while I should experience V2 hidden services publishing their descriptors to me (each hidden service picks 6 directory servers at random to publish their descriptor to).  How can I tell if this is happening? Can I (temporarily, for debugging purposes) view the descriptors being published to me?  I'm thinking their might be some useful logging if I enable debug logs (but I can't find it)?  Or maybe there is something I can get over the control protocol (but I couldn't find anything obvious in the stem API docs that exposes it)?  Or maybe I could make a code change to log this information (I'm not sure where the code is that receives the announcements)? "
1699,Where can I download .asc public key for Tor Browser?,"From where I can download the .asc public key for Tor Browser? I don't want to add the key using gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org because I read a note on Github and that advises high-risk users to stop using the keyserver network immediately.  Where I can find .asc public key ? "

1701,How do I use the Tor Browser for Android without Tor?,I use the Tor Browser for Android and it always takes long at startup since it has to start the Tor daemon first and I don't want to wait that long so I'd rather just disable the Tor daemon and configure it to use the already running Orbot.  How would I do this? It's easy on desktop but I have no idea on android. 
1702,How to become a tor guard node?,"From a little bit of research, I found that anyone can be any node other than a guard node. Why is that so? On some forums they say stable uptime for a few weeks is required, but is there a minimum requirement? "
1703,"Are Tor network nodes/relays proxies? If not, what is the difference?","I would like to know if there is any difference between the concept of ""proxy"" and the nodes (also known as relays) that make up the Tor network.

1704,How do I specify Tor use a single exit node that I specify (Tails user)?,"Complete computer/Tor/Tails noob here.  I want to use Tor (via Tails OS) using only one specific exit node. Can someone please provide detailed directions on how to do this? My understanding is that you would specify the exit node (with its fingerprint?) you want in the torrc file. However, it's read only and I haven't been able to figure out how to write to it after doing a lot of troubleshooting. I know I need to set up a password when booting Tails and I might have to change permissions or make the changes from a command prompt, but no idea how to actually do this or what kind of code to use.  Note: I use Tails/Tor for basic privacy reasons. I've heard specifying using one exit node in this way may reduce anonymity a bit? As long as it wouldn't cause major failure that should be fine for my purposes. "
1705,FIN ACK or RST ACK packet leak,"I want to build a Anonymizing Middlebox. Are the warnings about the FIN ACK or RST ACK packet leak still valid? I tried to reproduce the leak, contacting on of my servers on the internet. I placed tcpdump on several interfaces. I tried to shut down tor, then wait 100 seconds and then send the s.close(), I tried to close the connection from the server side, wait 100 secs and s.close(). No packets from my clear web IP was send. So I'm guessing the leak is fixed and its only a warning for old machines? Or a warning for other scenarios than the middlebox?  Thanks  Peter  "
1706,How Do I Wipe Tails Free Space?,"Can Tails get a virus?  I was and still am using tails.

Update 17 August 2019  Now every time I use Tails I get a message telling me I need to wipe the free space. There is a security issue that can expose your, and other users real location and real IP address. When I found the wipe free space, it said You need a password from a Tails administrator to preform this operation. So how do I contact a Tails admin to get the password?

1707,The beginnings of Onion Routing: I need an explanation about this 1996 chart,"The graph above comes from the document ""HIding Router Information"", used to formally present the concept of 'Onion Routing' at a convention in Cambridge in 1996.   I am analysing this graph for university research and have a number of questions:   At the dawn of 'Onion Routing', was the layered encryption similar to the one Tor uses today, or has there been any substantial change? In this graph, is the information between the client (Initiator Machine) and the first node (W) encrypted, or is it the first node that encrypts the information? Who currently initiates layered encryption on the Tor network, the first node, or Tor Browser from the client device? The graph says that the first node (W) is controlled by ""Secure Site"". I have read the document ""Hiding Router Information"" and I am not sure what ""Secure Site"" is. Does anyone know?   Sorry about the writing. But English is not my mother tongue.   "
1708,Can a onion domain I register be discovered if I don't make it public?,"This tutorial teaches how to register a hidden service and point it to a server's SSH port, so that we can keep this port closed on the open Internet and acess it from inside Tor network.  Of course this seemed odd to me. If for whatever reason it's not secure to let port 22 open on Internet, why'd it be so inside Tor? What kind of thing would change security risks?  If I register an onion domain and don't tell it to anybody and if I'm not hacked and this domain is found, can it be found in anyway other way? Is it certain to say that nobody will discover it if not by my telling or stealing directly from me?  Also, is Tor hidden services aimed at reducing security risks? Isn't it aimed at anonymously serve contents and services in a way that an adversary wouldn't know where our service/content is hosted?  Anyway, if it's indeed a security good practice, or at least if it doesn't increase risks, since I alrdy use Tor outside home, I'd like to make some of my stuff available for me only. "

1715,Tor usage in North Korea as a foreigner,I'd like to ask your opinion on whether it's a good idea or not to use the TAILS operating system (which comes with Tor buit in) while on my trip as a tourist to North Korea. The tour organizer says it's possible to access the Internet in North Korea if you buy a SIM card which is sold only to foreigners.   I intend to bring my own laptop and a USB stick from which i will boot the TAILS OS. I absolutely do not intend to perform any activities deemed as illegal or defamatory by the North Korean authorities. I just want to use TAILS + Tor for extra anonymity while browsing the Internet.  Do you think it's risky and it would seem suspicious if my USB stick is inspected and they find out TAILS on it? Do you know of any cases where foreigners successfully accessed Tor from North Korea and would you recommend its usage while in that country? 
1716,Why is my Tor bridge relay not getting any traffic?,"I used to run a Tor bridge on Windows at home, where I have a 300/150 Mbps ISP. This Windows has memory leak and crashes after some hours, ad I believe that was making my bridge never get traffic.  A few weeks ago I moved it to a Ubuntu server, also at home. I use uptimerobot.com to monitor if its port is reachable from outside and healthchecks.io to monitor if traffic entering from its local SOCKS port is reaching check.torproject.org. It's always up and reachable.  But nyx reports it's rarely getting any traffic, and its bandwidth never surpasses 1KB/s. Its log heartbeat reports very little download and upload and always claims to has seen 0 unique clients. But how come, if my healthchecks.io monitor's curl call uses it every few minutes?  metrics.torproject.org reports correct dates and uptime. Advertised Bandwidth is 58KB/s, way above what nyx reports. Flags are Fast, Running, V2Dir, Valid.  What might be wrong? Or is it normal for a Tor bridge relay be this idle?

1721,My Tor Download Speed is Awful,"I'm using tor browser version ""tor-browser-linux64-6.0.7"" in ubuntu14.4. But its speed is awful. In addition while it's downloading a file, it uses a great amount of my Internet traffic compared to the size of the file. Similarly, while opening a website, it consumes much Internet traffic, compared to the traffic needed for that website to be opened without Tor. Since Tor is censored in my country, in answer to question  Does your Internet Service Provider (ISP) block or otherwise censor connections to the Tor Network?  I checked Yes option, and it uses obfs4 as the bridge to connect to Tor. Any other settings of my Tor are configured to their defaults.  Is there any way to speed up my Tor?

1729,"Hidden services : clear text, or not, at the rendez-vous point?","Most common descriptions, including nice looking graphics, of the communication with Tor hidden services are framed in terms of high-level ""Tor circuits"" which obscure rather than help understand the underlying mechanisms, in this questioner's naive opinion. In this question instead let's please focus on the contents of TCP/IP packets exchanged :  Assume Tor-user retrieving some clear text file, hello.text, from server qw…rty.onion, using some unencrypted protocol over TCP, say, the HTTP. Let's peek - like, with that ethereal thing - at the data packets which are part of this transfer along the whole path (excluding the end-points). Are the contents retrievable in the clear anywhere, in particular, at the ""rendez-vous"" point ? Or does Tor ""onion"" layered  encryption somehow apply over the whole (2 ""circuits"") path ? Please explain...  Edited after suggestion by C.I. that this may be a duplicate. I do not think so. The other question was about encryption of requested hidden service URIs, this is about the encryption of contents. Also, the other question said : ""I understand that all of the communication between a client and a hidden service (.onion) takes place within the Tor network and is therefore end-to-end encrypted."" - but this is exactly what is in doubt with this here question : are data really encrypted end-to-end by the onion protocol (that would be six-level deep onion encryption) ? Or rather are they decrypted (in the clear) in the middle, at the junction point (rendez-vous), before being reinjected, reencrypted for the other ""circuit"" (3 level deep encryption)  ? "

1734,Can I prevent Tor from building single-hop circuits?,"Despite the manual's declared defaults [below], Onion Circuits shows single hop circuits being ""Built"" by Tor. So I have edited my torrc to specifically include ExcludeSingleHopRelays 1 and AllowSingleHopCircuits 0. Yet Onion Circuits still shows them being ""Built"".  Careful observation of the (often four?) initial one-hop circuits that are built at Tails boot (presumably used to ""build consensus"" as to which of them will continue on to be my ""guard"" for that session) tells me that the one-hop circuits that Tor will still build later in that particular session ARE from those initial four [at least the ones where I've noticed a later one-hop].  So I guess I can see why Tor builds those initially. While I understand that my IP is known to my ""guard"", why do those other potential candidates check in again later, and build one-hop circuits?  I am using Tails 2.9.1, and the torrc file at etc/tor/torrc. Other edits to that file function.  The manual states:     ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0|1      This option controls whether circuits built by Tor will include relays with the AllowSingleHopExits flag set to true. If ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set to 0, these relays will be included. Note that these relays might be at higher risk of being seized or observed, so they are not normally included. Also note that relatively few clients turn off this option, so using these relays might make your client stand out. (Default: 1)      AllowSingleHopCircuits 0|1      When this option is set, the attached Tor controller can use relays that have the AllowSingleHopExits option turned on to build one-hop Tor connections. (Default: 0)   [I have not specifcally set the SERVER OPTION AllowSingleHopExits 0|1 to 0, (which is its default anyways), because I am not running a server.]  "

And I could probably hack together a conky profile to display my actual time.  Where can I find documentation on the tor daemon timezone stuff? Any advise or documentation would be helpful.  Many thanks!  EDIT: oh! would changing my timezone negatively effect my VPN usage? I usually connect to VPN first, then use tor.

1756,"I want to use a private obfs4 tor bridge, without tor","I got my own server somewhere out there in the free internet, and I would like to connect to it via obfs4 and use it as proxy to circumvent local censorship. As far as I know, obfs4 requires a tor bridge.

But actually, I do not need the ""Tor"" part of it ... I trust my server, and I would prefer higher speed and no restrictions on commercial servers because of a tor ip address.  Do I have to recompile the source to allow single SingleHop Connections? How am I supposed to use obfs4 standalone?  edit: Can I use it, by just having a second server (maybe even a virtual machine) and forward the tor traffic through a ""private tor network""?

1758,VPN over Tor Firewall Config,"I'm looking for some help with accessing my VPN over tor.  A little background..  I have a router at home that I can connect to which routes all of my traffic over tor.  The router uses port 9030.  My VPN is hosted on DigitalOcean.  Using OpenVPN on an Ubuntu 14.04 droplet.  I'm using tunnelblick to access my VPN. I'm also using uncomplicated firewall (ufw) on my VPN on DigitalOcean.  Here's the issue; I've tried opening port 9030, 9040, 9001 etc. on my firewall for my VPN but tunnelblick's status just says ""Waiting for authorization from server"" and never gets any response back.  I think it's my firewall but when I checked the firewall logs I can never find the exit node IP that connects to the VPN.    Any ideas on what to check for in configuration files (in OpenVPN config, tunnelblick config etc.) would be very helpful.  Thanks  EDIT:  Following are my config files and torrc  torrc for Onion Pi [website]torrc for DigitalOcean VPN [website]UPDATE 2: This is what tunnelblick tells me when I try to connect to the VPN from my Onion Pi Access Point.  I changed the client and server config to allow for TCP connections and updated the firewall to allow tcp connections on port 9001.  I also ran the three commands in the terminal.  Getting closer I think.   "

1760,Tor is only assigning circuits from a very limited subset of exit nodes,"I am researching Tor, and as part of my research I was curious how many distinct exit relays a real-world client would include in building circuits. For my purposes, I am only interested in US exit nodes.  I found this project: [website]                          &lt;-&gt; Polipo 1 &lt;-socks-&gt; Tor Proxy 1 Client &lt;-http-&gt;  HAproxy  &lt;-&gt; Polipo 2 &lt;-socks-&gt; Tor Proxy 2                           &lt;-&gt; Polipo n &lt;-socks-&gt; Tor Proxy n   I modified the Tor arguments in order to maximize the diversity of exit nodes:  /usr/sbin/tor     --SocksPort {PORT}      # Allow creating new circuits after 30 seconds     --NewCircuitPeriod 30      # Never reuse a circuit older than 120 seconds     --MaxCircuitDirtiness 120      # Only use exit nodes in the US     --ExitNodes {us}      # Do not operate an exit relay     --ExitRelay 0      # Allow exit nodes not in the consensus     --RefuseUnknownExits 0      # Operate in client mode only     --ClientOnly 1      # Interpret the above ExitNodes argument strictly (nly US)     --StrictNodes 1      # Allow exit nodes supporting single hop circuits (idk if this does anything)     --AllowSingleHopCircuits 1      --DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/10011     --PidFile /var/run/tor/10011.pid     --Log warn syslog     --RunAsDaemon 1   The test:   Start the rotating proxy with 100 tor backends Repeatedly request ipinfo.io/json through the rotating proxy, log the IP address Sort the resulting file by unique IP addresses   Result after 30 minutes:   1581 total requests 66 unique IP addresses   Checking the haproxy stats page confirms that requests are being load balanced across all 100 tor instances.  Given that there are 500+ unique exit relays in the USA, I would expect far more unique IP addresses.   Why are there only 66 unique IP addresses? It appears that Tor is not rebuilding circuits as often as it should be, according to the arguments. Or it is rebuilding circuits, but keeping the same exit nodes.  Could it be because polipo is keeping a persistent socks connection?  EDIT: UPDATE  I made some improvements and am now seeing better performance. I am still curious if I'm missing anything.  Improvements I made:   polipo was caching the ipinfo.io requests for each proxy, which obviously makes it hard to test if the IP is changing... I fixed this by adding ipinfo.io to /etc/polipo/uncachable and doing all further tests on my own test server that explicitly forces clients to NOT cache responses I enabled the control port on each tor instance so that the daemonized docker script can periodically force a circuit change by sending the newnym signal to the control port ) via [website]Here are the new args:  ""--NewCircuitPeriod 15"", ""--MaxCircuitDirtiness 15"", ""--NumEntryGuards 8"", ""--CircuitBuildTimeout 5"", ""--ExitNodes {us}"", ""--ExitRelay 0"", ""--RefuseUnknownExits 0"", ""--ClientOnly 1"", ""--StrictNodes 1"", ""--AllowSingleHopCircuits 1"",   So far the test has sent 175 requests, with 61 unique IPs... far better than before, in terms of percentages. We'll see. "
1761,Does Tor block network administrators from determining sites accessed/data downloaded?,"If I am on a network in which the admins monitor sites accessed and possibly data downloaded; can I be confident that Tor would block them from doing this? Are there any exceptions - for example if there are too few people using Tor on the network, or can Tor be blocked without me being able to tell? (note they don't have the right to stop me having Tor on my computer)  I understand from research that there is no way I can actually stop someone from figuring out I am using Tor.  Thanks for any answers on this - I have been researching this stuff but don't understand all the technical details involved.  Also, if there are answers to this which are bad for my privacy but have a solution I can install, that would be highly appreciated.  Note - have Tor browser 5.5.3 for Windows installed, without anything else added on top (i.e. using standard version from installation) "
1762,Sniff Tor onions address from a relay,"Currently working on a Tor study, I would have a question regarding the tor hidden services.  I read lot of technicals papers to better understand the tor working on this point, like these good articles: The Tor dark net: [website]Content and popularity analysis of Tor hidden services: [website]But I couldn't get a clear answer to my interogations.  So the question is simple, I would like to know if it's possible, from a relay node, to sniff the traffic to get the onions address accessed through this node ?  In this case, the traffic is fully end to end encrypted, but is it only the data that are encrypted, or the onions address also ? For me, the onion address is a metadata, and not usefull information, so maybe it's not encrypted and we could get these metadatas ?  Thanks in advance for your explanations. "
1763,How does a tor node knows that the next hop is a node and not the final destination?,I was reading [website]In the normal tcp/ip packet you have source address and destination address. How can TOR packets know that they did not reached their destination and it's not only another hop on the chain? Does the packet has any type of TCP options like the TCP/IP packet does? 
1764,Circuit failed to establish,"I'm trying to build my own circuits using stem:  These are three different error messages I get from time to time:   Circuit failed to be created: DESTROYED Circuit failed to be created: TIMEOUT Unable to reach  ((7, 'Failed to receive SOCKS5 connect request ack.'))   Can someone explain what do these three error messages mean? (Plus when I try to built that same circuit again I get the error sometimes and sometimes it builds up?) Is there congestion on the network? / Or is there some other reason? "
1765,Security Risk or Not?,"Given the server foot-printing that MIT has recently discovered, and the fact that we know that they have been found to be in cahoots with at least one intelligence service (i.e. The FBI) Whats to say then that they aren't ongoing in their escapades? And further, given MIT's methodology of rogue nodes, whats to say that several intel services of various countries don't act in concert, providing part of the necessary rogue nodes in order to pull a sibyl / traffic confirmation attack, or any other theoretical attacks, for that matter, by simply sharing information, thus allowing the rogue nodes to appear less suspicious? and yet Tor doesn't appear to have any defense against this sort of thing. It would seem to me that the best thing to do would to be to block government agencies from using Tor all together, but yet this may be interpreted as some to go against Tor's anti-censorship mission.What do you think about this? Is Tor doing enough to protect it's users, or does it seem the whole concept needs to be overhauled? "
1766,Why does Tails use an insecure memory wiping process,"When I shutdown Tails, various standard messages appear including the statement that if the system does not power-off, then it is likely that the memory wiping process has failed. More curiously, I notice that something along the following lines appears: ""Warning, memory wipe is insecure (using 0x00)"".  I can understand why overwriting memory with 0x00 might be considered insecure ... but if it is insecure, why do it? Why is Tails not overwriting the memory using random bytes? "
1767,Send emails to external addresses,"I would want to send emails to external addresses from an external web site (for example contact@mywebsite.com or .org etc) from my mail2tor account, but I received the next e-mail:     Subject:   Delayed Mail (still being retried) From:   ""Mail Delivery   System""  Date:   Wed, March 23, 2016 8:39   am To:   myaccount@mail2tor.com Priority:   Normal      This is the mail system at host mail.mail2tor.com.      #      THIS IS A WARNING ONLY.

I would know if exist any solution on this? Or as I can to do to send emails in anonymously and security? I thought that I can to use a VPN and use a normal services from send emails: Yahoo, Gmail, Microsoft account, etc, but using a VPN. Do you know a VPN to use with tor browser in windows? I found the IPVanish VPN, but I would have to pay to use it, and I haven't money. On the other way, I read in other post, that if I received a response, this could to be in the spam folder, but, I cannot to see the spam folder in mail2tor.

1769,Is it possible to keep a list of IPs/Websites which I don't want to use Tor to connect to?,"I am new to the Tor world, and I really like the idea of it!  But now I encountered some issue when I applied the ""Torify"" to my own python program   torify my_python_program   As stated in the URL:[website]This would make every requests made within my program go through Tor network.  This problem is that my python program would access various different websites, and one of them is even in the LAN.  By default, Tor will reject access to local addresses, and therefore I'll need to use its public IP/DNS. But What I really want is that Tor would just redirect the requests to the normal un-torified network.  Is this even possible with the current Tor implementation?  I am hoping there is some config I can change to keep a list of IPs that I want to access without Tor? "
1770,port-reachability issues; socket proxies,"I tried hooking Tor up to a socket proxy. But it won't let me use it. It says ""Tor is unable to work in this browser."" What do I do about this? It originally worked. Any thoughts? Is this a problem with Vidalia?  Any thoughts? "
1771,How to chain proxy after Tor,"How can I use a proxy after Tor?

1772,"When I use Tor, occasionally I get two different IP address simultaneously",When I use Tor circuit during last few months I use ip-check.info site to verify my IP address in addition to check.torproject.org site. What I have noticed is that occasionally I get two IP addresses simultaneously. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced when I use bridges to connect to Tor. I have documented an example of this phenomenon. Below please find an example:   check.torproject.org showed that my IP Address appear to be 185.2.138.125 ip-check.info showed that my IP Address is 185.2.138.125  but in addition to that it shows that 46.149.23.63 (FTP) is my address and declares that I am not secure.   Is there something fishy going on. Am I being observed by third party? Is there a MITM? 
1773,Have Tor appear to be a different browser,"I was wondering is there a way to fool websites into thinking that I am using another browser instead of what I'm really using, Tor Browser. Say I wanted example.com to see me connecting to them using IE or Chrome instead of Tor Browser. Is this possible? Maybe using a plugin or something? "
1774,Torrent outside the Tor network,"I have set up a non-exit Tor relay on my Windows 8.1 64 PC.  When I use uTorrent, outside of the Tor network, but on the same pc, a lot of trackers become unreachable, not all of them though, just about 10 or 20%. (Some on the same domain than others that are reachable ; this results in the progress bar of some completed torrents becoming red).  When I shut down Tor, the trackers become reachable again instantly.  What is the problem ? As I am an avid user of uTorrent, this problem could prevent me from continuing my Tor relay.  I have a 100 Mbytes download connection and 50 Mbytes up.  I set up the Tor relay specifying a 1,5 Mbytes connection speed.  My only guess is maybe windows or my router limits the amount of simultaneous connections to my pc or something like that ? "
1775,Detect Tor from a LAN proxy,"I have a quick question I hope has not been asked yet.  Let's assume there is a network such this: there is a pc (let's call it X) which is part of a wide LAN; to connect to the internet, it must go through a proxy which blocks (and logs) connections to forbidden IPs. Now, on the pc X there is Tor; it must use the proxy to work as well, but when it tries to connect the proxy blocks Tor IP; therefore it is set up with bridge relays (got by email, not the public ones). In such a way, the connection to any of the forbidden IPs is successful (the proxy doesn't block the relays IPs).  The question is: even though the PC X is reaching an IP which shouldn't be reached, since the proxy logs ALL traffic, is there a way to know from logs that the PC X is using Tor? What kind of traffic does the proxy see actually? Is the traffic encrypted or something?  Thank you in advance. "
1776,What kind of protection will be: PfSense as Tor Proxy,I will setup gateway machine with 2 NIC: eth0 for WAN and eth1 for LAN. On gateway machine I'll install PfSense and setup Tor Proxy like for example here How to Set Up a Tor Proxy Server on pfSense. Client machine will be Windows.  Is it similar to Whonix Gateway + Workstation?  What kinds of leaks are then possible?  How to improve this setup without changing its parts? 
1777,Is Tor network making any noise to confuse global adversaries?,"Is Tor use any steganography methods to hide connections inside onion routing?  I found this question on security SE: Tor traffic correlation attacks by global adversaries     adversaries (like the NSA) that can see large segments of the Internet   can relatively easily de-anonymize most Tor traffic   Will Guard ( first node ) try to hide next hop from global adversaries ?  E.g. by sending 3 or more similar messages to the next nodes, where only one of them is a real middle-node ( second node ) ?   Is Tor network making any noise to confuse global adversaries ?  I'm talking about timing-attack:  Say, delays on transmissions would help, but would increase latency and aren't currently supported by TOR.

I tried overclocking the Pi, upping the MaxOnionsPending to 250, and reducing the MaxAdvertisedBandwidth to 250KB, and none of those seemed to help.  An email thread I saw speculated that this happens ""when your relay becomes the hidden service directory, or introduction point, for a popular hidden service.""

1784,Custom cryptography for Hidden services,Tor support AES for symmetric cryptography which is fine but for asymmetric cryptography we might prefer something else (I guess now its RSA1024 which is almost broken and proposals are saying to replace it with ECC in the future).   Main question:    Let say Alice have Bob's public key (a better cipher than RSA) so Alice don't need onion address to find Bob's public key first. Is it possible that Bob just advertise his descriptor (introduction points) on HSdirs with this custom cipher and meet Alice or hidden services are limited to what Tor support today?   Detailed questions:   How actually a descriptor look like (encoding) ? is there any format or size limit for descriptor on HSdir? Where descriptors are hosted? Who are HSdirs? Tor relays who donate their disk space for hosting these messages? How Alice find descriptor for Bob from DHT? wiki says truncated SHA1 is not secure (I say full SHA1 is not secure either) but attacker would not be able to impersonate already existing hidden services!

I already saw the hard failover and load balancing properties we could have by running multiple Tor instances with the same hidden service keys.  But still, I have a few questions :   Is there a hard limit of how many hidden services can be ran by a single Tor instance? If not, is there a known formula or number of hidden services beyond which the Tor instance will lose performance even though the server didn't run out of resources? If not, how much memory do we need for each hidden service hosted (inside a Tor instance where other hidden services are hosted as well)?  "

Even web searches just led me back and forth between the bug tracker and Wikipedia, which is rather useless.  While I discovered that the issue I found is already in the bug tracker, it has been there for over a month with no apparent attention paid to it, and was not in any way marked as a security issue.

1792,Do Tor hidden service directories (HSDirs) see the REAL IP of users who visit .onion sites?,"I'm reading here about Tor's 'DNS' resolving mechanisms (for both clearnet and hidden services) .  The mechanism for connecting to a hidden service itself (via a rendezvous point in a 7-hop circuit without the need for an exit node), I am clear on.  But, the step before that is finding out what its 'location' is (or rather, instructions for how to initiate a connection with the hidden service you're looking up), in the first place - Tor's equivalent of DNS.  In the afore-mentioned link, this line greatly bothered me:     Aaron’s client checks the Hidden Service Directory Server to see if the address exist.   After more searching, I found this excellent 2013 research, which states:     A client who would like to retrieve the full HS descriptor will calculate the time based descriptor id and will request it from the   responsible HSDir’s directly.   As for the official Tor HS protocol outline page ([website]  After [first learning about its onion address], the client can initiate connection establishment by downloading the descriptor from the distributed hash table.   This gives the impression of a decentralized distribution of descriptor information like Freenet, but maybe it is only distributed between HSDirs and that still says nothing of whether real IPs are linked to descriptor lookups or not.  So what are the facts here?  Is there any part of the process in which the original, non-Tor IP address of a Tor user, directly contacts a Tor HSDir (or another node for that matter), for the purpose of a direct request and retrieval of the descriptor of a given .onion address? If not, then which node in the chain does the HSDir see for that request, and is the original client's IP obfuscated to that node which has to know the onion address themselves?  If yes, this would be an extremely serious breach of anonymity for the entire Tor network. It is one thing to know virtually every .onion site in existence by operating a HSDir (under the current code anyway); it is another to know all the real IP addresses of those who visit them.  It would be ironic if Tor protected the IP addresses of users on clearnet by having DNS requests performed by the same IP as is doing the browsing (i.e. the Tor exit node), but not for hidden services themselves. If so, it would make sense to apply the same 'layered encryption' onion mechanism to descriptor requests also. (So have the exit node, or the same node as will be the rendezvous, make them.)  And on a related note, are the request (and response) packets between the client and the HSDir encrypted (similarly to HTTPS or DNSCrypt), or are the requests transported as plaintext directly to the HSDir server and thus readable by the user's ISP, global wiretapping adversaries and all other usual MITM suspects?

In this case the hiddenservice19 and it displays my index.html file just fine.  Why hiddenservice18 does not work??

1802,Blocked Tor exit nodes,"I know of several services that block traffic from Tor exit nodes including, as of a couple of months ago, the Australian Legal Information Institute. It's a sad state of affairs given that there are people whose countries block their access to information about the law of other nations and who try to use Tor to circumvent censorship, now only to find themselves stymied by the host that they are trying to reach.  I am familiar with the development by Tor researchers of means of circumventing censorship and giving access to Tor guards. Is there any similar development relating to the exit nodes? For example, one could envisage a changing series of hosts (a kind of ""exit bridge"" similar to existing bridges) that only accepted traffic from Tor exit nodes ... before passing the traffic on to intended sites.  Am I foolishly hopeful, or is the concept either (i) dead in the water for reasons that I can't envisage, or (ii) already developed?  "

1804,"Tor no longer secure, but can this be fixed?","In a recent episode of a podcast called Security Now (#493: Tor: Not so Anonymous), they claimed that traffic can be delayed in unique ways to identify which client IP address on one side of the Tor onion is communicating with which server IP on the other side. So basically they insert gaps in the data transfers and look for gaps going to client IPs. Somehow or other Cisco's Netflow feature is involved.  Here's an idea:  To solve this deanonymization problem, why not have Tor clients simply always be uploading and downloading packets at a steady beat e.g. every 10 milliseconds, regardless of whether any meaningful data is really being sent? Of course the exit node would have to play along with this charade, accepting and sending packets even if there is no need. The tor process running on the client would have to be able to drop incoming ""dummy"" packets, as well as send them; same for the exit node's tor process.  Would this fix the Tor deanonymization problem? "
1805,Uniqueness of your PC comparing Tor vs JonDo,"When checking my PC on Panopticlick, I could see that even using Tor does not make my PC more anonymous...  ...using JonDo, however, and visiting Panopticlick, my PC was less identifiably unique than when using Tor.  JonDo mentions things like using different fonts.  Is it possible for Tor to make similar changes so that your PC is less identifiable?  I'm not a computer geek, so maybe I'm getting something wrong here?  P.S. I tagged this post with ""tag"" because I was not allowed to use relevant tags, like JonDo, Uniqueness, Identifiable, Fonts etc.  ==================================================================================  re  two answers so far:  ""Try JonDoFox with Tor""? > Meaning? In what way? They're two separate browsers.  ""Tor Browser also erases browser uniqueness, but maybe it leaks more than JonDoFox"" > My test was using each browser at Panopticlick. Tor's access showed that my PC was unique. Following the advice in the 2nd reply, below, I change a font and had my anonymity marginally improved. JonDo's access significantly improved my identifiability...i.e. more computers like mine when accessing that site. Roya's link to JonDo test is where I got info re fonts from beforehand. It mentioned choosing Arial, Sans serif and Helvetica (from memory) as ones to choose. Only see Arial though in settings.  As stated, I'm not tech minded. Not sure how Tor's/JonDo's safety re IP address hangs with issue of how identifiable your PC is. In other words, if your IP address is not your own, is that protection enough? What if a site can see that you have a unique computer? What about MAC idenitifiablity? "

BUT there's a recurrent problem... An exit node hosted by Digital Ocean, that is firstly identified as from ""NL"", yet being actually from New York City, keeps coming back sporadically as the exit node.  I have been reinstalling Tor and checking the signatures... no change. How the hell can ""NL"" exit nodes still pass through when they've been blocked already, and only ""RU"" exit nodes supposed to pass?

1812,Accessing Tor hidden services over a single hop circuit,"I will presage the expected warnings before posting my question: I fully understand the security risks involved using single hops, however, with regards to my goals I have zero need for anonymity.  I am interested in archiving the contents of several Tor hidden services e.g. discussion forums, and am not intent on doing anything that might demand privacy. As a consequence, my interest is having a high bandwidth connection to these websites, with no need to remain anonymous.  I understand that one may re-compile Tor to create single hop circuits e.g. How to decrease number of Tor hops?  I also understand that while one may wish to construct a single hop circuit, very few relays have the single hop exit option enabled.   My questions are two-fold.  1. Can Tor hidden services detect that a client is using just a single hop, and reject the connection? I have been advised by someone that this does occur, but I am unable to find anything that indicates that this indeed the case.   2. Is the below configuration possible?   Re-compile Tor to allow for single hops. Using a second instance of Tor, create a relay allowing single hop exits. Configure the re-compiled Tor to use this exit relay  "

Heartbeat: Tor's uptime is 5 days 0:00 hours, with 483 circuits open. I've sent 159.72 GB and received 157.45 GB.   Does this mean I have sent that much data total since I started the relay a few days ago, or does that mean that from the time in the first heartbeat I posted, to the time in the second heartbeat I posted, I have sent 31 GB of data?  Basically, have I sent a total of 159.75 GB and received 157.45 GB of data since the relay first started? Or was that how much data I sent and received since the last heartbeat in a 6 hour period?

But lately I've heard a few mentions (mainly here and there in the tor-talk and tor-dev lists) that it might actually be hurtful to anonymity.  So, does anyone have any input on this? Should I be running a Tor instance separate from my relay instead? "

1819,Can I operate a relay and Bridge on same computer?,After ironing out several buggy problems with my Tor relay it's now been in operation for almost sixty days without problems (almost). Have one irritant left but it's not of to much concern.  System - Ubuntu 16.4 LTS  Question - Is it possible to run a bridge on the same computer with the relay?  Guesses - 1. a second version of tor would have to be in operation?           2. Is it possible to share ports OR do I have to open two new ports along with the ports currently in operation?  Question - is there a link for Nyx that works with Ubuntu? Can't seem to find one.  Thanks for any help! Adri

1825,Signal NEWNYM vs Stream isolation,"Resources. This answer explains well what happens at NEWNYM request, and I also dig into the code, yet my lack of knowledge on low level networking prevents me to make a proper design decision if stream isolation is enough for me or not.      Stream Isolation. By stream isolation I mean creating new TCP connection with uname/pwd authentication to Tor's Socks5 proxy to a remote hidden service.    Context. I am working a Bitcoin privacy technology that depends on a user to have two separate identity to the server (Alice and Bob). So the server must not be able to figure out there is a connection between Alice and Bob.  Alternatives.   Right now, whenever a change happens between Alice and Bob I send a NEWNYM signal to Tor, dispose all connections and build new one. This of course slow, because Tor rate limits NEWNYM requests for a few seconds and the existing connections are disposed, then new ones are built. I could create a two connections with isolated streams for Alice and Bob and conduct the communication there. This would be super fast, but I am not sure if it's sufficient. Or I could use some hybrid model, where I create two stream isolated connections for Alice and Bob, just like in point 2, however whenever an identity change happens I send a NEWNYM or CLEARDNSCACHE? signal to Tor and don't dispose the existing connections. I'm not sure this makes sense though.   Question. Can the server somehow learn the connection between Alice and Bob in 1. 2. and 3. alternative? "
1826,Clearing the client side DNS cache provides privacy improvement?,"Context. In my quest on figuring out if I must use NEWNYM signal or stream isolation is enough for me I dig into the code and narrowed down the possible privacy improvements that NEWNYM can bring over simple stream isolation, so I can ask more specific questions. One of it is clearing the client side DNS cache.    Goal. My goal is to be able to talk with a server with two different identity, without the server, learning let's say Alice and Bob are the same user. Where the server is a hidden service.    What I know. This answer explains one thing that Tor does for NEWNYM request:       src/or/addressmap.c:addressmap_clear_transient this clears the client-side DNS cache, as mentioned in the spec (any mapping between address and IP)   Looking into the code CLEARDNSCACHE signal does exactly this, it calls the same addressmap_clear_transient() method.  Question. Is there a risk the server can learn the connection between Alice and Bob without clearing the client side DNS cache? If so, then how much of this risk is?  For reference I also drop the code here, its comments may be useful:  /** Remove all entries from the addressmap that are set to expire, ever. */ void addressmap_clear_transient(void) {   addressmap_get_mappings(NULL, 2, TIME_MAX, 0); }   And finally:    /** Iterate over all address mappings which have expiry times between  * min_expires and max_expires, inclusive.

1828,Why Tor doesn't support UDP?,Tor relays reject UDP packets except DNS requests. What is the technical reason behind that UDP is not routed through Tor circuit? Are there limitations with UDP protocol that it cannot be routed through Tor? Is there a problem with implementation design of Tor that it cannot support UDP?  Is UDP being connectionless protocol a problem? If this is a problem it cannot support UDP then how DNS requests are supported?

Which means it should be possible to write a program to request repeatedly and get list of all bridges in the network and thus be able to add all of them to the block list. So how exactly this is prevented?  
1846,TOR Hidden Service: IP anonymity,"Suppose that a Tor client wants to access a certain hidden service. According to the protocol, instead of submitting a request directly to the server IP (which is hidden[1][2]), this client submit a request via a series of relays.   However, at some point, there will be a final relay in charge of delivering the client's message specifically to the server running the hidden service. In order to do so, this final relay must know the IP of this hidden server, otherwise the current internet infrastructure cannot deliver the message.  If the aforementioned steps are indeed correct, this means that in order to host a website using TOR Hidden Service you must reveal the IP address to a final relay. Therefore, Tor network does not hide the IP address of hidden services.  How to reconcile that? Am I missing something?  &nbsp;    [1]: ""TOR Hidden Service allows you to host a website, without revealing where the website is, and hence protects the identity of the publisher/webmaster."", WikiBooks  [2]: ""The Tor network hides the IP address of hidden services, instead using onion addresses and public keys to keep the real location hidden."", Privay.net "

1860,What encryption is actually used by tor circuits?,"I'm trying to determine what encryption (asymmetric and symmetric) Tor actually uses these days for client circuits.  I've read the changelogs and only seem to see nebulous statements about having a ciphersuite that more closely matches what Firefox uses, but no actual details as to what that might be.  Enabling the highest level of logging in my Tor client doesn't reveal anything either.  I also see mentions of elliptic curve and chacha20 support, but can't tell if that is being used in practice.  Other changelog entries suggest that AES256 is favored over AES128.  So, my question is assuming I'm using the most recent version of the Tor client, what asymmetric encryption algorithm is used, and what symmetric encryption algorithm is used?  Is it x25519 for key exchange and AES256 for the symmetric cipher, for example?  Thank you! "

1862,"Run TOR relay with ipv6 only (""DualStack Lite"")","I am a unfortunate customer of a provider that uses a so-called DualStack Lite (I can't post more than two URLs - check Wikipedia for detailed information on DualStack Lite). Short: My router can't be reached via ipv4 easily. After I've switched to the new provider (I didn't realize the consequences) my TOR relay quit working (it's still configured with ipv4-ports only, so it's clear why it can't work). This howto says that it's not yet possible to run a ipv6-only TOR relay.   I understand that I can't run the relay with the DualStack Lite natively (as opposed to the outlined workaround below) - is that correct? Is it possible to use a service like this to work around the limitations and run a TOR relay?   I assume that the answer to the latter question will be no because - as I understand - my relay registers itself at some TOR database with an outgoing ipv4 address and the configured ipv4 ports. If using a ipv4 -> ipv6 portmapper, a specific URL is used - one the TOR relay doesn't know about. Thus I think it's not possible for other TOR clients/relays to connect to my TOR relay.  However, if the answer to the latter question indeed is yes, could someone provide some howto or more detailed information about how to configure that (I didn't find anyting yet)?  "

1865,"Tor Relay questions (equipment, router hardware, DSL)","I would like to contribute to the cause by running a Tor Relay. After spending the last week researching, I am still unable to answer the following questions:   What are the MINIMUM COMPUTER requirements? May I run the relay on an older MacBook Pro? How about an older iMac? Do I need something high-end ([tex])? What are the PREFERRED ROUTER requirements? Do I need to upgrade from my generic ISP router, or should I purchase something more specific to support the cause? I live in the boon-docks and must connect to the Internet through DSL with the only cable/telephone company that services my area. Will a Tor Relay work with DSL service? I do not have the software/hardware expertise to do this, but willing to donate equipment and time to help. Is there someone within the Tor community that can help me get things up and running?  "
1866,What are security implications of keeping same tor bridges versus rotating?,If a set of obfs4 is working fine should they be kept indefinitely as long as they're still working? How would periodically getting a new set of bridges improve security? Potentially compromise security? Thank you.  
1867,I am interested in using tor on a Arm based processor laptop is there a way to do this?,Could I use QEMU on my Arm processor based laptop and put tails inside QEMU. Will this setup work? How do I do this?  Is there any other way I can use tor on Arm based processor? 
1868,Can I add hidden services to an existing traditional web server?,"I have several virtual hosts on traditional Nginx and Apache servers. They listen on ports 80 &amp; 443. I would like to also make those sites available as hidden services (e.g. ""This site is also available at XYZ.onion"" in the footer) by installing Tor on those same servers.  Is there a practical way to do this? Put differently, does serving Tor hidden services require a separate server or can it be used in tandem with a traditional LAMP server? "
1869,How often does a Tor change rendezvous point with hidden service?,"I understand how a Tor client connects to a hidden service, but can anyone explain to me how long a rendezvous point is used?  According to numbers  10-16 on this post on Tor stack exchange, the client determines the rendezvous point and sends an ""introduce message"" to the hidden service, containing the information of the rendezvous point and a one-time-secret/cookie request, via one of the hidden services introductory points, in order for the hidden service to know how to communicate with the client. The hidden service then sends the one-time-secret/cookie to the rendezvous point, where the rendezvous point forwards it to the client. The client is then informed that a connection is established.   Now this is where I was confused, number 16 states:      ""Client and hidden service talk to each other over this rendezvous   point. All traffic is end-to-end encrypted and the rendezvous point   just relays it back and forth. Note that each of them, client and   hidden service, build a circuit to the rendezvous point; at three hops   per circuit this makes six hops in total.""   I understand this, I am simply wondering how often this changes.    Do you change rendezvous points and repeat this whole process everytime you switch to a different page, even on the same hidden service?  Do you use the same rendezvous point the whole time you are using the hidden service, even when you switch to a different page on that hidden service, and only change rendezvous point and repeat this proccess when you leave the site and come back?  Or does none of this change until you completely shut down the Tor browser and re-open it? Is the same rendezvous point used for every hidden service you visit in a given browsing session until you restart Tor?  "

1871,Tor's encryption confusion and client to first node encryption,"From what I've read the onion routing process goes like this:   The client encrypts its traffic to the destination server and sends it to the first node (encrypted); The fird node encrypts it again and then sends it to the seconds node; And so on until the decryption process starts (the amount of nodes the traffic goes through and the layers of encryption can vary. i think.) The last node completely decrypts the traffic and sends it to the destination server unencrypted The server encrypts its response to the client and sends it to a node and the cycle of encryption and decryption starts again, just like the client did in the beginning The client receives the traffic.   My questions are:   Does the server's response reach the client encrypted or unencrypted? Is the cycle exactly the same for the client's request as it is for the server's response?  1.1 If unencrypted, wouldn't my ISP or anyone else be able to spy on me? Why does the traffic on the last node go to the destination server fully unencrypted? What prevents it from being encrypted?   Thanks "
1872,How does selecting new guard relays work?,I've been told guards are selected when a client first connects to the Tor network and used until they disappear.  What constitutes disappearing? Do all guards need to disappear (and then the whole set is replaced) or just one (and only that one is replaced)?  Would it be possible to get selected as a target's guard by DoS'ing random guards until you get chosen? 
1873,Bridge to improve anonymity,"Tor official page says “Tor  fails when the attacker can see both ends of the communications channel.”  Then,setting up a bridge on pc A and using it myself as entry node on pc B (with vpn to change ip)can make this attack impossible? (Because attacker can never be the entry node in this case.)  Or, asking reliable friends to be the bridge each other is also effective to improve anonymity? "
1874,Testing my own relay without being evil to the network,"I have implemented some additionnal functionnality to my Tor relay such as more bandwith control than what is possible with the torrc configuration file.  Howewer, I would like to try it because this one isn't stable and could crash due to some errors in my code. I firstly thought about bridge, which is nothing more than a private entry node, but it cannot be applied to midde/exit node.  What would be a proper way to test my relay ? How are Tor devs testing their updates ? "
1875,Help with torrc config?,"I’ve tried to configure my file to avoid connecting to nodes in certain countries, but Tor still connects to those countries.  What am I missing?
