0,What is this blob found at the edge of a puddle on a forest logging road?,"Exploring the woods of the Adirondack Mountains, this gelatinous blob was found near the edge of standing water on a logging road. The entire length of this thing is probably just under 10 inches and it seems to be about an inch thick (didn't measure). The road was used about a year ago, maybe more, and has existed for quite a while. The puddle doesn't really drain, so it's there most of spring and whenever there's a lot of rain.    There's not much human activity around this spot. Upstream of it is more forest for many miles. Of course being a logging road and a place where a photo was taken, there is some human influence and potentially petrochemicals introduced.  What could this blob be?   My first guess is poop but that doesn't seem to be the case because from what I've seen with dog poop it gets liquefied and dispersed by rain and water, not turned into globs like this. Beyond that, I have a hard time making any concrete guesses. A mountainous jelly fish? Maybe some kind of bio-chemical reaction from a few different 'ingredients' in the puddle? "
1,Lake Erie / Presque Isle Water Level,I was up at Presque Isle (Erie PA) today and the water level was a foot or more higher than I when I was up there in the summer last year. I kind of surprised as I did not think it would be subject to significant changes in water level.  How much can the height of the lake fluctuate over a year?    What time of the year is usually highest and lowest? 
2,What knot is this that starts off like a taut line hitch but ends differently?,I thought that Les Stroud was about to make a taut line hitch. But at the end he did a couple of things a little different. What is this knot? Does it hold better than a taut line hitch?     
3,Will bobcats climb cacti when not in fear of their lives?,"There are pictures of bobcats climbing on top of really tall cacti, the one story I read says that the reason the bobcat climbed the tree was to get away from a mountian lion who was trying give it a hug eat it.  Would a bobcat climb a cactus if it wasn't being chased by a predator? "
4,How can I help an injured crow fledgling with a hurt leg?,"I found this guy right under my window, huddled in a corner and bleeding a lot (for a crow) from his leg. You can see that the leg is sort of twisted backwards on these two pics, and you can see where he was bleeding.        Me and my family held him down and sprayed antiseptic on his wound and most of his leg, which he didn't mind too much. Over the next two days, he managed to stop bleeding and seemingly recover, becoming much more active and lively. The thing is, he can't fly. But he was constantly hopping on things to try to get outside of the garden (though he didn't fear us, he just wanted to get back to his parents, presumably).       The thing that I'm worried about is whether his family is going to accept him back if we send him out again. We sent him out already once, and a neighbour found him huddled in a corner just like the last time, so he brought him home (though the crows sounded angry at him as he was doing so).  My grandmother disregarded our plan and put him out again in the morning while we were asleep, and the cawing woke me up. What I really need to know quickly so I can make a proper decision (whether to try to bring him back into the garden, which is very much near the nest, or whether to let him take the chances out there) is whether his family is going to abandon him for not being able to fly and for having an injured leg. I am PRETTY SURE (I'm not absolutely 100% sure that it was him but I'm decently sure) I saw a crow feeding him directly with my binoculars. However, I also saw that another fledgling that looked similar was flying.  The question is, if he can't fly and if he has a limp in one leg, will he survive? Will his family teach him how to fly, or will they abandon him for not knowing how to fly yet? The area where we live has a lot of stray cats, so that's the big problem.  Thanks, I hope someone can help me figure out the best decision. The reason we wanted to keep him in the garden a bit more is to feed him and wait until he can learn to fly in a safe environment that cats are more unlikely to enter. "
5,Were elk solely plains animals before the Europeans came?,Someone was telling me that elk were solely plains animals before they were driven to the Rocky Mountains. They mentioned the account of Lewis and Clark and that they said there were no elk in the mountains and only saw them on the plains.   Since Lewis and Clark only went through one section of the west and were not exactly biologists I could see how they might get things wrong. On the flip side they were one of the first to write an account of the west while it was pristine.  So was there evidence of elk in the rocky mountains? Were they really driven off of the plains? 
6,Why is there no Wilderness Area within Grand Canyon National Park?,"This 1998 Draft Wilderness Management Plan proposes to set aside large parts of Grand Canyon National Park as wilderness.  However, despite large areas being declared ""Wild"" in the park backcountry management and wilderness areas in Kaibab National Forest (such as the Kanab Creek Wilderness and the Saddle Mountain Wilderness) and in Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument (such as the Mount Trumbull Wilderness and the Mount Logan Wilderness), no part of Grand Canyon National Park is currently designated as a federal Wilderness area.  This contrasts with Zion National Park, where almost the entire park is part of the Zion Wilderness or the LaVerkin Creek Wilderness.  What happened?  Why is no part of the Grand Canyon declared as a Wilderness Area? "
7,Is altitude tent helpful in preparation for climbing 7000-8000m mountains?,Climbing extremely high mountains requires a long time (weeks together) to acclimatisation to the altitude. Is it possible to reduce this time by adding sleeping in Altitude tent to the preparation trainings? Is altitude tent something worth buying? 
8,Hanging food on the appalachian trail,"While bears are located all along the Appalachian trail, in most sections they are rarely seen. During prime season there is enough use of the trail that hikers are often aware of problematic areas. This is especially true at shelters. Mice, raccoons, and other smaller animals are much more bothersome. My understanding is that the PCT bear hang method is designed to keep bears from getting your food.  Are there modifications that should be made to a PCT hang to prevent rodents and small animals from getting the food?  If you are not worried about bears, but are worried about small animals, how should you hang your food? "
9,How to keep socks from wicking rain off pants into boots,"My wife and I have been very fortunate in our long distance hikes - we've never been rained on except for our last day on the way out. So, while we have rain jackets that we pack, we've never packed rain pants or anything like that. We do have waterproof (Gore-Tex) boots.    Recently we were day hiking in the rain and our pants got so wet that our socks started wicking moisture out of the pants and into our boots. So we need a way to fix this.  It seems like gaiters or rain pants are the two fixes for this. Our pants are quick dry so I'm not as concerned about them getting wet.  Gaiters seem like something we could wear all day if the weather seems iffy (under our regular pants but over the boots and socks) while rain pants would be something we put on when the weather starts to get bad. Is one of these a superior choice? Are there other alternatives we should consider? "
10,Can ocean/saltwater fishing gear be used for freshwater/lake fishing?,"This is one of those instances where I need answers that are written as if you were speaking to a 5 year old. I don't know a whole lot about fishing.  My uncle likes to go fishing on the long island sound mostly but it's getting to be too much of a drive at his age. The majority of fish I remember him catching were porgies and other fish of that size. We're not talking huge fish and his gear reflects that. Rods and spinning reels. Lures, weights, etc.   There are some local lakes, rivers, creeks that have trout stocked by the NJ Fish and Wildlife division, bass and other fish. These are much easier for him to get to but most of his fishing has been in the same area out on a boat. When I think about freshwater fishing I get a picture of someone in waders with a fly fishing rod which would be too much of a shift in gear.  Main fish is large mouth bass and trout from what I can gather.  Can his ocean fishing gear (rods, reels line mainly) be used for trout and bass fishing in lakes, streams and rivers? If so I'm guessing at least the hooks, lures and other stuff that gets tied to the end of the line would need to be different as well as bait. IF this can be done can you make suggestions for a versatile setup to get him started fishing in NJ lakes and streams without getting into fly fishing? "
11,Why does North Cascades National Park get so few visitors?,"Last year I went to Washington state and I visited Mount Rainier National Park, Olympic National Park, and North Cascades National Park.  I enjoyed all three of them.  I just saw a Wikipedia page and was looking at the number of annual visitors for all of the U.S. national parks.  I noticed that Olympic National Park got 3.4 million visitors last year and Mount Rainier got 1.4 million visitors.  I was shocked to see that North Cascades only got 30 thousand visitors.  Why would North Cascades National Park receive so few visitors compared to Olympic and Mount Rainier?  They are all about 2 hours away from Seattle.  Not only that, but North Cascades National Park is free - it does not have an entrance fee, unlike Olympic and Mount Rainier, which makes it even more puzzling.  In fact, North Cascades National Park is the only national park in the contiguous United States that is not on an island to receive fewer than 150,000 visitors last year.  Why is that? "
12,What are the benefits of saving bats?,"I'm fascinated by bats. I love to watch them fly around, although I've never seen more than a few at a time where I live in a suburban area in Massachusetts, Northeastern Unites States.   I'd love to see them in large numbers in their natural habitat, and it seems that Texas is a good choice for that. Texas has a few areas of established bat colonies, the most notable species of which is the Mexican Free-tailed bats. Apparently at certain times of the year there are more than a million of these bats living in a specific region of Texas at the same time. Tourism is high when there's a possibility of seeing them.  In August of 2017, Hurricane Harvey, did almost unprecedented damage to Texas and neighboring states.   Many local conservation groups, scientists and concerned citizens worked hard for months to salvage as much of the habitat and as many bats as possible. I was told that large conservation organizations from all over the world joined with them. Why would they do that?  Devoting so many human and financial resources seems like a lot unless bats are important for reasons other than tourism.    What's so important about bats that conservationists from all over the world want to save them?  "
13,What are the pros and cons of introducing new safety colors for hunting?,"As indicated in Have there been any studies done on how fluorescent pink compares to fluorescent orange?, fluorescent pink is becoming accepted as a new safety color for hunting. Given that we have a color that already works, are there advantages that outweigh the disadvantages of either that would drive this addition? "
14,How many days does it take to reach hiking X miles per day?,"On a thru-hike or section hike, people frequently hike 15-30 miles per day. New hikers are typically encouraged to start at around 8 miles per day, though, and work their way up, to give their bodies time to adapt, and avoid injury.  Obviously the time required to reach 15+ MPD will vary by person, but that's not a very helpful answer for planning resupply points. I haven't been able to find any estimates of how many days it will take the average thru/section hiker to reach X miles per day, though.  I've seen plans for new runners, to start at X miles per day, and work their way up to Y miles per day. Would something similar make sense for backpacking? If so, what would be sensible values?  Here's my rough guess, to illustrate what I mean:   Day 1: 8 miles Day 2: 8 miles Day 3: 10 miles Day 4: 10 miles Day 5: 12 miles Day 6: 12 miles Day 7: Zero day to rest Day 8: 14 miles Day 9: 16 miles Day 10: 16 miles Day 11: 18 miles Day 12: 20 miles Day 13: 22 miles Day 14: Zero day to rest Day X: {previous day + 2 miles, with zeros once a week}   Of course, something like this is just an estimate for planning, and each person would need to adjust it to their specific fitness level, pack weight, trail conditions, etc; and then listen to their body while hiking to know their actual limits. "
15,Minimum safe rappel rope diameters?,"9mm is considered minimum for a vertical rappel with a nylon or polyester kernmantle rope, 6mm with high strength aramid, but what if your rappel isn't vertical? What's the minimum safe rope diameter for rappelling a slippery slope that may be 60° or less?   I'm asking because we plan on going here this summer:     Where if you make one slip then you're going for a wild luge run to the centre of the earth with an unhappy ending.  I'd rather bring one really long rope, then carry several heavier, shorter ropes.   I picked up one of these a while back: Mini Rescue 8   which is made for rappelling on 7.5-9mm ropes. I'm not really familiar with any common situations where you rappel on a 7.5mm rope, but I'm thinking that using one as a fixed line for a non-vertical descent may be one of them.  When is it considered safe to use ropes &lt;⌀9mm for a descent? "
16,How to straighten a bent tent pole,"During a storm one of my tent poles that used to be straight, became bent. Is there a way to straighten the pole again? Or is it a bad idea to try straightening the pole because is would likely snap anyhow and is replacing the pole the way to go? (There is already a question about finding replacement poles)  As a clarification, a picture of the bent pole. It shouldn't bend at all.  "
17,Stove/fuel setup for harsh conditions,"We already have topics on fuels here and here which give quite an overview. Also REI gives some info how to choose your stove and fuel properly.  Still I would like to know what are the best options for my stove/fuel setup if I want to melt snow for drinking and cooking meals on a multi-day trip in high altitudes (over 6000m) with cold (under -20°C) and windy conditions. Weight, seizure, error-proneness and ease of usability of the equipment counts as well as the heat output efficiency. The stove should be sufficient for 2-3 people. "
18,Beginners guide to fossil hunting,I spend a lot time rock climbing and walking and generally being around rocks. But I've never seen a fossil. I've always liked the idea of finding a nice fossil.   How would I go about doing this? Any beginners guides?  
19,What size dry bag is best for keeping and washing clothes?,"I want to buy a drybag for washing clothes while backpacking (travelling, not hiking) and also keeping dirty/wet clothes until it is time to wash them.  I have available near me 5L, 10L and 20L dry bags, they are almost the same price. For washing clothes I think the 10L would work, but since they are close in price and weight, is it better to pick up a larger size? Can I keep rolling it down to compress it more?  Also, those dry bags are made from polyester with PVC ""sealing"" (loose translation here).  PS: Couldn't find better keywords for this question. "
20,Where in the north of the UK are locations with good and easy to locate fossils?,"Following on from this question there was a map of the good areas in Northern America where there are     significant dinosaur fossil formations.   Where in the UK would this be the case?  Just to narrow this a little. I am aware of the Jurasic coast in Dorset (mantioned by nivag and aravona) but that's about 150 miles away from me (in North wales), So I'm more after somewhere in the North of England/north wales or failing that a map of the whole of the UK like in the answer to my previous question "
21,Cycling in Ontario — do I need to worry about permission to access logging roads?,"In Sweden, I've cycled a lot of logging roads. But Sweden has the Right to Roam and it doesn't really matter who owns the land. When cycling on logging roads in Ontario, is any permission or permit required? If so, from whom would I obtain the permit?  Suppose one plans a cycling trip through Northern Ontario.  Would a route such as this one — can I assume that roads that are on Google Maps as well as topographic maps are accessible by bicycle, or do I need to plan in advance for every non-provincial road along the route if I am allowed to go there? "
22,Bag technique for washing clothes while backpacking?,"Related: What size dry bag is best for keeping and washing clothes? Washing clothes on long hikes  After reading the first question above, I'm wondering to myself, is there an effective ""bag method"" for washing clothes while backpacking? I've never washed my clothes in a bag before, but I'm imaging soap and water with your dirty clothes in a roll-top waterproof bag then just shaking it, rolling it or working it with your hands similar to a front-load washing machine.  Is this a popular thing to do? If so then what are some good tips for effectively cleaning your clothes using this technique?  "
23,water knot vs figure 8 follow through vs X for rock climbing anchor - What is easiest to untie?,"I've recently been using figure 8 follow through on anchor webbing, and although it takes more time to dress properly and setup than a water knot, it's easier to untie at the end of the day and I feel like I get more than my time back on the untie. With either system, I also tie backup stopper knots.  This led me to thinking, is there an even better knot for anchor webbing? Would some sort of bowline variant be useful? If it's too hard to look at it and instantly see that it's correct though, I probably won't use it in practice, but I'm interested for curiosity's sake. "
24,Abseiling on one rope: should I attach the prusik to the other one?,"We were abseiling into a cave (about 15 metres height) using a rope hanged by its middle from an anchor:   _ /o\ | | | | | | | | | |   My experience on abseiling is mostly from climbing, where I descend on both strands. But my friend said that one should do it on one strand (it's understandable because it was a very stiff static rope). So we made a knot on the rope. Then she connected to one strand, leaving the other completely free, and descended.      _   /o\   \ /    &amp;   / \  |   |  |   | :)   |  |   |  |   |   Later, someone else told me that one should connect the descending device to one strand, and the prusik to the other.  So, my question is: should one connect the prusik to the same or the other strand, and why?  Also: if using two different strands, should one also tie a knot on the rope?  (side note: we used the setup with one free strand to practice building a hauling system. It was very easy to retrieve the free strand for that purpose. Is this a significant consideration when deciding how to connect the prusik?) "
25,Ice Axes - Ice blade or Mix blade?,I have just got Grivel The Tech Machine Ice Axe. It comes with Ice blade by default. Mostly I am going to do Mix climbing on granite in Norway with Ice climbing occasionally.  Do you recommend to get Mix blade additionally? What are drawbacks of using Ice blade instead of Mix blade?   
26,Why train at less than max intensity? Especially if not training often,"I've read a lot on the many running sites about training.  The consensus seems to be that you should have a mix of:   tempo runs (20-40 mins at e.g. 20 sec/mile slower than 10k race pace) long slow runs intervals, fartlek, hill reps etc   What doesn't seem to be explained is why bother with all that time and distance at significantly slower than your goal race pace?  Why not just run the distance you're training for as fast as you can?  I'm trying to get my 10k time down and I can only fit in 2 runs a week.  I used to just do two 10k runs as fast as I could, and saw my time gradually come down.  But since reading all this stuff I switched to a tempo run and either a long run or intervals.  And...I've got slower (by 2-3 mins over 10k).  Is the idea with lower intensity that you get most of the benefit but much less injury risk (so you can train more often)?  In which case I may as well go back to trying to max out on each run since I am more limited by time than recovery. "
27,Delayed muscle ache after boulder session,"The last weeks I observed couple times that I am getting stiffness/muscle ache in the upper arms after a boulder session. What's special about this is that it is very delayed. For example I went to the gym yesterday in the evening. Today I had no problems at all while working on the bureau. Arriving at home tonight an intense pain in the upper arms starts. Sometimes the stiffness even comes two days after the boulder session.  I am not facing cramps during or after bouldering. The issues I have while climbing are the typical hard forearms, lacking strength in the hands and skin resistance. No problems with the upper arms while climbing.  When I am facing muscle ache after an exhausting endurance run or a soccer match they come directly after the sport or by no later than the next morning. Therefore I am really wondering what is going on here?  So besides the general opinion that my body needs minerals like magnesium/calcium and lots of liquid what would you suggest? "
28,Extra strong sunglasses for sensitive eyes,"I have a damaged pupil that stays partially dilated. And regular polarized sunglasses which I am wearing over the regular glasses aren't working better than my prescription sunglasses. I have a new prescription that includes an extra coating on the polarized lens to make them darker. I haven't received them yet. I think I am looking for sunglasses that are extremely dark. What is available? I do not ski or mountain climb, just everyday stuff. Sunny days are no fun anymore because the sun light even on hazy days is hard on my eye.  Any suggestions? "
29,What are the critical dimensions to a safe bear-bag?,"Many outdoor areas that have bears have bear bag-lines setup for hikers.  In situations where the bear-bag line is not there or it is full, what dimensions should I keep in mind to protect my goodies from bears?  For instance, do I need to keep the bag at least 8 feet off the ground and 6 feet from any climbable structure? "
30,Can I sail a raft on a European river with commercial traffic?,"I'm thinking about sailing a part of the Danube, alone, on a self-built raft. I have no experience sailing rivers on any serious basis.   I'm considering a raft for a number of reasons:   It's cheap. It provides more space than a boat. I can easily take a bicycle. It's more easily replaceable in case of theft than a boat (plus, who would want to steal a raft?). There are no worries about selling it or transporting it after the journey has completed.   However, the portion of the river that I want to sail is used by commercial freight traffic. My worry is that using a vehicle with little steering and no engine can lead to life-threatening situations with river freight ships, like this one, and cruise ships. I imagine getting caught in their suction can be very dangerous.  Has anybody here attempted something similar, or have some river experience?  Are there traffic lanes on European rivers, so it might be possible to do this if you stay close to the bank?   Who would I talk to to find out whether this is a completely idiotic plan, or somehow feasible without risking your life too much?   Naturally, I would sail during daytime only. I can swim of course, and I'm prepared to wear a life vest at all times if so recommended. "
31,What is the safest way to purify water?,"There are a number of ways to purify water, off the top of my head we have filters, iodine, and boiling.  Clearly each has some advantage/disadvantage (iodine tastes terrible, boiling takes time).  Which of these is the safest? Is there another method that's safer? "
32,How should I treat poison ivy?,"If I'm struck by poison ivy, what should I do? Is there a way to suppress the itch? "
33,Do polarized sunglasses protect against snow blindness?,Will regular polarized sunglasses protect me against snow blindness? And if not what type of glasses/goggles will protect me? 
34,Keeping warm in an emergency,"When roaming the outdoors, it might happen that  one finds oneself in a situation that is much, much colder than one planned for.   What can one do in such an emergency, especially when it's so cold that there's real danger to health or even life?  I suppose one obvious thing, if at all possible, is lighting a fire. But what if that's not an option? Another thing is using every piece of textile one has got, and wrap oneself into it. What else can one do to keep as warm as possible? "
35,What are the different methods to purify water?,"What methods can I use to purify water? And what's the difference between those several methods (safety, duration needed, ...)? "
36,How do I wash Gore-Tex clothing?,"I have a bunch of dirty hard-shell pants and jackets. Are these safe to put in the washer and dryer? If not, how should I clean them? "
37,How do I take care of Gore-Tex boots?,I have a pair of Gore-Tex walking boots that I have used a fair bit now and want to make sure I keep them serviceable for as long as possible. What is the best way to maintain Gore-Tex walking boots?  Do they need reproofing occasionally or is just brushing the mud off enough? 
38,What are the most effective ways to start a fire in the cold?,"I frequently hike and camp in the forests of the Midwest (Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, etc). Considering this climate can get quite cold in the Fall &amp; Winter, what are the best strategies to starting a fire? Assuming I have a lighter, what materials would be best to gather? Are any types of wood structures better for this climate (tepee, log cabin, etc)? "
39,"Is digging a ""cold hole"" really effective when sheltering in a snowed area?","One recommendation I got in case of emergency or intentional sheltering in a snowy location is to dig a lower hole, so that the cold air can move there, while one can sleep higher up where the heat stays. I understand the physics involved, but I am not aware of how much difference it can do in practice. How many degrees are we talking here ? Is it really recommended, or does it just waste energy ? "
40,What steps should I take if someone starts sinking?,"What are the steps that should be taken if someone you're hiking with starts to sink uncontrollably into say a marsh? What are some good techniques and points that should be used to get them out safely and quickly? I'm not talking about times when their feet might get a bit wet, I mean when someone suddenly starts going down, it's clearly a real danger and you need to act quickly. Is there a type of rope that's good for this, good knots or anything like that? Things to practice?  Equally, what's best to do if this happens to you and you're alone? "
41,Rougher treks with Vibram Fivefingers,"I hike quite a bit in Vibram Fivefinger Kimodo Sports.  Like the KSO, they are covered and don't have a problem with rocks getting in.  I strongly prefer them to boots for marked trails, and would like to find ways of using them for some moderate trail-less backcountry hiking.  How can I protect myself from scratches?  Will gaiters work, or wear out underfoot without the sole gap provided by boots? "
42,"What to look for in a durable, 3-season sleeping bag?","I'm looking to purchase a camping sleeping bag. I'd like one that's high-quality, durable, and suitable for weekend hiking/camping trips during spring, summer, and fall in New England. (Most of my trips will be hiking with a backpack rather than driving to a campsite.) What factors should I consider when investing in a sleeping bag?  For example:   Given that the temperature varies so much in New England, what should I look for in terms of temperature rating? Does having a camping pad underneath the sleeping bag affect what I should look for in a sleeping bag? What type of material should I look for? Does the shape matter in terms of performance, or do some shapes just provide less bulk so they're easier to pack/carry?  "
43,Can/Should I cook in my tent?,When camping in bad weather I'm always asking myself if it is a good idea to cook in my tent with a gas cooker. Obviously there is the danger of fire. But how dangerous is this really? Can you easily burn down the tent? And are there any other dangers? Maybe carbon monoxide poising? 
44,What should I look for if I want to buy a winter-proofed tent?,I really like to go snowshoeing during the winter. I'm going up to 3500 meters and when I'm doing long tours I would really enjoy to try out winter camping in very remote areas. Is it a good idea to buy/rent a special tent for that purpose? Or can I just use my current tent? What features should I look for if I choose a tent for winter camping? 
45,"I found a Deer Tick on my friend and removed it, what should I do now?","While camping with some friends in Anywhere National Forest, I found a deer tick on a friend. After removing it with tweezers, is there anything else I should do? Should we abandon our trip immediately or is staying a few more days in the wilderness before seeing a doctor safe?   "
46,How should I remove a tick?,"If I find a tick on myself or a friend, what is the best way of removing it?   I've heard some people say that singeing the tick with a match makes the tick detach and fall off. However I've also heard that the fire method makes the tick essentially vomit and is worse than just ripping the tick off.   What is the best method? "
47,What equipment do I need as a beginner outdoor rock climber?,"What are the bare essentials that I need in terms of equipment when it comes to rock climbing? I've done indoor rock climbing but always rented my equipment from the rock-climbing gym.  (For the purposes of this question, I'm excluding bouldering because I've done that with no special equipment.)  Are climbing shoes necessary? What types of harnesses and ropes do I need? What other equipment is recommended to ensure safe climbing?  I do not have a particular place in mind for doing this climbing; I am looking for absolute-beginner-level equipment that will be suitable for any rock climbing area advertised as ""all levels"". "
48,How do I treat a blister? How can I prevent getting them in the first place?,"When hiking with a new pair of boots or if I haven't been hiking in a while, my feet might get blisters.    How can I treat a blister and keep hiking?  Are there things I can do to prevent getting blisters? "
49,"When stranded at sea, should I not ask for a tow?","I've been told that you should never ask for a tow when you are stranded at sea. The reason given is that the person towing can claim a huge share of the stranded boat, potentially all of it if it's abandoned. Is this really codified somewhere?  Should I avoid asking for a tow if I'm stranded because of this? "
50,What foods should I avoid when backpacking?,Are there any foods that should be off-limits when backpacking because they have a negative impact on performance or well-being? I am thinking that candy-bars and very greasy foods might be candidates? 
51,"How dangerous is a band of coyotes to a lone, unarmed human?","There's a delightful thrill to the call of a band of coyotes when you're alone in the dark woods. Do they present a danger? That is, have healthy coyotes (that is, not rabid) been known to attack or show aggressiveness to a lone human? "
52,Scafell Pike ascent,"Do any of the Scafell Pike ascents cross rivers/lakes? I want to hike Scafell Pike, but I don't want to be looking at rocks the whole time. I'd prefer to lake or stream/river scenery. Does anyone know?  (I wasn't sure if this question belonged here to on Travel Answers. Apologies if its misplaced.) "
53,How to grade a trek?,"What are the criteria used for grading a trek? One article that I came across provided the following set criteria for grading:   Duration. Terrain (includes altitude).  Exit routes.  Weather/Climate.   Is there is an official way of grading, or an agreed set of attributes within the trekking community regarding the same?  EDIT: I have removed the reference to Annapurna trek aiming to keep the discussion generic to trekking and not specific to treks from the himalayan range.  Second Edit: Removed the part where I referred to a trek being classified as easy/difficult. Now the question is more focused on the criteria of grading a trek and nothing more. "
54,Please Explain Rock Climbing Grades,"I have seen various grades for different climbs such as   5.14b,  8b+,  8b - 150m  It seems there are different parts to the grade, e.g. the last one is it 8b for 150 metres?  Do these grades only apply to sport routes or to trad routes as well?  Can someone point to a definitive guide or explanation? "
55,Knot for Joining the ropes of different thicknesses,"As, I have been using a Double Fisherman's knot to join the two ropes. With some physics that I know, in Double Fisherman's knot the same amount of pressure (stress) is applied over the two turns of each rope, so making sure there is no significant damage done to any of the rope.    However I believe that if the two ropes are not of equal thickness, or may be say if the difference between the thicknesses is a considerably huge, Double Fisherman's would(?) do some damage to the thinner rope.    In that case how trustworthy are Sheet Bend and Zappelin Bend?  Edit:  I am Not going to use this for rappelling at all. I intend to use that as a holding line when me and friends are swimming in a lake nearby. Having said this, We are not entirely relying on this as well.  "
56,Could I have a postmortem on this suburban raccoon encounter?,"I know this isn't Great Outdoors in the sense of planning a vast trek and seeing vistas, but I wanted to ask for a postmortem on an unwanted great outdoors encounter in the suburbs.  I was getting back after a photo shoot with a pirate motif, and among the items I had borrowed were some things from my brother, including a not purely ornamental sword, which he requested that I return to him that night instead of later on when I would unpack everything else.  I went out and heard a scurrying when I opened the trunk, and looked and saw two young, maybe adolescent, raccoons that had been rooting through a toppled trash can and were looking at me with what I would interpret as curiosity, but no evident fear. The distance was eight or so feet, and I tapped the ground a few times with sword to make noise that would scare them away. Again, no evident fear. Only looking at me.  I kept at least as much distance to them and made my way back into the house. They didn't approach me, and I'm rather glad there was no fight; I would not credit myself with sure victory if the fight was archaic weapon vs. rabies bite. But what really unnerved me is that nothing I did seemed to scare them. I made the usual noises of a person walking around, opening a trunk, and removing clanging metal items and tapping the ground with one of them.  I ""won"" this event; that is, I don't need a rabies shot. However, I'm somewhat concerned that I could be close to them and making noises (admittedly, not very loud noises like yelling), and maybe they were keeping their version of respectful distance by backing out of the trash cans and getting to a place they could escape from, and perhaps their looking at me was wondering if they would need to take flight, but I still found the experience a bit unnerving. We have squirrels, chipmunks, robins, sparrows, and other fauna, in addition to domestic cats that don't know me, and none of them will either let you get as close, or make noise, without fleeing for safety.   So what do I have to learn from this? The biggest lesson may be something I already did, keep my own respectful distance and end the encounter as quickly as possible. And I did not do something stupid like assume that a bit of pointed metal will infallibly shield me from a darting raccoon.  But I wanted to check in and ask for any guidance. Especially in a suburban environment. Are there animals that are simply not afraid of much bigger humans? Are there any rules besides the obvious about minimizing one's chances for needing a rabies shot? (Or for that matter an infection; a bite can carry danger of assorted infections.) Would I have been better as soon as I heard noises from the trash can to simply go inside and leave fetching my brother's property another day? In this specific case the raccoons backed out of the trash can into an area illuminated by a window; I wouldn't expect anywhere near the same visibility for most nighttime, meaning most raccoon, encounters.  Would it have been appropriate (in Illinois, outside of Chicago) to call for animal control ?  Again, any thoughts are welcome. I know this isn't a great trek into the wild outdoors, but the wild outdoors have a way of intruding into carefully planned suburban and urban areas. "
57,Venomous/Semi-Venoumous Snakes at Higher Altitudes,"When we camp in rainforests or even country side forest, we are supposed to be very careful about Reptiles, especially Snakes. In India out of the many venomous snakes, I have found Pit Vipers to be very common. That is why I have always considered the possible threats while choosing a campsite. But at Higher altitudes, like the Himalayas I do not have any information regarding their habitats. If I google it, I may get the information that I need. But, as far as I know and what I have learnt about Vipers, is, they have an organ called Jacobson's Organ which makes them to sense the heat signatures.    In regions around Mt. Everest (where I will be going), in Sagarmatha National Park, they have this Himalayan Pit Viper. I have confirmed that from a friend who is a Herpetologist and has worked in that region but never have had a chance to study the Himalayan Pit Viper.  For my question, this himalayan pit viper is just an example in case of Himalays, there can be many other species than Pit Vipers. I chose to ask w.r.t this because it is commonly found there. In other parts of the world, I believe there are Venomous Snakes, for that matter this question can also be taken as part where it generally snows!  My question is: If it is true about Pit Vipers being able to trace the heat signatures, does camping in the areas where it snows unsafe? Because, when it snows, it's obviously cold, and so is our body temperature. Yet, will one such reptile be able to trace the heat signature? "
58,Can heartwood be used for fire?,"During a fire building process, can heartwood be used as a fuel for the fire? Assuming you are working with less than perfect materials, there is always a danger that your fire will go out at the point where your tinder burns up. Hence, when using heartwood, do I need to keep an eye out and add finer shavings of wood to keep the fire up and burning? "
59,Which one is scientifically better for carrying water during an expedition: A hard fiber bottle or an Aluminium Bottle?,"I have come across two good products for carrying the water during expeditions. I wonder which of them would be scientifically better to have along.    Yes, I agree that this question may sound like a primarily-opinion based question, but I want to get the pros and cons of the two materials.    A hard-fiber can or an alloy/aluminium bottle. Does altitude/weather make a significant impact on selection of the bottle? A Hard Fiber one or an Aluminium made?  NOTE: When empty, both weigh almost same.    "
60,Trekking in Mongolia without a guide?,"I would like to visit Mongolia next year and organize a trek with my girlfriend. We are skilled trekkers and we would prefer to avoid to hire a guide. We both experienced treks with guide in Nepal, India and Tanzania and although we tried to decide where to stop and sleep, the guide had always a good argument to go in the lodge he picked up. This was sometimes quite frustrating.   During the last trek we did together, without guide and porter, we could really enjoyed to go from lodge to lodge by ourselves and to decide where to sleep, eat and what to change our itinerary if necessary.   Is it realistic to plan a 10 to 12 days trek in Mongolia without porter or guide? Can we expect as in Nepal to trek from village to village and find lodges?  What region would be suitable for such a trip? We are not looking especially for peak or high pass.  "

62,What backpacking water purification techniques can be substituted safely during a city's boil order?,"Can I use my Sawyer filter when the city issues a boil order? Or could there contaminants such as viruses present that require boiling? How about other filters such as carbon filters?  I'm confident that UV pens or bottles would be sufficient, but any commentary on those are also welcome. "
63,What are the repercussions of entering National parks during the 2013 US Government shutdown?,What are the repercussions of entering National parks during the US Government shutdown?  There's a trail near my house that I go to almost every week.  It's really just a fence with a gate in it.  I didn't realize it was national park until yesterday when I went there and there were temporary orange signs saying park closed due to the federal government shutdown.  I looked it up and indeed it is a national park.  Does that mean that it's truly 'illegal' to walk on the trail?  Or that it's just not patrolled (I've never seen a government employee in there anyhow)? 
64,What is the recommended wilderness first aid treatment for a scorpion sting?,"I'm going to be doing some backpacking in a desert environment state park. In the event that someone in my party is stung by a scorpion, what is the proper first aid?  Note that we may be in a remote location which means it may be several hours before we can get to a road, trailhead, or even to a location that has cell service.  The park I'll be hiking in is Anza-Borrego Desert SP in California. "
65,John Muir's Gear List,"What gear did John Muir actually take on long trips?  I live in California these days, and around here we revere John Muir as a legend of the outdoors. But the legend seems larger than is possible. John Muir is said to have traveled for weeks in the back country, but he never took any food with him, and he never hunted.  What did he eat? What gear did he actually take with him?  I'd be really interested to see what a serious backpacking gear list was like before the days of nylon tents, space-age rubber approach boots, and carbon fiber hiking poles. "
66,"Do you footprint the inside of your tent, outside, or both?",I've always footprinted outside of my tent but found water inside my tent after really heavy rainfall.  This has led me to wonder whether an additional liner inside of the tent would serve useful as a second footprint.  Have you done this?  What are your thoughts on this double footprint approach (if pack space and additional weight aren't a concern)? 
67,Is a mother bear more defensive during early summer compared to late summer and autumn?,"According to the Wikipedia page on Grizzly Bears,     Mothers defending their cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of fatal injuries to humans.   Is there any seasonal dependence on this?  For example, are mothers more defensive during early summer than during late summer and autumn, when the cubs are a bit older, or is there no significant difference?  Does it depend on the kind of bear?  See also: Do bear-safe rules still apply in the winter? "
68,Is Gaia GPS inaccurate for distances?,"In a previous question, I had asked for help in finding a GPS app with certain features. That led me to find Gaia GPS and it has been great, no complaints.  However, I had a situation recently. I found a hike through an online guidebook and it was listed as 3.1 miles. I went out and did a track on it (with Gaia) and it came up as being close to 5 miles. I wrote to the author of the guidebook, thinking that he might want an update. He checked through his notes and also asked for my tracks from Gaia and showed me how Gaia can be inaccurate and my actual track was a really squiggly line adding all kinds of crazy distance. He said he also used Gaia and would get the same weird results. I dont know what he used to create the actual distances in the guide. He stood by his statement of the hike being about 3.1 miles.   But I'm still uncomfortable with this conclusion. The hike just ""felt"" longer than 3.1 miles. Also, there's the factor of time. I'm not a fast hiker at all but the loop took me 3.5 hours to do. For a 5 miler, that puts me at 45 minutes/mile - totally reasonable - but a 3 miler would be 1 hour+ per mile - no one is that slow! Time is the only ""fixed"" factor in this and that would indicate that its more than 3.1 miles.   So is Gaia really that inaccurate? Or is there something else at work here? "
69,Most common infectious diseases acquired in the wilderness?,"People traveling in the wilderness can acquire infectious diseases. These can be caused by organisms such bacteria, viruses, protozoans, or fungi. They can be transmitted through drinking contaminated water, or by transmission from one person to another.   Does anyone know of any reliable, quantitative data comparing the probabilities of getting different infectious diseases while hiking in the wilderness?   Quantitative doesn't mean it has to be high precision -- even order of magnitude numbers would help in sorting out what are the more important risks. It would be good to differentiate symptomatic infections from asymptomatic ones, and to avoid data that are confounded by a normal background rate of infection. (E.g., giardia has a 3-7% prevalence in the US, and is almost always asymptomatic.)  Related questions on diseases acquired in the wilderness:  Why are people so worried about Giardia?  How do you avoid Norovirus on the AT? "
70,What causes these shallow indentations in cheek of axe head?,"On a new Hults Bruk's Kisa axe, the cheek isn't entirely smooth and has shallow indentations in it. The blade is nice and sharp, whole thing feels sturdy.  Where do these indentations in the cheek come from? Are they a sign of issues with quality, or is it normal to see imperfections in the cheek in hand forged axe heads?  Here are some pictures:   "
71,Snowshoe hare migration patterns through changing seasons,"I asked this question in the Hunting BC forum but so far it hasn't received much attention. I'm very interested in the answer(s) and will cross-post any useful information.  Over the last three weeks in northern BC (google.ca/maps/@55.2044433,-126.2710319,7.25z) the temperature has been rising and a lot of snow is melting. The hare hunting spot that was quite productive for me through January and February (at around 900 metres elevation) now appears to be biologically dead. I'm pretty sure I didn't kill all the hares, so where did they go?? The area has a mix of spruce, pine, and alder and I was finding all my hares in, under, or around the alder. The vegetation hasn't changed but the ground cover has - less snow, more bare ground, and a developing swamp thanks to the snow melt.  I'm aware that the hares are currently changing colour, and it's possible that they're just much better camouflaged than before, but I'm also not seeing any fresh droppings or footprints in what remains of the snow.  I haven't found anything online that describes hare migration through the changing seasons, but in other threads I've seen people suggesting this is the case. I'm hoping someone can tell me...  Do hares migrate to different kinds of habitat as the seasons change, and if so can anyone describe the kind of habitat they're most likely to inhabit in each of the seasons? "
72,Protection while working with acetone,"I used to clean my arrow-shafts with acetone before I applied glue. However, I was told that I should be more careful with it, because of its toxic vapors and stuff.   Which breathing mask is recommended? Should I wear glasses and/or gloves?  "
73,How can one tiller a bow without a tillering tree or similar wooden device?,"I've been crafting a longbow from ash and am about ready for tillering. By tillering I mean: stringing the bow loosely and drawing the bowstring back little by little to give the bow some flex, making finer adjustments and removing a little bit of wood on the bow to get a desirable flex of bow limbs.  I understand that folks tend to use some kind of tillering device to do this. Here's an example of a tillering tree (or a tillering stick with a base):    I don't have a tillering tree (a simple wooden device to hold the bow and hook the drawn bowstring into notches at different levels of draw-back) and am wondering if &amp; how I can tiller the bow without the use of a tillering tree, or nails and pullies in an actually tree?  I'm looking for instructions and/or diagrams detailing how one can tiller a bow themselves, without much but the woodworking tools for crafting the bow. For example, making a survival bow in the wild, how would one tiller it? Maybe the answer is 'bushcraft a one-time-use tillering stick' - I'm wondering if there's an alternative.  (I probably will try to get a hold of a tillering tree or will make something as it's useful to have, but I'm wondering how this could be done without an additional wooden tool.) "
74,How do you build a warming fire in an old barrel?,"I learned to ice-skate on a lake in Connecticut.  My father built a warming fire in an old barrel (oil barrel?) and a group of us would skate, warm up, skate, warm up and repeat, for hours.  How does one build a warming fire in an old (oil??) barrel?  What are the caveats?  For how many fires will the barrel last before losing its integrity?  Do people still do this, or does every skateable lake have a warming hut with all the conveniences?     "
75,Lapland UKK hike in late-May,"My dad and I are planning to hike the Lapland UKK from Aittajarvi to Kiilopää  in late-May (22-30).We are planning to drive from Helsinki to Saariselkä, about 12 hours drive.  Is it possible to drive the route from Helsinki at this time of the year?  How about getting from Saariselkä to the parking lot in Aittajarvi, is it  accessible by a car in late-May?  Do you think the UKK hike is suitable at this time of the season (if not, does anyone have any other suggestion for a multi-day hike in the Finnish Lapland).  Finally, what about the weather and what should we expect?   Thanks!  Any additional info will be greatly appreciated! "

77,Do backyard birds prefer birdbaths with moving water?,"It's spring here in the Northeastern United States, and we're getting a large influx of the wonderful birds who will spend the summer and fall with us. Although we feed and water birds, and any other hungry outdoor creatures, throughout the year, we increase their options during the busier months.  This is also the season when merchants heavily advertise many varieties of birdbaths.   I've read a number of articles saying that birdbaths with moving water are better. They suggest that moving water increases attendance, and keeps the birds, and birdbaths, healthier. For instance, this says     Birds find water sources by sight and sound.  Adding movement to your birdbath creates visual and audio cues that birds will hone in on, allowing you to draw more birds to your bath.  Properly agitated water can also deter mosquitoes from visiting your bath, as well.   This site also claims that adding motion to water attracts more birds.      Water is essential for birds and while a simple bird bath can provide refreshment, more elaborate arrangements like bird bath fountains have many benefits and can attract more birds to any birder's backyard.   I'm seeing a lot of ads for birdbaths with features that keep the water moving. Some examples are water wigglers, bird bath misters, agitators, and fountains.  The problem is that most of the sites I found that recommend these devices also sell them.   I'm seeking evidence that birds prefer moving, rather than stagnant, water, from reliable sources that don't make money from their recommendations. It would be even better if they specify which type of water-moving method is preferred.   Anecdotal answers through your own experience are fine too, and would be helpful.  My birds are the American versions, and include swallows (many varieties), sparrows (many varieties), cardinals, blue jays, grackles, robins, crows, finches, thrushes, titmice, woodpeckers, red-winged blackbirds, grosbeaks, mourning doves, canaries, and others in related families.  "
78,Definition of tributaries above/below a landmark,"There are many places where a special regulation for a river or stream includes tributaries ""above"" or ""below"" a particular landmark. If the tributary more or less parallels the main river, does the entire tributary count based on where it enters the main river?  Here's an example: Let's say a special regulation says:      The main stem of XYX river and tributaries above Miller Bridge is   closed to fishing all year.   Now let's say that XYZ river runs due south. There is also a tributary that mostly parallels XYZ river, and empties into it 1 mile below Miller Bridge. Since the tributary empties into the XYZ river below the bridge, does that mean that the entire tributary is open to fishing? Or, can you only fish in the section of the tributary that is south of where it would be even with the bridge (even though the bridge is on the main river, not the tributary)? If the latter, how would you even know when you were past it?  I am in California if it makes a difference. "
79,How can I desalinate ocean water enough for cleaning or showering?,"I'm planning for a long cruise in my small yacht. The water tank in the yacht has enough clean water to drink, but not quite enough for showers, cleaning the dishes etc..   Desalinating ocean water during the cruise sounds like a great idea. And I can get by with only most of the salt gone for many of my uses (like showering, cleaning, toilet use..) . Is there a device that can remove salt from ocean waters? I have electricity or petrol available.   I know there are huge watermaking machines for big yachts like this one , but I need something smaller. "
80,Device with very accurate GPS location,"I've already read this and this to get some background knowledge on GPS tools, but I'm still left with some questions:   Is there any way I can get a device that consistently provides accuracy to within 10 feet in less than a minute or two?   I've messed around with several iPhone apps, but haven't had very good luck thus far.  What's the most accurate a phone can be? If I can't have accuracy to less than 10 feet within two minutes, what's the closest I can get to that goal? (Both in terms of time and accuracy)   I only need to be able to accurately determine the coordinates of specific locations, so I don't need any additional features--even poor battery life isn't a big deal. "
81,Would Gorilla Glue Work on Goretex?,Is this waterproof glue effective on Goretex? It mentions 'etceteras' in its label but does it stick Goretex to fabric?      The stitching on my boot is ripped. I'm not considering sewing it because the needle would tear the Goretex. I know there are other waterproof glues available but I'm specifically interested in knowing if this one does the job. It's not somewhere under pressure I think; (the stitches are gone because of manufacturing fault but I didn't refund them because I wanted the boots!)   
82,How do I distinguish a dirt floor in a cave from a floor formed of very old coprolites?,"This may be better asked as two questions; if so, I will edit.  The question is prompted by a section in Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes by Svante Pääbo, who was the first to sequence Neanderthal (and Denisovan) DNA.  Pääbo and his team had to work out techniques for sequencing nuclear DNA ten and more thousands of years old.  They experimented with coprolites -- fossilized feces -- of the extinct American ground sloth.     The giant sloths had left behind large amounts of droppings, which   archaeologists dressed up with the fancy name of coprolites.  In fact,   in some caves in places like Nevada, the entire floor, to some depth,   is largely made up of old ground-sloth feces.   So, suppose one has to take shelter in a cave in Nevada:  how would one distinguish an ordinary dirt floor from a floor formed of coprolites of the extinct American ground sloth? Are there any risks involved in taking shelter in any of the coprolite caves? (except for the possible ick factor)      [This sloth,] Mylodon, weighed about 1,000 kilograms (2,205 lb)[2] and   was about 3 m (9.8 ft) long from snout to tail tip  "
83,What precautions should I take when cooking smelly food in an area with bears?,"I'm planning an overnight hiking trip and want to try cooking fish. We will be camping at an established backcountry site on the trail, which has a spot for a tent near a fire ring.  However, this is in an area with black bears. I know to hang all my food and other scented items in a bear bag, and not to eat in the tent. Beyond that, what additional precautions should I take for smelly foods?  Typically I just bring less smelly things like trail mix and energy bars, and nothing has ever bothered my site or bear bag (as far as I know!), but I'm worried that fish scent would be way more attractive.  For instance:   Should we cook further away from the tent than usual? (There are a number of sites along the hike, so cooking dinner at one site and hiking a bit farther is a possibility.) What is the best way to dispose of the ""juices"", grease, etc. left over from cooking?  "
84,Are cheap Packable Backpacks reliable enough for a long day strenuous hike?,"I will be going to a series of 6 to 10 hours day hikes in Hokkaido, Japan. Some of these hikes are strenuous in effort, and involves different terrains. The weather should include some rain, but for the most part it will be hot, and humid. I will be there from the end of July till the end of August. I will have my own car as a transportation going through Hokkaido.  I have a 70L Outdoor backpack that I usually travel with, but I am NOT planning on doing the hikes with my 70L backpack (tried doing so through Indonesia and Taiwan for multi-day hikes, and it was tough, silly me).  I am thinking of buying two of a lightweight packable (or foldable) backpacks (like this). Then before the hike I was thinking to leave the 70L backpack and use the foldable backpack for the day hike. I will also buy a waterproof cover for the foldable backpack.  I expect that I will be carrying a maximum of 4kg to 5kg. I will have my snacks (and/or meal), 1.5L to 2L of water depending on the hike, a shirt, headlights, and a waterproof jacket.  Does this sound like a good idea? Also, any possible alternatives for a reliable packable/foldable backpack? (even if it is expensive) "
85,What is this squirrel doing and why?,"I have sometimes noticed squirrels ""pancaking"" - lying flat on their stomachs. Unfortunately all my research into this subject has turned up hordes of ""cute squirrel"" photos and not much else... See the picture:  What causes this behavior? Is it for heat dissipation purposes? "
86,Can overexertion cause AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness)?,"Recently I did a trek in the Himalayan region and one of the group members was affected by what we believed was AMS at around 4600m.  We had to evacuate the person from there and get to around 4100m before she stabilized.   On review of the situation we found the following:   She did not have any headache or nausea. She just fainted. Which pointed towards lack of oxygen supply to her brain (subsequently she fainted around 5-6 times while we were bringing her down).  The person concerned was on Diamox (should have helped her acclimatize, but I realize that this is not a guarantee).  She was well hydrated (she was drinking around 4L of water per day). She did exert herself a bit more than required before AMS hit her (she was breathless as well, which is a symptom of AMS). There were no symptoms of headache or any nausea before that (or even after). Her oxygen reading was around 85% and her HR was registered at 140+ around the time she fainted. We had to administer Dexamethasone steroid to boost her lungs up and we saw an improvement in her condition in about 45min.   So my question is, can overexertion lead to AMS? Would it act as a possible factor in increasing the chances of a person being affected by AMS?   PS: I had a doubt if it was AMS in the first place, but since  there's a possibility of lack of oxygen causing her to faint, I'm assuming it was AMS.   Based on one of the answers given by @wills, I'm adding further clarifications:   The person concerned did mention that she witnessed the 'darkness in front of eyes' before fainting, so I'm ruling out weakness as the reason. Also, this continued to happen some 5-6 times in the next 1 hour or so.  "
87,How comfortable are pump sacks for air matresses?,"I am considering getting a new air mattress for situations where I want to save weight. I already have a large comfortable one for when I drive to camping with a car.   So I saw a system which costs a bit too much to be a ""try it and throw away if it is not good"", even at discounter prices, consisting of a 440 g mattress and 84 g sack which is used to pump in the air. The combination costs 74 Euro, while a 800 g mattress with an inbuilt pump from the same low cost supplier is available for 24 Euro. I would pay the difference if I get the weight reduction without loss of comfort in mattress setup and emptying.   I watched a video showing a similar pumpsack system from a brand name supplier (that specific system starts at 1:09 in the video) and it seems like you still have to use your own lungs for it. I really dislike pumping up a whole mattress with lung power when I am exhausted from hiking.   Has somebody had experience with the second type of mattress, especially in comparison with the first type? How much effort does it take, is it comparable to lung-blowing or the blow he needs in the video just a small part of it? Are there other difficulties with the inbuilt-pump system which make it less attractive than the pump sack system?  "
88,Dry Douglas Fir wood only creates smoke and no fire?,I cut down a Douglas Fir tree last year around June and we've dried it outside with tarp on top.  I live in Seattle where it constantly rains.  A couple of days ago I tried to use some of the wood in my outdoor firepit using Duraflame firestarter and it created a lot of smoke and not a lot of fire.  I tried couple more times with different pieces but still the same result?  I bought  wood moisture reader and it reads 10~16% in the middle of the woood. I don't understand why there is too much smoke and not a real fire when I think the wood is sufficiently dry.   How dry should a firewood be for ideal burn? 
89,Can you safely use retired ropes for belaying children?,"Climbing ropes are UIAA rated for so many falls of an 80kg weight. After that number of falls–or a specific period of time based on amount of use–you are supposed to retire the rope.   But what if the person you are belaying is only 15kg?   When ropes pass their recommended retirement age it doesn't exactly render them useless, but if you're using a rope to belay weights more than 80% less than what it's rated for, does that mean the rope will be good for a period of time 80% longer than recommended?  In my mind, a 15kg kid using a 9.8mm rope would be the equivalent of an 80kg man using a 22.6mm rope, which would last close to forever, but you probably wouldn't want to take any big falls with it.  To what weight can you safely use retired ropes for belaying small children on top-roped climbs? "

I'll be at least 5 hours away by walk to the nearest human settlement and another 1-2 hours by vehicle to the nearest medical center.   In such a case, what are the first aid steps that I need to take in case I get bitten by a snake? I have heard about tying a rope tightly just above the bite to prevent the venom from spreading, although I don't know the complete validity of the same. Are there other things that can help me to arrest the fatal effects of the venom before I get some medical attention? "
92,Micro-Fractures in Climbing Equipments,"I have always been very careful while handling climbing gear. Last year while returning from an expedition, I met a group that was returning from a tough-looking climb. They were selling off a few of their gear, which were pretty new. Most of the them were carabiners. Out of curiosity I asked them the reason and they replied that those equipment had fallen off a considerable height. I examined them only to find out a few minor looking scratches. They were in good shape.  The guy told me that they may have sustained micro-fractures. Has anyone ever come across such an issue? Is there a way to scan and determine if the equipment is considerably damaged? "
93,Minimal northwest mountain camping with emerg. bivvy and tarp?,"I plan to do some overnight solo camping in the mountains (400-1200m elevation range) in the next few weeks to escape Vancouver for a bit.  My available layers I can bring are polypropylene thermal underwears, wool sweater, an ECWCS fleece jacket, goretex/PVC jacket some good socks and alike, and I've been able to sit around still overnight without miuch trouble in parks at home with food in my stomach and a bit of concentration (200m, ~4C at night here)  I presume it is below freezing up at the 1km+ range, last October I remember a bit of snow around there, but mainly in the open.  Do you think I can just get a bivvy with maybe a metalic inside, or a simple tunnel/tubular emergency tent, put a tarp over it and expect to survive a few nights in the colder mountains?  Are there any other recommended minimal sleeping arrangements I can use for this kind of climate/weather?  "
94,Do leeches have a preference?,"So I did a hike in a forest infested with leeches. I ended up with quite a few leech bites (around 20). But, at the same time, another hiker got just one bite!   We both were wearing similar shoes, socks and trek suits. Hence, in theory we were pretty similar. Also, we did clean up the shoes/socks often. Yet, the number of leeches on me was way more than the one on the other trekker.   So what is it that attracts the leeches? Do they have a preference of going for a particular set of people? (Maybe driven by smell?).  "
95,What fall factor will cause me to hit the deck with a typical dynamic rope?,"Say I'm leading on a single-pitch climb, or the first pitch of a multi-pitch. The maximum fall factor I could theoretically have without hitting the deck is 1, but that's with a static rope, which of course I wouldn't use in this situation. This raises the question of what is the maximum fall factor I could have without contacting the ground at my belayer's feet. (If the rope stretches, then it's helping me by decelerating me at least somewhat, but I'd really prefer not to touch bottom at all.)  By UIAA standards, static rope stretch for an 80 kg climber is supposed to be no more than 10%. Dynamic rope stretch is going to be greater than this static value.  The UIAA standard fall is a fall factor of 1.77, and rope stretch for that fall is supposed to be no more than 40%. In the first-pitch scenario, you can't actually have a fall that puts this much stress on the rope, since you can't fall past the belayer, but we can be sure than the rope stretch in a first-pitch scenario will be no greater than this. (Again, this is for an 80 kg climber.)  What I can tell from this is that the rope stretch a is in the range 0.1&lt;a&lt;0.4, which is a pretty broad range. Therefore the fall factor f that just barely has me kissing sand is in the range 0.6&lt;f&lt;0.9. What is the actual critical value of the fall factor?  related: What is a typical elongation of a dynamic climbing rope? "
96,Could smoking pipe tobacco or a cigar attract bears and/or other wildlife?,"Bears and other wildlife are attracted to unusual scents, especially anything that could potentially be mistaken as food, such as often-sweet-smelling, aromatic pipe tobacco or cigars. However, you're essentially just burning the material and just creating smoke. And animals general aren't attracted to fire or smoke. I can imagine this one going either way, and I haven't really found a definitive answer anywhere. Personal experience leads me to think it's generally safe, but I'm only one person in one region, in one country.  Could smoking pipe tobacco or a cigar attract bears and/or other wildlife? Especially predators? If so, what specifically is the main danger: the unsmoked tobacco, the vaporizing of the tobacco through smoking, or the leftovers?   I know that this could lead into a conversation about smoking anything, but for the sake of this one, let's keep it to aromatic tobacco smoking, not including cigarettes. "
97,How safe is sleeping in bear country?,"We have recently hiked in Slovakian mountains where bears live. I’m not too concerned about the bears during the day, as we make enough noise to avoid an encounter. But I am not sure about sleeping there.  We slept in bivy sacks in the open, I hung our food on a tree somewhat distant from our sleeping place and generally followed all the usual suggested precautions. But when we could hear the bear grumbling in the woods in the night, we were pretty scared anyway. I feared that the bear might get quite close without us noticing, and I’d hate that.  How safe is sleeping in the open in a bear country, then? Is the general idea that the bear will simply not notice? That the area is large enough to make the encounter improbable unless we do something wrong, like cook in the camp? "
98,Can the sheer existence of snow lead to dehydration?,"When I went to Stok Kangri trek, while climbing down from the peak, on the snow-filled slopes, I felt terribly dehydrated. I was having ample amount of water throughout the climb and yet, I felt dehydrated on the snow-filled slopes. However, once I was out of the snowy slopes on to the solid land, this feeling of dehydration went off. Hence, my question is: is there a possible scientific explanation to the feeling of dehydration? i.e, if one is surrounded by snow, can the body end up losing water through the pores of the skin leading to a feeling of dehydration?  P.S.: I am NOT referring to eating of snow in place of drinking water. I am asking about a possible threat of dehydration when in a snowfall area.  EDIT: Solid land refers to slopes with no snow. It doesn't mean the end of efforts or an easier track. There was absolutely no difference in the gradient of the slope or the difficulties involved. The effort was made on the same day and it was as good as flipping a switch once I left the snowy slopes (the feeling of dehydration went off in a matter of minutes). "
99,Anchor without cordelette?,"I have the John Long book on climbing anchors and also a couple of others that describe the subject more briefly (Pesterfield, Traditional Lead Climbing, and Freedom of the Hills). When it comes to constructing a redundant anchor, they all seem to describe a process in which you place several nuts and/or cams and then use a cordelette to connect them together and equalize them. However, I came across this online:     I love to hear experienced climbers say they don't use cordelettes. I've been at it 40 yrs., including 9 yrs guiding, and 200+ fa's, and have never seen the reason to add such a time consuming, bulky item to a rack.   Can anyone expand on this? Is the idea to use the climbing rope rather than a cordelette? What would be the steps in the process of building an anchor this way? Pros and cons? I assume you can't use this to build a rappel anchor unless you intend to leave the rope behind...? I can't see, e.g., how you would bail off of a multipitch route this way. "
100,Are nutrition bars/energy bars good for high altitude treks?,"In this question Suitable food for high altitude trekking Wedapashi asks about food for high altitude trekking. Also, in this question, there is a discussion about engergy bars. One of the answers given by whatsisname mentions that Jerky can be carried if ""you have unlimited access to water"".   In wake of the above mentioned discussions, do energy bars/drinks have a possible dehydrating effect? Is it a safe bet to carry energy bars/nutrition bars for high altitude treks where a threat of dehydration is already high due to the loss of moisture while breathing? (I believe jerky is out of question on high altitude treks)  "
101,What are the proper precautions/protocols for storing food while car camping in an area with bears?,"Anyone with experience in bear-populated areas, what's the best way to store food when your on the move with a car?  Are some foods better than others?  Wondering specifically about black bears in Northern California, but would things be different if you were in say Montana around the grizzlies?    "
102,When to kill and bleed a fish,"I am getting into fishing (I bought an entry-level spinner and plan on going to some nearby rivers/lakes) and have been reading a lot of conflicting information in regards to the sequence of events that transpire from the time you catch the fish, to the time you eat it.  Obviously, first you must catch the fish, which as a newbie will probably be a bit difficult for me. Once I catch my first fish and determine that it's of legal size and is a species I'd like to eat, then I need to immediately begin preparing it.  I've read that bleeding fish (cutting the gills) helps remove the gamey odor that a lot of fish have, as well as removing certain undesirable toxins.  But what do I do if I'm not done fishing yet? What if it's still early in the day and I want to keep fishing for a few more hours? Obviously then, I need a way of preserving the fish so that it doesn't taint before I even get home. The thing is, I don't like the idea of keeping a fish alive once I catch it. Not judging others, just personally would rather kill it as soon as I catch it and put it out of the stress/misery of being caught &amp; wounded.  So, given everything I've read, I'm wondering if my following solution is viable, and if not, why:   Catch the fish, and kill it immediately (probably a knife through its brain is what I've found to be the quickest/humane method) Bleed the fish, totally Throw it in a cooler full of ice, and continue fishing When I get home, clean/fillet it   The only thing I'm worried about here is that perhaps the fish will somehow spoil from the time I throw it on ice, to the time I get home (which should never be longer than 6 - 8 hours). Ideas?  "
103,True fish attractants?,"Most ""fish attractants"" are actually just mechanisms to cover up human scent (as this article here as well as this one point out). They don't actually attract fish, but they mask any fish-negative smells that the bait have come into contact with (your hands, cigars, sun tan lotion, bug repellent, etc.). This doesn't entice the fish to bite the bait; it simply entices them to keep the bait in their mouth for longer if they decide to bite at all.  Well, ideally, I'd like to find some way of attracting the fish to the location where I'm fishing. I could then optionally decide to use a fish ""attracant"" to mask any smells I've inadvertently introduced. So I'm looking for an actual fish attractant.  I could take a jug of some sort and perforate its lid with lots of tiny holes. I would then put the actual fish attractant in the jug (obviously, the attracant would be different depending on the sort of fish I'm looking to catch). I could tether the jug to my boat or to land with a rope. I'd throw the jug as far as I could, and because the lid has holes in it, it would fill with water, sink, and begin leeching out the attractant.  Two questions:   Is this feasible/possible? If not, why? If so, what are some tried &amp; proven methods/best practices here?; and If it is possible, where could I find different ""recipes"" for different attractants based on the fish I'm looking to catch. I live in upstate NY (Adirondacks), so the major species are: bass, pike, trout and musky.  "
104,Is it really that unsafe to touch a stranger's wound?,"I am about to participate in a first aid training workshop. Before I do so, I am supposed to pass an online first aid course. While going through the course, I came across this section about applying pressure to wounds in order to stop critical bleeding:     It is always necessary to find an appropriate compromise between   safety and promptness.      For instance, you would probably not hesitate to put your fingers   into e.g. the wound of your partner without any protection; It   would be a more than brave action in the case of a stranger. On   the other hand, the casualty may bleed to death before you manage   to get a pair of gloves or a bandage.      If the casualty responds, you can ask him/her to press the   bleeding wound, and you can enhance the pressure over his/her   hand. Or you can use a piece of clothing, etc.   Is it really that dangerous? Why? What should I do if the ""casualty"" does not respond? How much and why is it risky to apply pressure myself? "
105,Placing protection efficiently when leading trad?,"I'm a beginning trad leader, having done about five easy fifth class leads. I've had some formal instruction, but don't currently have access to a teacher or mentor. I'm finding that I'm extremely slow as a leader, even when the climbing is easy, and I'm wondering whether this is can be improved by doing something about the way I rack my gear or the the steps I go through with my free hand. I would like to get more efficient so I can be more solid on more difficult climbs, complete more climbs in a day, and maybe start getting ready to do some multipitch.  Let's say I'm going to place a cam in a vertical crack, and I have a solid stance that gives me one free hand. I have a bunch of alpine draws on my left gear loop, and cams on my right, each with a carabiner. Since the draw has two biners and the cam has one, that's a total of three, which is one more than I need. I would probably place the cam with my right hand, then reach over with the same hand to grab a draw to use as an extension in order to reduce rope drag. I clip the draw into the cam's loop of webbing, and then I may need to manipulate the biner on its free end in order to increase the length of the draw (awkward with one hand). Then I probably need to pull up some rope, and I may not be able to do this without letting go of the draw -- ugh, now the draw may have dropped down into the crack where it's hard to get at the biner. I take the rope in my teeth, reach into the crack and pull the biner back out, and clip in. Now I've got pro at this anchor. I still have the extra biner stuck in the cam's loop of webbing, so I take that off and put it on a gear loop.  What could I improve about my procedure? Are there youtube videos showing experienced climbers doing this sort of thing efficiently?  [EDIT] I spent some time on youtube, found these three videos that might be relevant: A, B, C.  In A, at 0:22, he uses a cam without any extension. He pulls it off his rack, bites it in his teeth, and then turns it around to place it. At 1:11 you can see that some cams are on a doubled short sling, not just on the little loop of webbing a camalot is normally sold with. It's not an alpine draw; there's only one biner. The slings look shorter than a normal 60 cm sling, maybe only 40 cm? At 1:52, he has a nut that already seems to be on a quickdraw. Was it racked this way, or did he clip the quickdraw on during the climb?  In B, at 0:25, he has his cam on its little loop of webbing, which he extends with a quickdraw. Seems pretty efficient. At 1:11, he places a cam, then there's a quick fade and he has a sling with a single biner on it, which he uses for extension. Was there another biner on that sling, which removed during the fade?  In C, he advocates a rack with 6 quickdraws and 2 alpine draws. I'd been using nothing but alpine draws. I had an instructor tell me that basically quickdraws were only for sport climbing, not trad, because (1) you need to have more extension available, and (2) the stiff quickdraw can twist your pieces out of their placements as you climb past them. "
106,Climbing Mount Teide from sea-level,"Is it possible to climb Mount Teide from sea-level in 2 days for a reasonably fit person? Essentially, I was thinking of walking up to the Altavista mountain refuge on the first day (can that be done in about 10 hours walking?) and then up to the summit (and back) on the second day (but probably take a bus back down to sea-level).  PS: I originally asked it on the travel site but was referred to this site as being more appropriate. "
107,Walking up the slopes. To walk brisk or to walk slow?,"This question has been eating my head for quite some time now.  I trek often and most of the treks involve climbing up to a peak or something similar. I usually carry heavy loads of around 13-15kgs on my back and I've always found that walking up the slopes of a hill/mountain at a brisker pace is easier with the heavier loads. I climb fast, rest for a minute or two and start off briskly again. However, I have met trekkers who have told me that this is not a good practice and it's better to maintain a slow pace while going up the slopes. I did try this a few times but a slower pace tires me down faster while carrying heavier loads.   Hence, which is better while walking up the slopes? Slower pace or the brisk one? Or is it just a matter of choice and nothing more? (Better in terms of the ease of the climb and avoiding injuries over a period of years)  I would appreciate both personal preferences as well as scientific answers for the question.  Note: I am not referring to high altitude climbs i.e more than 3000m (at higher altitudes, slow pace is the only one advisable due to acclimatization). Also, the slopes I refer to have gradients from 30 - 50 degrees.  Please note that I'm not worried about maintaining the group structure of a trekking group or the time taken for slow vs fast walk. I'm concerned about the injuries one might incur and the ease of the climb. "
108,What is the strength of an ATC belay device when used in a guide mode/multi-pitch setup?,"Does anyone know the strength of an ATC when used in a multi-pitch set up? It occurred to me that the entire weight of a climber is resting on the strength of the ATC clip and not on any carabiner. I know it is not likely, but say if the belayer did not take in slack while the climber was climbing and took a large fall, how much force would be exerted on the ATC?   I've looked at Black Diamond, and Petzl, neither of which have KN ratings on their multi-pitch belay devices. Any clue why?  [website][website]"
109,Are there any animal behaviors that can be used to predict weather conditions within a 24 hr time period?,"There are many folklore tales of animals being used to predict weather.  Just a few examples from the Old Farmers Almanac:   When cats sneeze, it is a sign of rain. If the mole digs its hole 2½ feet deep, expect severe weather; if two feet deep, not so severe; if one foot deep, a mild winter. Bats flying late in the evening indicates fair weather.   I have not been able to find much evidence to back these tales that I have come across.  However, although not necessarily a prediction, the relationship of a cricket's chirp to temperature does seem to show how in tune animals can be with weather conditions.  In fact, this relationship is also known as Dolbear's law, named after the American physicist Amos Dolbear, who published an article on the subject called The Cricket as a Thermometer. It is expressed as:  Tf=50+(N60-40/4)   where Tf is degrees in Fahrenheit  and N60 is chirps per minute  It is generally believed that Dolbear observed the snowy tree cricket to come up with his equation.  The formula is believed to be accurate to within a degree or so for the field cricket.  Generally speaking, the relationship is believed to hold true because as temperature rises, the cold blooded cricket's metabolism will also rise, providing more energy for muscle contractions and thus for chirping.  Are there observable behaviors to look for in animals that can be a harbinger of changing weather conditions?  For example, say you are on a 2-3 day hike with no way to access weather forecasts and somehow you forgot to check the forecast before leaving.      "
110,Behavioural differences between European and North American Wolves,"There as been the claim that European and North American wolves behave differently, especially when it comes to encounters with humans. This was brought up in a comment in this question on a wolf encounter in Bulgaria.  The claim seems to be that European wolves are more aggressive than their brethren across the pond.  Is this true? Are there measurable differences? What are the differences and can they be explained? "
111,Fending off a boar with an axe?,"So, this is likely a very very dumb question but I came across this question about wild boars while researching boar hunting and I was wondering if an axe would be at all useful against a boar if it was the only weapon/tool you had to use? I know that when hunting boar spears and bows have been used in the past but I can't find anything on how effective an axe might be. Because of the tough hide, I am assuming the axe wouldn't do much but, could it be used to at least distract the boar long enough to run for the nearest tree? I have no hunting experience at all, so like I said at the beginning this could be a very dumb question. "
112,Is there any measurable effect on acclimatization rate for people living in middle mountains?,"Do people living in middle mountains (500-1000 m.asl) have any measurable advantage against lowlanders when it comes to acclimatization?   Are there measurable differences in blood cells density?   I've read some article stating that about 25% of people can exhibit first symptoms of mountain sickness on 2500m, for the other 75% it's about 4500m. Are there any studies comparing that rate based on what height the people live?  "
113,When and why were House Sparrows originally brought to the United States?,"The common House Sparrow, Passer domesticus, is one of the few birds not protected under federal law in North America, because it's considered a non-native species. However, it currently lives in virtually every state, many of them year round.   What's the history of the introduction of this bird to North America? Why were they brought there? From where did they come? Into what States or regions of North America were they introduced? Was there one period of introduction, or did they take place at different times?  "
114,What plants can be heard when they are growing?,"Growing up in the Midwest, USA I have heard of being able to hear corn grow on a quiet night.  I believe I may have actually experienced this at one time while waiting for some co-workers in the middle of a cornfield on a calm, hot and humid July day.  There was a very faint sound like broken glass rubbing together.  There is actually some research to back up acoustics associated with corn growing:     ""Material breakage is a lot like a microscopic earthquake: the sudden   release of internal stresses sends sound waves radiating in every   direction,"" Cook explained. ""We're using special sensors called   piezoelectric contact microphones to monitor the sounds emitted by   corn stalks just before failure. This helps us understand the failure   process more clearly.""   Source: Can you hear corn grow?  Yes!   There are other plants that grow just as fast or faster than corn, but I've never heard of actually being able to hear of any other type of plant grow.  Are there any other plants that can be heard while they are growing?   "
115,How accurate is the 3.5 - 5 degree F temperature drop per 1000 feet rule of thumb?,"Related Q (especially its link to inversion): What is the relationship between altitude gain and temperature decrease when mountaineering?  This question is concerning the commonly used rule of thumb that an increase in elevation of 1000 feet will, on average, decrease the temperature by 3.3 to 5 degrees F (3.3 for moist air, 5 for dry). Some sources differ slightly in the exact numbers, but 3.3 and 5 are what I have seen most often.  TL;DR  I have read that local conditions on a mountain can trump this rule of thumb. Trying to understand this better, I found some examples of temperature increasing going up. I am wondering if this is a common occurrence or a rare one.  How closely can we trust this rule of thumb? Said another way: How often does reality deviate sufficiently from this rule of thumb to reduce its usefulness?  My specific example  I camped on Cascade Mountain in the Adirondacks at about 1500 to 2000 feet (460 to 610 meters) higher elevation than nearby Lake Placid. The temperature at Lake Placid was 37 F (3 C). One of the forest preserve stewards told me the next morning that she expected the temperature on the mountain to be below freezing.  This is not a huge elevation difference and perhaps not a great sample, but I am hoping to use it to help understand the conditions I was in and better prepare for future.  The mountain was wet below the tree line, so I would go with the lower change estimate.     Temp difference: 3.3 x 1.5 = 4.95 = approximately 5 F and 3.3 * 2 = 6.6 F, so...      Estimated temp: 37 - 5 = 32 F to 37 - 6.6 = 30.4 F   Estimate: 30 to 32 degrees F at my elevation. 27 to 29 F (about -1 to -3 C) if we use the 5 degrees per 1000 feet estimate.  Since it did not feel below freezing and I never noticed anything frozen or frosted, am I correct to assume that the rule of thumb was not accurate in our case and that it was not actually at or below freezing? I still am not sure how often the inaccuracies/inversions actually happen and am wondering if I can assume that it was the case in my situation.  In other words: what is the likelihood that the rule of thumb is not accurate? Is the likelihood high enough that we should always take the estimate with a grain (or more) of salt, or is the likelihood low enough that I should trust the estimate more than my gut based on how I feel? "
116,Mountain weather archive,"Are there any weather, or at least temperature, archives for mountains?  I have read that this information is very spotty, that it is not recorded for many mountains. In searching for this data, however, I have found weather services which forecast weather for mountains at various elevations.  Though obviously recorded temperature is better, it would be useful if there was at least an archive of the predicted temperature. That would be better than nothing, assuming these mountain weather forecasts are somewhat reliable, which is something I do not know.  Are there any temperature archives for mountains? "
117,How warm should a sleeping bag be to sleep in summer in the Alps comfortably?,"I am looking to buy an ultralight sleeping bag, that would be warm enough for sleeping in the Alps in summer comfortably. I would be sleeping in a tent on a sleeping mat. I would probably be staying at around 2000, max 2500 meters. And I would expect I could be out there in between June and September. According to my research on the Internet, the lowest temperatures at that time and altitude should be around 0°C, possibly a couple degrees below, but most likelly a bit above. How warm do I need the sleeping bag to be?  Actually, I believe my question can be subdivided in the following subquestions:   Can I safelly assume, that it will not get much below 0°C in summer in the Alps at around 2000 meters altitude? How much warmer will it be inside a tent? (very small two-person tent, two layers, no heaters) Sleeping bags have temperature ratings for three categories: comfort, limit and extreem. Should I look at the lowest value of ""comfort"" temperature if I want to be able to sleep without feeling cold?   UPDATE:  So I have bought a sleeping bag, and would like to update the question with my experience.   I have decided to go with the ultralight (and expensive) option in the end. My new sleeping bag is rated +4°C comfort, and -1°C limit. I have tested it on a few trips in the mountains during this summer. When sleeping on warm summer nights at altitudes around 1500m, it was actually too warm. No surprise there, and not a problem either.   Another trip I took was in the end of September, when the nights were fairly cold already. I am not sure about the exact temperature, but it must have been in between 0 and 5°C. I was sleeping at around 2400. I must admit, I was a bit worried, but the only time I was cold was while cooking dinner outside of the tent. The sleeping bag combined with a cotton sleeping bag liner was certainly enough.   "
118,Are drop bears dangerous?,"I recently visited Australia, Sydney region. I've been warned about animals called drop bears. What kind of animal is it? Is it dangerous ?  "
119,Can any waterborne pathogens survive boiling?,"I know that boiling does little to break down chemical contaminants or heavy metals. But I'm unsure if it kills all microbial life. Are there any waterborne illness-causing viruses/bacteria/protozoa/cysts that can survive boiling? And if so, how serious is the illness they cause? "
120,How do I tie a sleeping bag to my backpack?,"I recently upgraded to a modern backpack and I'm stumped as to how to tie accessories down to it.  My previous backpack had tie-down points on the bottom of the pack that I could attach long straps to, which allowed me to tie down my sleeping back, tent, and a small sleeping pad.  My new pack lacks these generic tie-down anchors, and instead has two (smallish) straps on the bottom.  They're perhaps large enough for my tent, but certainly not large enough for my sleeping bag.  There's a waterproof ""top lid"" that can bind down, it's not impossible to stuff the sleeping bag between the pack and the top lid and cinch it down, but this is sort of awkward and top-heavy.  What's the proper strategy here?  Any tips for attaching my sleeping bag and tent to my pack?  Edit:  I'm not totally opposed to putting my tent and sleeping bag in the pack, especially for short and light trips, but on a multi-week outing, I may end up with the lion's share of the gear and food to haul, depending on the company.  If there's a clever way to have stuff outside my pack, it would be nice to have the option. "
121,How can I start a fire by rubbing two sticks together?,"When trying to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together, what does one need to consider? I am assuming I can't just grab any two sticks and start rubbing...    Should they be dead or green?  Hard wood or soft wood?  Is spinning or scraping more efficient?  "
122,What precautions should I take to protect myself and my camp from bears?,"Most of my prior hiking experience has been in areas that are not home to bears, so what precautions should I take to protect my camp (and myself as I am hiking) from bears.  I am aware of a couple of things, like having a bell or noisemaker on my pack, and hanging my food from a tree.  Are these effective?  I have also seen bear-proof canisters for sale for storing my food.  Are those preferable to hanging it from a tree? "
123,"As an experienced backpacker in the Eastern US, what should I know before hiking in the Western US?","I have done a good deal of hiking and backpacking in the Eastern US (mostly in New England), but I recently moved to California.  What are the major differences in terms of preparation or equipment that I should be packing?  I am talking more about hiking in wooded areas (as opposed to deserts).  What new challenges will I see from the terrain, wildlife, etc, and how can I prepare for it? "
124,How do I avoid leeches?,The last time I was attacked by leeches I thought I'd taken enough precautions such as pulling my socks over my trousers and avoiding walking through particularly wet areas or long grass but I still got them sucking on my ankles. What are the best methods to prevent them finding you interesting in the first place? And what will stop them finding your skin if they do take an interest? 
125,What should I do when I'm lost?,"What should I do when I get disoriented or lost?  How can I find help or make myself easier to find?  This is a general question to do when lost in the wilderness, whether it is a meadow or mountain.   "
126,How should I treat hypothermia?,"When I recognize the symptoms of hypothermia, how should I treat it? And what are the dangers if the symptoms are ignored? "
127,Which stove fuel has best weight to bulk to heat ratio?,"Pack stoves come in a variety of flavors, consuming white gas, denatured alcohol, propane, wood, gels, unleaded, kerosene... etc.  Given the assumption that I will be carrying all the fuel I need (no wood collecting), and that all stoves weigh the same (big assumption, but for the sake of the discussion, lets try it...) which one provides the highest heat-output per gram of fuel?   If we consider the weight of non-reusable containers, does that significantly change things?  Is any one significantly bulkier? "
128,Is drinking urine safe?,We've all heard stories about how people saved their lives by drinking their urine.  Is drinking urine safe when there are no other water sources available?  Can I filter it with a water purifier?  
129,How can I identify edible berries/fruit from poisonous?,How can I identify edible berries/fruit in the wide and avoid the poisonous varieties? Is there a general guideline that can be followed or is specific to each plant? 
130,What is the difference between men's and women's hiking boots?,"When I bought my current pair of hiking boots, the brand/style I tried on and liked was out of stock in the womens version, so the storeperson offered me the mens ones instead. I tried them, liked them, and have used them for hiking ever since. They are incredibly comfortable and provide a ton of ankle support.  So I can't help but wonder: did I miss out on anything by not getting the women's version? In what way would  they be ""better"" for me as a woman? "
131,What is the difference between camber and rocker shaped snowboards?,"When looking at snowboards, they are described as being camber-shaped, rocker-shaped, or a hybrid?   What's the difference between them, and when is one preferred over the other? "
132,How do I find known and documented trails for trail running in New England?,"In my past experiences running on trails, the paths are demarcated for hikers and bikers and I learned about these running-appropriate paths through word of mouth and in person park information. After moving to New England and the New York area, I haven't been able to discover a definitive resource for finding wooded running trails that include some information and reviews about the path and surrounding area. Does a resource like this exist describing running trails in this area? If not, how do I find running appropriate trails? "
133,Serrated vs flat-edge knives,"Each has their purpose, I'm sure. So for what activities is each better? When would I use one over the other? What about half-serrated blades?  "
134,How did/do scouts venture into the wild?,"Scouts, messengers, pioneers exploring the frontiers of civilization - images of these sorts of characters paints an ancient archetype, one that I think could be useful to understand in present times. There may even be similar characters today. I'm hard pressed to find good information about these types of characters who scout out terrain, more specifically: what did their equipment and habits look like in their adventures?  To clarify my search: I'm trying to figure out the general pattern of equipment and habits (ways of life) among the characters I listed above. Who are those characters specifically: could be American frontier explorers (e.g. James Beckwourth or Hugh Glass) or mountain men, a per-Columbian Mesoamerican scout, perhaps even a messenger of civilizations past (I am especially interested in those traveling in uncharted terrain, so the messenger archetype may be less relevant given the use of roads, maps, and potentially backup and support en route). Military examples which focus on more than just an individual or small group aren't relevant to this question in that they apply much less to civilian interactions with the Great Outdoors.  I realize this varies by place &amp; time, and that this may be better fit for history. To clear that up: I am interested in overall patterns, so specifics of a certain time/place are helpful but specifics from multiple times/places and comparisons thereof are even better. Since I am trying to extrapolate this to the present, to learn lessons about how I can prepare for and interact with the Great Outdoors today and in the future, I see this as relevant to TGO.SE. A comparison of past examples of gear/practices to modern equivalents is very welcome. There may be modern examples that could help answer my question too (e.g. if we look into the lives of relatively modern vagabonds or wilderness backpackers).  In case this is too broad, as if a book could be written about it: answers of books or resources already written about this are much help! So far, a lot of looking yields only small tidbits of info here and there, so I could use a well-marked trail to clarity by someone who has tried to answer this before.    To reiterate: what equipments and habits are common through times and places among scouts and people exploring frontiers, journeying through the Great Outdoors? "
135,Whippet as trekking pole?,"I was wondering if whippet could be used as a trekking pole? Question arises from hiking on steep hills (no snow, dry grass), where any additional grip would be really helpful. I've read that most people offer to use ice axes in this kind of situation, but I was thinking, if I already use trekking poles, wouldn't I be able to accomplish two things (stability while walking and self-arrest/assist) if I'd substitute trekking poles for a whippet?    "
136,Hunting bears with a knife?,"Michael Strogoff by Jules Verne (1876) describes how Siberian hunters used to hunt bears with nothing but a knife. This was ideally done with a single lethal blow, to damage the fur as little as possible.     [Michael Strogoff] was between the bear and the girl. His arm made one movement upwards, and the enormous beast, ripped up by that terrible knife, fell to the ground as a lifeless mass. He had executed in splendid style the famous blow of the Siberian hunters, who endeavor not to damage the precious fur of the bear, which fetches a high price.   A modern source from 2008 describes that the bear can be first trapped with a wooden pole, and stabbed afterwards. That could indicate that the Verne passage is an over-simplification of the actual technique.     On whether people really hunt bears with knives:      Emelianenko: Yes, they do. A few years ago there was an unfortunate incident. One sportsman, a world champion in wrestling ... what was he doing? Yes, he was putting a fork under the bear’s neck. [The practice of hunting bears with a knife involves, once the bear is in front of you, placing a long stick with a letter U-shaped end under the bear’s muzzle as it rears up to fight. Once the stick is in place, the bear isn’t able to bring its body down and the hunter stabs it a number of times, ideally killing it instantly.]      And then the bear couldn’t attack him, and he was stabbing it under the ribs in the heart. And as he was stabbing it, that bear swung with its paw. It was dead already -- the paw was its last gasp with all its strength and basically took half of the wrestler’s head off. And of course the other hunters opened fire on the bear, but it was too late. He went to try his luck with a bear, and it didn’t come off.      For me everything is still fine. I’m OK. I’ve done it and it was OK. About half a year ago, it was in Russia, in Siberia. Everything was fine. I put the fork underneath him and stabbed him in the heart. And that was it. The other hunters dismembered, prepared the bear.   How exactly are bears hunted with knives? I am specifically looking for the technique used by Siberian hunters in the past, but other examples could also be applicable.  Do these techniques still have practical usage nowadays? I would assume that bullets damage the fur more than a single knife wound. "
137,Will a compass work underground or underwater?,"Because they rely on radio signals, GPS units generally do not work underground or underwater, but what about a plain ol' magnetic compass?  Are the magnetic fields of earth present at all depths?  Does water do anything to attenuate them?  Can I go spelunking with a compass to help me keep my bearings or even go through a train tunnel in a mountain (contrived example)?  Do divers use compasses regularly? "
138,The bow's length and its influence,"I'm looking for buying a new recurve bow for field archery. I currently shoot a Hoyt dorado and I love it. I have two sets of limbs for it. One #35 set that I use for field and another #50 that I use for hunting. I love shooting it specially because of its length (60"" tip to tip) but I'm also aware the bow is too short for my draw length of 29.5 inches.  I know that bow length needs to match the draw length mostly because you lose precision when overdrawing it as soon as the string stops touching the limbs and just hold on the tips, string can swing sideways and affect arrow travel. (Unless you're natural for the sport. :) ). Similar thing happens to long bowers as the string doesn't actually rest on the limbs and instead it just held on the tips.  So, I've been thinking of buying a new bow, target type to use for field and I also know the minimum length would be something around 68"" (longer than that, the bow would become more forgiving).  Is there anything in my understand that is actually wrong? Also, what else could be affected with a shorter bow?  Thanks "
139,"If I get a ticket for fishing without license, will buying a licence make my ticket go away?",I live in Oklahoma where a relative and I were fishing.   We are new to fishing and didn't know you needed a license. We got stopped and the game warden gave us two options: buy a temp license or get a ticket.  We didn't have the $90 bucks so we got the ticket.  Then he said if we come back later that week and give him $50 for a temp license he will drop the ticket and we won't have to go to court.  We later got our license  from a store and when we contacted him he said it doesn't matter: we either get the temp license from him or the ticket will process through the court.  He also said that the difference is that we didn't have the license beforehand. So we still got the citation but we're not sure how buying a temp license from him isn't the same?  Should we fight this in court? 
140,"What sort of crane, and what sort of snake?","In an area near where I work in Monterey, I often walk during the noon hour and end up in a meadow that is much-beloved to red-winged blackbirds.  The other day I saw something unusual, though - as I walked into the meadow, I noticed a large bird - some sort of crane, I reckon - with a large black snake half-swallowed. When it (the bird) noticed me, it flew off several dozen yards, and then landed again at the far end of the meadow, standing there again, with the snake dangling. The snake must have been already dead, because it wasn't flopping around. I walked toward it/them to get a better look. The bird then lifted its head skyward, gulped down the snake, and flew off.  I didn't know cranes or crane-like birds ate snakes, and I'd never seen a big black (or dark brown) snake around here before. Is this normal behavior? What type of bird was it, probably? What type of snake was it, probably?  Hopefully not a rattlesnake, because they give me the fantods, even though I've only gotten close enough to to hear one rattle once. "
141,How long should you leave a synthetic sleeping bag compressed?,"How long can you leave a synthetic sleeping bag in compressed its stuff sack before you lose insulation? 2 days? 2 weeks? 2 months? The manufacturers say ""long periods"", but don't define it. "
142,Donating blood at higher altitudes and Acclimatization,"While I was re-reading this question where there is a lot discussed about impact of higher altitude on the physiology, acclimatization and things around it. Though, I have had put in an answer in the way I could study and think of.  One question that alarmed my mind, what impact does the blood donation may have on acclimatization.   If the situation asks for it, should a mountaineer be donating blood at higher altitude? (I personally would do that without a second thought). What precautions should one take later?  Does that mean that he/she should repeat an acclimatization programme/excursion? If yes, should there be changes in the routine.   Altitude I am referring to is close to 17K feet. "
143,How to avoid cracking your windshield while strapping down a kayak,"I have an 18 ft. fiberglass sea-kayak, which I mount to the roof-rack of my junky old station wagon with Yakima ""Sweetroll"" saddles - ratchet straps around the saddles and bow and stern to the bumpers. Unfortunately, while on a recent trip I suddenly noticed a 3-inch crack materialize in my windshield, which rapidly grew to an 18-inch crack.   I didn't see any impact that started the fracture and no part of the mount or the straps actually rests on the windshield - so I'm concerned it was the tension of the bow and stern guy-lines flexing the roof and putting too much pressure on the glass. The windshield is fixed, but I'm a little gun-shy about putting it up there again. Is there a better way to distribute the pressure on the roof? Should I just not ratchet the bow guy line down as hard? (I generally ratchet it down pretty tight to keep the strap from vibrating madly) "
144,First ascents by Edward Whymper,Edward Whymper is most known for his sweeping ascent of the Matterhorn 150 years ago. You can read about the competition with J.A. Carrel and the struggle to find a path to the top in the famous book Scrambles Amongst the Alps. By the way indeed a nice book because Whymper made wood engravings for a living and therefore there are lots of beautiful pictures in the book made by Whymper himself!    Here a list of mountains I have read that Whymper was first climber:   Chimborazo Cotopaxi Antisana Pichincha Cayambe Sincholagua   Are there more volcanos in Ecuador he climbed first? Did he first summit on his trips to the Canadian Rockies too?  Would love to get a complete list or even more infos/links for this great mountaineer. 
145,Stronger bond between GoPro mount and helmet?,"I used a regular curved helmet mount for my GoPro on my recent snowboarding trip, which comes self-adhesive.  At one point I fell on my back and hit the back of my helmet, the shock of which unglued the mount from the helmet.  Luckily, I was able to find it as it wasn't too far.  Is there a way to make the adhesive bond between the mount and the helmet stronger?  Should I add some super glue over the existing layer of the peel-off adhesive surface? "
146,Memory foam mattress topper for camping?,"I bought a queen-sized four-inch memory topper and cut it into two halves to get two twin(ish)-sized toppers.  I use one half on my bed at home, but that left me with another extra half.  I've heard people talk about using memory foam toppers for camping, and so I've taken this topper out into the outdoors (car camping only) on several occasions as well.  Cool weather  The problem is, I've had mixed results.  In cooler weather, the memory foam gets cold and hard and is only comfortable once you wait for the foam to warm up directly underneath you.  If you move in your sleep, this can be disturbing, as you have to wait for the foam underneath you to warm up for it to be comfortable. This isn't a huge deal, but it's not as comfortable as the same topper at room-temperature.  Warm weather  In warmer weather, the memory foam loses its ""memory"" and just ends up being super squishy foam. I believe it retained heat (in the summer, not cooler weather!) more than I would have liked.  Again, not as comfortable.  Has anyone else tried this?  Is your experience different from mine? What am I doing wrong? "
147,Most efficient training before alpine hiking/climbing?,"I am planning a trip to the Alps, where I'll do some mountaineering, mostly on rocks (little or no ice) at altitudes around 4000 m. I expect to do mostly scrambling, with only a few places per day where we'll need to climb with protection.  In the time left (a few months), I would like to improve my fitness. I can devote 30-60 minutes a day and a few additional hours at weekends.  Which types of exercise should I do, to prepare my body most effectively?   Running  How important is it to do interval training? Is it important to run uphill? Downhill? If yes, how steep? Should I carry weight?  Walking  I can devote a few hours at weekends to hiking with weight. How important is this? Should I carry the same amount of weight that I expect to use in the mountains? Maybe more? Or should I carry less, and aim for speed instead?  Biking  I do mountainbiking for fun, but I feel that it doesn't give me much advantage in fitness for mountains. Is there any way to adjust mountainbiking for this specific purpose?  I do gym and rock climbing 2-3 times a week. Do I need any other anaerobic exercises?  "
148,Ice axe and crampon post winter cleaning/preparation,So winter is well and truly over in Wales. Pretty much all the snow has melted and the weather is improving. So it's time to retire my winter gear until next winter.   What should I do with my Ice Axe and Crampons to ensure they're in tip top condition for next winter? Should I oil or clean them? What about any patches of surface rust? I'm thinking about cleaning them all off with a wire brush. 
149,How to top belay 2 climbers at the same time on multi-pitch climb?,"Senario: I am leading the climb with 2 ropes. I reach at the first pitch. I put myself on the self anchor and  built a master point. Now I want to top belay 2 climbers at the same time. They both will be climbing with approximately 15-20 feet of distance between them. I know how to top belay 2 climbers simultaneously with the following ATC:   Link     the ATC-Guide features a lightweight design, two friction modes and an   auto-blocking guide mode that lets you belay a seconding climber off   the anchor.     But I don't have this ATC with me. I have this one:   Link  I wanted to know if I can give a simul--top belay to 2 climbers using the ATC shown above?  And is it safe to do it? If not can anyone suggest me a another time efficient way of climbing a multi-pitch route with 3 people in a team?  Equipment that I have includes ATC, 2 Ropes, 20-Quick Draws (sport route), slings and cordelette.  "
150,Are all Ants and Termites edible?,Watching wildlife shows you frequently see omnivores (i.e. bears) eating ants and termites.  We have the existing Q&amp;A Eating ants/termites on outdoor expeditions explaining that some ants and termites are very good for people to eat.  I am wondering if all Ants and Termites are safe to eat?  Are there some that are not safe?  If so how can I tell which are safe which are not safe?  
151,How should I prepare my body for prolonged exposure to heat?,"Today I hiked for about 4 hours, and I ended up with sun stroke (terrible headache, trembling etc.). The heat was moderate (about 30°C, 86°F in shade), and the way was half in forest. I had a baseball cap on my head and I drank a lot (about 2.5 liter water). I was not dehydrated, judging from urine amount/color. So in theory, I did what was necessary to prepare myself. However, it seems that my body was overwhelmed in spite of this.  Is there anything I can do to prepare my body for heat? The people on Savanna, for example, are living with much higher temperatures and full day exposure to sun, and I wouldn't handle that in my today's condition. Is this a genetic factor, or it can be trained, for example sauna, intensive exercises or simply exposure to heat? "
152,Do squirrels have front and full peripheral vision?,"Our suburban yard in Massachusetts has a small woodsy area. We use a section for feeders for birds, chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, and the occasional bear or fox.   In an area of our patio, at least 20 feet from the closest feeder and that group of large trees, we put food down and stay within a few inches of, and sometimes directly on, the pile. Certain chipmunks, who we recognize by their markings, know where and when to wait for that food, and happily eat at our feet and even on our shoes.   This year, for the first time, a few squirrels have been daring enough to come  close and eat. I'm surprised because they're usually quite skittish as they get nearer to the house.    In the first two pictures, I'm standing just behind the leaf at the bottom right corner, and the little squirrel, possibly a young Red Squirrel, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, is not more than a foot away. He stood in that sideways position for a few minutes, then turned to face me. He then came closer, right under my feet, to find whatever whole seeds had been left by the chipmunks, and ate for a while. (I didn't take a picture then for fear of scaring him away.)  In the other two pictures, I'm in pretty much the same place, although it's hard to tell. I believe that squirrel is an Eastern Grey, Sciurus carolinensis, which is common here in America, Canada, and also in a variety of countries in the UK. He starts by looking tentatively towards me, then moves to where that food is and puts his head down to eat. I don't know if he chose that pile of food because it was the nearest to him, but I assume so.   I'm wondering what they're seeing in each of their body positions. Can they see me, or the chipmunk, only with both eyes facing me, or do they only need one? Can the grey squirrel with his head down eat and watch me at the same time? Can these positions also allow them to see what's happening around or above them?   I'm also curious if it's seeing the cat, but there's glass in between them, so there might be glare or other factors. The cat's always pouncing against that window and the squirrels and chipmunks never run away, so either they don't see her or they feel safe knowing they're protected by the window. I admit I really just added the cat picture because it's cute!   This is not meant to be a highly scientific question. I'm just curious because I spend so much time watching and interacting with my backyard animals, and their behavior fascinates me!   Click on the pictures for larger view.        "
153,Double Mariner Mechanical Advantage,"Petzl have a diagram on their website for what they call a Double Mariner.

154,Is it possible to drive through the Simpson Desert in an AWD?,"To drive through a couple hundred kilometers of sandy landscape like the Simpson Desert (central Australia), do you have to have a 4WD? If so, what are the primary concerns? "
155,Is it possible to walk from the UK/France to Georgia?,"I really want to go to the country of Georgia but don't have enough money to fly there. I had a genius idea and decided that I could hire a boat and get across the English channel to France, and then walk from France to Georgia. If I walk for 12 hours a day, at a kilometer (approximately 1/2 mile) every 15 minutes, then I will get to Georgia in 84 days. (I worked it out!)  So I have two questions:   Am I even allowed to waltz my way from France to Georgia? Are there any maps? Are there any maps to give me a route to Georgia?   I understand that you may think I'm just asking a silly question, but seriously, I want to know if I could walk to Georgia one day. I would need to make sure I have at least 1/3 of a year spare to do it though. "
156,Can hiking boots with Gore-tex lining be stretched?,I have a pair of leather Vasque St. Elias GTX which are a bit narrow across the toe box and I want to see if I can get some more room there.  A local shoe repair place said they could do it (for $6 USD and two days on the stretcher).    Can this be safely done without damaging the Gore-Tex lining?  Or any other part of the boot?    I imagine it depends on the amount of stretch.  I was going to ask for an extra 1/8 inch of width to start. 
157,How long is Gore-Tex lining in boots effective?,"I was reading a recent answer and found this statement     for the great majority of users, Gore-Tex boot liners fail anyway, and sooner rather than later if any real mileage is being covered. In fact, most experienced users tend to avoid Gore-Tex boots.   I have a 10+ year old pair of leather red wings boots with Gore-Tex linning. I wore them enough that the tread is pretty much gone, and never noticed a leak.  But I am not walking through much water with them anymore. I also put mink oil on the leather occasionally.   How long is Gore-Tex lining in boots effective? Is it distance or age that causes it to fail sooner? Do most experienced users really try to avoid Gore-Tex lining in boots?  "
158,"Can I safely camp in deer tick country, and if so, how?","Most of my camping has been above timberline and ticks have never been a problem.  However, a day in the garden at home in northern Virginia often results in a deer tick or two, despite long pants and long sleeves and DEET.       There's been a suggestion of a short camping trip close to home, but it is a banner year for deer ticks here, and the mere thought of sleeping on the ground here makes me feel itchy.  Am I overreacting?  Is there a way to enjoy a couple of nights outdoors without becoming a host to hordes of these tiny thirsty critters?   A complication is that I prefer not to sleep in a tent if the weather is good.  Is a tent necessary to avoid deer ticks?  "
159,Dangers of swimming with algae (potentially Eurasian Watermilfoil),"I took my first lake swim recently and found my lake has a fair amount algae, which bothered me more than I expected it too.  After some limited research, I found someone saying that it's Eurasian Watermilfoil (though I'm not sure that's correct), here's a picture:    For an idea of volume, you can see the video here (skip to 41s [probably turn the volume off too]):  Video of windsurfing with a good view of the lake's plantlife (YouTube video in French)  Are there any dangers of swimming with this stuff(assuming volume and proximity to surface are the same as in the video)?  Specifically my concerns are:   Getting caught up in it Something living in it taking a dislike to me   What (if any) are the dangers, and what can i do to mitigate them?   Lake is Lac Miribel Jonage, Lyon, France if that helps- ignore if it makes the question too specific "
160,Why do so many people hike with such light footwear?,"More and more, I see people hiking with very light-weight shoes.  To me, they look like regular sport shoes and they look to be lacking thick soles, waterproofness, or ankle support.  I thought this was a US phenomenon, but I saw that in two UK outdoor stores I visited, most shoes sold are such.  For example, a recent trip to Southern Utah, I partly hiked on popular trails in Zion National Park, such as the trail to Scout Lookout/Angels Landing and the trail to Observation Point.  Both trails include serious slopes where classical hiking boots (see picture below) would appear essential to me, yet I saw hundreds of people who hiked in lightweight shoes that looked unsuitable to me.  I observed the same in Bryce Canyon National Park, where a park newspaper lists improper footwear in a top-10 of injury causes as cause #3, #2 and #1. I did not notice this phenomenon on more remote trails or in other countries such as Norway, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, where outdoor stores sell hiking boots rather than city shoes.  Why do so many people hike in serious mountains with light-weight footwear?  Is it an active choice?  I've tried sport shoesonce or twice for a short distance, and it was painful — I can't understand that someone would hike anything that isn't flat tarmac in such shoes.  They wouldn't keep my feet dry beyond the first stream crossing, either.  By a proper hiking boot, I mean something like this:    By lightweight sport shoes, I mean something like this:    In Scandinavia, many people I meet hike in even higher boots, arguing they are more suitable to keep the feet dry.  I imagine that to be true, but I've never tried hiking in them and I don't think I've seen people using them outside Scandinavia:    Do people actively choose hiking in lighter shoes (perhaps part of the American ultralight fashion?), or is it simply a matter of unpreparedness?  (See also: What is the point of hiking boots, versus any comfortable walking shoes?) "
161,How can I tell a “trail shoe” from a regular sport shoe?,"On a day-to-day basis, I wear regular light-weight sport shoes, such as these:    The footwear I saw people using in serious terrain in the USA looked similar, but this answer to my related question points out those are trail shoes.  The concept of trail shoes is new to me, and I have not seen people hiking in those prior to my recent US trip, or I mistook them for sport shoes.  How can I tell apart a trail shoe from a regular light sport shoe?  Searching Google for trail shoes links either to running shoes or to shoes no different from the ones above.  Presumably, they are different from the ones above, that I wouldn't want to wear even for a 2-hour hike in the English countryside, let alone for a mountain trail (I tried exactly once and I've rarely had such painful feet, so either my shoes are different, or I am different).  Do people get trail shoes from cottage industry manufacturers or are they sold in regular stores (just hard to distinguish from sport shoes)?  I suppose it depends on aspects like Gore-Tex™, Vibram™ soles, protection against rocks, etc., but perhaps there is more. "
162,Do all American Summer Camps end with an award ceremony?,"As a Brit I've very little knowledge of American-style summer camps (none, in fact, beyond Addam's Family Values) however I'm attempting to help organise such an event this Summer.   I've been told that the only way to end a summer camp is with an award ceremony. Is this correct? Should parents/families be invited? "
163,Is it possible to differentiate between a dog print and wolf print?,This question got my thinking:  Did I see a wolf's paw print?.   I did a bit of Googling and it appeared that wolf paw prints and dog paw prints are very very similar. Is there any good way (given that the size of a dog and wolf can be very similar) to differentiate between them? 
164,Legal liabilities of non-profit guiding in adventure sports,"I am a whitewater kayaker and I often show people down rivers I'm familiar with on their first time down. I take special joy in doing so and consider it community service. The only compensation is maybe a few cold ones at the end of the day, of course optional.  However, is there any legal liability to me as a non-profit guide in case of injury or worse? How about if the person is a minor? Should I always refuse a minor without an explicit parental permission? Doesn't happen very often but every once in a while a high school looking kid in the parking lot is asking for someone to paddle with. "
165,What are the advantages and disadvantages of a paracord knife handle?,"Whenever I browse knife shops or online stores I see many fixed-blade knives whose handles are essentially just a piece of paracord wrapped around the tang. From my anecdotal experience this also seems to be a fairly popular choice - I'd guess that easily 25% of fixed bladed knives in local shops/stores have such a handle (I live in Switzerland).  Personally I always disliked these kind of handles: if I spend some 100-300+ $ for a good knife I'd like to get a quality product, and for me this includes the handle. Why would I want a handle consisting of just a piece of string?   A nice wooden or synthetic/carbon/etc. handle provides way better grip in my opinion, also it can't soak up water, and it's just over all a lot sturdier.   Why are paracord handles so popular? What is the idea behind it?  I get that you could unravel the paracord in an emergency, but let's be honest: a couple of foot length of paracord are not gonna decide over whether you live or die. And would it really be worth making your knife awkward and uncomfortable to handle just to get a piece of string? "
166,What water is fit for cleaning hands & gear during a visit to the Great Outdoors?,"I am looking to setup dish and hand washing stations for a group of folks in a fairly-wild woodland, in a car-camping summertime setting, for 2-5 days (depending on the occasion). Is stream water fit for cleaning hands, dishes, waste bins/buckets? Water used for cooking or drinking will be well-boiled or from a known-potable source.  I'm hoping the answer to the overarching question will satisfy these sub-questions:   Can stream water be used for washing dishes, cups, and hands, or does it need to first be filtered/purified?  What if that stream water is used in combination with biodegradable plant-based camp soap? Does vinegar or bleach need to be added to the container full of washing water to make it safe? Does temperature matter? If so, how much and what is preferable?   Emphasis on avoiding illness for a group of people with diverse outdoor experience/background.    This might be a tricky question because it probably depends so much on the river/water source. In this particular case, the stream I'm considering is one that flows well and pretty cold year-round, located in the Adirondack Park of New York. It's not in total wilderness but in a pretty remote area anyway.   I and others don't consider it potable without treatment, but I wouldn't expect to die from drinking it and wouldn't be surprised if I was perfectly unharmed by drinking from it for a weekend...though for that matter, I wouldn't be surprised if I was pretty harmed by doing so - yet to do any water quality test on it. "
167,How do membrane-based boots breathe?,"Yesterday I was shopping for breathable waterproof boots* and this is what the salesperson explained to me. The shoe material does NOT matter. The damp air from the foot goes through the membrane (Gore-Tex) to an intermediate ""pocket"" between the membrane and the outside shell of the shoe. Once the shoe is removed, the dampness begins flowing back through the membrane and into the air, thus drying the shoe.  Is this correct? Do shoes not breathe through the outer layer at all?  * - I call 'boots' any shoes, that are high enough to support the ankle, but mainly leather ones "
168,When is it OK to hike off trail?,"I visited my local forest preserve recently (in a suburb of Chicago, IL) and found new signs every mile or so that read something to the effect of      Please stay on the trail so as to preserve the natural environment   beyond the trail.   Part of the joy for me in visiting a piece of nature is to go off the trail from time to time, so I found this new notice a bid disheartening. This particular forest preserve is about 4 miles long and 0.25 miles wide with a small river/stream running through it, and has lots of deer within its boundaries. My initial guess about this new rule is that perhaps because of the small size of the preserve and the amount of people frequenting it, they needed to create this additional restriction to minimize the wear on the surrounding land/habitat.  After doing Google search on ""off trail hiking"" I found at least one national park that says it's OK to do this on their property: Off Trail Hiking.  So, I now know that ""hiking exclusively on the trail"" is not a universal rule in the US.  My original question: How common is this rule of staying strictly on the trail for forest preserves vs. a state/federal forest park?  My updated question (based on some responses below): How to know whether it is alright to hike off-trail in a particular nature area when there is no signage saying otherwise?    Followup: The comments below inspired me to take the basic hour-long Awareness Course from the ""Leave No Trace"" website: Online Awareness Course. I thought it was very informative in addition to the other info on that site, and helped address my question. "
169,Avoiding leaks from stove and fuel bottles?,"I used to use a liquid hydrocarbon-fuel stove for backpacking, but I hated it, one of the main reasons being that the stove and/or fuel bottle were always leaking and stinking up my car and pack. Mainly for that reason, I switched to using an alcohol stove for summer backpacking, and I'm very happy with it.  However, the alcohol stove is less than optimal for mountaineering in snow, since it takes a long time to melt snow, and may be difficult to start in very cold conditions. For that reason I've bought a newer, lighter hydrocarbon-fueled stove (MSR XGK).  How do I avoid the noisome leaks? Is this likely to have been a problem with old o-rings? Scratched o-ring grooves? Maybe I need to crank down harder on the seals? "
170,Which camp fuel type is the easiest on your stove?,"In reference to this question: Avoiding leaks from stove and fuel bottles? What fuel type is the easiest on your stove as far as cleaning and maintenance are concerned?   If you have a stove that can burn more than one type of fuel, which type will have the least negative effect on your stove and on the o-rings in your bottle?  "
171,How to attach signs to trees considering tree growth?,"I am trying to determine the best way to attach trail signs to trees in the woods.  The problem with trees is that they grow.  If you firmly embed a nail in the wood, the tree will eventually grow around the nail head.  When we put up small plastic trail markers (what we use a blazes), we deliberately leave a &frac12; inch or so gap between the nail head and the marker.  Put another way, we don't bang the nail in all the way.  This gives the marker room to slide along the nail, instead of the growing tree pushing all around behind the nail head, and eventually buckling and cracking the plastic marker.  I am now going to put up some aluminum signs that will last much longer than the plastic trail markers.  A tree could grow multiple inches over the expected life of the sign.  What I'd like is a way to mount the sign so that it stays on the outside, moving with the growth of the tree instead of getting swallowed up by it.  It seems that just the right diameter and length of nail might do it.  You want the sign to be held, but the nail be able so slide out as the tree grows and pushes against the sign.  What diameter and depth might that be? What studies are there that have looked into this? What experience do you have with this? "
172,What is the term for/manufacturer of belay devices with a clip that holds the ATC onto the carabiner?,"I broke my friend's ATC, and am trying to find a replacement, but I don't quite know what to look for.  It was a somewhat unique unit, at least among those I've seen; it was a standard ""basket"" ATC with a screw-lock carabiner, but it had a plastic clip that secured the cable from the ATC to the slotted side of the 'biner, presumably so there was no possibility of losing one or the other. The plastic wasn't structural/weight-bearing.  Either way, it broke, it's my fault, and I can't for the life of me figure out what to ask Google to find the term for such a device, or a manufacturer that sells them.   Does anyone know what the term for a belay device with a plastic clip that secures the ATC to the carabiner is? More to the point: who manufactures them?  Thanks! "
173,How to tandem rappel/abseil with a child?,"So my toddler just barely fits the smallest child's harness on the market, which of course means she's big enough to go climbing and rappelling with daddy ;)   I've been playing around with different techniques of tandem rappelling with her (both walking and free rappel) and I'm wondering what established techniques people use for different ages/sizes of children?   What are some good techniques for tandem rappelling with a small child? "
174,Does sleeping with liner shoes make you feel colder?,"While reading this article about mountaineering boots I found following quote by Ian Nicholson quite interesting:     ""When climbing in a double boot, bring the liner in your sleeping bag at night to warm them and slightly dry them, but don't leave them on your feet. It doesn't seem to make that much sense, but wearing them can make your feet quite cold, and just letting them dry in your bag makes them that much more pleasant to put on in the morning.""   Emphasis by me and that is the point I am interested in. Did you made similar experiences? And if so, why is this the case? "
175,"What kind of car do I need to reach most hiking trailheads near Boulder Colorado, Rocky Mountain NP","I am moving to Boulder, CO for my PhD and am interested in doing a lot of hiking on the weekends. To get to trailheads near Boulder and Rocky Mountain NP, all year around, do I need:   High clearance (Are roads paved,...?) AWD (Are roads groomed, muddy,...?)   I am intersted in what I really need, (to not get stranded).  Thank you. "
176,How unsafe is this belay technique really?,"One person I regularly climb with uses a belay technique that I was taught to be unsafe, so I would like to know just how unsafe it really is. With a classic tube-style belay device, after taking in slack and bringing the brake hand back down, he simply slides his brake hand up the rope, opening it up just enough to allow the rope to stay in place.  Although it is obvious that PBUS (which is unfortunately not taught here at all) would be much safer, it is less obvious to me whether there is any real danger of him not catching a fall, given that he would probably hold tight as soon as he feels his other hand being pulled. So ideally I would like to know some hard facts such as:   Have any accidents been attributed to this belay technique? (Or a similar technique -- holding the brake hand above the device does not count as similar though.) Does anyone know of any experiments to determine if people usually catch falls even if they were holding the rope loosely?  "
177,Have these ski bindings been mounted properly?,These are the first skis I've ever bought for my son. I'm not sure if the bindings have been mounted properly? It looks as though the screws may have been drilled in too deep? It's the same on the other end as well.  Would this affect skiing? durability? etc?    
178,Which procedure should I do before using a water filter after being unused for two years?,"I have a Katadyn hiker pro. I used it for the last time was two years ago and then I stored it without following the procedure for long term storage. This procedure consists in using it with water purified with tablets and should serve to clean the filter from bacteria which eventually can grow. In a month, I will need it for a trip to Africa, so what should I do with the katadyn? Use it as it is? Replacing the filter (that is rather expensive)?  "
179,Rigs for carrying axes and machetes,"When I go trail-clearing I generally carry two machetes and a felling ax, but I haven't found a practical way to sling them so I can work with one without taking off the other tools.  The machetes have cordura sheathes with loops, and the ax has a leather bit sheath with a loop.  I have this feeling that people who do this for a living must have clever carrying rigs or slinging techniques so they don't have to drop everything whenever they need to take a whack at something.  Are there any ways to carry or rig tools like this so:   They can be drawn straight out of their sheath, put to work, and returned to their sheath without doffing the sheath (or rig, or harness, or whatever is recommended for slinging them)? The slung tools don't inhibit the free swing of any others?  "
180,What are these fungi that I've found growing on a dead birch?,"What are these fungi I found on a dead birch? Initially, I thought perhaps artist's bracket or southern bracket, but now I think they might be horses hoof fungus? I'm not very knowledgeable about this sort of stuff so I could be well off.   I'm in lowland Scotland and, they were on the same tree though there was a darker bracket on a log that was on the ground right next to it. I was looking for cramp ball fungus and all I could find until these was wood-ear on some old dead elder.   The ones I touched were hard but I didn't try to get up to the ones on the tree, there was a swarm of beasties about and my dinner was enough protein for my tastes. The tree was split just below the half way point and was abundant. Some were greyer/browner on top and others were mainly white from bottom through to a thin top of pale brown/grey.      ps. sorry, I know the pictures are rubbish!     Here is a slightly edited photo that makes their features a little more distinct.   I had a few more photos, I edited the colour values on one of them to make it less bright and the other I'll just upload. You can see the trees state and its abundance clearly at least, if nothing else... and I also show in this second update the black fungi.  I went back and collected some, definitely sure it is horses hoof fungus and I'm looking forward to processing some amadou from it. Any ideas of uses for the spore tubes?  They are quite sturdy and apparently they are parasitic and can cause damage to living trees. They live a long time! I took a few and left the others for some other lucky passerby. Quite tricky to get off the tree though... seemingly if you cut free the trama layer, which is sort of like cork or suede, on the outer of the tubes, then let it soak in a mixture of water and ash, before boiling for an hour or so, then gently beating the material to loosen the fibers, you end up with a material that is great for taking a spark from flint/steel or ferro rod, and can smoulder for quite a long time, so you could use it to carry fire with you if you didn't have modern conveniences. Quite a cool fungus!   Thanks to everyone who helped out! "
181,Undoing an over tight Clove Hitch?,"The weather has been really nice this weekend in North wales so over the weekend I set up a slack line in my back garden to have a play about on!  On Sun I went to take it all down. Problem is I attached one end of the line to a carabiner using a clove hitch, it appears this was a big mistake. The hitch is now totally locked up and I can't undo or move the knot, it's been under tension for about 2 days. In hindsight this was probably not the knot to use here...  Can anyone suggest any good tricks to loosing the knot off? or do I have to cut the thing off?  Seen someone suggest a ""Fid"". But I obviously don't own one of these? Alternatives? "
182,Is a clove hitch to be distrusted in climbing?,"Reading the description for a clove hitch on animated knots by Grog (the go to bible of knots IMO) I was surprised to read:     Caution: The Clove Hitch was, originally, included here with the   intention of condemning it. It does have two giant faults: it slips   and, paradoxically, can also bind. It should be deeply distrusted when   used by itself.   Every climber I know relies heavily on this knot and I've seen it used on countless tutorials yet it seems to be marked as ""deeply distrusted when used by itself"" on Grog.  Should the clove hitch(with a good length tail) be deeply distrusted ? Why/why not? What alternatives are there?  This seems to come from a sailing point of view, why (if this is the answer) is it not trusted in sailing but it is in climbing? "
183,What are the most likely causes of unfilterable water contamination in upland UK areas?,"I have a new water filter, which removes bacteria and protozoa.  It's tempting to imagine that I can now go around drinking from whatever revolting-looking puddles I come across, but I'm mindful that the filter will not remove viruses and nor will it remove harmful dissolved chemicals.  Are either of these two forms of contamination likely in upland UK areas?  Are there any ways to tell that a body of water may not be fit to drink even after filtering?  One example might be visible algal blooms (which can produce harmful toxins which won't be filtered out, though the algae themselves will).  Of course this will also (partly) apply to boiling - though boiling will inactivate most (all?) viruses it will not deal with all forms of chemical contamination. "
184,Is it OK to keep a dyneema sling under constant tension (slackline)?,"The comment on a previous question I posted here:     I am not sure whether this biner was aluminum, but it could be, so a   warning (please excuse me if the biner is steel): Aluminum biners are   not suited for constant high loads (even less if the forces change   around a high value). You should always use steel biners for   slacklines and if an aluminum was used, retire it   Got me thinking. When setting up this slackline I used a dyneema at one end to extend the rope slightly. I actually picked dyneema purposly as I didn't want it to stretch. It was under tension (from the slack line and people using the slack line) for a number of hours. I noticed afterwards that the sling had become slightly ""stiff"".   Should I now retire this sling? Is it ok to expose dyneema to this type of load or does it act like the aluminium crab mentioned in the comment? Would a Nylon one of held out any better?   Just to clarify, my question is, having used this sling for a slackline anchor and having had it under load, is it now OK to use while climbing? "
185,Where can I take a dip?,"It's rather warm outside (32.6°C or 91 F) and I'd like to go for a swim.  Having lived in The Netherlands and Sweden, I'm used to living near lakes and the fact that any surface water is by default open to swim in (unless a nature reserve or industrial site), but I have a hard time finding those in the UK.  Looking at places near me on wildswim.com, one says Open Water Swimming Sessions can only take place during supervised sessions run by the Activity Centre. No swimming is to take place other then through and organised session., another has specific opening hours.  Both make no sense at all for wild swimming, so now I'm rather confused.  I also found this list but it's incredibly short for a country the size of the UK (NB: the aforementoined link is currently misconfigured which may trigger security warnings, but lists to a dozen or so popular public lake beaches within the UK)  There's plenty of surface water near me, and I'd like to take a dip and cool off.  I don't care for changing rooms, safety buoys, or supervision (but I'd appreciate not to have to wade through 3-metre high stinging nettles to reach a lakeshore).  If I identify a pond, lake, canal, or river, how would I tell whether swimming is permitted there?  Is it permitted unless explicitly prohibited, or is it by default not allowed?  Related: Swimming in a river in England or Wales with a right of navigation    Edit: I ended up having a nice swim in Bear Wood Lake.  One end of the lake had a sign Swimming strictly prohibited, dangerous water.  The other end had a wooden platform with a ladder down into the lake.  Very unclear but apart from if you can't swim you may drown I did not see any indication of danger and I don't know if the prohibition was just at the sign or at the entire lake. "
186,"How does water depth affect swimming safety? Why do signs, especially in the UK, say ""DANGER: deep water""?","In many UK lakes, I see signs prohibiting swimming with the explanation DANGER: Deep water.  This link contains an example.  I don't understand those signs.  Why is a 30 metre deep lake more dangerous to swimmers than a shallow 3 metre deep lake?  Is it because deep lakes may be colder (which depends on mixing)?  Currents (should be less, not more)?  Or does it really just mean If you can't swim, you may drown?  Perhaps they're referring to Kraken, Nessie, or other flesh-eating critters living in unseen depths? "

I tried holding a lighter to it, expecting it to be some kind of cooking charcoal pellet, but it didn’t catch on fire. How do I use it? Or is it for something else entirely?

Are there things I should look for in the trip description to tell me if the trip is beginner friendly? "
189,Do any birds hibernate?,"A friend said she heard there's a species of bird that hibernates during the winter. I was surprised because I've only heard of birds that either migrate to warm weather as it gets cold; or stay active and behave normally if they're designed to thrive in cold temperatures.   I know some hummingbirds go into a state called torpor. Their metabolism slows down and they lower their body temperature to conserve energy. A variety of animals do it, but it's different from hibernation.  Is there scientific proof that a species of bird goes into genuine hibernation?   If so, I'd like to know the general characteristics, including:   What is the species name? Where does it live? When does it hibernate and for how long? What type of areas does it hibernate in, such as den, tunnel, under trees?    Any other information, especially a picture, would be appreciated.  If there's more than one known species, I can split this up into separate questions so it won't be too broad.   New species, and traits of existing species, are discovered over time, so I'm asking for data as of June 1, 2018.  "
190,Why are birds so nervous around humans?,"I bet the first thing that came to your mind, was...   because humans are evil and hurt animals because we're bigger than birds because we are louder than birds because of all of the above   ...right?  I am not an owner of a bird. I only admire them. However, I know in myself that I am not an angry, upset, jittery or violent person. I smile at people, strangers and I say hello to people - and yes, sometimes animals like dogs and cats. But when I come across equally as caring and gentle as I can with birds, they fly off. They simply don't trust anything or anyone. Yet when they are in captivity, they just about melt in your hands. Which is why I won't own one as a pet in a cage. I believe that is cruel.  Why should birds, in general, not the prey-like ones because they will attack in the wild, be afraid of people trying simply to be kind to them?  More on the emotions of birds here. "

The problem I have always had is that when I go to put the cans together, it is hard to do so without having one of them split and then you have to start over.  When building a penny stove, how can I keep the cans from splitting?  Note: See What is the most efficient DIY alcohol stove for narrow pots?  "
193,What is the most severe temperature that a proper snow cave can protect you from?,"This question was prompted by my answer to Under what conditions does heating a backpacking tent artificially make objective sense?. In my answer, I mention the possibility of hiking across Antarctica during the winter to experience the harshest cold that our planet has to offer.  You are on this Antarctic winter hiking trip, and you are chasing the cold. You know that the record cold is approximately -135F (-95C), and you are expecting you probably will encounter close to that, and you need to prepare for the possibility of a new record being set so you want to be safe down to a few degrees below that in case of emergency.  To assist in keeping safe, you build a snow cave. Though emergency snow caves are often not done correctly, let us assume that you did construct one correctly on this trip (ie: top of door below inner floor to trap heat, properly placed ventilation, doorway plugged up, etc.)  Normally, I hear people say that a good snow cave can keep the inner temperature at a pleasant freezing (32F, 0C) temperature even if the air outdoors is crazy cold. Would this still hold true at -140 degrees? At what point is it just so freaking cold that even a snow cave cannot be kept warm?  The amount of snow that is insulating you does obviously matter. Let's say you dig into a small embankment, so part of it is more than a few feet thick. For the front of it where you dug into the bank and had to then patch up the front of your cave, I would personally assume a few inches at most, as I have read about safety concerns of cave-ins when people craft thick walls. If you are not concerned about such a cave in danger, then feel free to assume thicker if that is truly what you would do.  Assume that there is a modest wind. Enough that heat does not linger well around objects, but not enough to worry about the integrity of the snow cave.  So, what is the minimum temperature at which a properly constructed snow cave can no longer be expected to maintain a constant 32F/0C temperature without artificial heating? "

So many people recommend mixing distilled water with some salts 1. As far as I've read, the danger is mostly a myth.  Any personal experiences?  There is a related question at Skeptics.SE: Does drinking distilled water remove needed minerals from your body?  1 As an anecdote, some mountaineers and scouts used these salts to mineralize and oxigenate water:   "
208,When to perform a filtering of the water?,"Let's imagine I'm hiking and I find a water source - like a lake, a stream or a well, and I want to fill my water bottle with it.   I have a bottle and a water filter. And a bandana. Since I can't tell if the water I see is safe, I want to filter it prior to drinking. But - how should I proceed? I see 3 options here:    Filter the water right away, when filling the bottle. This way I'm sure the water inside the bottle is safe for drinking.  Or fill the bottle with (possibly contaminated) water and filter it before drinking. This allows me to have my filter last a bit longer (as some water from my bottle could be used for purposes that don't require a clean water...)  Or, maybe, have a bottle with the filter in the drinking cap (or drinking straw), so if I want the clean water - I can sip it from there and if I need ""just"" water, I can pour it from the bottle directly (note: I got no idea if there are any good bottles with good filters/drinking straws like that).    Before filling my bottle I can pre-filter the whole water via bandana, of course, to get rid of floating particles and maybe let the UV from the Sun do some job on killing bacteria.   What would be your approach? Assuming the filter won't last forever.  "
209,What are possible trekking routes in the Atacama region in Chile in mid April?,"I would like to visit northern Chile and particularly the Atacama region. The goal would be to trek in the area, during about 10-12 days. It can be one long route or several shorter ones.  What routes are accessible between mid-April and beginning of March? Any restriction due to the weather conditions? "
210,Do higher shoes breathe less?,"I wonder about the breathe ability of low (=ankle high) versus high (=20cm above the ankle) hiking shoes.   Do high shoes breathe less in the area of the foot (and not the shin)? What are the mechanisms of breathing of the shoe i.e. what moves the air, moisture in and out of a shoe? "
211,Rock Climbing - Beginner's Guide for Quick Improvement?,"I've recently become quite interested in climbing, and I have been frequenting a local gym. As I become more serious, I'm curious how to most quickly improve.   For example,    Should I focus on improving strength or technique?  What is the best way to go about such improvement? Are there any essential books or reference sites?   Any advice is appreciated. "
212,Warmth of two sleeping bags,"If I use two identical 20-degree-rated bags, one inside the other, what would likely be the effective temperature rating? 10-degree? 0-degree? negative-10-degree? "
213,Is it really necessary to gut a fish?,"I'm obviously not a fisherman...  If I like the flavors, is there any problem with cooking and eating a fish that hasn't been gutted?  Any particular species?  In other words, what are all the reasons people gut a fish before cooking? "
214,What does it need to maintain clothes including membranes,"Everything is available with membranes (e.g. Gore-Tex Pro or Windstopper) these days:   Hard shells Soft shells Gloves Walking shoes Gaiters Fleece ...   I know it needs care to preserve the advantages of those clothes. E.g. soap or fabric softener shouldn't be used because it destroys the membranes. But when I pay good money I want to know what's the best treatment. So I have some questions, like:   How do you maintain your clothes? How regularly do you wash and how do you wash/dry? How do you store (I don't think crumpling or folding the stuff for a long time is a good treatment)? How and when do you refresh the impregnation and what's the best make?  "
215,"How do locals (short of drilling) determine that lake ice is safe for skating, ice fishing, snowmobiling, skiing?","This question is not a duplicate of either (1)  Ice skating on a frozen lake -- how thick should the ice be?, which only asks how thick the ice should be; or (2) How to determine the thickness of ice?, which only asks how to determine how thick the ice is.  When I was a child, we skated on a couple of lakes in Connecticut.  One day my father would declare that ""It's safe now"" and off we would go.  No one ever fell through.  He did not drill.  My question is: short of drilling, how do locals decide the ice on their lakes is safe for winter sports?  I don't remember the criteria my father used, except on the larger lake the ice had to extend very close to the spill-way, which was in essence an artificial outlet stream.  (We stayed away from that area.)  If it was safe on the larger lake, it would be safe on the smaller lake.         Where I live (Northern VA), the only safe assumption is that the ice is never safe.     Clarification:  If you think drilling is the only way to declare ice safe, in your area for your lakes, that would be a valid answer.  But I am still more interested in how people can make the judgement without drilling.   "
216,Starting a Fire with a Battery - what are the fundamental guidelines for safety and efficacy?,"There are numerous videos online demonstrating that its possible to start a fire using a battery. Here are four examples using different starting materials. But I have not found any tutorials that address the concept in any kind of comprehensive way. For this technique to be useful in an emergency situation or improvisational challenge, its critical to understand the fundamentals well enough to assess the starting materials you actually have on hand.   As far as I can tell, the fundamental necessary ingredients are:   a source of electricity a flexible, conductive material to connect a circuit kindling   But it seems to me that there is a tremendous amount of variety in those ingredients. Its not clear to me how to compare different conductive materials for the circuit. I know from this question that thin pieces of metal are easier to heat but I don't know how to choose between different types of metal - something that I expect would be important if you have relatively weak source of electricity.  Choosing a battery (or other electrical source) seems to be a matter of balancing risk against likelihood of success. If I was using a AA battery, I would not be particularly worried about shocking myself but would wonder if there was enough electrical power to actually ignite something; with a car battery those concerns would be reversed. But I have no idea what the danger of being shocked by something intermediate, like a D battery or a laptop battery, would be.   I think my question boils down to two main parts:   How can common batteries and flexible, conductive materials be assessed for suitability to starting a fire with electricity in a camping/survival setting? What precautions are appropriate with respect to the materials used?   TO BE CLEAR: I am not asking about burning batteries. I am asking about using batteries to produce sufficient heat to be able to ignite kindling AND I am asking about doing so SAFELY. "
217,Gunfire in US national parks,"What are the consequences of firing a gun in a US national park due to distress? (for instance, shooting at an attacking animal, or firing in the air to attract attention when stranded)  There is a notorious controversy regarding the use of firearms for self defense, but let's set that aside and consider the following situations:   Hiker in a national park got stranded, became scared for his life and fired in the air to attract attention. Hiker was attacked by an animal, feared for his life, shot at the animal, missed and the animal ran away. Same as 2 except the animal was hit, injured, and ran away. Same as 2 except the animal was killed.   Let's also set aside the complicated legal situation with regards to firearms in the US, and assume the hiker in question was carrying his weapon in a manner fully compliant with the applicable law.  Since gunfire is loud and considered suspicious, I imagine all 4 of these scenarios would attract attention from park rangers, rescue personnel, and possibly other emergency services. I imagine they would start searching for the source immediately, and probably arrive near where the shot was fired in a matter of hours at most.  Suppose also the hiker makes no attempt to flee or hide from anyone who does arrive. When someone arrives on the scene, and the situation is explained (ie. fired a gun because believed to have no other option), what happens next?  Would the hiker get a long lecture from the rangers and a fine? Would they get arrested? Would this be considered an irresponsible/unwarranted discharge of a firearm? Would shooting the animal be treated as poaching (even though clearly the intent was not to hunt)? "
218,What equipment is needed for glacier hiking?,"What is the exact equipment I need for walking safely on glaciers? The route I will be taking is the Hvannadalshnukur ascend from the ring road and same path descend. From what I could find out the path is not challenging gradient is constant and small, and the crevasses are either non-existent or more like small holes. The roping is just precaution. We all have mountaineering experience, but no previous glacier experience.  From what I gathered from this answer and this one. I also read the safety research short rope PDF by Gottlieb Braun-Elwert, although I guess we will be long roping.  I need:   At least 10m distance between members (3 going total) Thickness of the rope depends on how many times I expect to fall which is likely no more than 1 Straight hilt pick axe used for walking rather than vertical climbing Harness each  Around 3 carbineers each Crampons    Other non-climbing related items such as:   GPS with lots of spare batteries Polarised sunglasses Sun cream Gloves/Hat/Waterproof clothes Food/water Mountain boots Whistle/ Torch /Rear bicycle flashing light Sheathed knife   Things which are unclear to me are about inventory:   How much excess rope should there be and should it be at the end or evenly divided between people. What is total recommended rope length for party of 3. Would spare rope be necessary or useful Do I need any other items such as quickdraws, belaying devices or figure eight Any other equipment I may not realise is necessary    Any other things you believe I ought to know, manuals should read or any wrong assumptions I make please let me know.

219,Using a synthetic sleeping bag on/under it's limit,"I've got a sleeping bag, rated at 15°c comfort, 6° limit and -8° extreme. I'm planning on a backpacking trip bivvying with a tarp. Currently the nighttime temperature is about 2-4°c. Is there any way to cheaply and easily increase the range of the bag with minimum extra space or weight? Or will this be a suitable set up as is?   (I could possibly use a cotton liner) "
220,Lowering a climber from above using a belay device in autolocking mode,"I recently gave a belay from above to a group of five people who were all doing the same single-pitch climb and then being lowered off. (In this case the reason for belaying from above was that the climb was too long for top-roping from the ground with a single rope.) I was using an ATC Guide in guide mode, directly off of an anchor. Afterward, I went back and researched different methods for doing the lowering. Any comments on the following methods, or suggestions of other methods?  Method 1  Don't even lower people in guide mode. Reserve that for emergencies. When the climber gets to the top of the climb, have them clip in, then switch the belay device to normal mode and lower them off. This requires redirecting the brake strand like this: [website]Method 2  BD's instructional video [website]Method 3  This instructional video [website]What do people think? I haven't tried method 3. It seems nice, but I'm worried that in the event that the belayer slips and inadvertently puts his body weight on the release cord, the only thing saving the climber's life is the Prusik.  In the BD video, they show a Munter rather than an autoblocking knot such as a Prusik, which seemed odd to me. After some dialog in comments with Shem Seger, I'm going to write up my attempt to analyze this issue in an answer. "
221,Is there a safe way to light and tend a small fire on earthy/peaty ground?,"When on slightly peaty ground, (i.e loamy forest rather than very peaty heath) is there any possible safe way to light and tend a small fire? I'd envisaged scraping away the top soil, dousing below with water, then making a large bed of rocks with a mat of sticks/logs on top to raise the fire away from the ground. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Obviously, if this isn't safe I won't use a fire, and will instead increase pack weight and carry a stove. Thanks! "
222,Is it feasible to hike Zion and Bryce in Utah in mid-May?,"Is it feasible to hike trails to at least some overlooks around Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon in Utah in mid-May? If yes, do we need a 4x4, or will a sedan do?  We are only interested in day hikes. "
223,Carrying hardboiled eggs when hiking,"I am planning to hardboil some eggs and immediately, while hot, wrap them in cling-film before stowing in my pack. How long will they last before going off? (I am in NZ so eggs are not washed like in the Us. Not sure if that makes a difference once boiled anyway.) Any other suggestions for storing boiled eggs unrefrigerated? I do not want to cook them on the trail.   Update 08 Apr 2015: Just to report on 2 pieces of empirical data.  1) Experiment. I hardboiled an egg and immediately wrapped it in clingfilm. Kept indoors for 5 days. Unwrapped and ate. Delicious.  2) Hiking buddy and I hardboiled and clingfilmed 8 eggs. Refrigerated for 2 days before hike. 4 were eaten 5 hours into the hike. 4 were good 30 hours into the hike. "
224,Does a tent need special after-trip care when camping on and near ocean beaches?,"Does a tent need any special care after camping on or near ocean beaches? I know that salt can corrode metal (e.g. metal in the poles, stakes, zippers, etc.) and sand can mechanically abrade many parts of a tent. I don't know to what extent occasional use in those conditions will affect the longevity of a tent though.   Do I need to rinse everything out when I get done with such a trip, or is simply drying and brushing out the tent as usual sufficient to protect it from wearing out? Is there some other maintenance I should be considering following use in these conditions? "
225,Red River Gorge Summer,"I'm planning a rock climbing trip this summer and I've been considering the Red River Gorge as a possible stop. I've been there before in the late fall and it was absolutely awesome in terms of sport climbing, but what about the summer? Is it buggy/too humid?  "
226,What's the best way to dispose of a body in the backcountry?,"Suppose you needed to dispose of a large carcass for one reason or another while in the backcountry... what would be the best way to dispose of it in the woods so that it wouldn't be discovered? You always hear stories of people burying bears that they've had to shoot, but I can't imagine digging a big enough hole in the rocky ground to hide a 500lbs+ bear. Especially if you weren't carrying a descent shovel. Is it easier to section the animal and bury the smaller parts? What about when you're up above the treeline? is covering it with rocks enough to hide it, or would you need to drag it into the trees and find some soft soil? I don't see anything on the Leave no Trace website that talks about this. Does anyone have any tips or stories about what they've done in these types of situations? "
227,Climbing gear: can the energy absorbers of a lanyard for via ferratas be used only once?,"Is the energy absorber of a gear kit for via ferratas for just one use? I mean, one fall and it has to be replaced?  In the product description, there is often mention of it being ""tearable.""  "
228,Train yourself to need less water,"I'm interested in doing multi-day hikes (i.e. backpacking) in the desert where water sources are not readily available, thus requiring one to carry in enough water for the duration of the trip.  On  any given day I feel the need to drink a lot of water, much more than most people that I know.  About a gallon in a typical relatively inactive (working at a desk) day.  If I don't drink this much water, I start to feel thirsty.  To do a multiday trip I will be drinking considerably more water (at least 1.5 gal/day?) which will become burdensome: this would mean 36 pounds of drinking water for a 3 day trip.  Like I said, I definitely begin to feel thirsty and dehydrated (dizzy) if I lower my current water intake much at all.  Is it possible to train oneself to require less water per day (by slowly weaning down the amount)?  Or, alternatively, is it possible to adjust one's chemical levels (e.g. electrolytes) to retain water longer in such a way that you do not need to take in quite as much water? "
229,Is there any difference between a harness used for rock climbing vs for mountaineering?,"I've recently taken an interest in both rock climbing and mountaineering. Both require a harness, but is there any difference in the harness used for each activity? I understand that the most basic functionality will theoretically be the same, i.e. be securely attached to you and have a sturdy loop you can tie/clip into. I'm interested in knowing what differences there are beyond the most simple functionality though. If I were to purchase a harness, what types of features would I be looking for that would lend themselves to climbing vs. mountaineering or both? "
230,Climbing barefoot/in toe-shoes?,"I recently went bouldering for the first time and liked it a lot. One thing I wondered about are the climbing shoes. The mostly form your feet to a very firm, compact package. So the following question came up in my mind:  Why don´t climbers embrace the power of their toes? Why can´t I find anybody climbing barefoot or in (toe-)socks or shoes like Vibrams fivefingers? Would it be worth a try or can I be sure it doesn´t work as well as climbing shoes?  _    Of course, you would need to train your feet to get the strength you need. But considering the amount of training climbers put into their hands and fingers for things like ""one-finger-holes"" I think this is probably no good reason for not trying it with your feet...  I am primarily interested in indoor bouldering, but aspects for other types of climbing are welcome as well. I am aware that most gyms probably don´t want you to climb barefoot for hygienic reasons...   Some background: Here whatsitsname describes for him climbing barefoot and in vibrams didn´t work well. This question is about the use of vibrams five-finger shoes. This closed question is about a specific five-finger model for climbing... "
231,How far would you need to fall for it to be fatal?,"A little grim this but I was discussing free soloing with a non-climber in work and I said     ""Well once you get over a certain height you're not going to survive a   fall anyway so anything over this doesn't really make much of a   difference.""   ... which got me thinking, how high is too high?   I'd guess it's reasonably low. So does anyone have any empirical evidence of how high a fall a human being can fall and survive (though not necessarily walk away from)? "
232,How to minimize limitation/pain from blisters caused before a camping trip?,"I have a short camping trip coming up. This week, from using a wooden tool, I got blisters on my hands at the base of some fingers. In the future, ideally, I would take precaution to not get blisters before a camping trip. Alas, I have them, now what can I do? During the trip I expect to cut wood with axe &amp; saw, keep a fire, and work with ropes setting up, moving around, and breaking down camp.  I'm not worried about this trip as it's so short and the blisters aren't that bad to begin with. It does make me wonder though, if I have blisters and know I'll be potentially making them much worse, what are the best things I can do in between to heal and prep these spots for more friction? Wearing light work gloves in the first place or at camp is an obvious answer but are there other methods to treat the blisters directly?    As for related questions:  This addresses the first-aid options pretty well. Should you pop a blister? If anything it makes me think, pop and treat these blisters while I can and then wrap them before expecting to apply more friction?  This explains how to use wraps to protect the blister in the field. How to apply duct tapes and mole skin to prevent blisters? Given the blisters are on my hand in this case, work gloves would suffice. "
233,What's the fastest way for a single person to setup a tarp umbrella/leantoo in the rain in a nothern temperate forest?,"Tangentially related to Pitching a tent in the rain? I want to know what the fastest way is for one person to setup a tarp as a big umbrella over a section of camp or as a leantoo for folks to gather under. The setting is in a northern temperate forest with plenty of deciduous and coniferous trees and relatively soft ground.  This question isn't about setting up a shelter for sleeping in the rain, whether that be tarp or tent. It's for making general purpose camp-umbrellas out of apx 4m*4m tarps and other materials as needed. For example, I'm sure rope is needed and since trees are available, I'm not sure stakes are needed but maybe they are. If other equipment is helpful for this, that could be part of the answer.  From my attempts so far, I expect the answer to focus on rope. There's a relevant answer in this question (How do you pitch a tarp so that you will not get wet in a heavy rain?) which I'll study more but since it is focused on tarp-tents, I wonder if it applies as well to higher, broader tarp-umbrella setups. What rope configurations are the fastest and most effective to get a tarp up for protection of people or gear at camp in the rain? Where are key tie-off points, what knots are best to practice, that sort of thing. "
234,Selling older gear - is it likely to be safe?,"My late husband died 7 years ago &amp; I still have his gear. I'm not comfortable leading (and I've lost half my shoulder tendons anyway), so I won't use it.   I think the ropes, etriers, etc should be trashed, but what about used cams, pitons, friends, stoppers with no leader falls on them?   Any ideas, or ways to assess which are safe to sell? "
235,What is the lowest altitude where the effect of lack of acclimatization can be observed?,"What is the lowest altitude where the effect of lack of acclimatization can be observed?  I've heard that generally we speak about the need for acclimatization over 3000 meters (9800 feet). Are the negative effects, such as significantly decreased performance, headaches etc., observed on at least a significant part of the population at the lower altitudes, for example 2000 meters (6500 feet)? "
236,Is hiking alone always faster?,"Suppose you need to cover a fairly long distance (e.g. 30 km) in a moderately difficult hiking terrain (no climbing), in 1 day. You can either go alone or with someone, or with a group.  I think (from experience) that alone is always faster. Is it right, and if yes, why? What are the factors that make me waste time? How much time should I expect to waste? Let's eliminate physical fitness differences for the sake of argument.  If the answer is no (i.e. group hiking time is the same or better than alone time): How can I achieve the fastest group hiking time -- which typical time wasters to avoid, and how? "
237,Why do different kinds of bug bites itch in different ways?,"I have gotten bit by 3 different bugs that have all given me itchy bites but they are oh so different.  The most recent one is a tick bite, today is the first time I ever remember having a tick bite. I could not feel the tick at all until I felt my neck with my hand. It didn't suck much if any blood(how do I know? It looked deflated and alive after I grabbed it and pulled it off). It immediately started itching after I pulled the tick off but that itch is resolving. There is no swelling at the moment.  Mosquito bites are also from a blood sucking bug but this is way different. I actually once endured a full mosquito bite while awake at night. I can tell you from that experience, a mosquito bite is painless at first and then as it continues to suck blood it becomes painful, almost as though it injected venom. After the mosquito flies off nothing happens for several hours. But then it becomes irresistibly itchy(so I rub instead of scratch it) and is like that for a few hours at a time, several times a day.  Spider bites are even more different. Whether I am awake or asleep, the spider biting me is unnoticeable. Then a few hours later it is just like a mosquito bite but worse(again irresistibly itchy for a few hours at a time, several times a day but the itch is much worse.  So yeah, 3 bugs, all give itchy bites, but the bites are so different in timing and/or severity. No allergies to anything except pollen and pet dander. Why are they so different, especially the tick and mosquito which both suck on blood? "
238,What is the col between Mt Meru and Kilimanjaro?,"When browsing Wikipedia's List of peaks by prominence, I was surprised to see that the parent peak of Mt Meru (in Tanzania) is Mount Kenya (350 km away) and not Kilimanjaro (50 km away). The col between Mount Meru and Mount Kenya is 1395 metres. When looking at Google Maps, it seems there are elevation curves at about that altitude between Mt Meru and Kilimanjaro.  What is the col between Mount Meru and Kilimanjaro? Or in other words, what is the lowest altitude you'd need to descend to from Mount Meru, before you can start to climb toward Kilimanjaro? "
239,GPS Altitude Anomalies,"On a recent run which crosses the Humber Bridge my GPS watch seems quite confused by my altitude as I crossed the bridge, as if there is an 8m shear drop half way with the south side being lower.  You can see this clearly on the graph plotted after uploading the watch's data:  as we cross the half way mark going south ~4.88Km in and the reverse ~19.10Km in as we head back north. My first thought would be to just assume a fault in the watch's calculations, but I remember noticing the same signature in another trace of the route from a previous year when doing a little research before the run like so  and doing a little more research after the same can be seen in the official map for another run that crosses the bridge available here (the elevation map in the bottom right shows the same drop between ~17.5 and 20 miles when the route is south of the bridge's half way point).   Why would this be? Is it a coincidence that the dividing line appears to be right in the middle of the bridge? Are such anomalies common?   Extra information as per the comments below: I'm using a TomTom GPS watch and their standard web interface. I have had a thought and will review the raw data from the device when I get home to see if the anomaly is there too or introduced in later analysis. I don't know what the data sources for the other graphs were. "
240,Are longer kayaks faster than shorter ones?,"I've been researching which kayak I'd like to buy, and I keep coming across the notion that longer kayaks are faster than shorter ones. I can understand that shorter kayaks have a greater tendency to alter course with each stroke, thus affecting your overall forward velocity, but if you correct for this in your calculations, it seems to me that a longer kayak would have more overall surface area than a shorter one, and would thus be slowed.  It is perhaps the case that this slowing of the longer kayak is not as pronounced as the loss of forward velocity experienced by the shorter kayak. Is there something else physically going on that affects the kayak's performance in the water that I'm not thinking of?  tl;dr: is there any truth to the fact that, all things being equal, a longer kayak will have a higher top speed for a given kayaker, and if so, why?    Edit  Note that I ask about length specifically. In other words, two boats of identical design and type, with identical beam widths, identical hull materials, and the same pilot. "
241,What is the difference between AMO/AMA and ASTM spine declarations?,"This question asks ""Are the Goldtip and Easton spine declarations AMO/AMA or ASTM??"",  What exactly is the difference between AMO/AMA and ASTM  spine declarations and what difference does it make? "
242,How do songbirds and small animals know when there's a hawk in the immediate vicinity?,"At any given time in our yard, we have at least 20 birds, up to the same number of squirrels, 15 or so chipmunks, and a few rabbits. Our many feeders and birdbaths are mostly under big trees and next to large bushes, although many of the birds and other things feed more out in the open. Needless to say they're very noisy, and it's a gorgeous cacophony!  Sometimes, all of a sudden, it will get eerily quiet out there, and when we look out, almost everyone will have disappeared into the trees or bushes.   Within a few minutes, a hawk comes through. It doesn't stop, but there have been times it will swoop down and grab something vulnerable, usually a chipmunk, or baby bunny, that hasn't taken cover in time.   A little while after the hawk is gone, everybody comes out again and resumes their regular routine.   I'm curious as to how they know the hawk is in the vicinity. Do some of them see it and somehow communicate that to the rest? Do those who see it hide and others follow suit by hiding even if they don't know why? Does it emit a sound that we can't hear? Is it a smell? In the yard, we've only ever seen one hawk at a time, so it doesn't seem like they feel surrounded.  If it was just a few birds or animals it would be easier to understand, but I'm referring to a variety of sizes, species, speech patterns, nesting behaviors and feeding behaviors. "
243,How can I help birds know how to feed from feeders?,"In Malaysia, the country I'm from, almost nobody puts up bird feeders. I have just bought a bird feeder from overseas, but the birds don't seem to know what the feeder even is, as they may not have never seen one.   How do I encourage them to know to eat from the feeders?   My feeder is a tube feeder (I think? I'm so new to this).    And the garden I have is about 11ft by 6ft as shown:   "
244,Can you put a tow truck stinger on a motorhome (RV)?,"Some terms may not be global, inline descriptions for questionable terms  A motorhome is RV with an engine (as opposed to a camp trailer that is pulled by another vehicle).  Many people will tow a small car behind it to use for running around when the RV is parked at a campsite.    Currently there are 3 basic approaches to towing the car   4 tires on the ground, with a towbar connecting the car to the RV A tow dolly, a small trailer like device that the front tires of the car sit on A full size car trailer that the entire car rides on.   For the first two it is not possible/recommended to backup with the car attached. You can backup with the full car trailer, but at the camp ground it is big extra thing to put someplace.   A 'wheel lift' or 'stinger' is a device on a tow truck that picks a car up by the tires.  There are several manufacturers in the US that makes ones that ""hide"" under the back of a pickup, cost start around $4,000 for a brand new stinger. A car being towed on stinger, can be backed up just like a trailer.    By putting a hidden stinger on the back of a motorhome, you could backup without disconnecting the towed car AND not have anything extra to put someplace at the campground.   My question: A stinger on the back of a Motorhome seems like a wonderful solution to many of the hassles of towing a car.  Why can't I find any examples (lots of googling) of it being done? If it is not possible/practical why?   RV Classes (for clarity of question) There are 3 basic ""classes"" of motorized RVs, Wikipedia has an article with details, there are execptions and variables, but for the purpose of this question, the below is a guideline   Class A - This is purpose built on a heavy truck chassis. The exterior may resemble a bus, or camp trailer, the drivers area is an intricate part of the ""home"".  The truck chassis is not near any load limits.   Class B - A complete van, as you would purchase from a local dealer to haul stuff, has an RV built inside it.  The exterior will look like a delivery van, possibly with special paint, custom windows, and possibly a raised roof.  The Drivers area easily access the camper area.  As built it may or may not be near load limits of the vehicle.  Class C - A marriage of the other two classes, A normal van is ordered from the Manufacture (i.e. Ford) but without a complete van body.  The body stops just behind the driver's seat. The RV builder builds a camper on the bare frame back of the van. The exterior will look like someone grafted a camp trailer on to a van.  Access between the drivers area and the camper may be difficult. As built it will most likely be very near the chassis load limit.   Of the above Classes, the Class C would not be a good candidate for a stinger, it would be near it load limit, while not impossible. it would be improbable. The Class B would be a good candidate for the stinger, but owners of them use them as both a camper and for casual running around, they would not have a interest in towing a car.  Class A these are the most expensive, and the largest, they are very capable of towing heavy loads, and can easily support the extra weight of the stinger and car. The Class A is the most likely to have car towed behind it. "
245,Reclaiming water lost from breathing,"What can we do to bring water loss from breathing down to the absolute minimum possible?  Techniques or devices useful to adventurers with no frequent water access is what I am looking for, such as hiking or biking across a desert for longer than is reasonable to carry or find sufficient water.  Water does not necessarily need to be reclaimed by drinking. Any answer for which water that would be otherwise lost due to breathing but is in your body keeping you healthy instead is a good answer.  See also: ""Is drinking urine safe?"" (Short answer: No) Urine is another one of the biggest sources of bodily water loss, and you can distill it back into pure water with a small amount of resources and a sufficient heat source.  Food for thought: I recall that in the story ""Dune"" the people on that desert planet had access to wearable water reclamation equipment which reclaimed almost all of their water, not only from breathing but other sources as well. Dune is science-fiction, but it does make me wonder if such technology is actually available in reality; is there any easily portable equipment that can reclaim a significant portion of breath water in the same way?    This question is inspired from reading this answer to a question about water rationing and death from dehydration. From that question, and reading up on the topic elsewhere, it appears a reasonable portion of water lost per day can be due to water vapor lost in your breath. This can even be a significant portion of water loss in some environments, such as cold dry air. "
246,What are possible ways to drink on a long scuba dive?,"On longer dives, let's say over an hour long, the air from the cylinder becomes rather dry and can cause a dry throat - what are possible ways to have a drink when scuba diving? Are there alternatives to drinking? "
247,Does body need to re-acclimatize after a few days out of altitude?,"We will be in Peru visiting Machu Pichu (altitude 7,972 ft or 2,430 m). Then we'll go down to the jungle (essentially sea level) for 4 days and then to Cuzco (altitude 11,152 feet or 3,399 meters).  Will it take less time to re-acclimatize? Will we have to ""start again?"" "
248,Usability difference between 0.1 micron 0.2 micron filter bottles?,"We have been using older water filter bottles with charcoal filters. These are easy to drink from a combination of squeeze the bottle and suck will quickly fill your mouth with a swallow of water.  We are planning to upgrade to sub-micron pore filter bottles.  After much research it seems like the two midrange dominate products are the Sawyer (0.1 micron) &amp; Lifestraw (0.2 micron), both have a product that incorporates their filter into their purpose build bottle.  Depending on who you ask and what you believe they both have either vastly different or nearly the same, life expectancy and filtering ability. Leaving that aside and just focusing on getting the water from the bottle, through the filter and into your mouth; are there significant differences?   The difference between 0.1 microns and 0.2 microns is double (or half) what impact does it have on being able to get the water through?    P.S. In most cases we have pre-filtered the water with a Camco 20 micron filter, into the fresh water tank of the camper.  Or we are using tap water from our local municipality.    "
249,"Why do almost all backpacking packs have top compartment (""brain compartment"") zippers facing backwards?","According to this answer to ""what gear should go in the brain (top most compartment)"",     the brain compartment usually ends up becoming the knick-knack / catch-all pocket, for small items items that get frequently used   However, I noticed that the zipper of the ""brain"" compartment almost always faces backwards, towards the wearer and the straps, rather than forwards towards the other zippers and pockets on the front of the pack.  Typically when I take my pack off, I set it down or against a tree, with the straps facing away. This allows me to open the pack and grab something out of the main compartment, and it makes it easy for me to access whatever water bottles or other equipment I've clipped to the outside of the pack.  But with everything else facing up, the brain compartment zipper is facing down. All of the ""small items items that get frequently used"" will fall out if I open the brain compartment zipper while the pack is in this position. So I end up having to turn it upside down to get things out of the brain compartment. The pack is usually heavy enough to make this rather inconvenient.  For a long time I've been wondering about the purpose of this design. What am I missing? Are people able to get stuff out of the brain compartment by reaching backwards while wearing the pack? I know that as for me, my arms are not nearly flexible enough to do this.  I asked the owner of the local military surplus store and he said that the reason for this design is so that the brain compartment zipper doesn't come open when the wearer of the pack is crawling through underbrush. I'm having trouble believing that most backpackers spend enough time crawling through underbrush to make this an important design consideration. Does anyone here have a more believable explanation?   "
250,"What is the difference between Class III, Class IV, and Class V rapids?","I'm planning a whitewater rafting trip, and I keep reading that different rapids are different classes, and sometimes the same rapid is different classes at different times of the year?  What do the classes mean, and is there a level that would be too dangerous to raft? "

257,Is it practical to get a satellite phone for communication from remote areas?,"When going into remote areas, it would be great to be able to communicate with the outside world, for emergency purposes or just to be able to call home on long trips. Is it practical for an average person to obtain and use a satellite phone? In other words, roughly what do they cost to buy or rent, how large are they, and what is the cost to use them to place calls? On what kind of trips would it make sense to consider this option? "
258,What mosquito nets can be used while camping?,"When camping in areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic, what options are there in terms of mosquito nets? The mosquito nets I've seen are meant to be hung above a bed and tucked under the mattress, but would any make sense to use in a tent? If not, what are some options for mosquito (or other insect) protection while sleeping? "
259,What essentials should you bring with you on a day hike?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What are essential items in an emergency kit?       Another question asked about emergency supplies you'd bring on a multi-day hiking trip. But many people prefer going on shorter day hikes (say, leaving in the morning and returning to the trailhead in the late afternoon) where it's less practical to bring a large backpack with every conceivable emergency supply.  Besides appropriate clothes and water, what equipment would you consider essential to bring on a day hike (for safety, comfort, protection, etc.)?  "
260,What kinds of knives are allowed while camping in California?,"I have read that California has some of the strictest weapons laws in the US. What types of knives are allowed when camping, hiking, or hunting? What should someone camping in California know before packing a knife? "
261,Can Primaloft One be Layered?,I currently wear a Polartec Power Dry base layer and a 60g Primaloft One insulated jacket.  This keeps me warm all the way down to about -10C when active(walking/hiking/Cycling).      At temperatures below that would layering another primaloft one insulated jacket be recommended or would it be best to replace the existing jacket with one of greater insulation.  In other words does 60g layer + 100g layer = the warmth of one 160g layer? Or is it recommended to remove the first 60g and replace with ONE 160g jacket? 
262,Are headaches a bad sign at altitude?,"Last weekend, we had a nice hike up Price Peak in the Sierras.  We went from sea level to above 10,000 feet (3,000 m) in about 6 hours. And I had a ROARING headache. I could hear my heart beat in my ears at all times. My entire head throbbed.  But, honestly, I was expecting it. We changed altitude too fast. But I felt fine otherwise (I wasn't nauseous).  Should I be worried when I get a headache due to altitude change? What are the signs I should be watching out for, if not headaches? "
263,Walking through a Thigh-high snow,"I have far less experience in trekking where there is snow. I believe walking through snow and through ice are two different techniques.    Is there some sort of safe technique to walk on such snow with nearly 30o slope and winds?    I wonder if I would be able to take the same route that I open during an ascend, while descending. Yes, I can use some sort of markers, so that I can navigate the way, but with such snow, you can't really bet on the fact that the marker will hold up there till I get back.  I have heard past experiences from people that, fixing rope lines there isn't of much help either, as they found their ropes buried under snow. And, that sounds logical to me, because there is a major factor, wind, which blows snow everywhere.  I am referring to high altitude slopes, probably between good 20000 - 22000 ft. An uncaught slip-and-drop would be fatal without a doubt.    How should I go about it then?   Obvious Assumptions: I have necessary equipment, walking sticks, Ice ax, etc. "
264,Does a cotton lined sleeping bag make sense?,"I have always been under the impression that cotton is the enemy of a hiker - it absorbs moisture and just becomes a horrible wet casing around you, transferring away all the heat.  I was therefore quite surprised to find that a new sleeping bag I had purchased actually has cotton lining. Is this not counterproductive? Or does it not matter so much, assuming I do not get into the sleeping bag all sweaty and wet? Should I take any special precautions with this bag? "
265,Flashlight or headlamp for night hiking?,Which is better to use during a night trek - a flashlight or a headlamp? Which do you prefer? Would be great if recommend the one you use and tell me what made you buy it. 
266,Hauling a pack during climbing,"Generally when doing multi-pitch climbs, I prefer to just climb with a light pack. However, sometimes that's just not possible and the pack(s) must be hauled instead.  What are some good ways to haul a pack up a pitch? Where does it best fit in around belaying the second? What are good ways to avoid getting packs stuck?  I'm thinking particularly of something that's light enough to haul hand-over-hand with some breaks in there, and speed of hauling is important. "
267,Can windowless tents be adjusted for adequate ventilation?,"I have an older tent, and it has some zip-down windows that can be completely closed, or opened for ventilation, with a rainfly that covers more or less just the top of the tent and leaves the windows open. It seems like many of the newer tents I've been looking at have a completely mesh top, with a rain fly that covers the entire tent, so you have to choose between being completely open (with no real privacy) and completely covered. Instead of windows that open, they have ventilation tabs in the top.  Primarily - do the vents on these tents provide adequate airflow? They seem pretty small in comparison to having a few large windows that can be zipped open for cross-breezes. Do these tents get very hot and stuffy? "
268,"How do you know how much isobutane is in a full canister (i.e., how much if fuel wht and not cannister)?","If a isobutane canister says 4 oz, does that mean it has 4oz of fuel or is that fuel+canister weight?  And I assume that is 4oz of wheight, not volume, right? "
269,Maximum slope angle for boots?,"Obviously, there is no limit when you talk about climbing or using alpine equipment, but what about maintaining a constant speed while walking, without crampons, and staying on feet, no scrambling?  Is there a way to estimate the maximum slope angle walkable in hiking or tracking boots on various terrain types? "

271,Did I see an Osprey?,"My friends think that I'm mad, but I'm pretty sure I saw an Osprey the other day. Could anyone confirm that what I observed is an Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) or, at least, Osprey-ish?  I saw the bird here -> Llandegla Forest, North Wales.  It was early evening and I was walking our dogs near Pendinas reservoir in north Wales, UK. I saw a couple of buzzards (common buzzards, Buteo buteo) hovering on the horizon above some trees. I was watching the buzzards when I noticed a third larger bird. Wing span easily half the width of the buzzards again, so roughly 1 1/2 times larger than the buzzards.   I observed all three birds for some time through binoculars. They were quite some distance away though, so I couldn't quite get a really clear view.   At first I thought it was simply another (larger) buzzard but its wings seemed different; rather then the splayed finger wing tips of the other two birds, its wings seemed much longer and distinctly more pointed and downwards pointing at the tips.  It roosted in a tree on the other side of the lake. It was very distinctively a Raptor (which ruled out my other thought of some kind of sea bird). Again, I viewed it through my binoculars. It appeared dark brown and had a distinctive white patch on its chest. Again, quite some distance so hard to get a really clear view.  I went home and checked my bird book. The only bird I could find that matched the description of the size and the distinctive wing pattern was an Osprey. There are half a dozen nesting pairs further up the coast from me but they are not common by any stretch.  Based on my description do you think I could I have confused this bird with another? Or does the Osprey seem the most likely? "
272,Bald eagle vs. vultures?,"I witnessed a bizarre scene on the James River in Richmond, VA, USA (1000 yards west of Mayo Bridge if you want to examine Google Maps). It was on a large rock in the middle of the river, where nearly 2 dozen vultures had congregated. There were so many I couldn't tell if they were atop some carcas, but I couldn't see one from 75 yards away.   Now here's the weird part. There was a large bald eagle that seemed to be vying for the rock. Eagle would swoop in onto the rock, look around like ""Oh, s*** this is more vultures than I thought!"". The vultures (at least those closest to the Eagle) would beat their wings and eventually the eagle would change position or retreat to prepare for another dive bomb. Eventually, the eagle flew away.  Some important details:   There was a treeline about 300 yards from the rock, and there may have been a nest there. Not likely, but possible. Assuming this was a mother w/ chicks, maybe a chick tried flying and ended up dying on a nearby rock? A lady walking passed said that vultures were ""all over the place"" this time of year on the river. Not sure how credible of a claim this was. No recent flooding, and the shad (fish) are still running in this area. The vultures didn't seem ""busy""; they looked like they were just hanging out waiting for something to happen.   Any hypotheses on what was going on here? In my vast 26 years of life, I've never seen anything like this. "
273,What material are the shells I just purchased made of?,"I purchased a box of shotgun shells in the United States. On the box it says they are for pheasant. But it does not say if the shot is lead, steel or some other nontoxic material. We know from the question I have an older shotgun designed for lead shot, can I use steel shot? that the type of shot is important.   I didn't think about this when I grabbed the box. Now that I have sat down and read the box, I am not sure. There is a very small bit of print that says      This item may include the following SVHC: lead styphinate; 2.4 Dinitrotoluene; Dibutyl phthalate   As written there may or may not be lead as part of any component of the shell (or box).  If the material the shot is made of is not clearly identified, what is it?  "
274,What is the difference between a rifle and a shotgun?,"This is one of those things, that seems like it has just always been in my knowledge. A recent comment about rifles on a question about shotguns got me thinking, it really is not all that simple.  They make slugs that you can fire in a shotgun, and they make shot you can fire in a rifle.   If they can both shoot either slugs or shot, is there a difference? Are the names rifle and shotgun interchangeable? If there is a difference what are key points that distinguish them?  "
275,"What are the laws for backcountry (""dispersed"") camping in the US?",I'm planning on taking a trip across the US and was planning on doing as much dispersed camping (a.k.a.backcountry camping) as possible. I wanted to educate myself on where it is legal to go off trail trekking and camping. I am unsure about the logistics for preparing for this trip. To begin with I am wondering...   What permits may be necessary? What agencies may need to be contacted? What areas are likely to allow this type of trip?   Does anyone have some insights regarding what is required to legally and properly go into the woods to camp for 3+ days? 
276,What does lumen and lux for flashlights/torches actually mean?,"Most torches have their brightness specified in lumen, sometimes one also sees a lux number, at times both. While the technical meaning of these units are clear (lumen is luminous intensity per steradian, lux luminous intens. per area, see wikipedia for more details), it is unclear how these numbers are measured.  Torches usually have one or several light sources plus reflectors and lenses, resulting in a light beam that differs from model to model and is spatially inhomogeneous. Thus the lamp as a whole is not really a point light source.  What does the lumen number refer to?  The lux number is conceptually easier, as it does not require a point source and could be measured at any point of the light beam. However it probably is along the central beam axis.  Is there an agreed upon position/method to measure these values (in between manufacturers)? "
277,Why does a leader have to be tapered in fly fishing?,"I wonder why fly fishing leaders have to be tapered? Is the most important reason to preserve flight dynamics when casting? Would a simple untapered leader not present a dry fly, for example, in the same way as a tapered leader?   I otherwise do not see a reason why it has to be tapered as the weakest chain determines break-ability anyway (in this case tippet), so why not using a leader size that is untapered and lies in between the width of the end part and the tippet connecting part?  "
278,Can you pre-identify the risk of severe Altitude sickness?,"This BBC news article Mount Everest: Altitude sickness claims third death in four days caught my attention.   From what I understand the best cure for Altitude sickness is to get lower, fast.  This is not always possible.  Is there some kind of test you can do before going up a mountain to asses your risk of having a fatal case of Altitude sickness?   Related Questions:   What can I do to prevent altitude sickness?

279,How do you survive getting towed under a log jam?,"When I was a boy, my father and I were unexpectedly swept into a log jam (pile of logs the size of a house) on the banks of the Elk River while canoeing near our home.   Somewhat similar looking jam, but think bigger pile of logs, and more rapid waters:   My Dad, being an experienced voyageur from NW Ontario, instinctively jumped out of the canoe up onto the log jam. Me, being barely 13, watched the water hit the hull of the canoe with wide eyes for about 2 seconds before the canoe suddenly flipped in the swift current and took me under the log jam with it. Fortunately for me, the logs were piled there during higher waters, so after a couple of seconds of getting drug along the rocks at the bottom of the river under the logs and my canoe, I eventually popped back up on the other side of the jam, with my Dad close behind me (he jumped in after me when I got towed under).  After that incident I just considered jumping out of the canoe onto the jam before it gets sucked under to be the appropriate course of action in this situation. But now that I'm a father, I've been wondering, ""What would my Dad have done, if there was no way out the other side?"". He just dove in blindly after his son, and we were lucky that there was room under the jam for us to go all the way underneath.  What if there was no way out the other side?  What can you do to help yourself or someone else if they get sucked under a jam and get pinned against the logs underneath by the current? "
280,How to put on footwraps correctly?,"In this answer @Vorac mentions footwraps. So I wondered, if I want to try them, how should I put them on?  Does anyone have experience with this? Are there different methods to try? "
281,Are there standardized signals to communicate with aircraft?,"Suppose one is in distress in the wilderness, and is being searched for by planes or helicopters because they thoughtfully told their friends where they were going and when they'd be back. Alternately, suppose you're just on a hike but happen to look very similar to a party of lost hikers.   How would you indicate to the crew of an aircraft that you are or are not in distress? Are there globally recognized hand signals to definitively say ""I need help"" or ""I'm fine""? What if one wanted to relate more specific information, such as how many people are injured or what type of supplies you need?  "
282,What do I do if a black bear is right outside my tent?,"Even if I was to follow the advice of letting bears know I am in the area, keeping my cooking and anything that smells at least 100m from my camp &amp; downwind, etc, suppose a bear finds my tent and likes the smell of it.   What do I do? Suppose I do have a means of defending myself (maybe a canister of bear spray and/or a gun of some description)? "
283,What happens to rappel anchors?,"When setting up a rappel anchor, using things like webbing, rings, that kind of stuff, what happens to the anchor when you get to the bottom? Assuming you can't hike to the top and grab it, do you most people leave it behind? I've seen some instances where people don't use artificial anchors, but just wrap the rope around a tree and then pull the rope down when they're done.  It seems awfully wasteful, and against LNT to just leave a bunch of webbing on a rock. Thanks! "
284,Continue a hike when legs start cramping,"Yesterday I was hiking in partly deep snow where postholing was inevitable. I had no problems until one moment when I was getting cramps in the femoral. Luckily it was close to the end of my tour and walking got easier because the snow height decreased. But if this wasn't the case and I had to hold on for hours I'd been in trouble.  What can I do to quickly get rid of cramps so I am able to get to the camp or the end of a hike?  I think dehydration plays a major role here so I would pause, drink and get some calcium if I have. What else to do? Which drugs are helping? "
285,Do leeches fall onto prey from trees?,Do leeches fall from trees onto unsuspecting hikers?    Or do they only dwell on the ground and attach to passing feet/boots? 
286,Basic setup for trout fishing,"I am a whitewater kayaker and my GF, who does not kayak, sometimes accompanies me on river trips. She loves the outdoors and is never bored when I am boating (besides driving my vehicle from the putin to the takeout, AKA ""shuttle bunny"") but she has mentioned that she wouldn't mind to do some trout fishing.  While the water level needs for kayakers (higher flows) are different than for fishermen (lower flows), some of the rivers I paddle are dam released, IOW, the basic flow is low and then the dam releases, injecting a necessary flow for kayaking for a few hours, then it is low again.  So it could work out that she could fish on the same river where I am boating or find another stream with (stocked) trout nearby.  My question is, what is the basic setup for trout fishing with a spinning rod (which would be more basic than fly fishing)?  What size of rod is optimal.  Our rivers/creeks are mostly smaller (e.g. 30-100 ft across, 300-1400 CFS) with some rapids and some swimming/fishing holes in between and lots of trees around (which makes fly fishing less practical).  What kind of bait and test lines?  Other equipment? "
287,Best sun protection for swimming,"When I am going swimming in the pool my skin gets tanned due to sun.   Which SPF value is suitable for my purpose?

288,Prevent athlete´s foot (re)infection in barefoot shoes?,"How can I prevent (re-)infecting myself from my barefoot shoes? The obvious answer would be not to wear them while I am infected, but taken that aside, are there possibilities to clean/disinfect the shoes so I can wear them again? Is there a possibility to reinfect myself again at all?  My shoes - as probably most barefoot shoes - are washable with 30 - 40° C.  "

290,Why is boiling water making my steel pot brown?,"Lately, as I boil water in a steel pot, it is making the pots very dark brown, and the inner surface of the pots seems to have changed to feeling rough and scrubby.  Can anyone help with this?    Also, as I was doing slow cooking in the pot, strangely, the bottom thick layer came off!  I am baffled!  My pots look awful.    If this is what is happening to pots, how is this water for drinking?  I live in northwest Indiana.  I have lived here for twenty years and this hasn't happened before.  I had also boiled water from brita in these small pots first, and as it reduced.  Seems tap and brita water are doing the same thing to the pot. I want to know what is causing this? "
291,How to light a fire with wet firewood?,"There is a wide variety of pre-cut firewood available when camping. In my experience, even wood that's been kept covered is often very wet and can be difficult to light.  What are some techniques for lighting wet firewood?  Are there ways to tell wet pre-cut firewood from wood that's only damp on the outside? "
292,Should you avoid handling lambs?,"On a recent walk we ended up with a lamb following us. I picked it up and took it back to its mother.   As I walked past someone else on the trail shouted that I shouldn't   touch the lambs as ""it will follow you now"".  I didn't think it was a problem as I'd picked up lambs in farms (with the farmers permission) before.     So should I have handled the lamb? Should I have actually just ignored it?   Will picking up the lamb do it any harm? "
293,How to deal with diarrhea when using a cathole in the wilderness?,I was sitting and thinking last night...

Related   What&#39;s the problem with burying toilet paper?    Why are people so worried about Giardia?  
294,Kayakers throwing their paddles when running waterfalls,"I was watching a YouTube video featuring clips from award winning kayaking films.  One thing I immediately noticed was multiple instances of kayakers running waterfalls who seem to be intentionally throwing their paddle away during the drop (you can see what I'm talking about pretty clearly at about 2:20). This seems to be contrary to what I always learned that your paddle is your life. I understand that for the initial landing not having your paddle in your hand might reduce the chance for injury, but it seems like the almost complete lack of maneuverability due to no longer having a paddle should make holding onto the paddle worthwhile. Not the to mention the expense of losing paddles if they run away or the time involved in trying to find your paddle.  Are these people just dropping the waterfalls and immediately bailing out of their kayaks at the bottom when the camera stops so they don't care about maneuverability? Do they just count on friends out of frame that have an extra paddle to give them at the bottom? Or is the risk of injury just so great above a certain height that the paddle has to go? "
295,Are square or rectangular tarp shapes more versatile?,"I'd like to try tarp camping.  3m x 3m (9ft x 9ft) and 3m x 4m (9ft x 12ft) tarps of differing material are plentiful and many are even affordable.  Which tarp shape is more versatile in the number of setup configurations?    Configurations should include a simple roof, lean-to-type or a fully enclosed tent-like structures.  All weather conditions should be considered also.  I know there are other shapes but they seem to be intended for specialized configurations.   So Square or Rectangle?   "
296,Can I camp in the protected areas Þjórsárver and Guðlaugstungur og Álfgeirstungur?,"I am investigating the feasibility of a hike looping around Hofsjökull.  The route takes me through the Þjórsárver and Guðlaugstungur og Álfgeirstungur protected areas.  The regulations for Þjórsarver and those for Guðlaugstungur og Álfgeirstungur do not appear to make mention of camping, but Google Translate may fool me here.    Am I permitted to camp in those protected areas?  Naturally, I would practice strict leave no trace and avoid fragile vegetated areas, which is exactly what makes Þjórsárver so unique in the Highlands of Iceland (compare Þjórsárver photos with neighbouring Sprengisandur!) "
297,Does fordable by 4WD imply fordable on foot?,"I am investigating the feasibility of a hike looping around Hofsjökull.  Among the foreseen challenges are 17 crossings of named rivers (and many smaller ones).  All rivers I need to cross have 4WD roads fording through downstream from where I will be hiking, sometimes quite far downstream after the confluence of several more rivers.  From a driver's perspective, I have seen the recommendation, “if you wouldn't ford it on foot, don't ford it by car”.  Logically, it should follow that if a 4WD road does ford a river, it should be fordable on foot (weather permitting).  Is this accurate?  Can I infer from the observation that a 4WD road has an unbridged river crossing downstream that it may be fordable on foot upstream?  Edit: For the purpose of this question, please assume complete sterility.  I am considering only fordability due to water depth and force.  I am not interesting in dangers from carnivorous animals in the water.   "
298,"Obtaining drinking water from a glacier or icefield, in the absence of snow or reachable meltwater","What are some methods to obtain drinking water from a glacier or icefield, in the absence of snow or reachable meltwater?  Collecting ice is much harder than collecting snow.  Do I need to bring special tools or can I collect tools “in the wild” to break or scrape ice from a glacier/icefield for melting? "
299,How to confirm/remove ticks in tough spots when alone?,"When in tick country, tick checks are critical. Easier with a buddy who can look where the sun doesn't shine, but even alone, diligent inspection (especially with a mirror of some sort) can go a long way.  This question is about what to do after spotting what might be a tick in solo inspection. If one isn't certain if they've found a tick or not, or they are pretty certain but it is hard to access, what's the best course of action?  The question is general but here's a specific scenario: camping out in backcountry, I do a tick check and find what might be a tick on my middle lower back. I use a mirror and I brush it with my finger, then my nail, to see if it moves even a little bit (likely a tick) or if it seems to be completely one-with-my-skin (probably a forgotten birthmark). If I can't convince myself it is not a tick I spotted, or if I end up confident it is a tick, what should my next course of action be given its hard-to-access location and the lack of anybody else around? All the more challenging in this scenario, I don't plan to see anyone else for at least a few more days! "
300,Open-sided tarp in rain,"I saw people using a square tarp sort of like this:    Will you not get flooded during rain? Specifically, I'm wondering about water flowing in on the ground from the front.   Tyically, tents have a kind of rim around them on the bottom:    The entrance is not right at the floor but is above that black rim on the bottom.  With a tarp having one whole side open, and no rim, what happens if it rains? "
301,How to take a bearing when the geographic coordinate grid is not aligned with true north on a map?,"I am confused by my new map of the Westfjords of Iceland. The geographic coordinate grid is rotated slightly, but the map indicates that true north is still the top of the page.     What's going on? I would have thought a flat map would be unraveled so that all the lines of longitude were vertical and therefore parallel to true north.  Importantly, how do I take a bearing on this map? Do I rotate my housing so that it is aligned with the true north arrow or the grid?  Just to be clear, the above photograph contains the entire legend of the map. There is no mention of magnetic declination, which is roughly 15° W in this part of Iceland in 2017 according to this site. Furthermore, the difference between the grid and the north arrow is not 15°. It would be highly unusual for the north arrow to be magnetic and not true north, but I suppose that's possible. I think I understand how to calculate a route given true north and magnetic declination on a map, but I'm not sure how to interpret this map so that I can start planning my route.  In the comments, @imsodin asked if the angles of the longitudinal lines changed on the map. Using a high resolution scan of the map and Illustrator, I think I can conclude that they do very slightly:   "
302,"Where can we see genetically pure American Bison, including Yellowstone National Park?","Most species of bison have been bred with cattle at one time or another during history. The American Bison (bison bison) is unique because it's genetically pure, having only the DNA of the bison, with no evidence of genes of cattle or any other animal.   I've been told that Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA, has the oldest and largest population of pure American bison currently residing on public land. We live on the East Coast of the United States, and don't generally travel far away, but we really want to see some!   We've never been to a place as big as Yellowstone, so help would be appreciated. We'd like to know:   Where are the largest number of these bison located in the Park?  Are they visible throughout the year? If not, when is the best time of the year to see the most? What's the best time of day to see them?   What's the easiest access route to take, starting with the entrance to the Park, and choosing which trails/roads to use? If possible, I'd like to see them without too much walking or hiking, because I'm disabled, but if necessary, we'd figure something out. Adhering to the principles of Leave No Trace is a mandatory criteria.   If there are herds of pure bison in other places, including them as an option would be great too! We'd consider any place in the continent of North America.  "
303,What is this brown dust/powder inside my old pack?,"I have a Lowe Aline Attack 50 pack from around 2000 and recently much of the inside has accumulated a sort of brown powder that is either, I suspect, some kind of mildew, or the remains of the decomposition of the pack's waterproofing.    The stuff is not easy to remove; if I beat the pack while holding it upside down, the dust gradually falls out. Wiping it down with a damp cloth or cleaner doesn't speed the process up much. The stuff appears to be only on the waterproof liner and, to a much lesser extent, facing surfaces. What is it? Can it be removed? Is it just time for a new pack?  --  Addendum-- I've already accepted an answer below but wanted to share that Lowe customer support concurs that the waterproof liner has decomposed.    "
304,How to cool a tent?,"We are camping in the summer at the Mediterranean Sea. We camped there already sometimes and in the summers its quite hot. Now we are thinking about how to improve the cooling of a tent.  Maybe making the outside wet. Not sure if some wet things in the tent could help ? Does anyone have any tips ?   Its not about getting it cool while camping, but getting it bearable warm only. "
305,Is this a dragonfly or a damselfly?,"In August of 2015, my husband and I were out for a walk at the Wachusett Reservoir, in Central Massachusetts. It was the same walk, including day and time, as in this question.  We stopped at the water's edge. It's the same water I referenced in this question, although the reservoir is large, and we were quite a distance from that spot.   A lovely delicate-looking creature flew in and landed gently on the top of a broken twig of marsh grass, only a few inches from where we were standing. It had a narrow, stick-like orange and white body; a red head with large black eyes (which for some reason came out white in the photograph); four lacy orange/red wings edged in white; and very thin long gray legs.  We stayed very still and it remained resting there for at least five minutes. Then another landed nearby and ""ours"" flew towards it, and they took off together.   From past experience, I assumed it was a dragonfly. However, for the first time, I recently heard of something called a damselfly. I thought that meant a female dragonfly, mostly because a damsel is a female. (According to Oxford and other dictionaries, a damsel is technically ""a young unmarried woman"" but that has no bearing on this question!) However, I've been told by a friend that, although they're in the same family, they're two different entities with similar, but unique, characteristics and behavior.  The first picture is the original taken by my husband. The others are the same picture, just cropped and zoomed in, so you can see more details, like the fur. As I said above, the white eyes in the picture were actually black. Unfortunately, we didn't get a side view, and you can only see the end of one wing, but I'm hoping there's enough to make a correct identification.  Is this a dragonfly or a damselfly? How can I tell? (Of course it's possible that it's neither, but I don't think that's the case.)     "
306,How far from a road do I need to be to not hear the traffic?,"We are always camping in areas we have not been to before.  We usually use Google maps (satellite) to try and guess about the appropriateness of a camp before going there.    From experience we know that a couple hundred feet (~100 meters) of forest between a camp site and busy highway, means lots of road noise in the camping experience. A couple miles (3KM) of forest between camp and busy roads, almost always results in only hearing forest sounds.   Are there any scientific data on how much forest (or other terrain) will dissipate the majority of traffic noise?   Rephrase Question; What is the minimum amount of forest I need between me and the highway so I won't hear the highway?  "
307,Climbing outdoors makes the skin of my palm red and sensitive,"I mostly climb at a rock climbing gym, and I can climb for hours until my forearms run out of gas.   However, when I climb outdoors, usually the reason I have to stop is because the skin of my palms and especially my fingers become red and sensitive, meaning whenever I touched a rock the pain is so bad that I am not able to continue climbing despite I still have a lot of gas in my forearms.  I thought about avoiding warming up on V0~V1s because I want to save my skin for harder climbs, but at the same time I feel like skipping warmups is asking for injuries.   I tried wearing gloves but it just didn't feel right and according to the videos on YouTube of people who climb outdoors, no one wears it.   Can someone tell me how to solve this? Currently I feel climbing indoors is more enjoyable because I can actually fully exhaust my muscles, but I read at so many places that climbing outdoors is supposedly to be more fun and cool, and I really want to experience that.    Is the material of the gym holds more skin-friendly? I don't recall myself running into skin problems when I first started to climb in the gym. "
308,What is the impact/risks of high altitude walking on individuals suffering from High Blood Pressure?,"Setting aside the benefits of cardiocavascular exercise in general, what are the risks to hikers/climbers with high blood pressure at various altitudes?    Is there an upper ceilling/threshold that HBP sufferers are recommended not to ascend above?  Given the prevalence of HBP in Western Society and the popularity of mountain hiking tour packages, this question seems a good fit for TGO SE with applicability beyond me.  "
309,Can I reuse the PADI Scuba Diving e-training for another person?,"My brother and I are planning to get PADI, (Professional Association of Diving Instructors), certified. The e-learning course in July, 2018 is $180, which isn't super cheap. Can I buy one and re-use it for the two of us? Will most dive schools accept that? "
310,"Where are some accessible flat areas for handicapped birders in Acadia National Park in Maine, USA?","We're planning a trip to Acadia National Park in Maine, USA. It would be in July or August. We'll be spending two days, with a night in a hotel in one of the surrounding towns. (We haven't chosen that spot yet!)  Our group includes able-bodied hikers and climbers; and people who need wheelchairs, walkers and canes. The park is large, with several different types of terrain, so we think it's a good choice for a mixed group.   It's mostly a mission to see and record as many types of birds as we can, including ocean birds; and report the data to an environmental conservation group. We also want to just explore and have fun!   Obviously the more able-bodied will have the best viewing opportunities, and the freedom to be adventurous. They'll take turns helping the the rest of us, but we'd like to be as independent as possible.   Which road has the best accessible areas to see the most birds? We want to be in the woods, by the ocean or both. Handicapped parking would be nice, but is not necessary if it would limit our opportunities.   Where are there flat, or mostly flat, trails? What about wooden or gravel trails that wheelchairs can handle? The itinerary is customized for the wheelchair bound, but they can stop at nice places on a trail while the device-aided walkers venture farther.   I'm sure there are accessible lookouts along the roads, but we want to go deeper into the park to experience nature and fulfill our birding mission.  I don't want to be off-topic by just asking for opinions, but in our situation experience would be very helpful.   There must be good information somewhere with guidelines and directions or maps.  I'd appreciate those too.   ` "
311,Titanium Carabiner: what is its ideal use case?,"I have the specs of a pretty interesting carabiner. It's made from titanium, it's lightweight and strong. These seem to be great attributes, but there are two caveats.    It is pretty expensive ($50). Maybe that's typical of weight bearing carabiners; I can understand that people do not want to cheap out on a vital piece of gear like that. It does not explicitly say it is ""weight bearing"". It's made by some Japanese or Korean company, and they don't have US customer service.   The smart thing to do here is to not use it as a weight bearing carabiner; better safe than sorry. Nonetheless, I will still share the specs with the community here with the hopes of mapping out its ideal use case.  Product Specs   Material: Titanium (Grade 5) Length: 2.24 in Width: 1.5 in Thickness: .24 in Weight: 1.02 oz Hardness: Nitriding heat-treatment     Question  This titanium carabiner really does seem to be built impeccably well, but I'm not sure why its product description omitted whether or not it's ""weight bearing."" Judging from the specs, should we simply infer that it is weight bearing? If not used for weight-bearing, what is the ideal use case for such a quality production carabiner? Is it simply vanity? "
312,"What are these fishing things called ""Pre-rigged sets""?","(Note: I'm a total noob in fishing).  I've seen some so-called ""pre-rigged sets"" with a hook and a float attached onto some line and wound around a piece of plastic:    They usually come with some ~7m (20ft) line. Which brings me to my question:  What am I supposed to do with that line?   It is not long enough for use by itself. Joining it with the rest of my line would make a nasty knot, which would interfere with casting. Cut it and splice just above the bobber? ???  "
313,No Stop Limit for Recreational Scuba Diving,"No decompression diving (No stop diving) refers to ""diving that you can always ascend directly to the surface without stopping, yet without significant risk of decompression sickness"" (according to PADI Open Water Manual). A traditional way to plan a dive is to use a dive table (e.g., see the picture below). For example, if I have a 20-minute dive at 20 meters, then I'm in Pressure Group G, meaning that there's is G amount of nitrogen in my body, thus limiting the duration of my next dive.  However, my question is that, for example, if I want to do a 40-meter dive with air, why is my no decompression limit capped at 9 minutes? I would only have G amount of nitrogen in my body. However, if I dive at 20 meters for 45 minutes, I could have U amount of nitrogen! The amount of nitrogen in my body determines the No Decompression Limit, is that right? If so, why can't I dive til I have G amount of nitrogen in my body at 40 meters? Thanks everyone.   "
314,Self-diagnosis of hypothermia onset,"Does anyone have experience with self-assessment of early stages of hypothermia, in the context of the other subjective experiences that may come with solo wilderness adventures?  In my experience, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep deprivation, endorphins, adrenaline, feelings of elation/euphoria in the presence of wild nature can obscure the described symptoms, and thus cloud the decision to rally to reach the planned stopping point, or make camp immediately and warm up.    Are there distinct telltale signs that occur before impaired judgment becomes a significant factor?   Thank you everyone for posting general hypothermia diagnosis / treatment notes such as [website]and specifically regarding use of a thermometer (consensus:  don’t use a thermometer to diagnose hypothermia in the backcountry) [website]"
315,Is clipping onto the rungs of a via ferrata bad practice?,"I did my first via ferrata this weekend and noticed there were often long vertical distances separating the cable anchors. At times this length was around 10m. This meant that a fall before reaching the cable anchor, if both cables were clipped onto the cable, would mean you'd plummet 10m + the length of the lanyard into the rocks below. This would result in severe injury or death.   All the advice I have read seems to say that both carabiners must be attached to the cable at all times, but surely, if it's safer to do so, why not clip one of the carabiners onto the metal rungs of the route and have the other clipped onto the cable? This seems like common sense to me but I'm surprised it isn't mentioned anywhere. Is this practice frowned upon? Or is there something I'm not understanding?  "
316,Emergency use hydration products - effectivness vs cost,"My medical kit already has some MRE style clean water bags, purification tablets, as well as OTC anti-diarrheal pills at the ready. However, now, I am researching what options there are for hydration in a life-threatening scenario (severe dehydration, possibly including prolonged diarrhea or vomiting). I want to include such a product in my medical kit in case I or someone I encounter while hiking has life-threatening dehydration. While I must concede that much of the bio-chemistry is way over my head, I would still like to think I have compiled a reasonably well-informed list of products. I tried to find not only the hi-tech premium products but also products more on the thrifty-side. Here are the products I researched in order of most expensive per unit gram:  Ceralyte   Site: [website]Market: medicine, military Price: 100g for $23.00 (10x 10g sticks) Price per unit gram: $0.23   DripDrop   Site: [website]Market: military, firefighters and athletes Price: 84g for $9.99 (4x 21g sticks) Price per unit gram: $0.12   Pedialyte Powder   Site: [website]Market: pediatrics, health enthusiasts? Price: 272g for $27.00 (24x 8.5g sticks) Price per unit gram: $0.10   Gatorade Powder   Site: [website]Market: athletes Price: 588g for $15.00 (12x 49g sticks) Price per unit gram: $0.03   Pedialyte and Gatorade are not marketed as emergency hydration products; Pedialyte has a disclaimer on their website that their hydration powder is only suitable for mild to moderate diarrhea. That being said, the low-end products are quite a bit cheaper.  Question:   Perhaps this is just a classic case of ""you get what you pay for,"" but I'm wondering if it's considered over-kill to buy military/pharmaceutical grade hydration powders for a hiking kit (72 hour bag). I'd like to hear from anyone with experience using any of these products. Are the high-end products like Ceralyte and DripDrop really heads and shoulders above cheaper products like Pedialyte Powder and Gatorade Powder? Better enough to warrant the price premium as shown above? "
317,Possible dangerous animals in north-west natural parks of the US in late July,"I am going to go to the Yellowstone park and other parks in the north-west (e.g., Glacier park); I'll be there for a couple of weeks in the late summer and we will sleep in tents in campgrounds part of the time. I have been excited about that for a long time: this is a dream since I was a kid watching documentaries on the Italian public TV. However, as that time is approaching I am having thoughts about bears and the like. Am I likely to meet dangerous animals while camping? Here I have some related questions:   How likely is that I would meet bears at this time of the year? How likely it is that I meet wolves or mountain lions or other carnivores at this time of the year? What other animals should one be aware of, in order to have a happy and accident-free vacation? (e.g., poisonous snakes, deer/wood-ticks) How should you behave when you meet them?   I know more or less what I could expect: I will be going there with two Americans; we are planning to stay on the beaten track; and my wife's dad is a hunter from Minnesota, so he will get us prepared a little bit. However, I do not have firsthand experience and I would like to have advice with this regard from experienced people. "
318,How does zinc oxide work?,"I am a big fan of zinc oxide products for minor outdoor injuries, e.g. zinc oxide tape for blisters on feet, or products like Sudocrem for sunburn and so on. They certainly seem to help the healing process. But how exactly does it work? By this I mean, how does it trigger or enhance the body's natural healing process, and is there anything additional I can do maximise the effectiveness of zinc oxide products? "
319,How can I prevent plantar fasciitis?,Every year or so I'll end up with plantar fasciitis after periods of time where I've walked a lot. In general my walking shoes are fine and have arch support but occasionally I'll need to use sturdier boots or sometimes walking sandals with no support. It's usually not long after that that the pain starts.  What methods or items of equipment are there to prevent this? Are there good quality shoes/boots/sandals with arch support? Does anyone have experience of extended walks with inserts? 
320,How can I avoid putting cinder burn holes in my clothing?,"This is especially problematic if you dress up in layers, the last one being, for example, a raincoat. Putting a burn hole through your rain coat let's the rain in...  Are there some tricks in fire-making that reduce this risk? Any other tricks to protect what you're wearing (be it a raincoat or one of those down coats; you don't want your precious down falling out)? "
321,Backup prusik for Abseiling: Where does it go?,"When abseiling from an anchor during rock climbing, I like to use a backup prusik as a potential lifesaver in case I screw up.  However, I have heard different advice on where to put it, both for where to attach it to myself and where to attach it to the rope:   Clip it to the belay loop or the leg loop or to a loop of my personal anchor system (PAS)? Tie it ""uphill"" from the belay device or ""downhill""?  "

323,Time of high / low tide,"When in coastal areas, where can I get times of high tide / low tide? I know that Garmin GPS can do it, but without it? What is the simplest way to determine in the wilderness? Which factors does it depend on, besides the phase of the moon? Can I estimate it somehow in the night just by looking where the moon is?  It might get particularly useful e.g. when:   Wild camping on coastal areas, Planning crossing of the coastal river estuaries (with backpacks) - already practiced this, Entering brackish waters / mangroves.

330,Making my own Vapor Barrier Liner for a mummy sleeping bag,"I'm trekking up the Kilimanjaro and planned on using my sleeping bag which is rated for -10 / +10 with an extreme at -17 degree Celsius. I read that temperatures may plunge down to -25° at the very top, although I don't know how cold nights at the camps are to be.  I was planning on making my own Vapor Barrier Liner in case I get cold, despite the bag and my cotton liner.  My plan is to use a heavy-duty garbage bag (to prevent moisture from leaving), add infrared radiation reflection with a thermal blanket inside of that, and to make things cozy, slip in my cotton liner.  Is this a decent homemade vapor barrier liner? If not, how can it be improved? Also, how damp may my cotton liner be in the morning with such a system? "
331,How to store a backpack while sleeping?,"During a recent backpacking trip, we hung the bear bag and got ready to set in for the night and I realized I wasn't sure what I should do with my backpack. Technically the backpack was carrying the food bag all day, so should it be hung? I should clarify that I am not using a bear canister, so although the food is in sealed bags, it still technically is in contact with the bag  From personal experience, I've always just left it right outside of my tent, but now that I'm acquiring more expensive backpacking gear, I fear that my backpack will be dragged off in the night by a bear or have a hole chewed in it by a rodent. Is there a best practice for this kind of thing? Any suggestions?   Thanks! "
332,Is there a standard set of light signals for mountaineers?,"On a recent winter backpacking trip there was some confusion and danger of separation of the group.  The group had not walked together before. Some members were not very experienced, while others were quite fit.  The group separated several times, during night time. Later days there were fogs.  This gets me wandering, is there a standard set of signals between mountaineers in the range 500m - 10km with a flashlight. As, for example, this site, demonstrates body signalling at distance.    Here is a list of the messages that I anticipate to be often useful in hiking, climbing emergencies:  Reverse SOS       We are here. (Because of poor visibility) we will stay stationary. Safety is this way. We are waiting for you.   ID       Who are you? I am number 8. I am the last in the walking line.   Acknowledgement       I understand and agree. I do not understand or do not agree.   Danger       How are you doing? Everything is OK, we are proceeding as planned. We have a problem, but there is no danger. We are in danger. Help.   Most people can't work with Morse code, and even a printed sheet of the code would be impractical without previous training.  My question is is there a similar system of signals? Something like a circle with the flashlight, pointing something with the beam or a cross with the flashlight. "
333,Do you need to purify all mountain water sources,"I was just reading this question What is the safest way to purify water?  Now I walk a lot in Snowdonia in North Wales and on occasion I drink from mountain streams. I've even camped next to mountain streams and used the water as my main water source.  I haven't used any purification tablets or boiling (generally) and suffered no ill effects. I always ensure the water is fast running and 90% of the time it's fed from mountain springs, so I've always assumed it's safe, in fact I'm sure I've read it's generally cleaner than most tap water!  I'm not sure where I picked up this information, I'm pretty sure my Dad used to do this.  There will be very limited chemical pollutants (from fertilizers, etc.) in the water as the area has virtually no arable farming.  Mining is probably the worst potential pollutant but I always check the source of the water(I've been walking in the are since I was very young and know the sources of most of the streams)  Am I mad or risking my health?  "
334,What EXACTLY is the chemical coating on the outside of GoreTex?,"I've got a pretty good understanding of how GoreTex works.   I understand that the outside chemical coating effectivly holds water off the outer layer (using little chemical spikes).  But I can't quite seem to find out what the coating on the outside (when new) is? What's it's name or chemical symbols, etc?  the reason I'm asking (and is also a secondary question) is, do the standard replacement products (all of which are not made by GoreTex themselves) contain the same chemical, exactly? "
335,Factors to be considered and prepared in case of unavoidable bivouac,"There are numerous situations when mountaineers may have to bivouac.    A few of them are exceptionally not advised but unavoidable at the same time.  I was going through the details of the K2-Tragedy(2008) and I learnt that in situations where one runs out of time and doesn't want to give up the summit bid, one may end up in a situation when he/she has to bivouac.  I am absolutely not in the mind to do something like what Marco Confortola and Gerard MacDonell or Wilco Van Rooijen did.  What can one do to prepare for such a bivouac? What are things that one should look for in case if he/she/they are going to have to Bivouac?    I believe that when one realizes that he/she has to bivouac, it is pretty late and the sun has set already.  Edit: Lets take this question into consideration Spectifically for High Altitudes. "
336,Abandoning a multi pitch climb,"If you're on a multi pitch route and you decide to abandon the climb and retreat(say the weather has turned unexpectedly). What is the minimum amount of gear you should leave behind as a rope anchor to effect a successful and safe retreat (abseil)?  Could cord be used as a sling over a sturdy flake or would you need to leave behind proper slings (nylon or dyneema), nuts or worse yet expensive camming devices? "
337,Shall I buy a Large size shell if I am wearing Medium size Down Jacket?,"So that I can have some spaces to wear Down or Fleece inside the jacket?   Normally Large size shell is too large for me, or I should buy the same size so as fit as possible? "
338,Is it realistic to teach yourself rock climbing?,"I've been wanting to get into rock climbing for a while but I live in a very flat area with no climbing gyms around. I'm planning on moving to the Pacific Northwest soon and I wanted to know what the general consensus was about teaching yourself to climb. Obviously it would be easier to have a guide, but I'm also trying to save money wherever I can.   I've seen a lot of people recommend this book: Freedom of the Hills as a good way for getting into it and learning everything you can. I've been researching as much as I can online.  Is it a realistic goal to teach yourself how to climb or is it really necessary (and safe) to be taught by a professional? Does anyone have experiences or stories of this?  Thanks!  EDIT: I should mention that I won't be all by myself, I have a partner to climb with, just another novice, my fiancee. I guess I meant more like professional instruction vs. self-taught.  "
339,How to dry paddling gloves,I currently use MEC Humboldt paddling gloves for cycling in warm/cool - windy/wet weather as they offer better protection than my thin runnning gloves and are not as hot as my winter gloves.  My issue is when I wear them the second or third day in a row they are still wet on the inside with my perspiration.   Is it safe to throw them in the dryer on low heat? If actually used for paddling out in the woods how would you dry them?    EDIT: Can a Silica Gel packet from a shoe box be placed inside the glove to draw out moisture? 
340,Does sandpapering finger tips improve rock climbing?,"Is sandpapering your finger tips an effective way to improve anything about your rock climbing?  On occasion, I will see climbers in YouTube videos or people at the local crag using sandpaper on their finger tips. Why do people do this? What benefit is there? Is this, perhaps, more superstition than practical? "
341,Belly flopping top outs,"I've always mocked friends who top-out using their belly (stomach) when bouldering. It's not very graceful but I was reading this article on UKClimbing and it shows someone topping out on a V6 using his stomach. I've always considered this bad form, but maybe I'm wrong.  Is topping out on your belly actually bad form? What is considered best form, and why is it better than bellying out? "
342,Cutting snow steps on slopes,"In many of the mountaineering expedition books that I've read, there are references to cutting of snow steps on slopes.   What is the advantage of cutting snow steps? Why not use crampons and do a front pointing cramponing with additional support from the ice axe? (Side stepping also seems reasonably safe on non vertical climbs). Is there a specific situation which calls for snow steps? "
343,What are the consequences of — illegally — using a 446 MHz PMR in the North American wilderness?,"I've recently bought a pair of PMR446 walkie-talkies with some 5–10 km range, operating at 446 MHz.  We've happily used them in Sareks Nationalpark in Sweden.  Now I'm moving to Canada, where this frequency requires a license.  My options are to:   Buy another pair for use in Canada Get a license Use them anyway without a license   Suppose that we're hiking in a remote mountain region of British Columbia, Yukon, or Alaska.  In all likelihood, nobody is going to be nearby.  What are the likely consequences if we use it anyway — for us, and for others?  Wikipedia notes:     PMR446 radios use frequencies that in the U.S. and Canada are allocated to amateur radio operators. PMR446 radios can only be used in North America by licensed amateur radio operators. The conflicting allocations have been something of a nuisance to North American amateur operators due to use of the equipment by European tourists in the U.S. and Canada.[citation needed]      Instead, the U.S. and Canada uses the FRS system, which provides a similar service on slightly different frequencies. FRS frequencies are allocated to the emergency services in Europe, notably the fire brigade in the UK, police in Russia.[2] Interference with licenced radio services may result in prosecution.   Will PMR446 usage in North America likely lead to prosecution, and/or endanger anybody? "
344,Strengthening exercises for a backpacking trip?,"I just finished a 22.4 mile hiking trip, which was spread of two days and it's the furthest I've ever hiked. When I finished my body was killing me, apparently taking long day hikes is not a replacement for actual trekking.  My question is, is there any specific workouts that you've found benefit you directly for hiking? Obviously there's a lot of general body fitness workouts, but I wanted to know any workouts specifically to improve hiking conditioning? For things like knee and ankle strength, or back strength to carry heavy loads...that kind of thing. "
345,How to begin in alpine tours,"I know it's probably too risky to make alpine tours alone, especially when you go over glaciers. I joined DAV to be insured while in the mountains and to be able to use the offerings like courses and guided tours. But they are quite expensive, I can't and don't want to do this every month.  I also read books about the topic but I guess book knowledge isn't enough, especially for higher risk mountain tours.  In my opinion the best would be to have a couple of more advanced friends who are able to teach or even know guides or groups and go with them for fun and to learn. Unfortunately I am not having this opportunity.   What do you think is most important to learn and how should one learn?   My experience is quite low, e.g. I have no clue about knots and security. I think that I am quite well equipped already, although this might not be the most important to start with. From my point of view I am also quite fit.    To summarize the question I could also ask:   When you were a beginner, who were the persons you learnt from and how did you met them?  What did they teach you and in which order?  "
346,How do you keep the inside of your backpack organized?,"Here's my current setup.    First I put my earthpad in my pack, using it like a cylinder to provide cushion and make my pack stay upright. Then I place a plastic bag within the earthpad for waterproofing (I hike in the tropics). Inside the plastic lining, at the bottom I put my sleeping bag and campsite clothes. I use the first-in-last-out method wherein the last items that i will use are at the bottom.    However its takes a lot of time and effort if I need to take out an item at the bottom or at the middle and repacking everything back. Sometimes I get tired I just stash everything inside my pack.   So how do you keep your backpack stuff organized and keep your sanity? Am I doing something wrong? "
347,How long will worms last in the refrigerator?,"So, my two kids are old enough to go fishing and have fun, but they get bored after an hour or so.  I purchased some worms from a local shop, and at our rate of fishing, it's going to take a while to use them up. I was told they were pretty fresh, and they apparently came from Canada (and boy are their arms tired...). The worms are packed in a small (6""x6""x2"") Styrofoam box that seems to seal itself pretty well.  They are packed in dirt, and they seem pretty happy when I open the container.  How long can I expect them to last in the fridge?  Is a typical home refrigerator (33-35 degrees) too cold?  They were in a cooler at the bait shop, but I have no idea how cold it was.  Is there anything I can do to make the little guys more comfortable?  How do I know when they are ""expiring""?  I guess they just quit moving, but are there other signs that it's probably time to git rid of them? "
348,How to stow backpack and boots whilst in a hammock?,"I'm contemplating using a hammock for my next trip, usually I'd keep my backpack and boots with me inside when I sleep to keep them dry.  Is there room in a hammock for a backpack and boots? Or is it uncomfortable being pulled into them all night? Can I instead hang them beneath a hammock, and is access an issue in that case?  I don't need to worry about predators where I'm camping so there's no problem with keeping the pack (and food) with me. "
349,What makes some beaches better spots for beachcombers than others?,"I live within walking distance of Del Monte beach in Crow City, USA (Also known as Monterey, California).  I enjoy scouring the beach for interesting-looking stones, seashells, and bits of seaworn colored glass fragments.  It seems to me that ""my"" beach is more fruitful than other beaches / your typical, run-of-the-mill beach. Every time I go, it's different, depending on the wave action from the previous night, but there are usually at least a couple of good ""rock fields"" as I call them through which to sift for sightly souvenirs.  On some occasions there are several sand dollars, but usually none; one some occasions, there are several beaches dead animals (birds, seals) but usually none; sometimes quite a bit of ""sea glass"" but usually very little if any. Oftentimes there are a lot of pieces of ""holey"" rocks (light in weight, either light or dark grey rocks with perforations in them, but their relative abundance differs from visit to visit.  I believe Monterey Bay is quite deep and that the dropoff is pretty dramatic - does this have anything to do with the generosity of the Pacific in this particular spot? It seems that the opposite would take place - since the material to be deposited comes from quite a depth (assumedly) it would take a lot to belch it forth.   Does the variability of material depend on which spot, or which depth of the ocean floor is being scoured with a particular storm / series of waves?  Note: after an unusually heavy amount of erosion of sand (when the sea ""takes more than it gives"" such as Saturday night, which I noticed Sunday morning) there are also more ""treasure hunters"" (cats with geiger counters) out on the beach. What are they seeking - lost rings and such, which are closer to the surface after the waves strip away some of the topsand? "
350,"Are the birds that snatch bread out of the air ""more citified"" (tamer) than those who let it drop?","I often take a slice of bread to the beach when I go on my beachcombing ramblings, and throw pieces of it to the shore birds that are, like me, combing the beach but, unlike my search for ""jewels"" are on the scavenge for grub.  For the most part, these avians are seagulls of one stripe or another. However, I notice a striking difference in their behavior: some will hover overhead and snatch the pieces of bread out of the air as I chuck them skyward, but most of them look at the bread to see where it's going to fall and then swoop down and sweep it up; or they just land on the beach in front of me and wait for a treat to come their way (I broadcast the morsels pretty equally, trying to give each bird a piece).  Are the air-grabbers hungrier than the more sedate ones? Or are they just more accustomed to humans heaving them their dinner and are thus ""old wings"" at plucking the tidbits out of the stratosphere before one of their mates gets an opportunity to intercept their meal? "
351,Best time to buy used (wind-)surfing equipment,"I am wondering if there is a best time to buy used surfing equipment. Is there any time when the offered variety will be greatest or when the prices will be lowest? Would that be just after season or at the start?  Will this differ for windsurfing, kitesurfing and waveriding? "
352,Does freezing cut bait affect its attractiveness to fish?,"Some background:  I go fishing 3-4 times a week at a local river for catfish, carp, perch, bass, and sunfish.  My favorite bait for catfish (and the one that I find most consistent) is fresh cut perch/sunfish.  I will usually jig a small nightcrawler in the shallows to catch a perch/sunfish and then chop it up and use the fresh cut pieces to catch larger flathead and channel catfish.  This technique has which consistently produced bites and fish (regardless of where I'm at).  Recently, the perch bite has been super hot so I will end up catching three or four perch and only end up using maybe one and a half during that fishing session.  I have been taking the remaining bait home and freezing it and then bringing it out the next day.  The problem I have been finding is that the frozen cut bait gets significantly less bites than the fresh cut bait, somedays the frozen bait will literally get no bites in a 2-3 hour period.  My question is: does freezing cut bait really make it less attractive to fish?  The bait shops that I go to all sell their cut bait frozen so I figured that was standard practice.  But given the last month or so, I am really questioning if frozen cut bait is even worth using.  I guess additionally, I was wondering if anyone knows if there are any ways to make frozen cut bait more attractive to fish? "
353,How dangerous is it to climb a via ferrata alone?,"What are the risks of climbing a via ferrata alone?  Would going through very easy via ferratas still pose high risks? Are well visited and easy climbing via ferratas necessarily a great danger?  I intend to do it frequently on the same route, regularly, as an exercise. "
354,What are the wall-cleaners in climbing called? What equipment/gear do they use?,I have been watching this climbing video of Alex Honnold.  In this video his friend goes ahead of him and cleans the wall of any debris or slippery rocks.  What are these people who clean the walls for the climbers called?  Or is it just the only one instance where a person actually cleaned a wall for the climber?  What is the equipment used by these people? 
355,Essential windsurfing moves,"In windsurfing there exist many different moves. Apart from the very basic techniques (like uphauling the sail), which moves are considered essential for windsurfing? Which order is good for learning them? "
356,Am I packing too much for a 2-3 day hike in the forests?,"I have decided that I would like to hike.  I have read a bit on hiking, and bought some gear and a backpack to get started. I want to start with backpacking through mostly flat forests, and later advance to mountains in Poland, like Bieszczady, and Tatry.  The problem is, when I put on my backpack and put on the hip and chest belts, it felt heavy and cumbersome, making me lean forward. I was wondering — am I so out of shape, or did I pack so much unnecessary things?  My backpack weighs about 10.5 kilograms (or about 23 pounds) without the food and water with all the equipment I would like to take on a two to three day hike. Is this too much? For a two-day hike, I would like to add at least 3.5 liters of water, and around 1 kilogram of food, bringing the total weight to about 15 kilograms (or about 33 pounds). For a three-day hike, my backpack weighs about 16 to 18 kilograms (or about 32 to 40 pounds).  Here's what's inside my backpack currently:   A sleeping bag A tent for two people A foam camping mat A fleece jacket A t-shirt Pants Two pairs of underwear Two pairs of socks A tarp (just in case of rain, used as a poncho) About ten meters of paracord Hygiene items, including wet wipes, a small towel, biodegradable soap, toothpaste, a toothbrush, and toilet paper Tools, including a small sewing/backpack fixing kit, knife, multi-tool, tape, a pen, and paper A headlamp A flashlight A power bank Batteries Bug spray Suntan cream A mess kit that includes a pocket stove Some fuel A steel mug A spork A lighter Matches Flint A compass A map A whistle Some zip bags Some trash bags A first-aid kit  "
357,Paramo vs Gore-Tex jackets?,"I'm considering replacing my North Face Gore-tex jacket as it's starting to get a bit tatty, some of the zips are breaking, etc.  I've seen quite a few Paramo jackets about. I'm presuming they're quite good as they are the jackets I see a lot of mountain rescue members and mountain guides wearing.   A mentioned this to a friend and he said, ""they're the marmite of mountain equipment, some people love them, others hate them"" but didn't elaborate further.   So what does a Paramo jacket do that's different to Gore-tex? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?  "
358,Any sites/apps for sharing and rating hiking/hillwalking routes?,"In Germany, there are many hiking/hillwalking trails. Is there any apps or sites that allow people to share hiking routes? Where I can try to search for nice places people have been, or create my own routes (""I want to do a 20km hike in a circle, starting from within 50km of some town, and there should be a restaurant near the middle for lunch"").  Sites like Strava for fitness allow you to share runs and cycle trips you've done. Is there anything for hiking/hillwalking? "
359,Fixed line: Prusik vs mechanical ascender,"The standard mountaineering textbook Freedom of the Hills has a long discussion of fixed lines, and they state simply that you use a mechanical ascender on them. This seems odd to me, since for most mountaineering I would be carrying a pretty light rack, and it probably wouldn't include a heavy mechanical ascender. I would just have a Prusik loop handy.  What would be the pros and cons of one versus the other? Is a Prusik any less likely to hold if the rope has snow or ice on it? Is it an issue of speed on siege-style climbs, where you're ferrying loads? They seem to have in mind some kind of massive expedition, where you bring a special-purpose 100-meter static line just for this purpose. "
360,Optimal use of available GPS devices when stranded,"There are quite a lot of questions concerning GPS device usage, however I couldn't find any specific information on more passive usage (as in waiting for rescue).  Say I have a watch and a phone which both have inbuilt Global Positioning Systems (GPS). When I am stranded in the wilderness, what can I do with them, in order to use them in a most optimal way.   By this I mean, while i'm waiting for search and rescue... for the sake of argument say I cannot use those devices as the actual means of finding my way out, because of some environmental/physical impossibility.  Here are some points which I am interested in, but do not limit your answer to them:   Should the device be switched on? Should the GPS on the device be switched on? What can I do to prolong battery life? Is the device useless once the battery is dead?  If I know they are looking for me, would they pick up the signal, if I switch it on for short periods every now and again? Is it best if I stay in one place (environment permitting) and would it be harder for them if I am on the move?  "
361,"How to carry perishable foods on a multi-day trip, without it going rotten?","We want to trek in a jungle for 4 days and we want to carry sufficient food for all days without it becoming rotten. Is there a special tool we should buy or a specific case to take into account in order to keep the food safe? We absolutely don't want to see rotten food in the 2nd day or so!   What is your suggestion? What do you do to keep food fresh over multiple days?  EDIT:    Well, question is not broad! Any food that is potential to become rotten needs a way to preserve it. For example lets say that we want to carry meat, egg, vegetables. I need a way to keep them healthy and fresh. Why you should say it is a broad question?    How to carry foods with the potential to become rotten???? "
362,What type of rope should I use for roof work?,"Am going to do some repairs on my roof, (not a climber). not sure regarding the type of rope I should get?  Also, any advice as to how to secure the rope to my harness? "
363,Where is the optimal place to do dishes in the backcountry?,"I just came back from a backpacking trip in an alpine area. I was cleaning some kitchen items (pot, spork, pan, etc) with some remnant food particles that were coming off. I use a very small amount of baking soda or campsuds to clean with.   I know to stay at least 200' away from water sources, and not to put food particles near camp because of increasing unwanted visitors (bears, bugs, mice, etc).   Does it matter beyond that though? Are there some places that are better than others? Vegetation versus sand? I default to rocks (big ones) because it's generally cleaner to set down wet cookware while working it and I function under the idea that food particles out there in the open on a rock will be quickly munched up.  "
364,How to record 2-day trek track when Garmin etreX 20 has limitation of 2000 points?,"There is a limitation of 2000 points in Garmin etrex 20. I have bought it recently and have not used it for a real trek. As far as I know when you reach the 2000 points limit and want to save it, the device will remove extra points. So you will not have an accurate track. What is the solution to this problem? Should I add an SD card? Will it save me in the wild? Or should I save track every 5 hours in order to prevent it from removing extra point? "
365,Is it safe to wear a down jacket while building a fire,"The outside of a down jacket is usually made of nylon or polyester, which is inflammable.  While trying to build a fire, is it safe to wear this jacket? Or will the flying embers be enough to set the person ablaze?  If not, what should the person wear? Fleece? "
366,How effective are pen launcher bear bangers compared to bearspray?,"So pen launcher bear bangers have apparently been around for quite a while, the training video for Truflare looks like something from out of the 90's, but they don't appear to be very popular, and I don't hear many people recommending them as an alternative to bear spray, despite the fact that they're much cheaper than bearspray.  The smaller flare cartridges below are classic red signal flares, the larger cartridges are the bear bangers, which have a delayed explosive charge that makes a really loud bang.    I'm familiar with bear bangers that you fire from a shotgun, but those are different, they're actually a large rubber wad that you shoot the bear with, so the bang is the impact the shot makes when it hits the bear. These pen launcher bear bangers get shot in the air, so the bang is the noise from the explosion.   Aside from being a lot smaller and lighter (and cheaper), these seem to me like they could potentially be a lot more effective than bear spray, especially considering you could choose to aim the banger at the bear in desperate situations, and it would be effective from a greater range, and could be deployed against more than one bear at a time.   How effective are bear bangers compared to bear spray?  "
367,Why might one need a 2000 lumen headlamp?,"I was just looking at a product my friend was bragging about, a headlamp with 2000 lumen intensity. When and why would I be needing such a powerful headlamp?  I usually trek in jungles and forests and so seldom like (from now on I plan to) once in an year in Himalayas.  A flashlight with 2000 lm capacity is what I can understand as a product, but a headlamp?  Here is a picture of the product my friend referred to:   "
368,Is campfire smoke safe for inhalation and cooking?,"Is it safe to burn any kind of wood as campfire if you are going to be cooking on it directly? Like broiling a steak on a grill over the fire where the smoke and the flames will touch the meat. Can some wood produce fumes that are not safe?  What about inhalation? Does campfire smoke cause damage to lungs? I am in Canadian Eastern woods, so mostly willow, pine, maple, birch etc.  The other question is...the wood itself burns hot enough for cooking, so what is the purpose of store bought charcoal? "
369,Eating ash in Soviet Union,"My Polish grandfather in early 1950's was sent by communist regime to a gulag. People were starving there and malnourishment was common, so they came up with idea of burning some kind of trees and eating the ashes.  Do you know what kind of tree can be devoured like this? And why ashes? How does this method work?  I'm asking here, because it is strictly a survival thing. "
370,How often to wash gore-tex?,"According to my jacket instructions, it performs best when clean (gore-tex pores need to be clean from sweat, skin oils, and whatever else from the outside). Also, they instruct to tumble-dry the garment after washing so to renew its water-repellent treatment.  Can there be too much washing and tumble drying? Would that ruin the cape on the long run? Or, should I just follow the instructions slavishly? "

372,"Good 2-day Alpine hike near Liezen, Austria?","We are a reasonably athletic couple who enjoy hiking and being outdoors. We will be in Austria for a wedding in August so we decided to make a week of it, stay in a couple of towns, but also do a couple of days' hiking (anywhere between 5 and 10 hours a day is what we're expecting).  We can get dropped off in the Austrian alps round about the Liezen region - I found the Via Alpina trail for this area ([website]My questions are:   How good is public transport in the region? If we book to stay in the same place for 2 or 3 nights, can we get to / from different sections of trail fairly easily? Or is it better to book different places for each night, and hike from one to the next? How good are transport links getting in and out of the area? At the end of the hike we will need to get to somewhere like Linz, is this possible? Are there any good websites that will help us figure out how to get from A to B by public transport? We will probably want to carry sandwiches / snacky food for lunch, and have a big evening meal. How easy will it be to acquire sandwiches and snacks in the smaller villages near / along the route? This one is a vague one - any recommendations on the best stages or areas to hike, in terms of scenery and variety of terrain? If possible we would like to avoid spending too much time hiking along the side of roads etc and would prefer to be as high as possible with views of the valleys.   Any input, suggestions or personal experience would be much appreciated!! "
373,How to care for a smelly (as in wet dog smell) down sleeping bag?,"My down sleeping bag smelled like a wet dog after a damp night out. By reading this forum thread.  I realized that it probably didn't dry enough after the trip. So I let it out at the air, and the smell partially went away. Two more days in the open air, and the smell was still there though.  So I washed it. I know how to do it properly, using the proper detergent, a front load machine and a very gentle cycle.  Now, I have two issues.  One, the bag left the washing machine still smelling. The odor is there, persistently strong though it diminished after the first day.  I headed to the self-service laundry to discover that it was not open 24h. It is going to open tomorrow in the morning.  Hence, finally, the questions:   why is my sleeping bag smelling so much even after letting it drying for several days, and even after a proper wash cycle? what should I do now while I wait for the self service laundry to open (that will be in about 12 hours?) to limit its damage - if there's any that may happen meanwhile?   Many thanks everybody "
374,What is the difference between hiking boots and “hunting boots”?,"Many (online) shops classify boots between hiking and hunting; for example, see hunting boots.  The hunting boots look more like the kind of boots I like, than the hiking boots do.  What are the differences?  Is it just that hiking boots are assumed to be used on trails and hunting boots in any terrain, or are there other differences?  Personally, I rarely hike on trails on my big wilderness hikes. "
375,What type of fishing lure is this?,"I've been using an old lure with great success and I'd like to know more about it.   what is this type typically called? what are the proper uses? what fish will likely take this lure?     It dives deep and has been attracting bass like a magnet.  It sinks when stationary.  I'm a decent fisherman but am by no means an expert.  I'm really just curious to know why this is working so well vs other newer, presumably ""better,"" lures. "
376,How do I know when to retire a climbing harness?,I've only been climbing a few months.  I bought a harness and have been using it.  I know they don't last forever.  How do I know when to stop using it and buy a new one?  (How should I check climbing equipment to tell whether it is still safe to use? doesn't talk about harnesses) 
377,"In canyoning, [why] do people skip a backup prusik?","I am used to abseiling with a prusik cord, which gives me protection for the case I lose control of the descent speed.  However, I have heard that in canyoning, in some situations, using the prusik is considered undesirable. So people descend on ropes with just a braking device, and without a prusik.  Is it really the case? If yes, what makes it a valid technique specifically in canyoning, and not in e.g. rock climbing? "
378,Stopper with Toggle for Blake's Hitch,"I'm a knot novice and I was thinking about using a Blake's hitch while camping. The hitch is finished with a stopper knot, which appears pretty critical to me. I thought it would make sense to insert a small stick into the stopper knot to function like a toggle does on a tarp grommet (I think it's called a toggle). I imagine that something like this might be useful in some other context also.  Are there stopper knots that are particularly suited to holding a toggle/stick? Are some stopper knots a bad idea for this purpose? Finally, is putting a toggle on the end of a Blake's hitch a bad idea for some reason?  P.S. I considered just using a constrictor knot on the toggle instead of a true stopper knot, but I read that this can be impossible to untie after use and that scared me off.  P.P.S. I was thinking of using this like a taut line hitch. Appeared more secure and easily adjustable. "
379,What's the ecological impact of bird-baths?,When reading this question (What is the ecological justification (if any) for bird feeders?) on bird feeders I wondered if there would be an ecological impact on having a bird bath.  Especially in cities where summer temperatures can be a bit unforgiving (and the fact that we've replaced natural landscapes with concrete) it may seem like installing a bird-bath in your yard will aid birds in dealing with the temperatures.  So far it seems like a good idea. But is there be a downside I might be missing? 
380,"Where in nature can we find examples of natural ""hoods"" - either for reducing UV / sun exposure or for providing shelter from rain?","I'm in the process of designing a more functional ""hood"" to block UV / sun exposure and also provide shelter from rain.  I believe that the best gear and products are developed by ""looking to nature"" for inspiration.  Therefore, what solutions exist in nature to reduce the amount of UV / sun exposure or provide shelter from rain?   I am specifically (though not exclusively) interested in mimicking any hood-like features that animals exhibit, or any natural means of blocking the UV rays/sun such as the way trees in the rain forest create a natural canopy (perhaps less obvious examples will generate more inspiration).  Are there are any other means of reducing UV/sun exposure or offering shelter from the rain?   Hoping to gain some inspiration here.  Thanks!  "
381,What will this bright green caterpillar with small turquoise spots turn into?,"We found this beauty in our yard:     It was 10 cm long and it was crawling pretty fast. What made it even more spectacular were the little turquoise spots on it. I suppose it will be a butterfly (but correct me if I'm wrong). Does anyone have a clue what species it is? I tried to look at some moth/caterpillar identification webpages, but with no success (they are covering mostly the United States).  We live in Cluj county, Romania (moderate continental climate). "
382,Can I expect to visit Camp 1 and beyond on an Everest base camp expedition?,"I am planning to do a 16 day ""standard"" Everest base camp trek in Nepal coming September.  Can I expect to visit Camp 1 (or even beyond?) as well or is this completely off limits for casual tourists?  I read that, summit expeditions will stay at base camp for weeks, in order to acclimatize for the summit.  How much acclimatization would it take if I want to only visit camp 1 for example? "
383,Do birds get ticks?,"This has been an especially prolific year for ticks in the northeastern region of the United States. We've had so many in our yard that I've given up gardening and switched to planting in pots!  We find them on ourselves frequently after filling our large number of bird feeders and bird baths. I think they're mostly in the tall grasses, wildflowers, other plants, and the regular lawn. I don't think they live in trees, though I'm not sure. Perhaps they're in the lower sections, near the grasses and vines.  There are very few deer in this neighborhood, but I know dogs and other animals, like the fox that's been wandering through every once in a while, leave ticks here for our enjoyment!   It only recently occurred to me that birds might be affected. We can clean up most of the obvious places where the ticks hide in our yard, but that doesn't mean the birds are safe. Obviously we can't clean up the woods or water sources inhabited by the wild birds.   I don't recall hearing that birds are affected by ticks, but I've never studied it either. Do ticks like birds, whether in the yard or in the wild? If so, do they bite them as they do with humans, or do they hang on and use the birds as carriers?  "
384,"What is this brown bird with a white area over its eye, found on the top of a pine tree in Ohio?","Any ideas what bird is making this song?  Unfortunately, this photo was the best I got, but I did get a lot of audio of it's call (the YouTube video has a bunch of them clipped together).  At the end of the video, you can see one of the birds (same kind as the one singing) fly away.  In case it's flight gives any hints.  It sounds like it has at least two (maybe three) distinct calls. The one call, you can hear over and over, and was the majority of it's calls.  But it also had one where it had 7 or 8 super-quick chirps followed by a high-low, high-low (specific spot in video linked here).  I'm in Northwest Ohio, US if that helps narrow it down.  Video:  YouTube video (with song) of unknown bird.  Photo:    Rough Sketch Update: I saw it today through binoculars, but still couldn't get close enough / for long enough. I did see that it had some spots or lines on it's stomach (similar to a young bird, but it appears to be an adult).  It was lighter brown than I was led to believe from the videos when it was silhouetted last night. It had a dark marking from its eye like a racoon, and white over its eye.  It is roughly 50% to 70% smaller than the robins we have around here, which are probably American Robins, as described on this page from the Ohio Division of Wildlife. It appeared to be the size of a chickadee but with a longer tail. Larger than a gold finch.   The only times I've seen this bird, it was on the very top of a pine tree (like in the video). I've not seen it on the ground at all. There was a bird here last year that I never saw that was making a very unique sound. Not sure if it was this kind or not, as I wasn't able to find it and don't remember the song.  Today's look was quick, and I tried to remember as best I could, but again, it was from a distance, so the rough sketch below might not be super accurate.  The first time I saw it today, I thought it may have had some orange tint on its stomach, but didn't see it the second time.    UPDATE 2:  After much googling, it looks very similar to a female rose breasted grosbeak (if not exactly alike).  I can't find a song that matches though, so I can't verify if that's what it is. "
385,How to craft container for cooking and filtering/purifying water,"If a scenario in which you go in the forest or next to one, how are you supposed to craft a containers?  All the web-ressources I can find for filtering water thanks to the multi-layer rocks (from fine sand to charcoal/rocks) will need a container. Either something metallic, a can, or a simple bottle cut in half. But you don't find that far away from human presence. Well, you might with all the debris left by our specie, but for the sake of the question let's assume you are somewhere you can't find it.  To boil water to purify it, you also need a container. Most of time, it's assumed you have a metallic pot, but blacksmithing isn't a step you'll take before achieving to have clean water.  Same for cooking tutorials : ""take your fish, put it in the pot, easy peasy""  So my question is :  1/ How do you craft a container that can be use for filtering water?  2/How do you craft a container that can be heated to boil water and cook?  3/ This one is a bit off topic here, but where can I find some ressources about survival from scratch and not ""survival from scratch but only if you already have a a supermarket next door""?  EDIT :  Comments and vote cast are the proof I haven't been clear. I'm not looking for method to purify or filter water. I'm looking for a way to craft the container needed for thoses actions and cooking. And these without going to a supermarket or taking something in my house that I got in a supermarket "

Which areas around the sea tend to have the least mosquito population? Which characteristics (climate, habitat etc.) does a spot need to have in order to be preferred by them?  "
387,"What is the defintion of a ""unisex tent""?","I was searching around after a new hiking tent, when I noticed a specification called ""unisex"", I know that something is ""unisex"" if it's suited for all genders. Though it makes me wonder, how on earth isn't a hiking tent suited for all genders? After a bit of digging, I realized that some might argue that a princess tent is a ""girl tent"" or whatever. But on hiking tent, isn't that information completely redundant?  Example of unisex tent  Edit To add to the conversation about the ""unisex tent"" being especially common in the UK, here's a listing from a swedish manufacturer (Found down in the productspecification). It's still in Europe, though.  Swedish unisex tent "
388,How do I weave the backpack shoulder straps when there are two strap adjusters?,"I've attached a picture, I got this used backpack (Dana Design Arcflex Astraplane) and I'm trying to figure out the straps on this thing.

389,Do doves go through a molting time of shedding and replacing their feathers?,"We live in Massachusetts, Northeastern United States. It's late July, and our temperatures this month have ranged between 70°F (21°C) and 90°F (32°C).   Mourning doves, Zenaida macroura, live here annually for many months. Lately some look a bit disheveled. They have fewer feathers, and some of their feathers are smaller, thinner, and more fluffy, especially on the back ends of their wings and body. They seem healthy, and we haven't seen physical damage either close-up or with binoculars.  Yesterday, we found a large amount of feathers matching the sizes and colors of those of the dove. They were dispersed throughout a small evergreen bush and on the ground. We assumed a bird had been caught by an animal. My husband searched the area for a body or bones, but didn't find anything.   A friend told me that the birds in this family molt, shedding feathers and replacing some of the older feathers with new ones. I've never heard of this, but it could make sense, according to that evidence. Is it true that doves go through a molting period? If so, what triggers it? Do both male and females do it?   Our mourning doves live in the United States and Mexico. They're part of a large family of doves called Columbidae, found in many countries. In case this is a characteristic of doves in general, I'm not limiting the question to a specific breed.   These pictures are an example of what type we have, and were taken in our yard.    "
390,Reusing disposable water bottles vs. buying dedicated bottles,"Can anyone share any experience re-using ordinary PETE disposable water bottles until failure, as a lightweight and low-cost alternative to dedicated water bottles/bladders?  How long did they last and how did they break (ie cap lost ability to seal tightly, pinhole leak developed in the bottle where it was creased, etc?)  PETE safety info: [website]"
391,How do forest fires affect rain run-off?,"The rains are doing all sorts of things to the landscape in Waterton-Glacier National Park this summer. All of the trails in the park appear to serve as water ways for rain runoff, and the rain appears to be doing more running overground than soaking into anything. The forest floor is covered with charcoal, which is getting washed into the creeks and lakes, making the waterfalls change colour after a rain, and washing out pathways.   Besides producing dark waterfalls that smell like a bucket of water poured into a campfire, do forest fires do anything else to affect water run off? Is there something about having charcoal on the ground that impedes the soil's ability to absorb rain water?  Forest fire runoff after a heavy hail and rain storm, the water was clear just before the rains:  Before the fires this waterfall used to turn pink after heavy rains. "
392,How do fly fishing lures work?,"I'm new to fishing and I don't know how these things work. Do I need to add some weight to make them sink or fishes will come at the top to bite them?  I've seen some videos where they use some weight and some of them just start fishing with the lures, what's the difference? "
393,How do I evade or pacify a bee?,"I've been feeding the local birds at the exact same spot at the local park for quite some time now. Unfortunately for me, today as I was minding my business as usual, a bee decided to sting me. It stung me and flew away, but not for long. It brought back another bugger with it, and they kept trying to sting me. What can I do to evade them? Or is there any way I can pacify them without injuring myself and getting myself stung again? "
394,What is the survival rate for fish restocked via airplane?,"In some places in the western United States, game fish are stocked into lakes via planes for fishing (every so often lakes will freeze to the point that it kills the fish).  I have heard stories of backpackers coming upon lakes where the planes missed and there being lots of bear food fish on the shore, but even if the drop goes perfectly, it still seems like a rough ride for the fish?  Are there any statistics on how many fish survive being restocked via airplane? "
395,Would dry or wet flies be easier for a beginner fly fisherman?,"Inspired by this question, if someone was just starting out fly fishing, would dry flies (float on top of the water) or wet flies (sink below) be easier for a beginner to use?  My experience is that wet flies are easier, but it has been a while, and I haven't showed a new person in a long time.  Would wet or dry flies be easier for someone just learning how to fly fish? "
396,Is parasol a good gadget to stay cool walking around the city and parks?,"I've only seen parasols being used in movies, cartoons and other artistic media, but extremely rarely in real life. Somehow it feels like I would look ridiculous with one in hand walking around the town while the sun is scorching. But I'm willing to ignore the supposedly negative public reaction (I'm unsure, because I've never seen anybody talk about how they perceive people carrying parasols during sunny days) if it means I'm gonna have a much easier time under the sun's heat.  With embarrassment out of the way, what kind of parasol is the best for carrying in the somewhat busy city streets (to avoid discomforting others) and parks where there's plenty of space around you? What color? Knowing that white reflects the heat and the light, and black absorbs them, which color would be optimal? Are there parasols with aluminium or plastic foil plating to increase the reflective effect? Or can I just use a regular umbrella instead of finding a true parasol? Are parasols even effective against the heat and UV rays?  In short, how do I attain the ultimate parasol experience? "
397,Is bear spray effective against other animals?,"Is bear spray (pepper spray specially formulated to be effective against bear attacks) effective against other animals, especially mountain lions or wolves? Or is there something in it specifically targeted towards bears that would make it less effective on other attacking animals? "
398,What do I need to be aware of if I'm considering purchasing a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB)?,"Obviously, I can't just buy it, push the button and expect a helicopter to show up.  Are there monthly or registration fees? Do I need to get a permit or register with someone? How does it all work? Does it get service everywhere (even internationally)? I'm not even sure what I don't know at this point.  Basically, if you were telling a friend how to purchase a PLB, what would you tell them? "
399,How bad do circumstances need to be before activating a PLB?,"Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) can be carried during outdoor activities to use in case of an emergency. But are there any guidelines on what exactly constitutes an ""emergency""? For example, what about the following situations:   You slip and fall on a trail several hours away from the trailhead, breaking several bones and putting you in intense pain. Should you hobble back to the trailhead to call for help or activate the PLB? You are bitten by a rattlesnake, experience symptoms of envenomation, and are several hours away from your car. Do you attempt to hike back and call for help or activate the PLB? While skiing in the morning in an isolated area of a ski resort, you run into a tree and break bones. No one responds to calls for help. Do you activate the PLB or wait until nightfall to see if anyone finds you?   Those are kind of contrived examples, but basically when is it appropriate to use a PLB? If the answers are different for different countries, I'm wondering specifically about use in the US. "
400,How can I make/improvise a rope on a trip?,"If I'm out in the wilderness and find myself in need of a rope I don't have with me (forgotten, not enough, another snapped), how can I make one?

401,Do iodine water treatment tablets have negative effects?,"I've heard that iodine water treatment tablets can have negative side effects.    Is this true?  If so, what are some healthier alternatives? "
402,How to estimate is the branch thick enough to stand on it?,"Some geocaches are placed high on trees:    You need to climb there to log. But standing on too thin branch can be very dangerous.   Is there a formula to estimate how thick must be a branch of a given species of tree to hold the weight of man? Of course we are talking about solid, healthy (and not rotten branches).  For example, how thick should be an oak branch to hold a weight of 70kg man? "
403,Consequences of crossing railroad tracks when looking for caches in Germany?,"It happens quite often by geocaching: the cache is situated somewhere near the rail track, but it seems that you are on the wrong site... The legal passage is quite far, and you have still a lot of caches to get... and don't want to loose too much of it just going there and back.  Yes, many German cache descriptions contains information that you shall not pass, at least not the rails in every place you'd like to. Of course, I'm not not talking about going through rails when the policeman is in sight, neither of rails with 'third rail'. I'm talking about just normal, not heavily used rail in not heavily trafficed place.   How the situation looks like in Germany? What's the pessimistic scenario that I should count with? Let's say someone sees me crossing rails in camera, or some rail worker will be incidentally somewhere near... Would someone care to catch me or to call a police for something, that in Poland is too trivial to even deal with it?   "
404,"Affordable South Korea topographic or hiking maps, in particular for the Jeju Olle trail","Where can I find topographic maps of South Korea?  If those don't exist, where can I find good hiking maps?  Specifically, I'm looking for maps suitable to hike the Jeju Olle Trail.  For topographic maps, I've found the Genshtab maps — not ideal in a densely populated area with lots of infrastructure that has likely changed.  According to omnimap, official maps do not exist, although geospatial.com offering maps for 149[tex].  The official English language Jeju Olle Trail website links to an English language guidebook, but this only includes sketches not suitable for navigating in nature.  Although I get the impression the trail is well-marked, I prefer to have a detailed map in addition.  It is fine if the map is in Hangul, although an English translation of the legend would be quite helpful.  For Mt. Hallasan, I found this detailed, non-topographic sketch (Warning: 8583x6159 square pixels!), but for the coastal Jeju trail, I've found nothing.  Does the map I'm looking for exist, or do hikers do with waymarks along with non-topographic sketches? "
405,How to assure safe searching for cache hidden in my own backyard?,"You shouldn't place a cache on someone's property without permission, that's for sure. But when the property belongs to me, I can hide cache on my own backyard.   However, what should I do to assure safe searching for geocachers? Strange people walking at the night through the door and sniffing around the fence are looking quite suspicious and they can alarm local police or neighbors. I don't want, however, to inform anyone around about that cache - I want to keep it secret only for 'chosen'.   Is there something I can do, for example some 'camouflage' giving excuse to strangers to visit my backyard? "
406,What purpose does a mesh liner serve in outdoors clothing?,Some outdoors clothing have an inner mesh lining of polyester (or similar) fabric. What purpose does such a lining serve? Does it insulate or is it for transporting humidity from the body? 
407,What kinds of wood work well in a bow drill?,"I've been working with the bow-drill, and I notice that certain types of wood may be so hard that hardly any powder forms (like african mahogany) and others may be too soft and crumbly. Pine appears to be a little too resinous. So far, I've had some success with rambutan.   What species of plants produce coals efficiently when used as part of a bow-drill set? Is there some test I can perform to easily identify good bow-drill wood?  "
408,Good quality walking maps for Spain,"What re the best quality walking, trekking maps for Spain? In the UK were pretty lucky as we have the Ordance Survey (a government body that maintains all topo maps). Is there an equivalent in Spain?  I've heard you can buy the old military maps, but:   I've heard they are very out of date (date to the Franco period) I've heard they are very poor quality I have no idea where you can get these from.   Anybody had any experience of this and can provide some advice? "
409,Is it possible to check the safety of a used climbing rope?,"In the comments to my answer on Can you use a rope that has been in storage for a few years? the question arose if one could have some expert check a used rope whether it is still safe to use. As answering this question would go a bit beyond the scope of the referenced question, I put it here as a new one.  So, is it possible to check the safety of a used climbing rope before using it? By check in this case is not meant some optical inspection for integrity or the like (as in How do I inspect a climbing rope?) but a check that says something like ""this rope was tested with a force of x kN and therefore is still inside the norm and safe to use"". "
410,Can a Finger Pulley injury be predicted / anticipated?,"I resumed climbing a couple of months back after a gap of a couple of years. After spending a month of quality time at the wall regularly in order to get back in touch, I have started to try different routes that are a bit tricky and a bit exerting so that sometimes I have to push it a bit harder than normal.  I first found myself struggling with cramping fingers and I even asked a query here.  And then during conversations with different climbing people, I heard that a lot about how climbers push too hard and destroy their finger pulleys:    I do feel a little stress and pain with my fingers, and I am damn sure that its definitely not the Cramping of Fingers.  I do feel perfectly fine during early hours of climbing, provided that I warm up pretty well and regularly.  I do feel better when I stop climbing, but for a brief time of about 10 minutes I find it difficult to pick up small things, or squeeze something, cycle brakes hurt the most, and the pain gradually subsides. I am not taking any sort of painkillers as of now, and I don't intend to.   Is it normal when you take it to a different level of climbing? Is such an injury predictable? Is it possible that I may have caused the pulley a trouble, and it has exploded without any warning as such? Should I take a break for a week or two? Or is it just the routine?  "
411,Hot or cold shower better after exertion?,"Most of us go around, doing different physical activities. Whether it is indoors or outdoors, the common factor is that we often sweat, make our muscles, joints, tendons, ligament, etc work harder than normal.  Specifically, working out, swimming, rock climbing, hiking, cycling, running, mountaineering, playing sports involving moving/running, etc.  If the weather is normal (where a hot or cold shower would be equally comfortable) what is most favorable to our body, especially to the parts we exert the most (muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments) during such activity?  Is it a hot or cold shower? "
412,Roping together on an icy path?,"I'm planning a mountain hiking trip and one of the issues is that the trails that we're following will almost certainly be covered in ice. There are two of us and we'll both be wearing shoe traction equipment like this: YaxTrax Extreme Outdoor Traction. The trails follow ridge lines and moderate slopes on relatively low altitude mountains (5,945' or 1,812 m). However there is the possibility that a slip on the ice will lead to sliding right off the edge of a cliff or steep drop.  My question then is, should we rope ourselves together so if one of us started sliding the other could ""self arrest"" by grabbing on to a tree, or even throwing ourselves in the deep snow? We will not have ice axes or climbing harnesses. I was picturing a bowline tied around each waist. Does this seem smart or does it seem like a way to guarantee both of us dieing if one were to fall?   Thanks! "
413,When should I retire my rope,"I know there is a degree of ""gray"" in this question but:  I have a Beal Top gun II 10.5mm, I've had this rope for around 4 years now and I'm starting to think about retiring it.    It's been used mainly for indoor lead climbing but also outdoor trad and top roping. It had a year of, practically, zero use (Where I got seriously into my bouldering in preperation for a trip to Fontainbleu). I've always keept it in my wardrobe so it's not been exposed to sunlight or extremes of temperatures for any amount of time. It's never had any serious falls, at most 2m on an indoor lead wall (I weight about 12 stone 77Kg or so, so I'm also not heavy). There has been a light increase in the amount of stretch to the rope but nothing major I inspect it often and there is no ""seath slippage"" or damage of note I have noticed that the rope has a tendency to go a ""bit square"" when under load. I don't really know what this means?   Any thought about when this rope should be retired?  I'm thinking about semi retiring it now as it's 60m long and quite heavy. I rarely use half of this amount and my back would appreciate a lighter shorter rope! "
414,How water proof are these kinds of tents?,"I have been living in the US for some time and I was surprised to see that these kinds of tents are pretty common now    I was skeptical about the effectiveness of this ""partial"" rain fly in case of (heavy) rain, but never experienced it.      The fly of the tent I am thinking about looks like the picture on   each side of the tent.   So my question is : how much does this kind of rain fly protect you from the rain? Can anyone share her/his experience on that point? "
415,What are the benefits of Vibram FiveFingers?,"Looking at the Vibram FiveFingers shoes, I find myself wondering why?  What possible benefits do they bring as opposed to a traditional sole?  Their web site seems to suggest that they are a more natural way to use your feet and then suggests a series of exercises to do to become used to the shoes. I'm not convinced buying a very expense pair of shoes that I can't wear until I complete a rigourous training regime is a good idea. I've not once looked at my boots and thought I wish I could feel all the rocks under my feet.  In all their marketing material (that I can see) they make no substantial claims as to what the tangible benefits are.  I'm tempted to suggest that they are simply a marketing gimmick, or am I missing something?  Does anyone love these? Can they explain why and what benefits they bring?    As a side note to this question I was speaking to a friend of mine at the weekend who's a manager of a national UK outdoor chain store (by far the largest chain in the UK). Apparently this company has decided they are a gimmick and that their days are over, apparently sales have been dropping for some time. As such they will no longer be stocking FiveFingers in any form.   Thought is was an interesting perspective as it seems to point to a decline in these types of shoes. If you really like these you may want to think about stocking up! "
416,Are manual double-back buckles on harnesses considered obsolete?,"My current harness has these single-piece buckles:   (source: [website]It might be due for replacement in one or two years, and I really like these buckles, since I can completely open all parts of the harness if I need to. Also, I heard friends complaining about their harnesses (with other types of buckles) becoming slightly loose while wearing them.  I am having a hard time finding any new harnesses with that type of buckle. Is that kind of buckle considered obsolete? If so, what is the reason for this?   Is it because you basically have to double check your harness to be sure that you have correctly fixed the buckles? Or are there other reasons that might make them unsafe? "
417,Bolt Conditions at the New River Gorge,"I am getting back into sport climbing and I am planning a trip to the NRG.  I get very nervous about safety issues in regards to climbing, almost to the point where I don't want to start again. One thing that makes me most nervous is bolt and anchor quality.  I was wondering what are the general quality of the bolts at NRG? I know there have been significant rebolting efforts in the last five years, are there old bolts left?   Should I only assume the bolts will be good on more popular routes and walls?  Are there any places to avoid? "
418,Where can I get long but light bottoms for water?,"I need clothing for kayaking in the summer. I already have the ""heavyweight"" equipment - thick neoprene longjohn and a whitewater cag. But for places where I need less protection from cold and injuries, I'd like something more breathable and less restrictive.   I looked into products marketed at kayakers and other water sport activities and ended up buying a kite surfers' rash guard for the top. I am quite happy with it, as it does not have the same hothouse effect as neoprene does. But the kitesurfers wear boardshorts as bottoms. They would have been OK for me, if they were available in long, but they end up well over my knee.   I would like some comfortable ankle-length layer which gives a small amount of warmth and can protect me from scraping my skin if I have to swim out, preferably also UV-protecting for the time I hang around before and after I get into the boat. And as all my watersports stuff, I'd like it to be quick-dry and machine washable.   The few striders sold by kayak stores are too short and/or made from neoprene. They're also quite expensive when compared to bottoms produced for other purposes.   Is there a type of clothing which covers the above criteria, the way rash guards cover them for tops? I was thinking of slightly denser pantyhose, but there are probably better solutions (is pantyhose quick drying?). Are there sports whose practitioner wears this type of clothing?  "
419,How do I attach a hammock to trees?,"On my next vacation, I will be camping in a tent on a designated campsite. I saw somebody use a hammock for lounging during the day last time, so quickly got a cheap hammock from eBay, with a ""let's see if that works for me"" attitude.   The hammock came, and it is a piece of silk with a spread of ropes on each short end. The ropes are braided together into a loop. I think this might be intended for a specialized hammock stand, but I won't have one, I'm hoping there will be a usable pair of trees in or around the campsite. It is roughly this style:     How do I attach it to the trees? Can I use any old cord and wrap it around a tree trunk? Won't it slide down? What cord thickness do I need? Are there special knots I should learn? Is there something more convenient than a cord, e.g. some kind of short belt with clasp? (I've seen long ones for fastening kayaks to car roofs, for example). If I want to buy something for this purpose, 1) how is it called, 2) which shop has it, and 3) how do I use it?  "
420,"What refilling material or glue did you chose to resole your trekking shoes? (What works, what doesn't)","Theses shoes are still good (picture have been removed), but the small missing part of the heel makes them painful to wear. I'm looking for the most efficient way to extend my shoes life (robust, cheapest, aesthetics and ecological). I'm looking for feed backs about what you tried: what work, and what doesn't.  The sole could be theoretically fixed in several ways:  ● by adding the missing matter on the sole with a form-work That would be the easiest solution : filling the missing part with some rubber like matter that would solidify. And maybe a bunch of small screws that would be cover by the matter and increase the adhesion between the filling and the remaining part of the sole. That would be super, but since I haven't seen anything about it on the web, it's probably because it doesn't work... Did you try it?  ● by cutting few centimeter of the heel and gluing a new heel sole: I'm tempted to use a piece of tire, that seems to work and that looks great. Did you try, which kind of glue did you use, which did last, which didn't? I know that theoretically many glue should fit but I also know by experience that resoling did failed most of the time (I spent my childhood running after my soles...). I'm tempted to use neoprene glue (contact adhesive) for the first adhesion to be completed by superglue for the tricky parts. What do you think?  ps: I would prefer practical feedback rather than theoretical advises (pictures of your experiments are warmly welcome!)  ps2: such worn out is cause by an ""overpronation"".   EDIT: shoe goo &amp; heel are extremely expensive where I'm living. So we need to be creative. Any feedback about what did work for you, or not, (kind of glue or heel) would be extremely appreciated (don't hesitate to post pictures). "
421,Should compound bows be unstrung when not shooting?,"I know that a recurve bow should have its string removed when not shooting, so that it does not stretch and the limbs do not experience plastic deformation. On the other hand, the procedure to unstring, string and tune a compound bow looks too involving to be performed on daily bases  How often should a compound bow be unstrung?. "
422,How can you safely set up a climbing anchor from above?,"Let's say I'm walking to the top of a really nice cliff.  Take a look at this beauty:    And there are some nice cracks to place some protection in, with the slings/rope coming off the cliff, kinda like so:    What's a good way to set up, equalize, and knot the anchor while on the cliff? Assume there aren't any trees or anything to tie off on above.  One possible solution gotten from everyone's help:  Tie a three point anchor without an equalizing knot, but with ""magic x's"", like so:    Then, have your partner at the bottom help you get the master point into the right position. Finally, tie clove hitches to the biners and then adjust them to fine-tune equalizing, again with a bit of help from your partner.  Here's your finished anchor! (isn't it pretty?)    This way, you don't actually have to go below your anchor to set it up, and it's equalized without risk of extending if a piece of pro breaks.  Happy climbing! :) "
423,Properly using a Gamow Bag,"I was just informed that our group is going to have a Gam-off, technically known as a Gamow Bag.  While I have never seen one such thing and so I don't have any experience with them, I browsed the internet about it for a while.  A few questions:   Do they have a high-altitude operating ranges like sleeping bags have? How much do they cost? How much do they weight? Is it okay to drag someone off the snow in a Gam-off? (Looking at the structure), or are they just meant for keeping the cold victim safe and warm while Evac is arranged? On a funnier part, Can that it be used as a shelter rather than bivouacking?  "
424,Is wild garlic edible? How do you prepare it?,"Driving into work this am, the woods were full of wild garlic, you could actually smell it in the car.     I've always presumed that it is edible but I'm not 100% sure. Can you eat wild garlic?   Which parts are edible? Does it have bulbs like the garlic you buy in the shops? How do I go about collecting, using, preparing it? Any recipes?!     Wikipedia says:     The leaves of A. ursinum are edible; they can be used as salad,   herb,[7] boiled as a vegetable,[8] in soup, or as an ingredient for   pesto in lieu of basil. The stems are preserved by salting and eaten   as a salad in Russia. A variety of Cornish Yarg cheese has a rind   coated in wild garlic leaves.[9] The bulbs and flowers are also   edible.   Which is great, but I'm not sure I trust wikipedia! Does anyone have any experience of eating/preparing these? "
425,North Ridge of Crib Coch grade,"I'm trying to get some info on the grade of the North ridge (going into Cwm Glas, not the main crib coch path but the alternative route coming from Nant Peris) of Crib Coch. I've been up Crib Coch several times but never done the north ridge. There is no footpaths marked on the maps. This description of the 3000s route says:     Eventually you should reach Crib Goch's north summit where an obvious   continuation descends towards the Pen y Pass, however you need to   follow the ridge as it curves around to the north. As the ridge comes   to an end, descend the pinkish screes in a north-westerly direction   via an indistinct path. Set your compass to 312 degrees and follow   this bearing to a steep descent down a little gully (SH 61992 56084).   Follow the faint path, at first to the west and then to the north   west, to another short descent (SH 61800 56200). Continue descending   in a northerly direction to cross a stream. Follow a path besides the   stream going downwards (north-easterly) to a good track over a bridge   at Blaen-y-nant. Finding the best way down from the north ridge of   Crib Goch is not easy and this is one section that you may wish to   recce first (but in reverse) from Blaen-y-nant   But I'm struggling to get a sense of the route and difficulty of this path, there's very limited information on this route on the internet. Has anyone been this way before? Any maps of the route or more detailed information anywhere? Should this require a rope, what grade is it (I'm guessing scrambling grades?)?  I think I'm going to reccy it this weekend but I'd like to have some information or other sources if possible. "
426,Is it generally safe to hike a pass in a thunderstorm?,"Friend and I had this discussion, and came to no conclusion:  Hiking in the mountains.  Crossing a range through a pass.  Peaks on either side are a good thousand feet higher.  Are you at serious risk of getting hit by lighting?  More generally:  If you are walking a ridge line, and see a storm developing, how far below the ridge line do you need to be to be reasonably safe?    Edit:    Since asking this question I've been doing more reading.  Unless the  the mountain is sharply above you -- better than 45 degrees, you only have a very moderate amount of protection.  45 degrees is steeper than the angle of repose -- 37 degrees -- the angle you can stack loose rock and not have a slide.  So the 'best answer' is correct.  There is no safe path.  Still: only about 15-20 people a year die from lighting strikes, mostly fishermen.  So the real question becomes:  How big is the whole risk?  While strikes 6-10 miles away from the base of the thunderstorm have occurred, most of the ground strikes are under or very close to the edges of the storm base.  If we take the LD50 radius of a lightning strike at 50m then it requires a storm with 133 strikes per square kilometer to land one near you.  A storm with a 10 km diameter would need to deliver about 10,000 strikes. to zot a person under it's immediate footprint.  That's several hours at one per second.  The storms I have experienced in the mountains are both shorter than that, and seem to be limited to a few strikes per minute.  Net conclusion:  Avoid the really high risk places, and enjoy the show.  Overall moving toward safety is better than staying put.  I've been unable to find stats on how much higher your risk is standing vs the lightning position (squat in a ball)  Overall on a per trip basis, I would rank risks largest to smallest:   Accident traveling to the hike Avalanche (low 30's per year, North America) Climbing accidents (low 20's per year, North America) Lightning (mid to high teens per year, US) Wildlife attack (a few per year)   This doesn't take into account the relative frequency of the activity.  Fishermen have a higher rate because they are willing to fish in the rain. And there are a lot more skiers and snowmobilers at risk of avalanche than of people walking the high country, or doing technical rock climbing. "
427,What is the best practice to secure a 17ft open canoe to the roof of a vehicle?,"Next month, my kids and I are enrolled in a canoe building workshop in the Lake District of the United Kingdom.   At the end of the 4 days we will have a 17ft canoe weighing between 16 and 22 kilos.    Our return journey is over 200 miles using mainly motorways.  We have a mid-size MPV vehicle with built in roof rails and attached Thule roof bars.  What is the best practice for attaching and securing an open canoe to the roof of a vehicle?  Is it the same as a kayak (which has similar questions here on TGO SE?  I have never transported any outdoor equipment on the roof of a vehicle previously. "
428,Does listening with an ear to the ground actually work?,"In movies, sometimes the character will put an ear to the ground and then hear people moving a long ways away example.

429,Relative risks of various outdoor activities?,"I got into a 'discussion' with the vice principal of the school I work at.  He was worried about the dangers inherent in our fairly extensive outdoor program.  I pointed out to him that an analysis of the previous year's infirmary logbook showed that we had far more lost school days from basketball than we did from snowshoeing despite that the entire school snowshoes, and only about 1/3 have anything to do with basketball.  ""Prove it""  And there I got stuck.  (Edit in response to comment: My VP considers the outdoor program far more lethal -- chance of dying.  So comparing injuries in the infirmary log struck him as specious. Yet this is not borne out.  Kids die playing hockey and football.  Not many.  Kids die in avalanches in school outings.  Not many. I'd like to get a handle on the relative risks.)  (Edit 2: Charlie, below has some interesting articles, and some of these are similar to the ones I found in  my groveling.  The problem is that few take into account the number of practicianers.  One article comments that falls are the leading cause of ER room outdoor pursuits treatments.  And if you dig further you find that more hikers were injured or killed than mountaineers.  But there are a lot more hikers, so if there was equal hazard you would expect more incidents. )   I found tantalizing tidbits:     For the young teen male, there is about 1 fatality per 5 million downhill ski days.  The most dangerous sport is high school foot ball: Much more dangerous than either college or pro ball. (This made sense to me: High school kids are growing, clumsy; high school coaches aren't as well trained, fewer assistants.)  Hockey came close. I found a lightning strike density map for Alberta.  The highest density strike zone runs 4 strikes/km2/year   Anyway:  Some insurance company I'm sure has collected these stats:    Someone has written a report on the relative risks of various outdoor pursuits:  E.g:  In absolute numbers more people die in climbing accidents than are killed by lightning in the mountains.  But overall there are a lot more hiking days than there are climbing days.  How many people drown per million canoeing days?  What are your chances of coming to a sticky end cross country skiing?  Avalanche deaths per million days back country skiing?    For each individual activity there are mitigations:  E.g.  Don't be on ridge tops during lighting storms.  Take an avalanche safety course, carry the radio thingies, and practice using them.  Learn how to right your sailboat.  Know the signs and treatment for incipient hypothermia.  OTOH  What is the relative risk between the pass and the peak on either side for lightning? In another question and the reading it caused me to do, it isn't safe to cross a pass.  Certainly more dangerous than crossing the street, but compare to crossing the Bakersfield freeway (8 lanes each way) How risky is it?   But I figure that insurance companies that underwrite various flavours of adventure companies have some more concrete numbers than this.  What do they use?  Does anyone know of either a stats heavy report on various outdoor pursuits, or a more general book on risk management in the outdoors? "
430,When is improvised water filtration warranted for survival?,"In the comments of the accepted answer to this longstanding question: Water filters - why sand and rocks? the makings of a debate started, but no definitive consensus was reached. I'm going to do my best to make an attempt to summarize each side:  For   in a survival situation with only murky water available and whether help is coming or not remains uncertain, an improvised filtration system of rocks, sand and charcoal can make the water safer to drink (conceding it doesn't purify water)   Against   in a survival situation, it may be more constructive to devote time and energy to getting home.  Additionally, there is no way to know that there was not a recently decomposing animal (or other bacteria source) on the very sand you are using which would introduce even more harmful contaminants into the water.   Question  I see the logic in both sides of the argument, and I think there is an implicit distinction between filtering and purifying. With that in mind, when is it warranted to filter water in a survival situation?   For example, is the only use case to filter debris before boiling it over a fire to make it truly safe to drink? Or is improvised water filtration with sand, rocks and charcoal a waste of time and energy altogether? "

432,Handling feminine hygiene on multiple-month treks?,"How can I handle multiple months of menstrual cycles on a long trek like the Appalachian Trail?  I am asking about how to handle the mess.  Here are my personal considerations:   Using hormonal birth control to skip five months of periods is not an option for me. I'm concerned about the amount of space pads or tampons would take up in my pack, not to mention the amount of trash that would accumulate. I'm of the opinion that 27 is a bit young to be having a hysterectomy (though I have considered it).   Are there any other options out there?  EDIT:  May, 2016 (four years later): This video by Emily Graslie of The Field Museum in Chicago explains in great detail and from years of experience how women handle menstruation on field expeditions, including information she has gathered from other women in the field about what worked and did not work for them in practice.

433,Should a hiker be concerned about wolves in the back-country?,"In this question, it was asked whether bear-spray was effective against other animals, such as wolves.  I know the old adage that ""there has never been record of a healthy wolf attacking an adult"" is not entirely true, but it seems the frequency of attacks may be sufficiently few and far between as to render it a non-issue.  So rather than give the wolf a bad rap by innuendo, I hope to get some clear answers on the risk of wolves to outdoor enthusiasts:   Are wolves a legitimate worry-worthy threat to back-country travelers? What are my odds of encountering a wolf in the wild? What are my odds of being attacked by a wolf? Are there special precautions that one should take in wolf country that are different from standard bear precautions (which are often found in the same area)? Are some wolf-inhabited regions known to be more dangerous than others?  "
434,What clothing would be appropriate for hiking in -18°C with up to 30 km/hr wind?,"I recently moved to Germany and am planning to do a hike in the Harz mountains.  The weather is expected to be around -18°C.  Most of the trail will be sheltered by forest, but the mountaintop is exposed to strong winds.  I am somewhat new to the cold climate and am wondering what others would consider appropriate clothing for this day hike.  I have:   Down jacket (outer layer), polar fleece and microfleece (intermediate layers), and t-shirt. Cotton pants (jeans), fleece pants, and long underwear. Wool socks. Leather/Gore-Tex boots Wool beanie (hat), gloves.   Obviously the cotton pants are not so appropriate.  What would be the best cold-weather hiking clothes?  After-hike edit:  The weather on the hike turned out to be much better than forecast; in particular: sunny and no wind. Two observations:    The puffy down jacket quickly became much too warm to hike in and was awkwardly bulky to stow (but was wonderfully nice and cozy for breaks).  I think I'll shop around for a lighter outer shell and a more compact down intermediate layer to add when necessary. It turns out that my boots were terrible for walking on compacted snow. These boots are wonderful otherwise; I think the problem is that the tread has been worn away over the years and they need to be re-soled. So I would add: check boot traction on various surfaces, and/or bring traction-enhancing devices for compacted snow/ice.  Or perhaps the ""Hot Weather Safety Toe Flight Boot"" is simply not designed for ice?  Other than this issue, my feet were perfectly warm and happy.  "

436,Are there performance differences between lead and lead-free ammunition?,"According to this article (full disclosure: I wrote it) lead-based ammunition is a well-known threat to Condors and other scavengers, and may have negative effects on humans who unknowingly ingest bullet fragments.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that lead-free ammunition performs just as well as lead-based ammunition, without the potential side-effects, and lack of adoption is largely due to habit (we like to use what we have always used).  So, my question is two-part:    Are there documented performance differences between lead-based vs lead-free ammunition? Have any hunters who have used both noticed a marked difference in performance?  "
437,"Do reusable ""hand coolers"" exist?","I often carry around a couple of reusable hand warmers when hiking or just around the outdoors when it's cold. They don't take up much space, they're easy to reuse (just boil) and they provide a fair bit of heat for a while.  However, try as I might I can't find any equivalent reusable packs that work the other way - i.e. they set of a reaction that draws in heat and makes them cold for a while, and then (I'd expect) you could put them in the freezer for a while to reverse the process.  I wouldn't really use them for hands, but they could come in useful for cooling you down generally - placing at the back of your neck for instance.  Do such things exist? Technically I don't see why it's not possible but I haven't seen any around at all.  EDIT: After a bit of looking around I stumbled across these - perhaps they do exist after all! Has anyone used them? It looks like they're geared more towards medicine than general use but if the effect's the same that's fine by me. "
438,"What are the non-obvious pros and cons of an ""Instant Tent"" vs. a tent with shock cord poles","Some newer tents have integrated pole systems where the poles collapse quickly but stay attached to the tent body.  The obvious pro of this design is that setup and takedown is faster and can be done by one person. The weight and size seems equivalent.  The pole design actually seems less likely to break than shock cord fiberglass poles, but harder to fix if it does break. If you've used one of these tents and the poles have broken in the field, how hard was it to repair?  Are there any hidden gotchas to the instant tent design? Any details I haven't covered above?  "
439,Baby-friendly trek near Innsbruck,"My family is going to Innsbruck in August, and we want to do a 3-4 day mountain hut trek. This will be our first trek with our son, who will be 16 months old. I can see many, many huts and trails in the area, but I'm having a hard time ascertaining which ones are easier. For example, we don't want via ferrata, nor very steep climbs. Basically, we just want an easy trek - I'm sure that practically anywhere in the area will be lovely, we don't need somewhere famous.  I don't mind arriving in Innsbruck and then consulting with locals, but I'm worried that things will be crazy in August, and if I don't reserve places in huts, they will fill up. Is this true?  Anyone have a route or area they'd like to suggest? "
440,Are Dolphin sightings seasonal or serendipitous?,"I walk along Del Monte Beach in Crow City, USA (Monterey, California) quite often.   It is not too rare to see dolphins frolicking (so it seems to me, although they may just be going about their business, with no particular feeling of fancifulness or frivolity as they periodically arch their backs out of the water every several seconds/yards) about 60 feet (estimated) off shore.  However, it seems that either I have been very unlucky lately, or this may be a seasonal occurrence. What used to be common is now ""special"" - I saw one again last week for the first time in at least several weeks.  Is this because they would tend to be in Monterey Bay only during a certain time of the year (and not in late spring)? Is it based on a prey/predator situation, the temperature of the water, or something like that? Or is it just sort of a ""random"" circumstance or ""happy accident"" that I might happen to see them quite a bit for a stretch of time, and then an ""unhappy accident"" that I miss them for quite awhile (they're there, but I just don't happen to look in the right place at the right time)? "
441,What materials are most durable for marine vessel interior resurfacing?,"When resurfacing counter-tops, ceilings, etc. in marine vessels, what materials stand up the best to moisture, yet are manipulable enough without excessive tooling?  This can be at many levels of difficulty.  I'm most concerned with the case of a sailboat at a mooring; which means you do not have access to AC power and the ability to place heavy items on solid ground.  Everything has to fit into a tender/dinghy.  So, the material has to be cuttable by battery-powered tools, or by hand.  It also has to be light and easy enough to move with a single-person in a small tender.  For example: Is linoleum counter top material good for galley counter tops?  Does the necessary adhesive stand up to marine conditions?  What might be better?  Some surfaces of concern:   Galley countertops Cabin walls Table tops Bathroom walls  "
442,How to avoid tangling up the rope when throwing it before rappelling?,"When we rappel after a multi-pitch climb, we usually take up the rope (or both ropes when we use half ropes) so that we end up with one or two nicely lap-coiled ropes.   Throwing the coiled ropes quite often results in at least one of them becoming a tangled mess on the way down, even without getting stuck on trees, the rock or other things. The first climber to rappel then needs to spend quite a bit of time to untangle one or two of the strands/ropes.   This is very annoying, so: What are common mistakes that lead to this problem? Is there a special way of taking up the rope that helps here? "

444,Which type of cooker to use above 6000m?,"I'm an enthusiastic mountaineer and hiked up several 4000m - 6000m peaks till today. Now I'm faced to a problem I think many mountaineers are faced to:  Which type of cooker do I use above the 6000m?  Normally I use my oldest friend the propan-fired cooker. But the cold temperatures told me about the physics and around -30°C it won't fire at all. That's why I thought about a gas-fired cooker, but it's also heavier and often bigger ...  So does anybody have some experience in cooking above 6000m? "

446,Tiny crab/bug in Pacific NW; makes shell out of rocks/sticks. What is it?,"We encountered these guys in a small inland (freshwater) creek in southern WA.  There were hundreds, covering low flat rocks in the water;  every one carrying a shell made out of either tiny rocks, or a piece of a twig.  They're probably 1/8"" in diameter, maybe 3/4"" long with the shell.  Some were moving at a slow crawl along the rocks (below and above the surface), others were burrowing in and out of the dirt on the creek bottom.  Anyone know what these might've been?

448,What's the easiest way of improving my strength without a large investment of time?,"I've been climbing for about 7 years starting when I was 31 years old.  Initially I made rapid progress as I learned the various techniques etc, but after about a year I plateaued and I haven't really made any progress in the last 6 years.  I have kids and I'm pretty busy all week so I only get to climb, with another friend my age at the weekend so as it stands I'm doing about 2 hours climbing per week.  I can reliably climb up to a French grade 6b or a bouldering grade V4 but that's about it.  People generally say that my technique is good but what I really lack is strength.  I see other people do routes that are beyond me and I get as far as ""that pull"" or ""that hold"" and I simply don't have the strength to do the move that's required.    So here's the thing, I'd love to go up another grade and to be able to climb V5-V6 routes but it's clear that if I don't make a change to how much training I'm doing it won't happen.  I don't have a lot of time but I'm wondering what I could do with a few hours at home over the week that would help me improve at the weekend?  Would two 20 minute finger board sessions mid-week at home be enough to get me up a grade?  What kind of things would I be best investing my limited time in? "

451,What to video during a solar eclipse?,"I will be in the path of total darkness during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017.  I plan to be in alpine wilderness (Oregon Cascades), but will adjust my location as needed so that there are no clouds.  I'll have a single 4K video camera, tripod, ample recording memory, and batteries.  While the typical eclipse video is a direct image of the sun waning, then black with halo, then waxing, etc., I suspect there will be adequate quantities of those videos available for viewing.  I am hoping to capture something more unusual -- something that isn't routinely photographed.   Ideas which spring to mind:   environmental changes attendant upon the eclipse, such as wind direction, air temperature, stream flow, ambient sound, etc. wildlife behavioral changes:  birds, mammals, rodents, fish, insects, etc. vegetation changes:  what do flowers which open for daylight or track the sun do for two minutes of darkness and about 60 minutes of variable darkness before and about 60 minutes afterward?   Are there other features attendant on a total solar eclipse which I could capture with my equipment and that are relatively rarely photographed except in scientific expeditions?

The person had been stung several times before, and suffered only swelling around the stings, but never had a systemic reaction (no anaphylaxis).  What should this person do?  Should he get out as fast as possible because of the number of stings and because a relatively mild reaction on a previous occasion does not guarantee a relatively mild reaction on the next occasion?  Or should he stay quiet, applying cold compresses (ideally with snow, if accessible) to the stings?

459,Climbing with a much lighter partner?,"Both my fiancee and myself bought some climbing gear recently and we're planning our first trip to an indoor rock gym this weekend. We decided to practice our knots and belay technique before we went so we rigged some rope to a chin-up bar to practice letting one person hang while the other person held the ""brake"" position to get used to how it would feel.   The problem is, while I could hold my fiancee just fine, she weighs about 70 lbs less than me and had a really hard time holding my weight, in fact she could barely hold it at all. I'm worried that she won't be able to hold me if I were to fall while climbing. Surely, we can't be the first climbing pair to have different weights...is there a way to fix this? Is there any mechanical advantage of having the ""lever"" of the top rope much higher than the practice chin-up bar is?   EDIT: From some research, it seems like there may be a difference when top-roping vs. lead climbing? For reference, we will only be doing top-roping for the foreseeable future.  FOLLOW-UP: We just got back from climbing for the first time today at an indoor gym and we didn't have any trouble at all. My partner anchored herself to the ground as mentioned in the answers and the weight wasn't even an issue.   Thanks for any insights! "
460,Technique and physical conditioning for crack climbing,"Very recently I had been to a climb where I learnt about an alternate route that requires a huge crack to be climbed. It is of about a 100-120 ft roughly.  Though I have experience in climbing open faces of walls with the aid of equipment like pegs, I have never tried much of my skills to climb through natural cracks, so before I get there, I'd like to prepare a bit in that point of view.  As far as I can see the kind of an activity it is, offset pull-ups should be good exercise to start with.    Can anybody suggest some more sort of a warm-up/exercises one should follow while beginning to prepare/practice for such a climb? Are there good online educational resources for learning specialized techniques for crack climbing? "
461,Use of gore-tex for a DIY Double-layer hammock,"I'm planning to sew my own double-layer hammock. I found a simple pattern here: [website]I was thinking about modifying it a bit, to have the bottom layer made of Gore-Tex fabric. This adds some weight to the product, but also adds some layer of waterproof protection from the bottom (so maybe I could use it on the ground, where there are no trees around?).   I'm not sure how would the gore-tex behave when under the mechanical stress too. Any thoughts?  "
462,Trekking poles: Collapsed or fixed?,"I recently purchased some collapsible trekking poles (Komperdell Ridgehiker, made in Austria) and found them quite useful in terms of being able to extend or retract them slightly for going up and down hill when my knees are most strained with my 30-40 pound pack.  A major issue with the design was that it snapped at the plastic rings that make up the joints while going downhill with only a 15 pound pack and fast pace, with conscious effort to plunge them in a way where I would not bend them too much while moving forward.  If I am to be abusing the poles like this (absolutely am looking for them to be strong enough for the rare slip somewhere at a minimum) should I look for much pricier ones with stronger joints, or go with fixed? And if I choose fixed, should I size them at a 90&deg; bend or should I size them for say uphill climbing or slightly longer for downhill and possibly adjust the hand loop much longer for when I use them for uphill? Or is the benefit of collapsing mainly for packed size and not much is gained by adjusting them for the incline? "
463,"Do mountains really make their own weather, and if so why?","Forecasts for the mountains generally seem to be somewhere between useless and unreliable. Afternoon thunderstorms, clouds that come out of nowhere, unexpected rain showers, etc... Anyone who has spent some time in the hills has a story or three of getting caught by unexpected weather, and we're always taught to be vigilant and prepared.  Do mountains really make their own weather? Why is that? "
464,Official Protocols to be followed in England for trekking/hiking,"I am planning a long hike in England which is part of E2 trail.  Apart from all the documentation and legal processes that I need to follow to be in England, are there any specific local procedures that I am supposed to follow during hiking/long distance walking? How safe is it to trek alone in England? I plan to carry my food, bedding, a tent and all the necessary things that I need in emergency and a medical kit. "
465,Where in New Zealand is wild camping permitted?,"Basically this question, only for New Zealand (both islands).  I know that the Freedom Camping Act exists, which basically allows camping everywhere unless it's forbidden.  So, where is it actually forbidden? Is there a list? Or are local municipalities not making use of this possibility to restrict wild camping?   By camping I mean using a tent in combination with a non-motorized vehicle like a bicycle or legs. I understand that RV's/campers might have different rules.  "
466,What's the maximum temperature difference wind-chill can account for?,"If I understand wind-chill (which I probably don't), the air feels colder because your body doesn't have as much time to heat the air as it passes by.  But in that case it seems like there should be a wind-speed at which the amount by which the air is heated by your body is 0 (or negligible).  At that point you're feeling the ""actual"" temperature the air is at.  How much temperature difference would that speed be from no-wind?  What wind-speed is that? "
467,How is the Nuaulu palm leaf carrying pot made?,"In a Ray Mears BBC Demo, The Importance of the Sago Tree, he travels to Seram in Indonesia and witnesses the natives using Sago leaves to create this really cool pot at 2:40:    The Nuaulu tribesman twists the leaves together, somehow causing them to lock into place:     Unfortunately, Ray ""didn't even attempt it"". However, perhaps there is someone here who has and would be generous enough to teach us the technique? "
468,"Who places the bolts on rock climbing routes, and how?","On big, serious routes (Dreamcatcher, Jumbo Love, etc), who puts the bolts in place and how? Are the bolts there before the ""first ascent"" or does the first ascender put them in place as he goes? It seems ridiculous that he would be carrying whatever equipment it takes to do that with him.  Who decides how the route will go and where to place the bolts? How could they know before the thing has been climbed whether they're putting them in good places, route-wise? The whole thing seems very confusing to me. "
469,Large Tents and Traditional Campsites,"I am going to be relocating to the Colorado desert for a long-term research project and need a portable shelter. The only one I've found so far that will conform to my needs in the turtle tuff shelter found here: [website]Being 6' (1.83 m) tall, I'm a little worried about getting claustrophobic in the 16' (4.9 m) model, but the 24' (7.3 m) model seems a little.... huge. I go camping regularly and if I'm going to drop thousands of dollars on a tent, I would like to be able to use it after my project is done (edit: per the comments I should clarify that I usually go camping 3-4 weeks out of the year for 1-2 week periods at a time. I'm not looking for something for weekend trips). However, I've never camped in a tent this large and I'm not sure if something this size would be allowed, or would even fit in most campsites. Does anyone have any experience camping in a tent this large? Or can someone recommend another tent that would give me a little more head space, but would still meet my needs (listed below)?  Needs:   Must be sufficient for 1.5 to 2 years desert living Must be (reasonably) sand proof and able to withstand high winds Must be at least 200 sqft (18.6 m²) with at least 100 sqft (9.3 m²) I can stand in (I'm going to be spending a lot of time in this tent) Must have some sort of insulation/ventilation system or the ability to keep electronics and people reasonably cool (I'm going to have some solar panels with a swamp cooler or other form of air-conditioning to help with the heat, but my budget is pretty limited so passive methods of climate control need to be used wherever possible). (I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack on this one) Must be a secure shelter for a domestic cat (Edit: I think I should also clarify that I'm not looking to take my cat on recreational camping trips. I can find a sitter for those. But, I need a way to care for her during the 1+ years I'm gone). I know it isn't a good idea to take a cat camping, but I have a cat with some medical conditions and special needs and I haven't found anyone I would trust to take care of her who is actually willing to put the necessary time and effort into caring for her. Due to the extended time period of my trip, I don't see many options short of dropping her at a shelter or putting her down. My definition of ""secure"" is that I can leave the cat alone in the tent for a few hours during the day and not have to worry about her baking alive, tearing through the siding and escaping, or other animals getting into the tent and eating her. Obviously no shelter is 100% safe, but (to give an example) I believe the turtle tuff would meet these needs as it has very strong siding which would prevent the cat from getting out, and would most likely prevent any other animals from getting in. Worst case scenario, the height and strong frame would allow me to hang a high platform the cat could escape to if a coyote or something did manage to break into the tent. Any other suggested shelters would have to give me the same level of comfort about the safety of my pet.   Thank you very much for reading this, and any advice you can provide. "
470,Activities on a long voyage to avoid boredom?,"What should the crew and passengers do on a long voyage?  If they do nothing, their attention is scattered and may become remiss. You can begin to wash the boat, but I do not think that is the best solution for a vacation.  What are suggested best practices? "
471,How do I protect my book(s) while backpacking?,"I recently started backpacking in the Olympic Mountains. While camping, I usually bring along a trade paperback for light reading before bed or during a lunch break on a day-long hike. Up until now, the only protection my books have had has been a ziplock bag, for moisture, and being wrapped up inside clothing, to insulate from the cold/heat.  Is this all I can do for them? Are there any solutions for protecting books from the humidity and the day-night temperature swings associated with backpacking in the mountains? I'm not incredibly worried about pests taking chunks of paper from them, but any suggestions that cover this would be appreciated.   Please let me know if I need to clarify any of the above statements or add additional information. "
472,Is dyneema rope without a sheath safe for climbing?,"I recently was given some old Chouinard hexes my uncle used back in the 70s. They look great, and I see no reason why I can't re-sling them and use them as perfectly safe protection.  I've found some 5mm Dyneema rated for over 5000lbs, but I can't find any as good rope with a sheath.  I know that with Kevlar, this isn't really a problem because its abrasion resistance is so high, but what about Dyneema? Am I mistaken about Kevlar? Can I use this rope without a sheath for building anchors? "
473,Are static dyneema/spectra ropes suited for use on glaciers?,"While Dyneema is in use for cordelettes for quite some time manufacturers started bringing long ropes made of dyneema on the market. The benefits are obvious: Less weight, less volume and no water absorption. The big difference: The rope is static so it does not stretch and take up energy in case of a fall. This makes it unsuitable for climbing. So I am thinking glacier tours and ski touring.  How does the dyneema rope being static influence the ability to stop a fall into a crevasse?    If as a consequence the same procedure as for dynamic ropes cannot be applied: Is there a method so that static ropes are save to use in this scenario?  Are there any other factors to consider when using dyneema ropes on glaciers?  Clarification on the material: Dyneema is a Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, UHMW), also known as high-modulus polyethylene (HMPE), or high-performance polyethylene (HPPE). Spectra is the same material. From my web search it looks like dyneema is more commonly used in Europe and spectra in the US. "
474,Should I spray a 'good' raincoat with 'water proof' spray?,"I come from a family where outdoors activities include picknick baskets and a time limit of four hours tops. However, my girlfriends family loves taking me on outdoor holidays, the kind where you won't see another human being for a few days. During last years holiday, my cheap coat was clearly insufficient to withstand anything more than a light Spanish shower, so they surprised me with a 'good' outdoor raincoat for our upcoming canoeing trip to Canada.  Usually, I sprayed my coats with some kind of water-proof spray before use to make it at least a little water- and dustproof, since 'you should always do that before first use'. However, this coat has some kind of high-tech breathing fabric that I'm not familiar with, and the labels did not provide any directions on whether (not to) spray the coat before first use.  So, my question: should I or should I not use water-proof spray on a 'professional' outdoors jacket? If yes, should I invest in a good spray from an outdoors shop, or will an all-purpose spray do? Or will this actually do more harm than good?  Specifically, it's Venturi ® fabric from Schöffel.  Link to the coat in question (if that's allowed) "
475,What is the best rope material to use for climbing protection?,"I've been doing some research on what type of cord to use for resligning some hexes, and I found something very surprising here.  Basically, the paper seems to suggest that while the tensile strength of high performance cord vastly outperforms nylon, the strength once it's tied in any sort of knot is significantly less. It also suggests that while other materials might outperform nylon when new, several of them rapidly degrade when stressed, to a tensile strength well below ordinary nylon.  Is this just a fluke? Is regular old 5mm nylon really the best choice with a rating, for example, of just 5.6 kN for slings? (Given the average breaking strength of a loop of 7mm nylon tied with a double fisherman's was rated at about 5/3 of the tensile strength, I'd think it's probably a -3-sigma rating pretty close to 9kN when tied... Obviously not tested though.)  It seems odd that it isn't more well-known that nylon is the best choice if it's true... Everyone seems to swear by high performance rope for slinging chocks and setting anchors, but it seems the ""high performance"" rope might just offer a better sounding number than an actual performance increase.  Has anyone had any experiences with cord failing on a piece of pro? What failed, when? What's worked? What do you trust? Does anyone have any other info on the failure of rope when in actual climbing configurations, and not just the tensile strength? "
476,Is stringing a recurve without a stringer damaging to the bow?,"This is my first bow - it's a low-end recurve with a draw weight of 14kg nominal. At the shop they told me not to string it by bracing it against my foot, because the limbs get twisted sideways. They recommended I purchase a stringer.  However, I am a bit skeptical. Firstly, at the training grounds that I visited several times, the instructor was stringing the (I admit, very introductory, maybe 7kg) bows by hand and foot. Secondly, the guy at the shop also didn't use a stringer when he was test-stringing the bow.  So is a stringer necessary? If not, what is the proper technique to string a recurve without twisting the limbs? "
477,Why aren't the mule trains outfitters required to clean up after their animals?,"When we venture into the wilderness, we bury our solid human waste (or may even have to pack it out in some places).  The basic guideline is to not leave faeces anywhere where it can be discovered or uncovered in the future.  Yet along the popular North Kaibab, South Kaibab, and Bright Angel trails in Grand Canyon National Park, pack animals walk down the trail and up again, while the animals (which are non-native) leave their solid waste in the middle of the trail.  As a hiker, I find this a very unpleasant experience, in particular when I'm tired and hot heading for the rim in the afternoon.  Why are the outfitters operating the pack animals permitted to leave the trail in such an unpleasant state, when the rest of us are doing our best to leave no trace?  Some sort of diapers (as in, any piece of cloth that would hold the solid waste for disposal elsewhere) might work, or at least a stick and flick method to move the manure off-trail? "
478,Hiking/Scrambling Etiquette? (UK Specific),"I'm an American who moved to the UK 2.5 years ago but didn't start doing a lot of outdoor activities until early this year (here, specifically, as the job that moved me over was very demanding at first.)  As such, I'm trying to find documented and reliable information on Etiquette for hiking and scrambling that might not be the same as the US. Here are some specific examples, but a well written article from a reputable source that discusses discusses overall etiquette would be better than answers to these specific questions. Does anyone have such an article they could point me to? (Article could mean blog from a reputable source, vblog, podcast, magazine article, etc.)  1) In the states, we frequently say ""on your left"" and then pass on the left when we mean to overtake. This is true for bikers, hikers, parents with strollers, etc. Plenty of people, especially in areas with lots of novices, don't know what you're talking about, but it's a widely accepted practice. I've noticed almost no one in the UK announcing a plan to overtake, but is there an actual preference?  2) In the states, cyclists and hikers should yield to horses and cyclist should yield to hikers (even though most hikers who also mountain bike will yield, knowing how much more difficult it is on the cyclist to start and stop, the established etiquette is frequently sign posted.)  3) Priority for oncoming traffic of the same type. I've always heard that uphill hikers/scramblers should have priority over those going downhill. I was recently told this was not true in the UK and that people moving downhill should have priority. This was based on anecdotal evidence though of a crowd of people getting annoyed with a group who insisted on priority moving past a group of nervous children coming down a loose rock slope on Snowden in the winter.  "
479,What to do if you are above timberline and your descent is cut off by a large forest fire?,"The situation:  you are backpacking and are above timberline.  Streams are ubiquitous, you are well equipped so exposure is not a problem, the entire party is uninjured and healthy.  But a large, rapidly expanding forest fire sprang up well after you left the trailhead, and your route down is blocked.  You have some food, but you will be on short rations if you have to take a long detour to get down.  (See option 2, below.)   Do you (1) activate your PLB (see definition of PLB at the end of the Question); (2) climb up to a pass and try to identify a fire-free way down on the other side of the pass, and activate your PLB only if you cannot find what looks like a safe way down from the pass.    Option (2) seems to me to be clearly the best, but are there dangers to doing this?  (The climb up is well within your capabilities.)  Under what conditions would Option 1 be best?   Addendum: See How long after a forest fire can you safely reenter a forest?.    Edit in Response to Comment: Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) is a [portable] emergency radio locator beacon ..... capable of providing homing signals to assist search and rescue operations.  Many hikers and backpackers routinely carry a PLB to ensure rescue if they get in a life threatening situation, e.g., alone with a broken hip days from the trailhead.       "
480,Is there a functional safety difference in types of helmets,"From a pure safety standpoint is there a functional difference between a climbing helmet, cycling helmet, etc?  Is a cycling helmet actually the safest solution for a cyclist, or would the greater coverage of a climbing helmet be better for safety? "
481,"For a DIY wood burning stove, is there a significant advantage of the double wall ""bushbuddy"" style?","I made myself a simple wood burning stove from a small tomato can, and I am pretty happy with it, but now I am wondering if I would get significantly increased performance by making a more complicated double wall ""bushbuddy"" style stove.    Does anybody have any experience with DIY double wall wood burning stoves?  Is there enough increase in performance to justify the more complicated design? "
482,Is it better to wear one pair or two pairs of socks while hiking?,"From personal experience I tend to wear two pairs of socks, normally some running socks and then my hiking socks on top of that. It helps me avoid blisters. Quite a few of my friends thinks this is nonsense. But with well worn-in boots I always tend to get more blisters if I wear only one pair. Does anyone know if there is any scientific reason for this? or is it just an old wives tale?  "
483,How to sail a packraft,"I would like to use the wind to propel my packraft on passages over lakes. Are there any lightweight and/or improvised sail systems?  Especially: how do I erect a mast on the packraft without it becoming unstable or damaging it? I guess with a mast I could use a space blanket or something else as a sail.  The packraft in question is an Alpacka Raft ""Yukon Yak"" "
484,Should I be scared if a black bear is outside of my tent at night?,"I know that they say to make as much noise as possible to try and show your dominance, but what happens if I am sleeping? If I wake up with a bear right outside my tent while i'm sleeping, and I have nothing to defend myself with, what should I do? "
485,Does putting an item in a microwave oven kill ticks (and other bugs)?,"After a hike, we often find many ticks on us (and remove them of course). But the assumption is that some might still be in the clothing, on the shoes, etc. I don't want to throw the worn stuff in the laundry hamper, and have the ticks potentially crawl all over the house, and I also don't want to (or can't - think motel room) immediately wash after every hike.  For that, I thought I had the really clever idea to put my clothing (and shoes) inside a plastic bag in the microwave, for maybe ten seconds (at full power), assuming that would be unsurvivable for ticks (and hopefully any other bugs, spiders, and whatever else was alive in my cloth - shudder). Then I throw them in the laundry hamper (or luggage) for later washing.  Question: Does ten seconds of micro-waving kill ticks? Is this a useful approach? "
486,Big wall strategies for a three-member team,"I'm off this weekend for a three-day big wall with two other friends. I read ""Big Walls"", by Long and Middendorf, but the book is too old and doesn't really mention strategies for a three-member crew. For a two-member crew, the strategy is quite standard:   Climber 1 (C1) climbs pitch, attached to a lead rope (R1) and carrying with him a second rope (R2), which will serve as a zip-line and a haul line; C1 arrives at belay, fixes R1 and sets a hauling system for R2; C2 lowers off the pig (haul bag), which is then hauled by C1 while C2 jugs R1 and cleans the pitch; Repeat for next pitch;   P.S: If the pitch is long and horizontal, a third rope can make things easier: not only it'll be used to lower off the pig, but also to cancel pendula C2 might have to deal with during the cleaning.    Now, when dealing with one more person, things start to get a little weirder, since there are many possible strategies.   A possible one I was thinking about is Method 1:   C1 sets off with R1 and R2, same way as before; C1 arrives at the belay, fixes both R1 and R2; C2 helps lower out C3, which will jug the fixed line R2; C3 arrives at belay with C2 still waiting. After arriving, C3 sends a signal to C2 to start lowering off the pigs; C2 lowers off the pigs and starts jugging the fixed line R1 and cleaning the pitch. Meanwhile, C3 and C1 are hauling the pigs; When hauling is done, C2 is probably halfway cleaning, and C1 or C3 can start leading a new pitch. Hopefully C2 will arrive at belay before the leader is halfway through, because most of the gear will be hanging with C2;   P.S: As always, another rope can be carried by C2 to help him clear the pendula and lower off the pigs.    Another one is Method 2:   C1 sets off with R1 and R2, same way as before; C1 arrives at the belay, fixes R1 and pulls up R2 and two other ropes, R3 and R4. R2 in this case will be a very thin, 7mm zip-line; C1 fixes R1 and R3 and sets a pulley system for R4; C3 starts jugging R3 and leader starts hauling from R4 at the same time. C2 immediately sets off to clean the pitch; After C3 gets to belay and helps C1 with the hauling, he or C1 can already start leading the next pitch;   P.S: a fifth (!) rope can be carried to avoid pendula, etc.    I hope I was transparent enough in my descriptions.   Now, let's talk about the advantages of each method. Method 1 has the downside of C2 having to wait till C3 got to the belay to lower off the pigs, and only then start cleaning. But C3 is the fastest of the group anyway: he needs only to jug fast and tight. The main advantage of Method 1 is that C3 can help C1, which just leaded a possible A3+ and is thanking Odin for being alive, to haul the pigs. This method also involves a maximum of 3 ropes.  Method 2, on the other hand, can be faster: C2 starts cleaning immediately after C1 fixes R1. C3 can deal with lowering off the pigs and then can sprint up from a fixed line, to help C1 haul a little, and to lead the next pitch. C2 will be cleaning throughout the whole process, so the next leader will have available gear earlier than in Method 1. The problem is that at least 4 ropes must be carried, and that C1 will have to haul at least a little bit on his own.  Do you know another method? Does anyone have any experience with both of these methods and can suggest any improvement/comment? "
487,Warning shot in bear encounter?,"I'm wondering if anyone else has had any experiences with guns and/or bear spray in combination, instead of just carrying one over the other? How have bears reacted to warning shots?  We backpack in bear country (black &amp; grizz) and carry bear spray as well as a handgun for our safety. Unless we're in a National Park, we will also have our Border Collie with us, mostly off leash (if you ever hiked long distance, over variable terrain with your dog(s), you know why a leash isn't comfortable or safe for either dog or owner), but not allowed to run ahead of us on the trail. I've read many stories, statistics and comparisons between using bear spray vs. a gun for protection, almost all of them favor the bear spray. I'm not disagreeing with these, but haven't found much advise on the use of BOTH. We ran into black bear in the Wilderness the other day, on the trail, about 50-70 yards away. The dog was about 10 feet to my right, and we saw the bear just after it had spotted us. She didn't charge or bark. The bear checked us out, while I turned sideways, keeping an eye on the bear, reaching for my bear spray, and telling my hiking companion behind me of the bear. We were slowly backing away to give the bear an escape route, speaking to the bear and the dog. The bear (bluff) charged, and my companion shot a warning shot. Everybody froze. The bear stopped its charge. I discharged the bear spray, mainly to build a wall in front of us, as the bear was about 25 yards away now. The wind carried the bear spray cloud off to the side, it went out maybe ~10', not the 35' advertised on the can, I was disappointed in the product. We talked loudly and aggressively to the bear and stood our ground, the bear left. Despite being in the wilderness, this was on a fairly busy trail, at a lake used for camping as well. I'm assuming the bear was habituated to humans and looking for food rewards. We saw it again on our way back from our destination in a gully, this time we were louder and there was no wind, so the bear had spotted us beforehand and wandered through the creek and up the other side of the gully, clearly not out for a confrontation. After this experience, I don't see how one would ONLY carry bear spray, as the bear would have to have been so much closer in its charge for it to have even reached it/deterred it with the wind. The warning shot proved very effective in this case!  "
488,What is this tree with shiny leaves and a fuzzy seed pod?,"I was walking my dog along this one stretch of side walk in my neighborhood and there are a few of these trees lined up along it.  They have a fuzzy seed pod (or perhaps a flower pod?) that reminds me of an artichoke, and smooth shiny leaves.  Below are pictures of the pod and leaves, and the bark (which is a bit blurry, but I don't think it takes away from it too much):      What kind of tree is this?  This is in  southeast Virginia, but I think these trees were planted here, so I'm not sure if they are native to the area.  "
489,What causes a tree to split into multiple trunks?,"There is this one tree (I believe an oak tree) near my road that is very large in size.  Practically at the base of its trunk, it diverges into four other large trunks:    What causes this phenomenon in trees?  Is it possible that this was actually a few trees that have grow into one another?  To me, this looks like one tree that early on in it's life, somehow split off into four trunks like so.   "
490,How are the routes of hiking trails determined?,"While hiking and backpacking, I often ponder how the trail came to be located where it is. Some trails, especially longer ones, seem like they could take several different routes to get to their destination.  Let's say a wooded, mountainous US national park decides to build a trail several miles long between an established trail and an interesting geological feature. How would they go about routing said trail? How would the approach have differed before technologies like GPS, aerial imagery, and detailed topographic maps came about? "
491,How long does it generally take to stop feeling climber's elbow?,"I've been climbing 1-2 times / week (usually once) for about a month. After each time I climb, I feel joint pain in my elbows. From my understanding, this is likely Tennis Elbow.  Slowly but surely, the pain seems to be becoming less intense, and also last a bit shorter each time I climb. My question is, how long does it generally take to stop feeling elbow pain altogether after a climb? I am aware that there are mitigating techniques for alleviating joint pain as mentioned in this question: What can I do to help relieve joint pain in fingers after climbing?. My question, however, is related to how long it generally takes to feel no elbow pain for someone who is climbing 1-2 times / week. "
492,What is this tree with a spiral shaped trunk in Massachusetts?,"On a recent hike at the Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary in Princeton, Massachusetts, my husband came across this tree.   The trunk is twisted in a spiral/curly fashion. It was in a forest of many other trees, but this was the only one that looked like that.   What is the name of the tree? Is that just the way it grows, or an indication of something wrong with it?    "
493,Hints for hiking the west highland way,"I am a 'newbie' in hiking, and I will be doing this trail in July. Following more or less this plan:    -> Milngavie to Carbeth (8km) -> Carbeth - Drymen (11.2km) -> Drymen to Rowardennan (23km) -> Rowardennan to Ardlui and Inverarnan (22.4km) -> Ardlui and Inverarnan to Tyndrum (19.6km) -> Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy (11.2km) -> Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse (19.2km) -> Kingshouse to Kinlochleven (14.4km) -> Kinlochleven to Fort William (24 km)   Do you have any tips? Do's and dont's? Any input is kindly appreciated. "
494,Rapelling an overhang,"How do you bypass the overhang, mid-rappel?   --.  &lt;-- Start of rappel    |    |  __|  &lt;-- Overhang | |   Do you go to your knees and then step one foot over at a time trying not to squash your hand?  Do you drop quickly, making sure to drop low so your face doesn't bash the rock?  What if it's not deep enough to swing into air?  I'd love some tips to bypass this sort of obstacle safely, especially on slippery rocks. "
495,What is Fast Packing?,"I've heard it referred to as a cross between running and hiking, but what does that end up looking like? What type of milage/hour are people doing, there chafing issues, and is this the type of activity that one trains for (as apposed to a more general 'hiking') by running at home with a 20lbs pack? "
496,Quality of duck vs goose down,"While searching for a sleeping bag I was told that goose down is clearly superior to duck down in terms of quality. I guess that means e.g. the fill power (measured in cuin). What exactly are the differences, is goose down always preferable?  What I was also told is that duck down is more prone to smell bad when it was getting wet. Goose down isn't. Is this true?    This topic is related but gives just a kinda overview and it asks for all down species. Here I am solely interested in sleeping bags and in the comparison of duck vs. goose down. "
497,V-chamber vs trapezoid construction,"I am searching for a down sleeping bag and found two alternatives. They are from one manufacturer so data should be comparable.   bag (""A""):    T_limit = -13°C weight = 1000g filled with 600g of 850cuin goose down  bag (""B""):    T_limit = -17°C weight = 1170g filled with 700g of 850cuin goose down    So far, so good, numbers make sense in my opinion.   But what is very interesting now is the fact, that A is made in trapezoid construction and B is made in V-chamber construction.  Is this already considered in the temperature rating? And should I always prefer V-chamber over trapezoid? If so, why? "
498,What to do in a herd of angry cows?,"Sometimes I have to go through a herd of cows on a pasture when hiking in mountains. Cows are generally very peaceful creatures and there is no problem usually.  However, I missed this ""Danger! Bulls in herd!"" sign today. I walked quite swiftly, cows were going out of my way and then I met a bull. It was standing right in front of me, very angry, pawing the ground with hoof. ""Alright, let's go back"" I decided, but it was too late. Cows were all around, obviously nervous, because the bull was nervous. They were mooing, snorting, kicking each other, getting panicked and moving closer to me. It was pretty scary.  What should one do in such a situation? Run? Shout and wave his hands? Sit down and try to look small and friendly? "
499,How can I tell if a opossum is truly dead?,"I saw a opossum (the North American kind) on a golf course the other day. It looked pretty dead - there was foam coming out of its mouth and flies buzzing all around it. However, I know opossums can convincingly play dead by involuntarily entering a catatonic-like state. Are there any tell-tale signs indicating a opossum is really dead? Would the flies be buzzing around it if it was actually alive? "
500,Where do I document first ascents?,"I see a lot of people on social media posting their first ascents. These people are usually professional climbers climbing new super hard routes and as a result their first ascents blow up on social media. But what if, hypothetically, I find an untouched boulder at make the first ascent of a V0 boulder. Where would I document this? If there isn't some central database, how will people know if they actually made the first ascent of something?  A quick google search for first ascent documentation turned up fruitless. "
501,"How dangerous are polar routes, if an aircraft must land on water or wild land?","Suppose an emergency landing  necessary for a commercial aircraft on a polar route on water or in the unoccupied, secluded Arctic outback (e.g. Siberia, far northern Canada).    What is the time interval for aid to arrive (I write 'interval' because I know that this question depends on the location)?  How likely would the passengers survive in the freezing cold  in their cabin clothes? Assume that they are not equipped with clothes or gear for frigidity.   "
502,Will an opossum wake up from pain stimulus if playing dead?,"When an opossum is playing dead, will it keep up the act even if an animal decides to start eating it anyways? Or will it wake up once it's flesh starts getting ripped open and try to fight back or flee?  "
503,Tent for High Altitude Trekking,I am planning to do the Kangchenjunga base camp trek (in Nepal) in the coming months. I read that a tent is a must for this trek as it is not a tea house trek. I am thinking of buying a tent for myself but my dilemma is do I choose an all season tent or 3 season?  Which will work best (in regard to the weather condition in high altitude of Nepal) or what kind of tent is suitable for the trek keeping in mind that I may also need it in the future for other trails? 
504,How safe is it to travel from Kathmandu to Lukla without Flying the distance?,"I am planning a trek around Mt Everest. I intend to cut the cost as much as I can, because I'll be planning a more exhaustive expedition in the same region in a short while after this trek, so I just intend to plan this trek, spending as less as I can. I plan to so there by the month of August or September.  I have a few queries to which I could never find a convincing answer so far from the resources that I tried.    How long does it take to travel from Kathmandu to Lukla (without the flying option)? How safe is the journey by means of best available local transport? What is the duration? How much does the flying option cost if I plan to take that? How early do I need to book?   I hope if there is anyone who has recently been there, can help me with these questions. "
505,Is there any upper temperature limit for a given sleeping bag?,"I'm actually shopping for a new sleeping bag and am a bit in doubt about a question that I do not find treated anywhere: By investing an arbitrarily huge amount of money I can buy a sleeping bag to sleep snuggly down to -30° C and even below. But what about the other side? Let's say, I buy a sleeping bag with a comfort rating of somewhere between 0 and -10° C, can I use it also in a warm summer night? Or is there some temperature where it will be just too warm to use it even with zipper fully opened and used more like a blanket?  I'm aware of the fact that I will carry more weight and volume than necessary for an insulation that I would not need. I'm just interested about the comfort at the warm end of the temperature scale. So if I buy a bag with some reserve for cold fall or winter nights, will it be unusable in summer or only not the best choice I could have had? If it is unusable above a certain temperature is there some rule of thumb that says something like ""a bag that has a comfort rating of X won't be of use for temperatures roughly Y degrees above that X rating."" "
506,Food nutrition for week long hike,"I'm going on a week long hike in Southern Spain. I envisage myself being away from civilisation max 3 days. What kind of food should I take at any one time? There are infrequent farm houses and outbuildings. A friend recommended dates, nuts, sultanas, carrot, cucumber, olives, salt, pepper for food? What do you think? "
507,Climbing guide for the Yorkshire Dales,"Can anybody reccommend a climbing guide for the Yorkshire Dales area? I'm off for a weekend trip there in a couple of months but I'm having difficulty finding a guide for the area. Roughly the Askrigg region  Preferably this will include somewhere I can easily set up some top ropes on easy routes as I'm taking some inexperienced friends.   Barring a book, any recommendation's for crags that fit the bill, above? "
508,"Would gutters in an impermeable single-wall tent drain condensed water away, and keep the tent comfortable?","Single-wall tents are made from waterproof breathable material, which is heavier and more expensive than a simple impermeable layer.    But if a single-wall tent were made of impermeable material, wouldn't excess moisture generated inside the tent simply condense on the inside surface of the tent since that will be colder than other surfaces in the tent (such as the outside of a sleeping bag)?    Then, with a good system of gutters to drain the condensed water away, couldn't the tent stay comfortable?    Would there be more condensation on the roof of the tent or the floor? "
509,Super/Krazy Glue on Outdoor Gear,"I currently use All Purpose Krazy Glue to repair pinch flats on my road bike inner tubes.  All it takes is one drop over the bite and it seals it perfectly, works every time and holds 95 PSI for weeks with no leaks!  Recently I lost a pull tab on the back of my LaSportiva trailrunners.  I figured I would Krazy Glue it back on however when the drop landed the shoe smoked, the fibres melted and turned rock hard as if they were burned, which is most likely what happened.  I am curious, does anyone know what Super/Krazy Glue is appropriate to use on fabrics if any?  I understand the re-attachment of the trail runner tab is a pretty ambitious task.  What I would really like to do is put a drop over a small tear in my winter gloves, attach new leather to the palm, small tear on tent...  Does anyone have success using Super/Krazy Glue on Fabrics/Outdoor Gear? "
510,Canvas vs Nylon Tent for Car Camping,"I'm looking for some input to determine which type to camping tent I should purchase specifically for car camping.  I really like canvas tents as many of their features are very appealing but I know they do have a number of drawbacks.  Below is a summary of what I have found in my research.  My Background  I do not need this tent to be portable (i.e. carried long distances) as this is intended for week-long trips with the family when camping in a single location, most often (but not always) at developed campgrounds.  My only constraint is with the packed size as I'm currently driving a small crossover SUV which doesn't quite have the carrying capacity of a pickup truck.  The Comparison  Canvas Tents  Pros:   Large - Lots of room internally with near vertical walls. Waterproof - Easily maintained waterproofing using a product such as Kiwi Camp Dry. Temperature - Cooler in summer and warmer in winter as compared to Nylon. Durable - If well maintained (not put away wet, will last decades). Repairable - Simple needle and tread can be used to make field repairs.   Cons:   Heavy - Thick (but durable) material and steel poles contribute significant weight. Bulky - For similar reasons to #1, they take up a lot of space when stored. Price - Substantially more expensive than Nylon counterparts. Stinky - Can develop an odor that's borderline impossible to remove, particularly if ever stored wet.   Nylon Tents  Pros:   Weight - Very light, small tents are event backpack-able. Price - Cheap enough to almost be disposable.  Large tents are not dirt cheap but are still 1/2 the price of their canvas counterparts.   Cons:   Not as durable - Waterproofing breaks down over time and seam leaks are difficult to repair. Small - Large tents are almost (but not always) dome tents to take advantage of the small/lightweight curved fiberglass poles. Temperature - Hot in summer and cold in winter.  Slightly invalidated for summer as only ""hot"" when the sun is shining and I'm not in the tent anyways.   My Use Case  I'm leaning towards a Kodiak Canvas 9x12 cabin tent with a ground cloth and the attached screen porch option.  If anyone has any hands on experience with one of these tents specifically, I'm interested in how it stands up against the aforementioned points.  I elected for this specific model because the attached porch can optionally be setup or tied back to the main tent meaning that I could use it when no other screen rooms are available and we need a bug-free location for cooking and storing gear under a roof.  The Real Questions   Can anyone offer some advice regarding their experience with the points in my comparison?  I've never stayed in a canvas tent so I am likely missing some important details. Do you think that my decision to go with the large canvas tent is a wise one?  "
511,Sizing up high altitude boots,"I currently use La Sportiva WildCat Trail Running Shoes size 43 for trail running/light hiking and Nepal EVO's size 44 for Ice Climbing and Alpine adventures.  The Nepal EVO's fit me perfectly with a good midweight sock and using their additional tongue for the left foot which is slightly smaller than my right.  I am looking at purchasing La Sportiva Olympus Mons EVO's for high altitude such as Denali and other real cold expedition type adventures that require a double boot.    My question is how much larger do I size them to accommodate for the swelling of the feet at high altitude?  Would one full size be ok?  I am thinking a half size for thicker sock+ sock liner and a half size for the swelling of the foot, is this accurate or should I be sizing up even larger? "
512,What do I do if I lose my belay plate?,"The scenario  My climbing partner and I are at the top of a pitch and we drop a belay plate to the ground. There is no safe descent, we were planning on rappelling down off safe anchors.  What do we do?  Also covers:  ""How to abseil without a descender device?"" "
513,What specific features should I take into account when buying GPS device for Geocaching?,"I've been geocaching using Android smartphone, but it slowly becomes unsatisfying. The battery time of Android smartphones is too low, I need to minimize time I'm walking with device on, because battery discharges very quickly. I'm planning to buy a dedicated GPS device.  What should I take into account when I'm going to use GPS device for geocaching? There are some general features, like battery life, screen resolution, the ability to upload custom maps and points with photos and descriptions (general GPX support).   But are there any features that are specific for geocahing, and may be not present, or unsatisfactory in some GPS devices? Geocaching requires the device, for example, to be hand-held and operate by various whether conditions... Is there anything else I'm missing? "
514,how high does a fence need to be to prevent European brown bear to climb it?,"An entrepreneur is planning a campsite-hotel in Romania, with a full outdoor gourmet restaurant attached, with an outdoor kitchen.  There will be no cabins or other living structures, only tents and tepees. This campsite-hotel//restaurant should be attractive to people without much, if any, outdoor experience and allow them to live and eat outdoors without worrying about their safety from European brown bears. Living outdoors will be beyond the comfort level of many of the customers.    European brown bears are a danger in Romania, however docile they may be in other parts of Europe.  See this article from Reuters and this article from Romanian Insider.com  I need to enclose an area at least 50 meters by 50 meters (164 feet by 164 feet) or 0.6 acre.  For many reasons, I do not consider electric fencing as an option. It needs to be a physical concrete-pole fence. Metal will rust and/or will need to be painted regularly, and wood will be too weak probably. The area contains apple trees, and vegetables will be planted inside the area.  There will be at least two enclosed areas, one for sleeping and one for eating.  Parts of the fence will be behind bushes, so people will not feel confined, but they will know it is there for their protection.  What height does the fence need to be, and possibly any other parameters? Not sure if spikes at the top would be of any use? Likely the fence will need to be quite strong, with concrete poles smaller distance apart then the size of a bear, so he can't pass between by breaking the weaker material between the poles.  Is this feasible at all, or will bears break through anything, and climb over any fence?  Answers started going in the wrong direction, talking about locking away smelly food. Please focus on answering the question about parameters of the fence, not suggesting other solutions. There will be just too much smelly things inside to lock away: a large outdoor kitchen, restaurant, cafe, full-size freezer, not to mention growing vegetables and keeping chicken for eggs and goats for milk and meat.  To prevent obstructing the view and looking like a prison, I want to construct this as a ha-ha wall but on a slope, here is a cross section (1):   "
515,Setup for solar powered battery generator,"I would like to setup a solar charged/battery storage system for an RV/small camper environment.  Initially with one solar panel, one matched battery pair; but also allow the battery(ies) to be charged from 120VAC and/or auto alternator when available.  I expect to add additional batteries and solar panels matched appropriately.  I expect to use only 12VDC powered devices in the RV, so no need for an inverter.  I do not expect to try to power lots of gear at once.  I see lots of solar/battery setups, but none seem to include recharging by 120VAC and auto alternator in addition to solar, nor 12VCD loads exclusively.  Are there any special requirements for wire sizes depending on run length from solar panel to batteries?  to charge controller?  etc? "
516,"SERE Surival Kit includes velcro finger lights, but why?","I have seen a survival kit that has been spoken well of by many reviewers: the SERE Air Force Survival Kit. SERE stands for: survival, evasion, resistance, escape.  It is a rather small kit fitting in roughly the size of an altoids tin box. In the kit there are the basic things that are axiomatic to survival such as: compass, first aid, signal mirror, flints and so forth. Then one item that stood out was finger lights with Velcro straps. It was just kind of glossed over in the reviews I saw, and I also could not get much info elsewhere on the internet. All I know is:   one is red light (visible) one is infrared (for use with night vision)   Since I thought perhaps it would be useful for putting it over your finger as you pointed at a map in a dark environment. While this makes sense, I'm not sure the space and weight these items take up in the kit would be justified if it provides merely more convenient map reading (with all due respect to map reading). Here is a picture of the SERE kit with the lights in the red circle:    As you can see, they look good and well engineered, and I assume as a GI product the purpose is not to just roleplay as iron man.   Question: Perhaps it is the Velcro strap and notion that the lights go on our fingers that confuses me the most; what is the advantage of this? What is the typical use case for such a device? Perhaps we can also Velcro it to a small twig or something? "
517,Does a hands-free kayak bilge pump exist that is as speedy and reliable as a hand pump?,"Does anyone have any experience they can share with actual use of a hands-free kayak bilge pump?  I’m curious about foot-operated/electric/other, purchased or custom built, anything that lets me keep both hands on the paddle.  My performance / reliability benchmark is the standard foam covered hand operated piston-style pump.  Any comments welcome but specifically:   How did your system do at emptying the majority of water from a fully flooded (post-wet-exit / skirt blowout) cockpit in reasonable time (actual stats, or just your qualitative assessment of how long it took vs how long you could reasonably keep the swamped boat upright)?   How many times could it perform the above function (in terms of battery life, leg fatigue, etc) Have you had the opportunity to use the system as a matter of convenience, or actual safety (for example has it actually allowed you to keep both hands on the paddle to stabilize a flooded boat in unsteady water, or when conditions made rafting up with another boat tricky) How did it do at the different but also useful task of getting the kayak close to completely dry, over whatever time period?  (My thought at justifying the weight of this system is that the few liters of water that typically make their way into my boat weigh a corresponding few KG).  Did your system drain the whole boat (including behind bulkheads) or just the cockpit? What maintenance challenges did you experience?  "
518,Hiking trails between Mt Moosilauke and Rumney NH,"I would like to hike from Mt Moosilauke to Rumney NH. From the all trials map it looks like I can take the Carriage Road Trail almost all the way to some sort of extension to the Three Ponds Trail, but it does not look like there is an easy way to connect the last half mile from Breezy Point Rd to what I am hoping is a trailhead. Then from the southern trailhead it looks like I would have to walk 6 miles on Stinson Lake Rd to get to Rumney.  Is it possible to connect the Carriage Road Trail and the Three Ponds Trail? Can I avoid the road walk on Stinson Lake Rd? Is there a better route? "
519,Is there a backpacker's guide to edible plants that is very light?,"Several decades ago, we were three days from the trailhead with no food.  Let's not get into why that happened, please.  It is too embarrassing.  We had to slog through snow for two days, but on the third day we walked into spring greenery.  Everything looked delicious, but we didn't know what was OK to eat, so we ate nothing until we got to civilization late on the third day.  Is there a field guide (that doesn't weigh much) to edible plants?  Ideally, the guide would come in multiple volumes (although volumes makes it sound heavy!) that cover particular areas.  For example, there might be a guide to edible plants in the Sierra Nevada, another one for the Rockies, and so on.  What level of specificity makes sense?  Our experience was before on-line anything, but even now on-line would not be much help because most interesting places have no cell-phone reception "
520,How sophisticated a dust mask can one hope to improvise?,"A common improvised dust mask is taking a bandana and tying it over your nose and mouth. I'm asking this question because I'm wondering what else one could add to this set up if anything. First, I'd like to say I'm not knocking the classic cotton bandana dust mask at all; in fact, I appreciated its simplicity.   As for the use case or hypothetical scenario, we can assume it could be anything from pm 2.5 ridden smog that the wind blew over from a nearby city or factory unexpectedly. Or it could be a dust storm kicking up in a desert setting. It could be any number of things. To my knowledge, a cotton bandana would only offer limited protection in these hypotheticals. I'm hoping there is a way to improve it.  Ideally, we would research the area and bring gear accordingly. However, suppose we were caught off guard but we still wanted to make the best dust mask we could to protect our lungs. Going with the pm 2.5 issue again, this would normally require a specific, professional-grade mask. I don't hope to improvise anything better than that of course, but maybe there is a way to improve over the cotton banada? The cotton bandana can serve as a baseline.  One Idea I had:  The only idea I had using materials that an outdoorsman would conceivably have on him would be to nestle some activated carbon (useful for filtering among other things) in between the folds of the bandana. If it could somehow be secured there, would that not help a little with the pm 2.5 or other harmful particulates?  Question: If my idea doesn't sound plausible, is there any way at all to improve upon the cotton bandana using reasonably common outdoorsman supplies? Or are we 100% doomed to suffer the full extent of pm 2.5's microscopic wrath without a professional-grade mask? What about for the case of a natural desert dust-storm? "
521,Do dog life jackets have the same ratings as humans?,"I'm looking into purchasing a dog life jacket for kayaking with our Shetland Sheepdog puppy, when he is fully grown (6months, he's currently almost 4months).  Ideally this will be for rough water such as the sea, as potentially on calm water like the canals he may be ok swimming. However he is long haired so swimming may get tiring without the jacket for him.  When looking for my own life jacket I found the safety ratings confusing (first time purchase!) Do dog life jackets have the same / similar ratings to human life jackets?... Also What rating would be recommended for a mix of sea, canal and lake activity?  Edit: here he is in his new jacket   "
522,Dangers of excavating caves?,"There are a lot of caves around where I'm from in the Southern Canadian Rockies, including the largest cave, and the longest cave in Canada, as well as the Booming Ice Chasm. The caves around here were carved out by the flow waters off of the continental ice sheet during the last ice age, so they aren't growing anymore, instead, they're filling back in.   Scree that falls off of the mountains finds it's way into the cave entrances, then slowly makes its way deeper into the cave, filling in some tunnels.      It's obvious in some places where the cave dead ends that it used to go further, deeper, or higher, but the tunnel is blocked by scree. Even though many are filled in, there's still water flowing into or out of them, so who knows how far they may go, or whether they may connect to other unexplored chambers or even connect to other nearby caves. Chances are good that the entrances to lots of undiscovered caves in the area are buried by scree too.    What I'm wondering is if there's any risks to excavating these tunnels? I don't think that they would cave in, they held themselves up just fine before getting clogged up with scree, I'm more concerned about digging up into the scree. There's one cave that may have a blocked entrance on the other side of the mountain it's in, which could be easily excavated from the inside out, but I don't know how much scree might be behind where we want to dig. I'm worried about an avalanche of scree pouring into the cave once we clear out enough of the tunnel.  How safe would it be to attempt to dig through some of these blocked passages? "
523,How to clean cookware?,"When going camping on a multi-day trip, how do you clean metal pots, metal silverware and plates (for metal or ceramic)?  The solution that came to mind was to bring dish soap and a sponge. However:   It adds bulk The dirty sponge will dirty up everything else in my backpack Drying and cleaning the sponge when done takes a long time Dumping soapy water in the wilderness is bad for the environment (and often against the rules) In many areas (such as deserts) water is limited, and park rules say you should conserve water (and using up a lot of water to first wash, then rinse, then wash the sponge seems like a waste) In other places, clean water is not readily available. If I just rinse my things with water from a random stream, then put them in my mouth/eat off them, won't that expose me to pathogens in the stream water?   I'm curious if there's a better solution to this than just using disposable items like paper plates and cups, plastic forks and spoons, and disposable aluminum foil cooking vessels (this also seems wasteful since you can easily go through a bag of each in a week).

525,Why do Robins tilt their head to the side before pulling a worm out of the ground?,"I've seen this happen several times. The robin hops along, stops, tilts it's head slightly and then grabs the worm/grub, etc.  What's the purpose of this gesture?   I'm thinking it maybe helps them focus on the target? "

This recording was made in England, in mid-June.  Also, how do you quiet these birds down?  The call is very noisy and annoying. "
527,Why did I get goosebumps after drinking water while walking in Hot and Humid weather?,"I have observed a strange thing happening with me these days. In India, month of March to May are of Summer with extreme heat, May to be worst. Midday, the mercury rises up to 40oC. I was walking on a long plateau for close to an hour  or so in the afternoon, with ambient temperature of about 40oC. I was well hydrated. The water in the hydration pipe (and not the bladder) was a bit hot due to the sun. Yet, I took a sip and then came the colder water. I immediately got goosebumps as it felt cold. That happened frequently. Have anybody observed this? It didn't affect my performance visibly, but I felt that really strange. Is that an issue? "
528,Waterproof shoes for men for +10°..+15°C and full-day use,"I am looking for shoes that I can wear for all day long in moderate outdoor conditions, both in rainy and dry conditions, at +10°C..+15°C (50°F..60°F). My feet sweet quite a lot, so breathability sustaining for long hours would be a great advantage.  The target conditions are:   rainy day in a rural conditions, both walking a lot and sitting on an open-air terrace for long hours rainy day in a small town full of puddles and with lots of unpaved pathdays a cool day with a ""chance of rain"" when rain doesn't actually happen   What brands and product lines to look first? Which characteristics/features to look for? What keywords to search for in customer reviews to make sure given model is what I need?  How can I best explain what I need in a advanced-outdoor gear shop? Or what stores should I actually look at? "
529,How do I reliably diagnose my own dehydration?,"Drinking too much (and wasting it) or insufficient water quantity can be dangerous. The current method that I am using to judge if I am doing it correctly is urine colour:   clear white - if water is not abundant, you are wasting it!     very light yellow - correct ""setting""     dark yellow - dehydration has begun occurring (now a lot more water and a long rest are needed to exit this condition, otherwise body and mind begin suffering and chances of survival drop).   Is this method reliable? If not, which one would be? "
530,Exploring coastal caves safely?,"Having read this good question I felt it covered mountainous regions very well however myself and my husband are big fans of the coast and he certainly has (with his ex-fisherman father) explored many coastal caves over the years.   What dangers or points to be aware of (tide, potential debris, etc) are there when exploring coastal caves? How would you safely explore a coastal cave? (would it be better over a few days etc...)  "
531,Why are two birds obsessed with a chopped-down tree?,"Where I work, there was a great pine tree which was recently chopped (actually, sawed) down.  Prior to its demise, this tall pine was visited often by lizards and birds.  After its removal, though, the remaining stump has seemed to hold a fascination for a pair of dark birds, and I'm stumped (no pun intended) as to why. I don't know what kind they are. They're not juncos, but are about the same size.   They are not actively seeking bugs or such - they simply stand on the stump looking around and at each other, sometimes walking around on it.  Is it because this was their tree, and they are confused? They still feel an attraction to it? They had a nest in it?  This is in Santa Cruz, on the central California Coast. "
532,How did people make topographical maps in the pre-modern?,I've been getting into making maps with compass and a ruler and just triangulating positions of objects. I would like to start making topographical maps but how? How did they make them before the modern times? If you can answer and point me to some where to teach me that would be great. 
533,How to stay clean on a multi-day hike?,"I love hiking but there is a serious problem - I find it disgusting to be sweaty or dirty. I am literally unable to function properly if I do not get a thorough and warm shower every morning.  This places me in a difficult position, as I do not want to give up long hikes but the discomfort is really too much for me. In the summer, a good swim every morning works OK to wash the filth off of me but there is only so much of summer and I tend to go out all year round (perhaps even more so in winter).  Are there some basic tricks to keeping clean? Or do you just try to get used to the filth? To be clear, I am speaking of keeping my body clean, not so much the clothes, since those bother me less (and I can always bring a change of clothes for longer hikes). "
534,Prevent mosquito bites: insect repellent patch or just eat vitamin B1?,"I'd like to use natural malaria prevention. Insect repellent patch seems to be very promising. One patch contains 75 mg of B1 and covers 36 hours. However, it's not very cheap. Many other travellers recommend doses of B1 vitamin.   What dose of eaten B1 (in mg) is enough for protection? (daily) How is it effective compared to the patch? What dose of vitamin B1 (eaten) would be comparable to the 75 mg B1 patch?  "
535,What are some things to keep in mind when stealth camping?,Stealth Camping definition:     Stealth camping is the act of quietly finding a place away from people where you can camp for the night and then quickly slip away in the morning without being detected. The key to stealth camping is to remain hidden at all times and to leave no trace of your existence during or after your departure from the site.    I have been starting to plan a cross Canada bike tour.  I was wondering if anyone has experience with stealth camping.  Any tips or pointers?  Things to keep in mind?    (I know that the rules/regulations will be different in different countries/provinces/states.) 
536,How can I tell what time it is without a watch?,"Assuming I don't have a watch or other time-telling device with me in the wilderness, is there a way to know what time it is? I don't necessarily want to know the exact minute of the day, but a general idea of how many hours are left until sunset would be helpful. If it's very cloudy or stormy, do I have any hope of knowing the time of day? "
537,What happens to cams after climbing?,What do people do with their cams after they've reached the top of the rock? Is there some special way of getting them down again? Seeing the prices of around 50 € per piece they can hardly just leave them up there. 
538,How to tell the time at night,"What is the simplest way to approximate time after the sun has set? Perhaps using the moon's height and phase? This would make the most sense to me, but what could you do in the case of a new moon? "
539,What qualities to look for in a good emergency whistle?,"I've always been taught to keep a whistle on me in case of emergencies - it makes sense since it's small and lightweight but could really help in an emergency.  However, something I've never really thought about much is, are they pretty much all the same, or are some more desirable than others for various reasons? I'd assume metal ones are preferable for durability, but are there any other characteristics that should be taken into consideration apart from that? "
540,"Chalk: pure, plus drying agent, liquid?","Having only used pure chalk without added substances so far, I wondered how the other types perform. Most of the information I could find online is either somebody ranting against a certain type, or uncritical explanations of what the different ones are made of.  So, what are the benefits and tradeoffs of each type of chalk? How long do they last on the hands, how much climbing do you get per amount of chalk? So I can base value on the price I can get for these products when it's time to buy.  Is there really something that makes you feel like you've got sticky fingers like some people suggest? "
541,What is the impact of clothing color in a tropical jungle environment?,"I heard that light colors attract less insects than dark, that dark colors could be warmer, and I was advised against wearing white in the jungle. Where can I get a comprehensive list of the effects different colors will have in a tropical jungle environment? Do these effects differ in different environments? "
542,What type of knife should I carry while rock climbing?,"I carry a cheap folding knife with me while climbing, particularly if I know there is a chance of stuck ropes, grubby anchors, or we are in the backcountry. The knife is held shut with a loop of cord, but I've been hoping to find a safer, cleaner solution.  I know Trango makes a couple knives (one attached to a nut tool), and so does Petzl. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Does anyone have personal experience with a particular model? Ideally the knife should be wearable on my harness.  Edit: I'm really looking for a broader answer that references advantages and disadvantages, though the information about the specific knives so far is awesome. "
543,What is a realistic weight for a week long hike?,"I'm looking to do some hiking and wild camping before the end of the British summer, I'm happy with the contents of my kit and the items I'm taking but I'm not sure how realistic it is to be carrying 14 kilos (33 lbs) for an extended period of time each day.

544,"When taking a Go Pro scuba diving, how would you mount it?","I'm taking a Go Pro to shoot some diving video, and I've never done this before. Assuming a mask mount is not an option, would you strap it to your wrist, attach it to your BC, or take it loose / on a lanyard with some sort of short pole? I've seen floatation mounts - are they recommended for diving? "
545,What to do when a moose blocks the trail?,"We were hiking in Colorado a couple of weeks ago (i.e., mid-June).  One day, I took Trail A and my husband took Trail B.  As he rounded a bend, he saw a moose on the trail about 50 feet away.  He stopped.  The moose did nothing.  He continued walking towards the moose. When he got to about 30 feet from the moose, the moose ambled off the trail, and, partially screened by trees, started eating.  Question  Other than neglecting to take a picture, did my husband do anything wrong in this encounter with a moose?  (That is, was he dumb?) Should he have waited at the 50 foot range (when he first saw the moose) for the moose to leave?  Waved his arm?  Spoken or shouted?  Or is a slow-ish, confident approach good?  (I would have stopped, taken a picture, and waited until the moose left.)     "
546,What might being certified as a polar bear guard involve?,"I recently talked with a young geologist, some of whose field work is in the Arctic. We mostly talked about the science, but the geologist mentioned being certified (not sure of this word) to act as a polar bear guard. This involves killing the bear, if necessary.  My question: Does anyone know what training this certification (?) might require? Is any sort of simulation of actual conditions involved, and if so, what?   (Sorry, I am not going to get specific about where in the arctic because that might identify who I talked to.)  "
547,What to do when a snake blocks a narrow trail?,"Some time back I was on a very narrow mountain trail with a cliff rising to my right and a steep gorge dropping to my left. The trail was blocked by by the viper below (with the gorge just out of shot). The weather was chilly and the viper was sluggish, but quite aggressive and hissy.   I stamped my feet and clapped which normally scares snakes off, but it wasn't going anywhere and we had a bit of a stand off. I could have swept it off the trail with my walking poles, but this would have sent it over the edge of the gorge and killed it. I was short of daylight so eventually decided to rock-climb around it on the cliff above, at some risk to life and limb.  So my question is, when it's not practical to sweep a snake off the trail with a  pole or stick (as recommended in the answers to this question), is there anything else I could have done to persuade it to withdraw without endangering the snake or myself?   Assume I'm carrying a sack with all the usual overnight trekking gear at my disposal. For example, could I have done something with fire or smoke?      PS - the encounter happened in the Italian Grians in the gorge above this photo - a very lovely spot!   "
548,Handling IT-Band Syndrome when hiking,"A few weeks ago I was hit by IT-Band syndrome. I know that rest is paramount in healing it but the problem is that you do not know if it has fully healed.  In a few days, I want to go on a 2 day hike. Right now, I am pretty confident that I can hike for 15-20 km without any pain.  Do you have any tips for when the IT band pain hits me right in the middle of the trip?   Streches that help, walking methods to alleviate the pain or outright help prevent IT band syndrome? "
549,Carrying small game while hunting on foot?,"I like to hunt on foot, walking through the desert. I mostly shoot jackrabbits since those are plentiful in my area. However, I still haven't found a good system for carrying the animals back to the car once I am done.   I might walk up to 3 miles (5 km) and shoot jackrabbits along the way and I'm almost always carrying a backpack with me along with my rifle. Most of the field kit ""game bags"" I have come across are designed for large game like elk or deer and are much too big for my use. What is the best approach to carrying 2-3 rabbits back with me? Is there some method I can use that also straps to the back of my backpack?  "
550,How can I care for a wound that will be immersed in water?,"I got a fairly bad cut on my leg, not quite bad enough for stitches but will probably leave a scar. I have a camping trip planned this weekend at a lake where we will go swimming and kayaking. I expect the cut to be partially healed by then, but not to the point where I feel safe leaving it exposed. (I'm also a little nervous given a couple recent news reports about ""flesh-eating bacteria"", even though I know it's rare, and the incidents didn't happen near where we'll be!).  At home I have been wearing a fabric bandage, which allows air flow but only keeps it safe from ""dry"" contaminants. I did read How should you treat an open wound in the backcountry?, but it's about immediate first aid treatment for when the wound happens in the wild, and doesn't discuss what to do about water.  What precautions should I take to protect the wound before, during, and after going into lake water? What first-aid items should I pack?  Of course, simply not swimming and kayaking is an option for this situation (although it would be a bummer), but this could also be a concern if you got a cut on a canoeing trip or a hike with water crossings. "
551,Is it a pheasant? A grouse? What do I feed it?,"I live in the United Kingdom.   This cheeky fellow recently wandered into the house, scaring the life out of the missus, much to the amusement of the child.       I put him out in the porch with a bit of wild bird seed mix I had kicking around from spring time, he ate some and wandered off. He's since been back for more and has taken to wandering in and out. I have a large garden with several well established trees, undergrowth etc. I don't mind him hanging around and am happy to put food out / make somewhere suitable in the porch for him to sleep but I'd like to know more info so I can put out the right food etc. Any advice on what he is, what he eats, bedding materials etc?  Why am I bothering with a wild bird, you may ask? Couple of reasons - I live near a very fast road and it'd be a shame for him to get flattened. He looks young and on his own and I suspect he's not truly wild; there are a couple of places round here that keep and breed pheasants (as far as I'm aware) and he may have come from there/ have been raised in some form of captivity. I've made enquiries with the locals but no one has responded to say they're a bird short, so if he's heading towards a career in the big outdoors, I don't mind providing a helping hand (and if he becomes a semi-pet, no big deal either, though he does poop like a trooper, so maybe he can stay outside) "
552,Geocaching: How important is having a dedicated GPS device instead of a smartphone?,"I'm thinking about getting into geocaching with my girlfriend, as it sounds like an activity that we'd both enjoy a lot.  However I really don't think that I want to buy a dedicated GPS device if at all avoidable. On one hand I don't want to spend the money, on the other it'll just be one more device to keep around, make sure it's charged, upgrade firmware or maps, etc.   Can I simply use my smartphone with Google maps for geocaching? Are the modern smartphone GPS receivers accurate enough?   Is there anything that would make dedicated GPS devices much better at geocaching compared to smartphones? "
553,How is a backpack supposed to fit on the shoulder?,"I'm sorry if this question has been asked before or if it's a very vague question, but I'm just in the process of buying a new backpack for myself and I'm confused about how it's supposed to fit on the shoulders. I've no previous experience with backpacks and would appreciate a little help.   I was considering this backpack : QUECHUA Forclaz 40 Litre Air+ Women's Backpack - Grey/Blue. (It's in my budget and I trust decathlon. I can't afford a very expensive backpack at the moment).  It's an internal frame backpack that I've tried in the store and it does feel comfortable, however, the shoulder strap comes slightly above my shoulder (instead on sitting on my shoulder), almost like this:   I asumed since it's shown like that on the official pictures, that's how it is supposed to be but on second thoughts, may be this is the wrong fit for me? Is this normal or should the strap be sitting on my shoulders?   It's a 2 weeks long trip where we'd be travelling hostel to hostel (so I won't have any camping or other heavy gear except for my hiking boots and a thick jacket).  "
554,Can I use sunlight to purify water without a special container?,"According to the answers at Does water in the sun get purified from or polluted by algae, fungi and bacteria? &amp; Can sunlight be used to purify water? water in special containers can be purified in sun light in about 5 hours:  Can I purify water with sunlight and without a special container?  Clarify: can water in a shallow pan be purified by sunlight? There are multiple reasons a person might not have a PET bottle, and need to purify water.  As an example; hiking in the back country, I would be more likely to have a cooking pan than a supply of plastic bottles. While fire can be used to boil water, why use a fire if sunlight can do the same thing? "
555,What is this plant with fluffy white flowers in the Canadian Rockies?,I was hiking in the Ptolemy Plateau in the Canadian Rockies yesterday.    There were all these plants that looked like something right out of a Dr. Seuss book. What are they?    
556,Can you boil/decontaminate water with heat from a magnifying glass?,"A bit hypothetical, but ruling out being able to use a solar still, or the SODIS method, could you make water drinkable by using the suns heat through a magnifying glass?  Paper self ignites at 451° F , water boils at 212° F, but that is at one concentrated point when paper burns using a magnifying glass. Would it be possible to boil a small about of water using the same method? For sake of it lets say you have a magnifying glass that is 3.5"" across, and a plethora of different small containers available glass or metal.   I realize you could then start a fire, and boil water in a metal container but i am just curious if it is possible to heat the water enough to be drinkable without placing it on a fire using this method. As fires cause smoke lets say you are in a less than desirable place where the smoke from a fire could give away your location when you didn't want it to.  "
557,How to improve the grip on my boots?,"I've got a pair of Keen hiking boots that, at their best when brand new, never had a particularly good grip, and now, a few years later, have simply lost any grip to speak of. They are so slippery on any surface, wet or dry, that not only is it embarrassing, but downright dangerous sometimes.   My question is whether there is some technique or trick to getting the bottoms of the boots grippier? Perhaps scarring them with a blade, or running a grate over them, or some other method? The bottoms appear to be the standard rubbery type of bottom that most hiking boots have. "
558,Safest route to cross Þjórsárkvíslar from the north,"In my planned circuit around Höfsjökull in Iceland, the biggest of the 15–20 fords will be Þjórsárkvíslar.  Travel writer Fabrizio Frascaroli describes fording this river; I have included an excerpt below, a bit long but I found it too beautiful to shorten.  Fabrizio was hiking from Nýidalur, a location at least 20 km (as the crow flies) east of Þjórsárkvíslar.  I will be arriving from the north, from the area around Klakkur / Háalda / Háölduhraun, so my route is different.  Counting on the DMA C761 map, there are 23 small (&lt;18 metre) and and 2 intermediate (18–25 metre) crossings between Klakkur and Arnarfell, with the biggest ones at 28N 7182500 619250 and 28N 7174900 611200.  Þjórsárver is in the middle of it.  I don't know exactly where this wide but shallow and quiet river is located but it looks unproblematic despite its large size.  What is the safest route for crossing Þjórsárkvíslar when arriving from the north?  Are there any established locations that travellers have used in centuries past, perhaps indicated by cairns or not?     I wake up to my alarm clock at 3:30 in the night: it is time to wade, and the favour of the morning’s earliest hours is required, however masochistic that may feel. The weather conditions look optimal for the upcoming challenges: entirely dry, still, and as cold as it gets in July.   It must be roughly 8am when I start the Þjórsárkvíslar crossing: the dreaded springs of Þjórsá, Iceland’s longest river. One after the other, I leave behind all the threads of an endless web of streams and rivulets.   I feel a mixture of relief and disappointment about the smoothness of my progression, but it is not meant to last much longer; it is promptly dissolved by the appearance of the river’s last branch, frightening in all its breadth and might, surrounded by the notoriety of grim tales and warnings. The water’s depth varies in a range generously estimated to be between 50cm and 150cm. The prospect of confronting a violent flow up to my chest has admittedly been the source of many headaches over the last few days. In the end, however, the Þjórsárkvíslar will not treat me that badly. The water level suddenly rises above my waist, but with a detour upstream I am able to find a relatively innocuous course in shallow waters, all the way to the other bank. I do not know how long I have been soaking in the river, probably some ten minutes. What’s certain is that as I gain the high ground again, the bite of the cold has made me totally hazy, I am speaking in tongues and can hardly remember how to spell my own name.

559,Is it likely that decimation of its suburban forest habitat would cause a black bear to wander into a busy city if it wouldn't otherwise go there?,"I live in the suburban town of Holden, in Central Massachusetts. Many hundreds of acres of mature woodland areas are being torn down nearby to create new roads and housing developments, and it's getting worse. As a staunch conservationist, this concerns me.  Recently a friend in a nearby city, Worcester, Massachusetts, had a young black bear on her deck. The area is very developed, congested, and there aren't many trees. My friend doesn't have bird feeders, although her neighbors do. Some people are careful with their garbage, but there's plenty around.     The bear didn't do anything aggressive, it just seemed curious. She didn't want it to get hurt so she called animal control to come protect it. Unfortunately, by the time the officer arrived, the bear had wandered off. The officer said he'd try to find, tranquilize and transport it for release at a nearby wildlife habitat area, but he couldn't promise anything. He said there's been a significant increase in bear sightings in her city over the last few years. City animal officers aren't properly equipped to protect them.  In his opinion, the increase is due, at least in large part, to the construction I mentioned. There's enormous decimation of natural habitats of bears and other animals. Ponds and other water sources are being drained, which is devastating for animals and birds.   He said food, shelter and security are no longer available to animals that have inhabited these areas for many years. This has caused bears (and other animals) to venture into areas where they wouldn't necessarily need or want to go in order to find food. The youngsters, such as my friend's visitor, might even be looking for their mother, family members, or other animals who are usually together in the woods.  This is my question: Does it make sense to assume that a significant decrease in their natural habitat would drive more bears into a busy city than would otherwise be there? Is there a causal relationship in this type of situation? Learning about this will help me in my approach to conservation, both personally and politically. "
560,What happens to the bear after being pepper sprayed?,"If a bear kills a human, it is usually euthanized as in the case of a grizzly bear that partially ate a man in Yellowstone     It also seems likely to end sadly for the bears. Park officials have captured the sow believed to have killed Crosby along with one of her two cubs. If DNA evidence matches her to the killing, she will be euthanized and her cubs offered to a rehabilitation center or zoo.   Source  However, in the situation that a person had to use their can of bear spray on a bear and it worked as intended with no injuries to the person, what actions would authorities take regarding the bear (if any)?  "
561,Can forest fires cause a drought?,"Everyone knows that fires are a big concern during droughts, but can they also cause a drought elsewhere? I currently live just on the East side of the Canadian Rockies. All summer long fires have been burning in British Columbia and in Montana, and we've been down wind catching all of the smoke. We have not had a single significant day of rainfall all summer long. It rained a little only once overnight a few weeks back from what I can recall.   My best guess is that the smoke and heat from the fires is somehow drying out the air before it reaches the continental divide, preventing any kind of rain fall.   Can forest fires cause droughts significant distances downwind? If so, how?  "
562,"What insect makes this hissing type sound, especially in the summer?","During the summer, I always hear this sound.    It's like a long ""hissing"" sound.  I assume that it is some sort of insect that produces this, and it's usually during warmer days.  It can be heard all day long, but I don't think at night I've ever heard it.  What bug makes this sound? "
563,Is it legal to sail a personal-size boat in the ocean in Massachusetts during a thunderstorm?,"When I was younger, during the late 1960's and 1970's, my Dad had a personal-size sailboat, called the Sunfish.  He loved it because it was lightweight, easy to sail on his own, and had room to include a few young children if we wanted to go with him. It was also easy to right by himself after capsizing, which we frequently did on purpose just for fun.   We used it regularly, on freshwater lakes and ponds throughout Massachusetts, where we lived. I would call him an accomplished solo sailor.   Each year during that same time period, we spent the month of August in Nantucket, an Island about 30 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. Almost every day we sailed throughout the ocean waters of the region. Some areas were calm, and others were quite choppy and rough.  One day while he was out in the Sound by himself, a thunderstorm, including lightning, arose. He wanted to wait it out, but the Coast Guard spotted him. They brought him in, impounded the boat, and he had to pay a fine to get it back. I don't know if there were actual written rules he didn't follow, or if the Coast Guard just considered him a danger to himself, or a reckless person, and reacted accordingly.   What are the current rules in 2017? Can a Sunfish be sailed during a thunderstorm in waters off the Massachusetts/Cape Cod region? Is a permit required? Are there separate rules because of its design or weight class, or are the rules the same regardless of the size or type of boat?   If this question is easier to answer without it being specific to Massachusetts, that's fine. I just didn't want to make it too broad, especially since rules may vary from state to state. Feel free to expand it to increase the amount of useful information for the community.  "
564,"Book about wolves raised by a man, his wife and a German Shepherd: familiar to anyone? Is basic premise plausible?","Several decades ago, I read a book written by a man who rescued and raised two wolf cubs whose mother had been killed. He was sure his wife would welcome the cubs, but he was apprehensive about the reaction of his large, male German Shepherd.  The dog took one sniff of the cubs, and adopted them, starting by licking them clean (they were filthy).   I don't remember how the man and his wife fed them; I think they had not been weaned.  The book focused on the pack that developed.  The man was the alpha male, his wife the alpha female.  The German Shepherd was initially the beta male.  As a juvenile or young adult, the male wolf challenged the man, who instantly and forcefully responded, and thus maintained his position as alpha male.  The male wolf and the German Shepherd worked out an arrangement where the GS was beta in the home territory, but when the pack (led by the man) went far afield, the male wolf was the beta.  The man trained the wolves to live on their own -- Born Free with wolves instead of lions -- and eventually the wolves, who had started to roam on their own, left and did not come back.  I don't know the title, I don't know the author (it wasn't Farley Mowatt or Barry Lopez or Jack London)), and I don't know where this happened, but my impression is the northwest US or Canada.  The book was presented as the true experiences of the author.  Does this go click with anyone?  Does the premise of the book - the artificial pack -- jibe with what has been observed about wolf and dog behavior and their relationship to humans?    "
565,Lowering other members of a party on belay after rappelling,"I, an experienced climber who knows how to rappel, would like to take some people on a scramble route that requires rappelling into a notch. The other people on the trip have standard top rope climbing experience (i.e. know how to tie in to their harness, and be lowered at the end of a top rope climb), but they do not know how to rappel.  My plan is to set up a rappel anchor, using one or more slings around a boulder and thread the rope through rappel rings, or more likely, quicklink carabiners.   The process to get down into the notch would be as follows:     Rappel to the bottom, and go off rappel   The other person would pull one end of the rope up and tie in to their harness   I would put them on belay and lower them down as if they had just a finished a top rope climb   Pull the rope through the anchor and continue on   Are there any special considerations for this method? How should I build the anchor knowing that the rope will be moving through it, possibly multiple times? "
566,Pros and cons of Tent vs bivvy bag,"Tent vs bivvy bag - different camping experience, protection from the elements, comfort and weight? What are the pros and cons of both? Is it even a valid comparison - e.g. is it viable to rely on multi-day camping if you only have a bivvy bag or on the contrary does it make it easier to find somewhere to sleep? "
567,Stability and ergonomics of Garmin Etrex 20,"I'm thinking of buying Garmin Etrex 20 (or 30) for geocaching purposes. I've read reviews in internet, and after that the issues with ergonomics and stability makes me worry, if that device will be good enough for geocaching.  I'm geocaching so, that I load caches for large region, but I don't plan exactly which caches will I search. Therefore, it's important for me to be able to relatively quick view the descriptions of the nearby caches. On Android, opening single cache and navigating to spoiler text + short description takes about 15 seconds. How much would it take on Etrex, where no touch screen is available? About a minute or more?  Many people in reviews in Amazon site complain about software unstability - the upgrades that breaks more things than repair, or cause the internal memory to be overfilled etc. Is the software for that device stable yet? "
568,What to do at the top of a sport climb,"I dabble a little at leading trad, but have never led a sport route.   If I do a sport lead, I want to make sure I don't make some stupid mistake when I get to the top. For example, I don't want to drop the rope or miscommunicate what I'm doing to my belayer. Suppose I get to the top of a sport route where I'm still on a vertical wall. There is a redundant bolted anchor, and I want to get on that anchor, be lowered, and end up with a top-rope setup.   Can anyone lay out all the typical steps, including knots and verbal signals?   What should have on my belt besides quickdraws? A sling and locking biner?   What etiquette issues are there?   What common problems arise (e.g., not being able to complete the climb), and how do you deal with them? "
569,How to pull one's partner from a crack/crevasse when skiing?,"We are going to descend some snow-covered glacier on skis while roped-up. If my partner falls into a crack, and I stopped him (i.e. didn't get dragged down there), what should we do next?   Assuming he is hanging in space and wants to get out by himself, what should I do to provide a reliable anchor point for him? Just brace myself as hard as possible? Assuming he can drill some ice-screws and unload the rope, what should I do now to make a good anchor? Just dig the snow to get to the ice below, and get some ice-screws there, or maybe invent some setup with skis secured in snow? Is it realistic to expect a good outcome if we don't have any other help (just the two of us)?   We have some basic gear (ice-axe, ice-screws, 50 m of rope, pulleys, karabiners, crampons); is there some specific piece of equipment that is worth having in this situation? "
570,Replacing rope/cord/tape/slings on protection gear,"We all know that due to age-related deterioration, ropes, harnesses, slings and other ""software"" should be replaced after a certain period even if thay have not been damaged or been involved in high fall factor falls.  But what about the ropes, slings, tapes or cords attached directly to nuts, cams and other protection gear?  Even of they appear undamaged, should they also be replaced after a certain period? If they should, then how long should that period be? "
571,Taking only the part that I need from OSM to my Garmin,"I'm just buying my Garmin and I'm looking for maps for geocaching. I'd like to select Bavaria, or a part of it. Under the link: User: Computerteddy (Wiki).  I've found the map for the whole Germany, over 1GB, too big and surely I don't need so much now. But I've found information about programs, that can be used to divide that maps: OSM Welt-Landkarte in MapSource.   I've tried first with the GMapTool, but I've been stuck with the list of files, and no clue what is in them and which region do they represent:    I've tried also MapsetToolkit, described in details in linked site, but the index file (teddy.typ) is not available, and I've failed to process the source .img files (the program crashed each time I've tried to do that).  Are there any Open Maps with smaller granularity, for example only Bavaria, Germany, only Masovia, Poland? Or some tools that can cut the map region based on coordinates, and don't crash doing that? "
572,Advantages of types of sleeping bags over another,"I have never used a Mummy type sleeping bag, rather I have hardly used a sleeping bag. I am afraid, I am more of a carry-mat, sleeping-pad and a blanket guy.  It never occurred to my mind that What must be the advantage of a Mummy type sleeping bag over a Blanket type? over even vice-versa if it is so? "
573,Improving sport climbing skills,"I recently made a sport climbing course mainly to give it a try and also to learn something about belaying in general. It's fun, challenging and I got hooked quite a bit. Overall I was around 10 times in the climbing gym yet.  I want to get better of course. I am 1,84m and thin, indeed my arms/hands/fingers aren't very strong yet...   What would you suggest to improve my sport climbing skills?   I recently read the suggestion that one shouldn't do strength training unless one is able to climb UIAA 7 just because it's better (and faster if you want to improve the difficulties) to learn climbing technique first. If so, would it be best just to climb, climb and climb? "
574,Hardshell vs. Softshell jackets,Nowadays not only outdoor enthusiasts hear those terms when they are searching a jacket which fits their requirements most. Literally everywhere in cities you can find jackets (often with membranes) that can be grouped into Hardshells and Softshells.  But what are the major differences in terms of:   water proofness wind proofness breathability durability ... ?   Is there even a distinctive definition of those terms? 
575,"Color vision deficiency a dead end for mountaineering career, as an athlete?","Is having color vision deficiency a problem for mountaineering ? Can one so, pursue mountaineering as a career ? Do professional mountaineering schools and expeditions accept climbers with color vision problem for high altitude (7000ers or 8000ers) climbing, as sponsored athletes ? To clarify, as per the free online tests underwent as of now, it is moderate-to-strong Proton color vision defect, Red color blindness (Protonopia). Also my sibling is having it (genetic). "
576,Hiking boot help,"A couple of friends and I are going on a road trip this summer, and we're planning on hiking the Grand Canyon, Half Dome, Observation Point at Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Longs Peak. I've been trying to find a pair of boots for this juggernaut and I've been out of luck so far- at least, I've made it hard on myself in my pursuit.  For starters, I have a small foot. I'm a tall guy, six feet, but my feet are 9s in most shoes. My foot is narrow, too, and definitely low-volume. That probably has something to do with my dilema.  I picked up the North Face Storm Mid, and it was nice. I liked it. Felt right on my foot, except when I tried to crank it down to lock my ankle in- it was too short. My toe hit the front on downhills. To tighten it enough to attempt to stop it meant my sole just felt... pinched. Hot. I can't really describe it, it was just uncomfotable, and it didn't help the toe knocking. So I went back to the store and went up a half size, and the slipping was gone. But, another problem arose; my ankle started lifting in the boot. Again, trying to lock it in meant pain for my sole, so I decided to take those back too. This time, I got the Teva Raith mid, and as soon as I got home I realized I made a mistake. The ankle slipped worse, something I had noticed in the store but tried to tighten to mitigate. The tightness required to keep the ankle semi-solid was painful, again, and the boot just doesn't feel right on my foot. The last isn't the right shape for me. So I'm taking those back, too.  What do I do?  The store I've been going to has a no questions asked return policy, so I've been lucky in that regard. However they only have four makes of boots- Teva Raiths, Keens of some sort (I didn't try them, they're apparently very wide inside), North Face Storms, and a Salomon that was nice but had a little heel slip and was kind of wide in the toes.  Should I take back my boots for store credit, use that on something else, and head to another outfitter? One south of me has a slightly wider selection.  Should I go back to the Storm (which I liked, it was a nice fit- or so I thought) and try new ankle lacing techniques? I read about some that reduced the pain in my Tevas and helped the heel problem a little, they may be of help. Would an insole help with heel lift? Is the general sole soreness an artifact of tightness or a misfit boot? I've never had hiking boots before, so I'm not sure what to expect totally.  I don't want to seem like a Goldilocks of shoes, but I figure that whatever I settle on should be semi-comfortable given the use they'll see.  TL;DR   I can't find a boot that fits and this may be my fault. Should I go back to the TNF Storm, which fit but had heel lift, and use an insole/lacing techniques? Is general the general footbed pain I had from the Storm caused by overtighness or a sign that the boot just isn't right?  "
577,What options are available for hunting feral boar on Hawaii?,"I posted this on travel.stackexchange.com originally, but it was recommended that I post here as well. Let me know if the question is off-topic and I'll remove it.  I am visiting Kauai shortly and am interested in boar hunting while there. So far I have applied for my Hunter's Education Exemption and have mapped several locations that allow for bow hunting.  While researching, I came across a blog post that mentioned the writer simply asked an employee of the hotel he was staying at and was put in touch with a group who invited him to go with them. Is something like this a common occurrence? I do not wish to hunt alone as I am unfamiliar with the territory, but I also do not wish to spend a great deal of money on the hunting ""tours"" that are provided by local businesses.  Also, I have had little luck finding a place to process the animal should I be successful while hunting on the island. I would prefer to have the animal processed there as it will cut down on the cost of shipping back to my home state. Does anyone have any experience with game processing on the island of Kauai?  Are there any other cultural/logistic considerations I should be aware of? Thanks! "
578,How frequent are polar bears inland in the Mealy Mountains and English Mountains in Labrador?,"I am considering a trek in August/September in the Mealy Mountains and English Mountains in Labrador (Canada's newest National Park; for info see 1, 2, 3).  However, I am worried by the prospect of polar bears, so I wonder how frequent they are.  I have two data points:   Gros Morne National Park, almost 500 km south of the Mealy Mountains, rates polar bears there as accidental visitors (Occasional visitor, no permanent population). Torngat Mountain National Park, roughly 600 km north of the Mealy Mountains, writes on their website: Visitors travelling and camping in the park are in polar bear country and are at high risk of encounters. Polar bears are almost always present along the north Labrador coast.   Where do the Mealy Mountains fit in during the ice-free season (August/September)?  Are polar bears occasional visitors like in Gros Morne National Park, where it's arguably safe to hike without worrying about polar bears?  Or are they closer to being permanently present, and is hiking alone without a guide very dangerous? "
579,Rappelling with an injured arm,"Is there a specific method which would help one with an injured (say, broken) arm to rappel down a rock?  It is very much possible that one may hurt his / her arm for some or the other stupid / major mistakes, and then need to get down one his / her own with having to rappel down a rock.  What are the do's and dont's of such a scenario? "
580,Where can I find visitor statistics for Canadian provincial and territorial parks?,"I'm currently planning my autumn (August/September) trek somewhere in Canadian mountains.  Canada is vast and there are many very spectacular places, but some are very popular; for example, Jasper National Park gets some 2 million visitors per year, and even backcountry camping is limited to campsites and need reservations.  This means there is neither solitude nor flexibility, so I will look for a less popular location.  I've been considering Kluane national park, Mealy mountains national park, Tatsenshini-Alsek provincial park, Northern Rocky Mountains provincial park, Tombstone territorial park, and others.  I suspect the number of visitors for those parks ranges from less than a hundred to hundreds of thousands per year, but I'm only guessing.  When off-trail hiking is possible and permitted, the probability of solitude naturally increases dramatically.    For U.S. national parks, visitor statistics are available online.  For Canadian national parks too.  Total visits for BC provincial parks top 20 million.  But is there anywhere where per-park visitors for provincial and territorial parks in Canada are estimated? "
581,When (if ever) do backcountry campsites in the major Canadian national parks in the Rocky Mountains grow quiet?,"The Canadian national parks in the Rocky Mountains are very popular (and for good reasons).  Banff National Park had 3.3 million visitors in 2012-2013, and Jasper National Park had almost 2 million (Source).  Although only a fraction of those visit backcountry campsites, a fraction of >5 million is still a very large number, and therefore reservations are required.  Those statistics are not specified by season.  I suspect that visitors are highly concentrated in the summer.  I enjoy backcountry hiking, but I seek solitude.  As I don't mind cold or waking up with half a decimetre of fresh snow, one alternative could be to go very late in the season.  How late in the season, if ever, do backcountry campsites in Banff, Jasper, Kootenay, and Yoho national park, and the adjecent provincial parks, grow  quiet?  By quiet, I mean an expectation value of less than one tent per backcountry campsite, or, in other words, that I would have a 50% chance to be alone at any given backcountry campsite.  Does this happen within the season that hiking (as opposed to skiing or snowshoeing) is possible at all? "
582,Can I camp in the backcountry outside backcountry campsites in Jasper National Park?,"In Jasper National Park, when I am hiking on trails, must I camp on designated backcountry campsites, or can I camp anywhere I want?  According to this forum post on tripadvisor:     Yes, random camping along established trails is frowned upon and park regulations are enforced by wardens on patrol - on foot, on horseback, and by helicopter.   That's neither clear nor authoritative.  What are the rules that apply here? "
583,Trekking poles: what are the pros and cons of Anti-shock vs standard designs?,"This is not a shopping question just to preface that issue. I'm not looking for a specific brand or model of trekking pole. Also to add some background information, I have borrowed trekking poles once, but do not own any. They are a rather new thing for me to consider as I've been a bit stubbornly (and maybe irrationally) opposed to them until I began to have knee pain as I grow older.  There are several trekking pole manufacturers, and they all seem to have a myriad of options and models. One of those major categories is the Anti-Shock, (hereafter known as ""AS""), or shock-absorbing models. These poles use different methods to reduce the amount of force transferred to your hands and arms upon the poles' strike with the ground. Well, at least that's my understanding anyway. Standard poles do not have this mechanism.  So my question is what are the pros &amp; cons of each: AS versus Standard trekking poles?  Just a few of the the things I'm wondering about as a jumping off point:   Effectiveness of the AS mechanism. Does it really make that much of a difference over non-AS poles? Weight differences between AS and standard: noticeable or negligible? Reliability: is one type more reliable than the other? Or are they about the same? Are all AS designs roughly the same or are some better (more effective or more reliable) than others? Are there specific occasions when AS is a definite advantage/disadvantage when hiking?   There are a nearly overwhelming number of trekking pole reviews out there so to help direct this question, I'm really looking for answers from those who have owned or used both types of poles thus having their experiences with them informing those answers.  Any possible studies out there would also be welcome information. "
584,How to deal with aggressive homeless when exploring urbex?,"It's a geocacher's nightmare, when you do a nice urbex cache, and then, when leaving, find the entrance blocked by angry homeless, that seem to live there and are not happy from unexpected visitor (which isn't surprising).  How to deal such situations, to avoid the confrontation, which could end poorly, or loosing your wallet, which also isn't a dream situation? Are there any tricks to lighten the atmosphere, for example offering cigarettes? "
585,Gloves for alpine tours in summer,"I own Haglöfs Grepp Glove which are quite thin but have a Windstopper membrane. I like those gloves because they offer great grip. But I am also a bit confused because I got really cold fingers on my bicycle during the winter with approx. 30 km/h speed. It wasn't that cold (0°C/32°F) so I wouldn't get frosty fingers with those gloves without the wind, especially when I am making sports. Is the membrane not working like I expected? It is said to be 100% windproof, so wind-chill shoudn't be the major issue. Is this just marketing or is it the unfortunate exposure of the finger tips while cycling?  That all being said I am searching gloves for mountaineering. I am not explicitly planning to do winter tours. I was thinking in getting a second, thicker pair to wear over the thinner one. I don't know if this might be a good choice. I have to clip carabiner, use ropes and (un)tie knots. I will grab in the snow, it could be raining the whole day and there might be quite strong wind - and not just 30 km/h...  All those thoughts make me doubtful although I am not expecting really cold temperatures at all. So which system is recommended to protect the hands, if most important requirements are those for typical glacier/alpine tours:   water- and windproof good grip layering?!   Taking a pair waterproof gloves of construction workers besides the Softshells could be a solution? Or even add very thin liners or mittens? "
586,Urbex question: How to protect myself from asbestos?,During some Urbex explorations sometimes I'll encounter a building with an asbestos warning. Is there any way that I can safely explore these buildings? Would Just something like a surgical mask and some gloves be enough or can I not go into these places without a hazmat suit?  Thank you very much. 
587,Where is it possible to use a hammock in the UK?,"I have a hennessy hammock which is great, but so far I have always taken my tent along too... as it is rare that campsites have trees the correct distance apart, or let you pick a pitch with the few trees on the site.  Is there a list of campsites that cater for hammock use?  Also I would like to do some wild camping, but a pretty strong factor in English wild lands is a lack of trees! Is there a resource that lists good areas to try? "
588,"Do ""R"" values add proportionally?",For winter camping it is recommended to use a sleeping pad with an R value greater than 5.    Can you alternatively use two closed cell 2.5R pads one on top of each other?   If using an inflatable pad with an R value of 5 and a closed cell with an R value of 2.5 will you effectively have a 7.5R value set up? 
589,Where to buy ethanol in Canada?,"I have recently moved from Sweden to Canada.  In Sweden, I always bought ethanol for my trangia ethanol stove at petrol stations.  Where can I buy such ethanol in Canada?  Is it sold at petrol stations, or will I need to visit more speciality stores?  What is the colloquial name? "
590,Group Trips: 1 Large cook group or smaller cook groups of 3 or 4?,"On trips I lead, we always split up into smaller cook groups, yet I did have one occasion a long time ago where we cooked as one large cook group. Long enough that I don't remember if it worked well or not. (I don't think that it did, but we also could have done something wrong.)  On extended trips into the wilderness, whether it be backpacking, kayak trips, etc, what are the advantages of cooking together as one entire group? Conversely, what about the advantages of splitting up into smaller cook groups? Would the type of trip, and environment be a factor in the advantages?  Let's say we have a group size of 9 people, and the trip is 10 days, no resupplies, and it is a temperate, forested environment. "
591,Buying Campingaz in Eastern Europe,"My boyfriend and I are currently a month into a 3-4 month trip in Europe and are finding it quite challenging to find suitable gas refills for our van. The gas runs both the cooktop and the fridge.   We have a Campingaz R907 cylinder and are out of gas in Poland, en route to Romania, Bulgaria and Montenegro where we plan to spend most of the next 2 months. We will pass through the eastern parts of Slovakia and Hungary today/tomorrow.   We were under the impression that Campingaz was easily available throughout Europe, but that doesn’t seem to be in case in any of the countries we plan to be in in the immediate future. We are wondering what our options are as  Is it possible to:    buy a different brand of gas cylinder that will fit the regulator we have (15mm screw in)? change the regulator to one that is going to be more conducive to the gas cylinders that are available in the countries we are heading to? If this is possible, can we do this ourselves? Can anyone suggest names of stores from which we could buy the required equipment please?   "
592,Has extended exposure to sunlight and UV in the arctic or antarctic ever caused someone's eyes to change color?,"In Biology SE I have just asked Could being exposed to excess UV in the arctic lead to a human eye color change? If so, what is the mechanism? but comments there questioned weather Arctic hiker Robert Swan's eyes did actually change color due to exposure to UV.  Even 32 years ago people spending all day in brightly lit snowy areas did usually use eye protection of some kind, if not for UV at least to reduce the brightness of all the reflected sunlight.  I'd like to double check here; does this in fact happen? Has someone's eye color actually changed due to exposure to excessive UV in sunlight, especially because of the ozone holes at the poles?  Also, if there's a source specifically about Robert Swan's hike and eyes 32 years ago, that would be great!  Original source: Expedition Antarctica: A father and son's journey to save the planet.    above: ""This winter, Barney and Robert Swan became the first explorers to ever trek to the South Pole surviving exclusively off of renewable energy."" Robert (the elder) is on the right. From here. Credit: SHELL-Technical Partners "
593,Neoprene as a base layer for winter activities?,"How does neoprene perform as a base layer for winter sports?  Is it a way to be warm while remaining sweaty, as opposed to wicking sweat away?  What are its disadvantages?  What are best practices for how to use it as a layer?    By neoprene I mean typical neoprene wetsuit material (foamed neoprene, closed cell, typically with a fabric backing, typically 2mm to 8mm in thickness) assuming it will be covered with a wind-blocking shell and probably other insulating layers.    By winter I’m personally most interested in the 0F to 32F (-20C to 0C) range   I’ve used it winter kayaking a couple of times (a 2mm sleeveless “farmer John” wetsuit in conjunction with fleece layers and a goretex drysuit) when I didn’t believe I could manage layering just right to avoid sweat.  It worked better than sweaty wool or fleece, and generally seemed like a decent option.  But I have limited total experience (a few trips of a couple hours’ length).  Curious what experience other people have had.   "
594,What constitutes mountain exposure when hiking or scrambling?,"In this question, I focus on the fall exposure component. While I understand the perception of danger will vary from person to person, I'm having trouble characterizing mountain exposure. I can see where when you reach YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) 3rd class, it's evident that overall steepness usually makes the path exposed in some way, but at 1st and 2nd class ratings, how do we define exposure? I'll be asking a few questions here but they all aim to aggregate the attributes of a hike or scramble that would make it exposed.   Is the mere presence of a drop-off on one side enough to consider that particular section exposed even if walking on mostly level ground? Does the footing have any impact, like loose scree on a long steep talus (let's say over 35°)? How long or steep does a slope have to be to become exposed? I have Greg Slayden's Mt. Columbia trip report in mind where he mentions the constant steepness being overwhelming. Is a narrow path traversing a slope that ends further below at a drop-off considered exposed?   This question is inspired by my recent experience with Alan Kane's Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies guide. It seemed to me that what constituted exposure was strangely defined or that I didn't understand the concept. For example, I found the slabby ridge up the classic Mt. Rundle quite exposed at its narrowest point (and that's at the most a 2nd class hike), but didn't find the 3rd class moves up Mt. Temple to be that dramatically exposed. "
595,How stuffed is a sleeping bag stuffed in its recommended stuff sack size?,"Sleeping bags often have a recommended stuff sack size given either in dimensions or volume i.e. 6 x 11 inches or 5 liters.  Is the recommended size for how small it can get for backpacking or is it more the size of what one could store the bag in?  To put it another way, does the recommended stuff sack size fall on the more or less stuffed end of the spectrum? "
596,Why is it undesirable for the New Forest to convert to a mature forest?,"The source, Commoners of the New Forest referenced by @Liam in his answer to the question How do you become a New Forester Commoner? implies that for the New Forest to become a mature forest would be a bad thing.     It is vital that the tradition of commoning is maintained, as without   the [grazing] stock, the forest would soon become a very different   place. The ponies and cattle are the ‘architects’ of the land, feeding   on the gorse and brambles that would otherwise become overgrown.      Without this grazing, the scrub would develop into mature forest,   reducing the ecological value of the area and affecting the   recreational activities visitors enjoy across the forest today.   I understand why it is beneficial to keep brambles in check, and although I have never encountered gorse, it sounds unpleasant to walk through.    But what do the authors of this article mean when they say a mature forest would reduce the ecological value of the area and affect (presumably reduce) the recreational value of the land?  Although I am not religious, religious is the only word I can find to describe the experience of hiking through a mature forest. "
597,"If you are canoeing on a lake when whitecaps start happening, what is the best direction to get off the lake?","If you are canoeing on a lake and the wind suddenly starts blowing to the point where there are whitecaps, what is the best direction to head to get off the lake?  Would it be the shortest way back to the shore or would one take the direction of the wind into account? "
598,"If you are kayaking on a lake when whitecaps start happening, what is the best direction to get off the lake?","I am stealing Charlie Brumbaugh's question about canoeing on an open lake, because for kayaking you would get different anwers, and it's important to distinguish those.     If you are kayaking on a lake and the wind suddenly starts blowing to the point where there are whitecaps, what is the best direction to head to get off the lake?      Would it be the shortest way back to the shore or would one take the direction of the wind into account?   Assume a one-person kayak with the cockpit covered. "
599,Hypothermia risk from deflated sleeping pad,"The inflatable sleeping pad I bought last year is leaking air and I'm debating the wisdom of taking a replacement to Alaska in September. When working, it's more comfortable than a foam pad. But I worry it will provide no insulation when deflated. I have also never used a camping air mattress below 50 Fahrenheit.  Is there a risk of hypothermia from a leaked inflatable pad?  When working properly, do inflatable mattresses provide sufficient insulation for cool / cold temperatures? "
600,Is drinking water containing dirt harmful?,"I noticed that if I collect water from a stream dense of small debris/thin mud, if I keep the water bottle close to the surface, while it takes a longer time to fill the bottle, the water is cleaner there.  In that occasion, the water was not that muddy, but it was muddy enough not to look clear - it had a very light brownish colour - and to taste ""groundy"" as well, despite my care in collecting it on the top of the small stream (which made a difference).  I boiled it; for quite some time (one good minute of hard boiling), so I assume it was very safe from a bacteriological point of view.  I am wondering though: there may be any health dangers caused by drinking all that tiny debris?  And, unhealthy or safe, it still tasted bad. Are there any - possibly simple and lightweight - ways to filter that?  Like, may a coffee filter help? Or, what could/should be used, assuming that the water contains no dangerous chemicals and that the biological dangers are removed by boiling?  Please notice that this is not a generic question about water purification but it's very specific to debris and to lightweight backpacking. "

602,Which is the best clothing in extreme heat?,"If you are in a survival situation in extreme heat (i. e. in the desert), which is the best clothing and footwear to use? It's better to cover yourself up entirely, like the tuaregs, or to go about stark naked, like the Aboriginal australians?  Some questions I've read are related, but not the same. In particular, I don't need plausible answers. I would like correct answers. Bibliography of experimental studies would be the best option. "
603,Running in bear country,"I am an avid runner. I will be visiting British Columbia for the first time, soon. My trip will include a few weeks in the Rocky Mountains (Glacier, Banff, Yoho) and north of the Sushwap Lake. At least the former regions are ""bear country"". While I have looked up recommendations about hiking in bear habitats and about possible bear encounters (also on this site), I am unsure what they imply about going for a run for an hour or two.  Where do people in these or any other bear-populated regions run? Which precautions do they observe, if any?  I would love to explore the natural surroundings in my running shoes, but as a second best, I would contend myself with saver but less interesting routes. "
604,Waterproofing leaking canvas on a pop-up camper,"We have a pop-up camper that has seen better days.  Last summer the canvas covering the bed ends began to leak in a few critical places, and we are looking for a solution that stops short of buying all new canvas.  I am thinking about purchasing a spray-on waterproofing product like Aqua Armor but don't have any experience with this kind of product and would appreciate suggestions.  In particular, I would like to know:        Does anybody have experience waterproofing the canvas on a pop-up camper?   Aqua Armor advertises a product with the phrase ""for Tent &amp; Gear"" in its name, and another with the phrase ""for Natural Fabrics"" in its name.  Which would make more sense to use for this purpose?  The ""Natural Fabrics"" one is advertised as being non-solvent based, which is appealing (we are going to be sleeping underneath that fabric and would prefer not to breathe in solvent fumes) but I also want something that will be very effective at keeping out the rain.        If anybody can recommend something better to do, I would also appreciate that. "
605,Little or lesser-known multi-day hike routes,"I have just finished part of this [website]EDIT: Following on from the first few comments below, I'm not looking for loads of information or a trip report or anything, just a lead, a place name, or a link to a map, etc. :) "
606,How to attach a shackle to vertical square tubes by using a rope?,"I want to hang up a hammock. There are vertical square tubes made of galvanized steel of 10cm x 10cm. I want to hang up my hammock by using ropes (polyester, ⌀6mm, 9500N) and shackles. The rope should remain attached to the square tubes. The shackles are for fast and easy mounting and dismounting of the hammock. I also bought some thimbles.   What is the best knot or method to attach the rope to the square tubes. With:   Preferably highest knot strength. No slipping down of the rope, since the square tubes are vertical. The square tubes must not be modified. No drilling, etc.  What is the best knot or method to attach the Rope to the shackle?   Using a thimble? Using a rope loop instead of a rope ending to increase the holding force? If yes: How to mount the thimble to the rope loop?    I am generally able to hang up the hammock. What I am asking and interested in is what would be the best knot or method to do so. Taking into account knot strengths and other factors about knots and ropes I have no clue about. "
607,When should you remove old pitons?,"We were up above the treeline below the final climb to a scarcely visited cave and discovered an old rusty piton with a length of weathered webbing tied to it. It was obviously there as a safety for a belay, but it easily came out of the rock when I tested it.  At what point should you remove old pitons? Should you clean your own pitons while cleaning the rest of you gear? Is it even wise to use pitons that you find in the rock? "
608,Why do seagulls circle around at high altitudes?,"I was recently at a music festival in a field here in the UK. It was a nice hot day and I was staring up into the lovely blue sky. I noticed there were high numbers of seagulls circling above, seemingly riding thermals to a great height (they quickly became speks in the sky).  I started wondering, what are they up to? I couldn't make sense of it.   If they were riding the thermals as a mode of transport, they didn't appear to be going anywhere (just round and round in circles).   It didn't make sense that they were doing it to spot food either (that I thought). There was plenty of food about, but none of them appeared to be making any attempt to come down.   It almost appeared that they were simply riding the thermals for fun.  So why would these birds by seemingly riding thermals for no reason?  "
609,How do I get mold off my sandals?,"I took my sandals out of storage in the basement today because it's two-hobbits-just-threw-a-ring-into-my-room kind of hot in here and outside, too.  The problem is that they have mold on them. How do I get rid of the mold? I am trying to clean them by hand right now and am wondering if that's enough. After all the fungus is in the material.  Can I put them into a washing machine? What temperature in °C should I use?  They are Teva sandals, FI 2 was the model name if I remember correctly. "
610,Wild camping in the Brecon Beacons,"What is the legal and practical position on wild camping in England and Wales, specifically in the Brecon Beacons National Park. I think I am right in saying that technically you need to ask the landowners permission but how much of an issue is this in reality.  I am looking to pitch a single one man tent for a single night and then move on the next day to a new location. As long as I pitch away from the path and in an unobtrusive location, how likely am I to encounter any problems? Does anyone have any experience of camping in this area and could give me some advice? Also what about camping in forested areas. I will be using a self-contained stove so fire isn't a risk but am I likely to run into any other problems? "
611,What level of UV protection is recommended for glacier travel?,"What level of UV protection is recommended for glacier travel? For example, I have sunglasses which says 40% UV layer. Will this be ok for glacier trekking, or do I need glasses with higher level of protection?  "
612,How can I know if a rope is certified? I found a hidden tag,"We (a uni student club, mostly hiking) own a rope that is practically unknown. We know that it's a year since it was bought (presumably new) and that it has hardly ever been used (no dead hangs, etc). It contains no rating tags/tape outside. We don't know the maker or how much it was bought. Superficially, it's a kernmantle that looks pretty legit.   We've been thinking about whether we should buy a new rope that we KNOW is legit. But because of funding, buying a new rope isn't top of the list. We'd rather determine for certain the legitimacy of the rope (whether legit or not) before making a move.  By luck, we found a strip of plastic hidden underneath the sheath that says ""LIFE SAFETY ROPE OF NFPA 1983. 2001 EDITION SET(?) CERTIFIED""     [website]Is this sufficient reason to conclude that the rope is indeed legitimate for aid/rescue use? Can it carry more than 2000 kg as specified by the NFPA 1983? "
613,Why bring a multitool on long treks?,"I have been trekking for years now, mostly in Scandinavia, Canada and Peru. For most of treks we had to be sustainable and carry food for 10-14 days at a time - so weight is always a big issue.  Obviously this requires very optimized equipment, and for this reason I never considered bringing a multitool (like a swisstool or leatherman): personally I just never saw the benefit of such a tool, as out in the wild I essentially never encountered situations that would call for pliers, screwdrivers, or any of the other sophisticated tools.  However, over the years I have seen plenty of people who absolutely swear by their multitools and bring them on every occasion, including long hikes or trekking trips.  I'd like to know of you:   Why do you bring your multitool on long trips? What kinds of purposes does it serve, which a normal knife can't?  "
614,Renting a boat for overnight in ocean?,"I want to rent a boat (not a pontoon, but one with a sleeping area, bathroom etc.) which I can use for an overnight stay in open ocean. I am an absolute beginner about boats and don't know anything besides that boats run on water.  The questions I have are:   What is that kind of boat called? Should I search for yachts, power boats, resident boats? What are some places I can rent it from? I'm based in Delaware, so DE beaches and the coastal areas of NJ, MD are easily accessible. What sort of training would I require? Driving the boat is for sure a required skill, but the rental place will certainly provide that training. In addition, do I require any based medical training like CPR etc.? I know how to respond to simple issues like taking care of small wounds, burns, insect bites etc. How far in open waters can I go before I'll get into international waters? I don't want to leave the US territory. Will there be some indication or coastal guards to help or assist if I get too close to leave US waters? Is it safe? Pirates are still there, aren't they? I mean spending a night outside away from everything seems a bit ... frightening. How will I keep the boat from drifting when it is not moving? Are anchors still in use? What else should I be prepared for? For example: navigation equipment, another rescue boat?  "
615,Theft and tent camping,"I used to go tent-trailer camping as a kid ('60s and '70s, west coast US and Canada) and don't recall worrying about people going into our campground and stealing things. Now I'm thinking about getting back into camping (tent, not tent-trailer, and now in New England), and am worried that, if we pitch a tent, then go off to the beach or something, someone will steal our stuff.  Is that a reasonable concern? If so, is there something I can do to keep from getting ripped off? "
616,Do I need to worry about inadvertently signalling while using a space tarp?,"If I use a space tarp (basically a heavy duty reusable space blanket) as a sunshade or as a ground tarp with the shiny side facing up, do I need to worry that someone might see it and think that I am in trouble?  People often suggest that a space blanket could be used to signal for help, would a 5ft x 7ft reflective surface be taken as a distress signal? "
617,How does weather affect an altimeter watch?,"I really love wearing an altimeter watch while in the mountains. I know that it's affected by weather, but unfortunately I don't actually know how it is affected. This usually causes me to ignore the altitude readings entirely when the weather is unstable (and thus altimeter readings are inconsistent), rather than use what I have with some kind of mental/watch correction.  So, what types of weather patterns impact the altimeter reading?   To still estimate the altitude, can I do a mental re-calibration and/or what features of the watch could I use to mitigate any changes due to weather patterns? "
618,Canoeing in a thunderstorm,"What are your chances of getting struck by lightning in a canoe? I've done a lot of canoeing on stormy lakes before, but when the thunder comes what is the real risk of getting struck by lighting?   My thinking is, if you're on a mountain lake surrounded by mountains, the lighting is much more likely to strike the mountainside than it is to strike the water; the size of the lake, and the elevation of the storm clouds would of course have to be factored into your risk assessment, but even if the lake was wide enough, and the storm low enough and out over the middle of the lake so the lightning would strike the water, is there a chance that the lightning will strike a person sitting in a kevlar canoe? Does the construction of the canoe make you more or less likely to be struck by lightning? Will striking the water be the path of least resistance?   How likely are you to be struck in a canoe and what should you do if caught in a thunderstorm? "
619,What to be aware of if lightning strikes close to me?,"Many questions (and answers) about lightning seem to focus on avoiding being hit directly by lightning but don't consider being close to where it hits the ground. Granted, it may be intentional (ie: keeping a narrow scope) but it got me thinking:  What do I have to be aware of if lightning strikes close to me?  And just how close is too close? Is there any real difference if it hits me or if it falls at an arm's length?  For example:   I once heard that if it falls really close (but doesn't hit me directly) I'd be deafened. Temporarily, unless there's serious damage to my ear. And I'd probably be disoriented (which could be a risk in itself). I read that electricity from lightning often travels through the ground's edges and bends (especially if wet); so one shouldn't be too close to a wall or cliff. Also, falling rocks could be an issue here.   I'm sure there are lots of things I should be aware of and not only the ones I mention. "
620,Is 8 miles of unpaved gravel road a lot for a old-ish consumer road car to take in normal weather?,"When going to Goose Lake, WA is there any worsened chance that the car will not be able to ""take"" ?   "
621,Legal situation to bowhunt in Hungary for foreigners,"As a foreigner from the EU, what prerequisites do I have to fulfill to hunt with a bow in Hungary?  Edit:   I'm asking for general rules like ""You need an accepted hunting licence. Most of the EU hunting licences - like the German 'Jagdschein' - are accepted."" and so on. I don't ask for specific hunting seasons like ""When and how am I able to go for deer?"".   "
622,Insect repellent alternative for mosquitos and ticks?,"DEET seems to be the main insect repellent that works for pretty much all of the bug world.  I just don't care for it, it feels weird, smells weird, and likes to melt stuff.  Most the alternatives seems targeted for just mosquitos, not ticks.  IR3535 seems to have some data on ticks (10 people, really?).  What is the best alternative that works for both mosquitos and ticks?  Is there any data out there to compare all the repellents? "
623,How can I tell if a wild animal has rabies?,"If I am in the wild and encounter an animal that I think might be rabid, how can I tell if it has rabies?  An animal that has been running hard, or any number of other things could cause it to be foaming at the mouth, but not neccissarily have rabies. Foaming at the mouth is the symptom I most often consider to be a sign of rabies.  The horse in this image, is foaming at the mouth a lot, but I seriously doubt it is rabid     Related   How should one properly dispose of a rabid animal carcass?  "
624,Are there wild camping rules in Scotland?,"I am planning a 7 day trip in Scotland. I am considering some possible cheap options for accommodation, and I have read wild camping is permitted. Are there any rules that need to be respected? Does it mean I can camp anywhere? "
625,How do I get started duck hunting?,"There's a huge list of things to start duck hunting.  Dogs, decoys, blinds, etc, and it's a chicken/egg problem.  How could I possibly know how to buy and train a dog, which decoys to buy, etc., without already knowing how and where to duck hunt?  What's a good way for a complete rookie to start duck hunting? "
626,What are the best ways to increase your draw weight?,"What exercises exist for increasing your strength in order to increase the amount of draw weight you can pull back on your bow? I was told just push-ups but, is there anything more that can be done? "
627,How can I hike across the Grand Canyon if I don't have a backcountry permit?,"I am going to try to hike across the Grand Canyon in May, from the South Rim to the North Rim, and back. Unfortunately, I have discovered that I am probably too late to secure a back-country permit for the week I plan to be there.   My original plan had been to camp at Bright Angel, then 2 nights at Cottonwood (whilst I hit the North Rim and then came back), then again at Bright Angel, and back to the South Rim.  My question is, what is my best option for still taking my hike?   Here are some ideas that occurred to me, but I'd like to hear from people who have done it if any of these are feasible:   Try to full cross the canyon, each way, in a single day, so as to not need it. (Is this really feasible? I'm fat, I'm 40, and I do want to see things along the way!) Pray hard that a permit is available when I show up. (I hear they reserve a percentage, but don't know how likely it is that I could secure one.) Set out even without a permit, and just find a discrete place, not in a campground, where park rangers won't look for a permit. (Dodgy in the truest sense of the term - but what happens if they do find me?) Just show up in the campground and take my chances without a permit.   On the bright side, I will be in the area from May 12 - May 22, but knowing how to plan would be helpful.  (Zion and Bryce both seem too close to pass up)    For future use, backcountry permits open up on the first of the month four months prior.  On February 1st, for example, all of June becomes open to reservation.  I'll save you the time of calculating - May opened up in January, and by February 24th, there was NOTHING in any campground in the corridor any time in all of May.  Phantom Ranch was fully booked (they open up 13 months in advance).  Moral of the story - April, May, and June are busy.  Make your reservations ASAP! "
628,"If you get a ""clean"" kill on a deer how long do you have to field dress?","If you are out and get a ""clean"" kill on a deer, meaning that you have hit only its vitals, how long do you have to field dress the deer?    Also, beyond that how long do you have to get that deer processed? Under the conditions that I am thinking the deer would just be at camp.  How long would you have with it there? "
629,How to treat shin splints while backpacking,"It's been a couple of years since I last had bad shin splits but I can still recall how painful they can be. I was able to heal them before mostly with a couple weeks rest.   If the pain came back when backpacking, a day or so away from transportation, what methods can be used to at least control the pain enough to get back to civilization without having to leave all my gear on the trail?  I prefer answers that do not include an additional person to carry weight since I often backpack alone. I also don't need answers on how to treat it once I am home.   Is there anything better than a couple of ice packs and aspirin? Obviously I would prefer the lightest solution to reduce pack weight and the chance of the shin splints in the first place. "
630,"Selecting backpacking cooking pot – teflon, aluminum, steel, titanium, or cast iron?","What are the relative advantages / dangers of different cooking wear? I'm a one-pot gourmet that has been using the same stainless steel pot for 15 years, but am considering an upgrade.  Some things I have heard but not substantiated: teflon flakes off and you might ingest it. Aluminum can leech into acidic foods. Titanium shatters in cold? Cast iron makes the best flap-jacks... "
631,Thinking about a road trip out West,"My wife and I are thinking of taking a road trip from northwest Ohio to ""out west"" - Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, etc. I've never been farther west than Indiana, so it's a whole new territory for me (my wife has when she was younger). We would both love to see Yellowstone and possibly the Grand Canyon &amp; Yosemite. We both enjoy camping and moderate hiking, so we would love to include this as much as possible on our trip. We would probably have a 2 week time period.  My questions are:   What supplies should we take? We've got the general camping stuff (tent, sleeping bags), as well as our vehicle, but what other things will help us do camping and moderate hiking &amp; sight seeing? Any ""emergency"" items that should be pretty common? On a trip like this, are you able to just pick a spot somewhere and plop down to camp for the night? Or would we be limited to staying in campgrounds? Any recommendations on where to go (outside of the 2 mentioned above)? Since this is new to me, I'm open for pretty much anything. Do you know of any good routes to take from Northwest Ohio? Initially looking at a map, I pictured us going to Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, then head north through Colorado, Utah and Montana, then back east. I'm not sure if this is a good way, however.  "
632,How often should I wax skis?,"I have a pair of skis, let's pretend I use them as much as I want to. How often should I wax them? Once a season? Every few ski days? Before or after every ski day? Both? Does it matter what kind of snow it is? If so, how does that factor in? "
633,Navigational gear worldwide,"Is there any difference in navigational equipment between the northern and southern hemisphere? We live in the northern hemisphere but will be emigrating to the southern in the next few weeks. We'll take our usual compasses and GPS units with us in our shipping, can we expect these to work and be accurate ?  Granted, the GPS usually shows us our position in Ordinance Survey grid reference and I'm assuming we'd need minutes/seconds, but otherwise it should work as it uses the same GPS satellite network, right?  Also, what about getting north from using the sun &amp; your analogue watch? I seem to remember that alters slightly in the southern half. "
634,What are the key features to look for in mobile device apps for hiking/camping?,"I've used one of the trail apps and was satisfied, but am looking for something better. What are the features I should focus on for selecting an app?  What bells and whistles are really useful on the trail?   "
635,Falling into an ice cold body of water,"I've never been hiking in such extreme situations, but if in the situation in the question, i.e. you're hiking in very cold weather and someone falls in (let's say so pretty much their whole body is under, and it's a lake not a river, so no current) what's the best course of action?  Specifically, how do you get them out safely without endangering yourself or others, and what do you do to minimise the risk of hypothermia and other related conditions when they're out? "
636,What's the UPF of a T-Shirt or jeans?,Many outdoor clothing items advertise themselves with a UPF (Ultraviolet protection factor) of 30 or even 50. How does that compare with a normal cotton T-Shirt or a pair of jeans? Do I have to use sunscreen even when using these clothes? Or is it all a marketing scam? 
637,What sleeping bags are needed for a northbound thru-hike of the AT,"If you were attempting a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail, starting roughly now (being mid to late March) and going northbound, how many sleeping bags and of what types would you need, assuming cost is not an option?  So a little background. I've talked to a number of people who have thru-hiked northbound on the AT, and have heard about the various sleeping conditions. Assuming a pace of about 5 months, would different bags be needed for March in GA, June in VA, August in VT, etc? Obviously I don't plan on carrying more than one bag at a time, but if need be bags could be mailed to spots on the trail at certain dates.  Minimizing weight is always #1 on the priority list, but staying warm up north in the later months would be #2. I've mostly lived in the VA region of the AT, so I am used to backpacking with a very lightweight sleeping bag in summer months.   Also, I'm hoping for this to be information given a usual year, not necessarily the spring going on right now in 2012. I am planning to thru-hike the AT in 2013. "
638,Am I likely to need multiple pairs of boots on the Appalachian Trail?,"Reading up on a hiking boot size question, I came across this review from Silver Spring, Maryland for a wide hiking boot.  This boot has a ""lifespan"" of 400 miles.  Is that typical of a hiking boot?  Since the Appalachian Trail (AT) is over 2,000 miles long, should I expect one or more pairs of boots to wear out and become unusable during the course of a through-hike?    Also, if my feet do change size over the course of the hike-- or if a pair of shoes does wear out-- how do I get a new, better-fitted pair while on the trail? "
639,The dangers of simul-rappelling,"To simul-rappel, the technique goes as follows:   Prepare to rappel as usual, passing the rope through bomber bolts; Tie knots on both ends of the rope; Attach your personal anchoring system (PAS) to your partner's PAS or belay loop (or remain tied to him in any other way); Set the gear to rappel from a single strand of the rope simultaneously with your partner, who's going to rappel from the other one; Weigh the rope and be absolutely sure neither you nor your partner has its weight placed on the PAS, but on the rope (standard procedure: never untie from something that's hard to untie from). In other words: make sure you're both tied to the rope and balanced only by your weights; Untie both PASes and rappel down singing a beautiful song, preferably in a sonorous language like Italian, Portuguese of Russian (German and Polish songs may cause accidents);   This method is faster than usual rappelling. Many people use it frequently, and even more people have used it at least once. I like using it a lot, and one of these days a friend came to me saying that another climber got freaked out after hearing he used simul-rappelling in a daily basis. According to this guy, simul-rappelling is more dangerous than rappeling.  This got me thinking: imagine the belay is bomber and your rope is trustworthy (if those are not matched, then rappelling won't be safe regardless of the method). Then why would simul-rappelling be more dangerous than rappelling? I can only think of one situation where this is true: the weight difference between the climbers is considerable plus they're not attach to each other (as when rappelling from opposed sides on a spire). Overall, this is easily solved by remaining attached to your partner - actually, sometimes going down is only possible if simul-rappeling (like when one of the climbers is so light that the rope won't run through the brake - this happens sometimes to children).  Does someone have a clear, precise reason for simul-rappelling to be more dangerous than rappelling? Since most climbing accidents happen during the rappel and many of them are due to the fact that one of the climbers didn't actually pass his/her rope through the breaking device, I'd say simul-rappelling is actually safer than standard rappelling, since both climbers need to be balanced on the rope (using their braking devices) before lowering themselves.   "
640,Is it harder to exhale while swimming in open water?,"I do laps at the pool quite often and when I do front crawl I breathe out with my face in the water.  I tried to do the same at a lake (it was quite warm actually but choppy conditions) but found it quite a bit harder to force air out of my mouth and nearly impossible to breathe out of my nose (which I prefer in the pool).  Is there anything about open water that would make this harder?  Or was it psychological?  I didn't notice myself feeling tense (I was close to shore) - but I wondered if small currents from the chop, relative to a pool made the difference? "
641,Where do white tigers live?,"We saw this magnificent white tiger in a wildlife rehabilitation center in the United States. I don't like seeing animals out of their natural habitat, but all of these animals were rescued from circuses or zoos, and are not able to be returned to the wild.   Usually these places have signs by the animal enclosures so we can learn about the animals, but I didn't see any information there.   This especially intrigued me because I don't think I've ever seen a white tiger before, even on television.   Where does this breed of tiger usually live? What are some other important facts about it?    "
642,"Want to climb highest mountains of most European country's, how and where to start?","As I am always looking for my next challenge I have decided that I want to reach the highest points in some of the European countries.  I am a pretty fit person and I went on some 3-4 day trips in the mountains of Italy and Austria.  I want to start in 2018 with this challenge, but what countries should I do first and where do I find the right information? I am having trouble of finding information of mountains like Olympus and Großglockner.  As I want to start as soon as possible with this in 2018, what mountains should I do first and what time of year can I start? Probably the mountains with the least snow first?  Some of the mountains I want to climb (not all in 2018 and not complete at all):   Olympus (Greece) Zugspitze (Germany) El Teide (Spain) Großglockner (Austria) Dufourspitze (Swiss) Mont Blanc (France)  "
643,Which knot to tie bulky objects together for transport,"I am looking for a knot that can be used to tie bulky objects together.  Usually I would use compression straps to tightly strap a tent to a bike handlebars, but I only have paracord at the moment.  I could use a square knot but I am afraid it would come loose with all the vibrations.  It looks like some kind of trucker's hitch would work, but I don't have a tension point I could use to keep it under tension?  What knots are good for this kind of situation? "
644,Assessing potential lead climbing partners for competence and safety,"I recently started lead climbing in the gym after taking a lead climbing class.  So far, I've only led with someone I know from the class who I watched lead belaying a number of times during the class.  However, at some point I will want to lead climb with others and will therefore need a way to assess their competence as lead partners before climbing with them.  My question is, what is a good way to do this?  I've read this question (Vetting belayers at the gym?), but I'm specifically asking about lead belay and it is obviously more complicated and the potential for a serious accident is greater.  I could make sure that they have their lead card and climb easy routes at first that I'd be very unlikely to fall on, but I wouldn't be able to see their belay technique since I'd be looking at the wall most of the time.  I know that some people only let others who they know belay them, but presumably you didn't know them at first, so this only seems like a realistic option for experienced climbers who already have several lead climbing partners.  I'm asking about how to find competent climbing partners in the first place.  How do you handle this situation?  If it matters, I plan on only leading indoors for a while until I gain more experience. "
645,Is belaying a lead more difficult than a top roped climber,"Assessing potential lead climbing partners for competence and safety asserts that a lead climb belay is more complicated and has higher potential for a serious accident over a top rope belay.     Is this the case?  Are top rope belays inherently simpler and  is the potential for a serious accident much lower than with a lead belay?  Further, in the context and risk of an entire climb, what part does the extra complexity (if any) of belaying a lead vs top roped climber play in the overall  safety of climbers?  Note: I am interested specifically in the risks of the belay and not the inherent risk of top roping vs lead climbing. As this is about comparison to top rope, it's reasonable to exclude multi-pitch considerations from answers.  "
646,Why do Old Town canoes have dramatically higher capacity than Osagian canoes?,"I've been thinking about buying a canoe for a little while now. Growing up my family had an aluminum canoe so I've been looking at aluminum canoes in addition to the plastic canoes commonly seen in sporting goods stores. Today while looking at the canoes it struck me that the Osagian 17' canoe has very similar dimensions to the Old Town Discovery 169, and Old Town Penobscot 174. Both Old Town canoes have a capacity nearly double the 780 lbs. capacity of the Osagian canoe. The major difference that I can see is the Discovery is 2 inches taller and the Penobscot is 1 inch taller than the Osagian. I would be inclined to attribute the extra capacity to the height difference but Penobscot has 100 lb more capacity than the Discovery even though it is 1 inch shorter. This means that length is a bigger factor than height for Old Town canoe capacity.  Additionally the shape of the boats seems similar from a top view. Not that a couple of pounds weight would equate to hundreds of pounds of additional capacity but the aluminum Osagian canoe is lighter than either of the Old Town canoes.  So why do the Old Town canoes have more carrying capacity? Is this just a meaningless marketing number so each company can claim whatever numbers they want?    I just found this Grumman aluminum canoe that has a very comparable capacity to the Osagian canoe. "
647,How to get started on canyoning?,"Since I saw one of the last EOFT-films I am really curious about trying canyoneering, but I can´t quite figure out how to get started. What would you suggest to try it? What would be the minimum of equipment needed for that?  Some background on me:   I am a student, so (expensive) guided tours are basically no choice. For the same reason I would like to spend little money on equipment - at least in the start, till I know more I don´t have any mountaineering or climbing experience - all I know (related to canyoning) is swimming I live in northern Germany  "
648,Any ideas about long-term camping in a 16x16 foot yurt?,"My husband and I will be retiring soon and will spend 5 months of the year in a bricks and mortar house.  The other 7 months, we'll be gypsying.  We don't want to deal with the complexities and expense (both initial and ongoing fuel costs) of an RV.  We DO want some space to stretch out.  We are long-time, avid tent campers and are thinking about doing our roadtrips in a camping yurt.  We'd stay no less than 2 weeks in each site and carry a small tent for overnight stops.  We plan to pull a small trailer with our gear.  Any thoughts?  (Have we completely lost our minds?) "
649,What routes in the Canadian Rockies have minimum group sizes (and where can I find about those)?,"I like to be alone in the wild.  I know it's not the wisest thing to do, but I do it anyway (and I'm not the only one).  Today I learned that some routes in Canadian national parks may enforce minimum group sizes.  What routes in the Canadian Rockies enforce minimum group sizes, and where can I find information on those?  I didn't find anything on the Jasper National Park website. "
650,Indoor vs. Outdoor sport climbing,"As I started indoor climbing this year I would like to know what distinguishes it from outdoor sport climbing, especially when you are lead climbing.  I know that there are huge differences in safety, like outdoors   there aren't always bolts available as belay points (like indoors) so we need to use the less safe cams/friends, nuts, ... bolts might be insecure stand isn't as stable so we should belay dynamically bigger falls because of less belay points   This list isn't complete.   What could you add to this list of safety concerns? Besides from safety, what are major differences between sport (indoor) climbing and rock (outdoor) climbing? Are the difficulties comparable to indoor scaling systems?   As for the last point I can think of tougher conditions outdoors (again safety issues or strong wind, wet rock, psychology aspects and so on) and pure length of the routes. Besides that, I guess an indoor UIAA 6 should be as tough as an outdoor UIAA 6.  Edit  You are right guys, the question was too broad when asked about comparing sport to trad climbing.  Edit2  Why do you still think, the question is too broad, comparing bolted indoor sport climbing to bolted outdoor sport climbing? "
651,Anti-theft tracking device: how to configure it to deal with the battery?,"I'm planning to buy this GPS Tracking device, to place it on my boat. I don't need to track my boat coordinates while sailing. I need to be alerted when my boat is stolen. Therefore, I need this device to inform me when the boat is moving and I'm not on board.  Battery life is extremely important for me, since I don't want to change battery every month or 2 months. On the website, they write that battery life is 4 months in ""Stand By"" mode, and ""2 months"" on average use. There is also a 6 months ""deep sleep"" mode which I'm not sure what it means. I tried to contact customer support but they didn't answer yet, therefore I try to give it a go here.  Scrolling through the functionalities on the website, I believe this device doesn't have a ""motion detection"" sensor, so the only way to detect movement is either with a ""Geofencing Perimeter"" or ""Speed Restrictions"". But I believe both functionality requires active gps tracking, right? Are they expensive functionalities in terms of battery? or not? "

653,Kayaking - 'Brand' ? and Plastic vs. Fiberglass?,"I'm a new Kayak enthusiast with limited molded plastic boat experience, in the midwest (Michigan). As a newbie that is desiring a ""Better than Average"" 12-14' unit I am considering the ""HURRICANE"" brand of Fiberglass Kayaks but it was not mentioned on several sites I visited that included lists of brands. Why is that? They appear to be high quality and well designed.   I plan to make the necessary 2 hour drive north for a day of testing them before I buy, but am a bit concerned by the absence of the brand. Can I please get a bit of advice on both the brand mentioned AND on general suggestions for an average sized man (6', 200#) who wants better performance than the cheap plastic units offer?  "
654,"Why is a ""Czech bed roll"" called this? History, uses?","This was actually something new I came across recently. A Czech bed roll.  I've never seen a set up like this before. I was also intrigued by the name.  Has anyone used one of these? Advantages/disadvantages?  Why are they called Czech bed rolls? Especially the Czech bit?  Edit  Yes, I know the example I tagged was Czech army surplus. I am more interested in the history/usage of these things. The post I came across this on refereed to this as a more generic title.  "
655,Some mobile helper for tree climbing?,"When I do geocaching, I meet sometimes caches on trees. Some of them can be climbed by me without equipment, but in some cases I miss some flexibility or height to reach them :)  Is there any mobile (by mobile, I mean, I can put it to regulary city rucksack I go with to job, and it doesn't fill in fully, like normal rope) device to help me climb such trees? Some kind of short rope that can be thrown when I miss 1 meter to the branch above me?   I know it won't be so secure as normal climbing equipment, but I don't have such and don't plan to wear such with me on long trekking trips or to work, and I'd like to do my geocaching anyway :)  An answer with a short tutorial how to relatively safely use such tool would be very welcomed!  Thanks! "
656,How to dry Gore-Tex boots in the field,"I'm thinking of switching from old and heavy army boots to modern trekking ones.   Trying to choose between Gore-Tex and leather with waterproof coating only, I can't get over a simple question -   What do you do when water gets inside your boot?   It happens quite often when you cross swampy grounds (50% of my hikes) and occasionally find your leg ankle deep in water - usually I just dry inner soles and boots (since my old ones don't care about heat) near the campfire, but it's not an option with modern boots (I've read a lot of sad stories about those who'd tried it) so, as I see it, the only way is to take 'em inside the tent or even a sleeping bag for a night. This won't make them dry, but, well, at least less wet and not ice-covered (if it happens during autumn or spring).   But I feel pretty unsure that it will work with membrane-protected boots. So, once again - how do dry your boots when they get wet and you're far away from home? "
657,Gloves for knuckle protection that can get wet but not necessarily waterproof,"I am looking to replace my NRS creeking gloves that I use for kayaking ""bony"" rivers and creeks where rock contact is a real possibility.  The problem that I have with them is that the seams are not done very well or neoprene is simply not conducive to hanging onto many seams so they tear easily.  Unfortunately, this seems to be the only glove on the market that is designed for this purpose.  I was thinking of perhaps goretex gloves that offer some degree of padding on the fingers and knuckles and don't really need to be waterproof as long as they resist tearing in wet conditions.  Their purpose is not to protect against the cold but against impact, so wetness is OK.  So I was thinking about perhaps dirt bike or mountain biking gloves of some kind.  Or perhaps some gloves that commercial fishermen use.  Any suggestions that would meet my needs? "
658,Why are unequalised anchors acceptable for fixed-point belay systems used while ice climbing?,"The Association of Canadian Mountain Guides demonstrate Fixed-Point belay systems in this video.   Fixed-point belay systems as demonstrated make no effort to equalise the loading on the two anchors, but the video also states several times that fixed-point anchors are only appropriate for solid gear: bolts or ice-screws.   Fixed-point belay systems don't follow SERENE (or ERNEST). Why is this?   When considering 'bomb-proof anchors' in rock (bollards, for example, that have significant ratings [upwards of 80kN]), using two anchors in this fashion might allow for more ideal placement of the belay point: directly on an anchor, rather than between two anchors. If a single anchor is extremely unlikely to fail, this seems reasonable; I'm happy belaying off a single bollard in our area.   What is different about ice climbing? Are ice-screws considered stronger than natural protection in traditional rock climbing?  What are the advantages of ignoring equalisation and creating fixed-point belay systems?  "
659,Learning to fall when leading: what is good fall technique?,"I'm learning to lead climbs, and I'm terrified of big falls. Part of this is learning to trust my gear placements, but a large portion is because I don't know how to fall - I've only taken small falls (while top-roping). This has an adverse effect on my climbing - I pump out very early while placing gear, and place too much, because being even a little above protection is very scary.   Is 'learning to fall' something that climbers do through practise or through on-the-job training, as it were?   This isn't something I've seen addressed much. Is there a 'good fall' technique for lead climbing? Are there things during the fall I should be doing?   How does one deliberately set about learning how to cope with big falls - higher fall factor than top-roping generally allows?  "
660,How precise is a pedometer for estimating on a backpacking trip?,"In practice, how precise is a pedometer for estimating your progress on a trail? For example, if I'm to hike 10 miles, how far should I expect to be from the 10 miles marker?  Is there data comparing pedometers accuracy with GPS? "
661,Recommendations for anchoring long rope swings,"Some questions about rope swings similar in size to the the corona arch swing which has an accompanying setup video.   Assuming you can avoid rope abrasion, do swings like this damage climbing ropes? Swing goes straight into a pendulum with no/limited free fall. The figure eights get very tight at the anchor. I've heard people say you should loosen them, retie them, or cut them away after several jumps. Any truth to this? We set up a prussic chord at the anchor. It attached just below the figure eight knot that secured the jump line. This kept the weight of the jump partially off the knots. Are there risks associated with this - eg. can prussics weaken a system like this, or cut the rope?   We also jumped onto a prussic (primary), with an atc below, with overhand knot below that. We clipped the bite from the overhand knot to our belay loop. We did this because we jumped with a backpack and had to rapel to the ground after the swing completed. Slightly clustered, but we wanted to easily rapel after the jump was completed. Any feedback on this setup?   [EDIT] Removed some slang "
662,Where have all the sandpipers gone?,"(long time passing).  I walk along Del Monte beach in Crow City, USA (Monterey, California) quite often.  For quite awhile, sandpipers were there in abundance - more than any other bird.  I haven't seen any in a couple of months.  Have they migrated away? Where?  According to this, sandpipers are ""year-round"" residents in my area (well, ""spotted"" sandpipers, anyway, I don't know what subspecies these are that are common to my area). "
663,Can deep wave action be partially predicted by lunar phases?,"Where I walk weekly (Del Monte Beach in Monterey, California), I beachcomb for shells, glass, and particularly stones. Most of what gets cast up is rather dull and uninteresting - gray and black rocks of no particular noteworthiness.  However, there are always at least some gemlike little rocks of various hues: yellow, green, white, orange, caramel and chocolate brown, reddish-brown, pale blue, etc. These are often well-worn and oval.  Every foray differs from the previous (quantity and ""quality"" of what gets thrown onto the strand by the relentless waves), yet certain stretches tend to have a consistent concentration of these gemlike stones.  I reckon quantity is determined by the strength of the tide, so full moon and new moon can be expected to produce a good harvest.  Storms would be another factor, obviously.  I assume when certain deposits are washed up, it's because the waves are ""digging deep"" in certain locations on the ocean floor where these types of stones tend to be concentrated.  So I can predict in a small way what portion of the beach will produce which type of stone; is it possible to predict with a greater certainty which area of the bay is going to get scooped out based on lunar phases and weather patterns?  Basically I'm wondering why certain spots on the ocean floor are ""reaped"" on one occasion but not on another. Is it such a complicated interplay that it can't possibly be predicted? "
664,What is the best way to manage Scottish midges?,I have seen some posts that mention midges and midge spray. I am wild camping in Scotland in August. Should I be worried about them? Is there anything else a part from midge spray I can use to keep them away? 
665,Extending a two bolt anchor with one sling?,"I took some kids out climbing last night at a small crag popular for top roping, but I wasn't too impressed with their choice of anchor placements, or lack of additional hardware considering their placement. On one of the routes, if you were to clip into the bolt hangers, you'd be unavoidably crossroading your carabiners.   I had a 120cm nylon sling on me, so my solution was to extend the anchor over the bulge of rock like so:    It seemed pretty SRENE to me, the only flaw was the potential for extension, but using a bulky nylon sling seemed to make extension less of an issue, when I unclipped one of my biners to test how it would extend, it simply didn't. The amount of friction generated from the nylon made it very difficult to pull through, I actually turned one of the hangers a bit while trying.  My question is, is this an appropriate method of extending an anchor? What would be a better method of extending an anchor such as this one?  The Crag:  "
666,How far does a nursing Eastern Gray squirrel travel from her nest?,"It's obvious by her belly that we have a nursing squirrel, probably an Eastern Gray, Sciurus carolinensis, in our yard in Massachusetts, USA. I assume her nest is in one of our large evergreens, not too far from the bird feeders, especially since she's now only eating at the feeders closest to those trees.   I know she nurses the babies for at least a month before they're big enough to leave the nest, and that the dad (actually, it's usually more than one dad) takes off after birth, so I wouldn't think she leaves them unattended for long.  I don't intend to go searching through my trees, as I would never purposely bother the nest or whatever may be in it. We only go back there to fill the bird feeders and bird baths, and to water our little backyard forest. I'm just curious as to approximately how far we may be from the nest.  Also, if we, or something else, gets too close, will she sound an alarm? If so, what does it sound like? An explanation is fine, but a link to a recording would be even more help. "
667,Slingshot resources,"As part of my everyday carry gear, I'm looking at including a slingshot for taking game birds whilst hiking.   However I've never used one, what should I be looking for in a catapult when purchasing? What kind of ammo will I need? Where can I find good tutorials for beginners? "
668,"Did I save, or prolong the death throes, of the tuna crabs?","Walking along the strand this morning in Monterey, I was confronted by hundreds (at least) of stranded (no pun intended) tuna crabs (I thought they were shrimp, but a visitor from San Diego told me they were tuna crabs, and had, as a result of El Nino, been washing ashore and dying down there).  Some were still ""alive and kicking"", but on their back. I gently turned them back over with my shoe, and they poked forward their antennae (term.?) and looked at me as if to say, ""What? Are you going to squarsh me now?""  They didn't immediately head back toward the ocean; was my turning them over as they were flailing about instrumental in saving some of their lives, or were they goners, and such efforts would ultimately end in futility?

669,What are the best practices to ensure survival of catch and release fish?,"I have seen some folks handling fish in a rather rough way before releasing them. The other day I was in a similar situation and realized that I don't know well what the best practices are either.   I get that keeping them in the water and using a landing net are two essentials, but what else is there? Barbless hooks? Is there a better type of landing net? How about the way you land the fish? Any other tips? "
670,How did cartographers map out shores before modern times?,"I was down at high rock lake N.C. and I was making a little map of the shore lines in my kayak, or at least going to. I ran into a problem, I could not judge the distance from the last mark I made to the next(needed to make a map).  So my question is how did people make maps of shores before modern times?.  Also did they make them on boats.  Also How can I tell how fast I'm going on a kayak?. "
671,"Rope between legs while leading on rock, ice","When you're lead climbing, the most common way for the rope to hang naturally, if you don't do anything special, is usually between your legs. Is this OK on rock? On ice? Why or why not?  On rock, the impression I get is that it's fine, as long as you don't back-step the rope. I have heard people in the gym tell people not to do it, but I suspect they're either wrong or oversimplifying. Flipping through some rock climbing videos on youtube, I pretty quickly came across examples of extremely skilled sport climbers with the rope in this position, e.g., [website]On ice, are you supposed to keep the rope over one thigh because it makes it less likely that you'll damage it with your crampons or get your crampon points tangled in it? I've had a small amount of instruction and experience ice climbing, but I don't do it often enough to remember much of the technique from one time to the next. "
672,Impregnation and waxing full leather shoes,I will go to a wet territory (Jotunheimen) next week and would like to prepare my full leather shoes for that. I have read a lot of articles about shoe care and they are either about impregnation (spray) or waxing but what to do first?  Could anyone tell me in what order I have to treat my shoes so it does not harm the leather and I get the best water resistancy effect? 
673,Is there a good and fast way to dry used flies before storing them?,"I have been spending many hours by the water recently and usually try a lot of flies before I find what is working on a particular day. The question is: what to do with all the flies that got wet after I used them? I reckon that I should dry them, but is there any nice way to do it before putting them back into my fly box?  Edit: attaching them to hats seems to be a popular option, but what if I don't want to damage my hat or if I don't wear one? "
674,"Will practicing casting on my backyard lawn damage my fly line? If so, how to avoid it?","I have been practicing fly casting in my backyard using the same line that I use to fish. The question is: will my line get damaged from this? I reckon that these things are made to drag through water and vegetation, but I'm still worried that me dragging it through my lawn will accelerate the wear and tear process. Should I use an old line for that? Is there any better way of doing it? "
675,What should I bring home foraged mushrooms in?,"I've read a few books about gathering wild mushrooms as it's something I'm interested in exploring, and all of them stress the importance of using a wicker basket to transport the mushrooms so that they can ""breathe"" on the way home. However, I live in a very urban area and would look somewhat out of place, to say the least, carrying a basket of organic goodies down the street like Little Red Riding Hood; in short, I want a container that preserves both the mushrooms and my dignity. What can I use? I usually carry a backpack, but would this be too enclosed for the poor fungi? "
676,Can I use wading sandals with waders?,"I have a pair of wading sandals (made by Keen and designed for water sports) to which I added a few metal studs and have been using for wet wading while fly fishing in shallow streams. Now I wonder if I can use them with proper waders in lieu of wading boot or wading shoes (i.e. wear the sandals over the neoprene 'socks' of the waders). Is there anyone there who has tried it? Are there any disadvantages or problems that would make it impractical? I currently don't own waders, so I can't test it myself. "
677,Sleeping in an inflatable boat,"I am going to make a trip on a river in an inflatable rowing boat. The trip is going to be two days long: one day down the river and the next day - back.  The question is how I should spend night. I don't have a tent and now am pondering over whether I should buy it and spend night onshore or not. Have anybody spent night in the boat on the water? Is it safe? What safety precautions should I take?  The river is relatively calm, it's the Dnieper river in Ukarine, and at the section I'm going to boat at it is about 500 meters (540 yards) wide, current speed is 0,6 - 0,7 m/s (up to 2 miles per hour).

678,What is the longest stretch of bike trail that parallels a navigable river in the US?,"I have begun adventuring where I drive to a boat launch on a river near a bike trail, put the canoe on a trailer, and tow the canoe up the trail with the bike.  At another boat launch I put the canoe in the river and the bike in the canoe, and paddle back down to my vehicle.  I find that I make about 5 miles an hour pedalling up, and about 3 miles an hour paddling down.  This limits a day trip to about 15 miles; 3 Hours up, and 8 hours down plus drive time, lunch, launch, etc.  I am currently working on the section of Monongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers between Connellsville(PA) and Pittsburgh PA? The trail and goes farther up stream but at Connellsville the river is closed to open canoes, 63 miles down stream the bike trail ends(Google map)  I used the bike trail feature of Google maps and followed the Ohio to the Mississippi all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. in the 3300 river miles between Connellsville  and New Orleans, the section I am working on now seems to be the longest stretch.    A little thought on the subject suggest that old rail systems that parallel small to midsize rivers, that have been converted to bike trails will probably offer the longest stretches.   So where is the longest stretch?  I would like to go someplace and spend a week or two biking up and canoeing down different stretches of river, where is the longest stretch of bike path that parallels a river I can canoe on?

680,is it a good idea to cover a tent with a tarp to protect for heavy rainfall?,"Last summer, I went camping with my family for the first time. We bought a second hand tent, similar to the one on the picture below. We had a great time, but after a rainstorm that went on for 24 hours, the tent started leaking at the seams at the top, causing the rain to drip down at the inside and soaking our sleeping bags. More rain was coming for the next day, so we were forced to pack up our wet tent and return back home a few days earlier than planned. Back home, we discovered that the rubbery sealing of the seams had worn out, so we have repaired this, but it might not provide enough protection for heavy rainfall during a next camping trip. So I was thinking to bring a large tarpaulin and use that to cover the tent at the top. Is this a good idea ? Or might this get dangerous if heavy wind gets under the tarp ? And should I tighten the tarp directly over the tent (like this) or keep some distance using cords (like this) ?   "

682,How to handle grizzly bear encounters,"My friends and I are traveling the North Country Trail in Michigan's Upper Peninsula this August. Even though odds are small, we could encounter a grizzly bear. This is something none of us have experience with, so as we prepare it is the top discussion of safety.  We understand that we should cook food more than 100yd's away from our sleeping area, and hang food in a bear canister (or bag)/anything else that may attract them via smell.  If we encounter a grizzly bear, what should we do? What if we are in a tent and hear a bear walk by (which I've heard is most common, because they are traveling to hikers' food, typically through a campsite)?   None of us are registered to carry a gun, so that isn't an option. For the sake of this website and the completeness of question for future users, the answerer could also provide an answer assuming we had a weapon. "
683,Is it normal for an Evenk/Siberian hitch knot to become loose?,"Is it normal for the Evenk/Siberian hitch knot to open out in use, particularly when tied to a large diameter object (think tree) where the rope enters the knot close to right angles from the load?   I'm 99% sure I'm tying it correctly,   but no matter how slowly and carefully I work the knot up, after pulling it up into position and under load it seems to open out into 2 separate parts. Due to the mechanics of the knot it seems to hold from my quick testing, but I don't know. It's meant to be okay for hammock usage but it's not giving me any sort of confidence in it. Not the ""in a sack, over a rock"" confidence you'd want anyhow.  Alternatively, does anyone have a good alternative slippery hitch that can be pulled up into a tree above head height and released again, and suitable for hammock use? I've looked at a few which may fit the bill, but I'd  be interested to know what people actually use. "
684,Mountaineering / glacial traverse: rope-up or go it alone?,"When crossing a glacier (or other mountaineering activity for that matter) I've heard that roping everyone together without having a fixed anchor is falling out of fashion since more often than not if someone takes a tumble into a crevasse then end up pulling their partner(s) in with them. What is the current expert advice? Is it better to tie everyone together, or keep the rope handily unattached and ready to perform a rescue if someone goes in? "
685,How long does mayonnaise last unrefrigerated in the back-country?,"Yes, mayonnaise. It is sold unrefrigerated, and is an essential component of any back-country sandwich. Has anyone reached its limit and had it spoil on them?  (I haven't. Of course, I've never had an opened bottle last more than about week unconsumed...)  To clarify just a bit - I know that the labels and recommendations are to refrigerate, but I think western society waaaay over-refrigerates everything... and that paranoia prevents a lot of great food from making it into the back-country.   So my question is not: what does the label say, but: has anyone ever had it turn south on them?  Edit from a fellow mayonnaise lover:  Any developments in packaging in the past 4 years that might help?    "
686,What is the best way to cross streams while backpacking?,"I'm curious of a good technique to cross a stream while backpacking that's above the boot's waterproof line but no higher than the knees. I typically face upstream and use my hiking poles for stability. However, I'm not a fan of soggy boots, so I tend to go barefoot, which adds to the risk of slipping on slick rocks or stepping on a sharp edge. Is it best to wear the boots anyway and try to dry them by rotating socks? Or would a pair of camp shoes that quickly dry be a good option?  This is similar to this question, but less related to survival and more about typical backpacking trips. I'm often going solo and on well maintained trails, but without a bridge at the streams. And because of leave-no-trace principles, I don't want to construct anything to cross on top of (e.g. fall a tree). "
687,What's the advantage to a bent-shaft paddle?,"What's the advantage (or advantages) of a bent-shaft canoe paddle?  I've been told that it allows for more efficient use of both arms: the rationale I heard was that your arm on the grip does more work than your arm on the blade with a straight paddle and this is ""evened out"" with a bent-shaft paddle.  I've also been told that it moves the water more efficiently (though, assuming the same blade, I fail to understand the theory here.)  I'm neither a kinesiologist nor a physicist, so I'm not convinced about either of these answers.  I find a bent-shaft paddle more comfortable, but I've always chalked that up to personal preference more than anything else.  Can anybody shed some light on this?  Examples of bent shaft paddles "
688,How are sleeping bag temperature ratings determined?,"One things that has always troubled me when buying a sleeping bag is the temperature rating.  When looking at a bag that claims to be a +15°F bag (for example) how do I know that it is really good down to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (preferably without buying it)?  Is the rating just determined by the manufacturer, or is there any sort of independent validation/criteria on these ratings? "
689,Dealing with very cold climate (clothing),"In the near future I will have to prepare myself for a Siberia expedition.     During the winter, average temperatures in Siberia range from -10°F   (-23°C) to below -50°C (-45°F).1   What should I wear in very low temperature conditions? Is there any layer system that has been proven to effectively protect the body from very low temperature exposure? I have found this paper but I am sure many of you have some personal experience/tested “solutions” – that's what I am asking about.  Most of the time (60-70%) I will be outdoors, just visiting different places (i.e. sight seeing, walking). I will also travel through Siberia (by train &amp; bus) but the question mainly concerns protecting from cold when outdoors. "
690,How do I store a bivy sack?,"I bought a BlocVent bivy sack. What’s a good way to store it for a long time? Obviously I’ll dry it after a hike, but is it okay to roll it up and put it into a small stuff sack afterwards? Or should I keep it unrolled, like a sleeping bag or a mat? "
691,Cooking by pouring hot water into plastic bags?,"Recently I came across pour and store bags. They seem a bit similar to the bags for trekking freeze-dried meals like Travel lunch. That gave me the idea of preparing the meals myself beforehand and packing them into such bags. It sounds easy &amp; clean on the hike: just take out the bag for one meal, pour hot water into it and wait a while. The bags could be reused, which is a plus.  Is something like this a common practice? Which kind of bags would be good for it? (I mean, it has to be 101% food safe and withstand the hot water.) I do realize there’s only so much variety of such meals that I can prepare at home without freeze drying, but I don’t mind. I’m mainly curious if the system works and what bags to use. "

I know that this can be done in 1 day, but when googeling, the tour length differs a lot. Some sources speak about 20km(12.4mi) and 1000hm and others about 30km(18.6mi) and 2000hm. This makes some difference for me. Therefore I tried to use Google to get the directions and then tools like GPSVisualizer to plot a profile.  Unfortunately, Google Maps can't find the path over the mountains, but just a highway.  So, how can I get more information about such concrete tour plans? I'm particularly interested in the length of the tour and the height differences. "
693,How can I tell when pemmican has spoiled?,"Following this video I have made pemmican.  When making the pemmican I used a food processor instead of rocks (because I'm lazy).  I handled it with care, and according to this handbook, this stuff will last years, but ... I'm not entirely confident that I can toss this in my pack for a week.  How can I tell when it has spoiled?  Does it look wrong, smell wrong...?   "
694,Why aren't aluminum canoes more popular/prevalent?,"Growing up we had an old aluminum canoe. It looked kind of ugly, and had some dents, but it was a great boat. Over the past 5 years I've been in various sporting goods stores in California, Colorado, and Idaho looking at canoes. Every single canoe they have on display is plastic. They never have aluminum canoes. Aluminum canoes that I've found on the internet are price competitive (generally slightly cheaper), and weigh less than the plastic canoes.   My own biased perception is the aluminum canoes are more durable, hardier (in and out of the water since they can't warp if stored in the sun), require less maintenance, and if they are damaged are easier to fix. I know that I'm biased so I don't understand why the market seems to be dominated by plastic canoes. What am I missing? Why are plastic canoes everywhere and aluminum canoes hard to find? Is there something in the pro/con list between the respective build materials that makes plastic canoes a clear winner? "
695,Would a gunshot echo in a cave?,I'm writing a story in which someone is shot in a cave system. Another character is an adjoining tunnel some distance and at least a few tunnel intersections away. Would the sound of the shot reach her? Would it sound like a gun shot? or a rumble of echos?  
696,Water turning slightly reddish brown,After boiling water it went from clear to brownish red. I boiled the clear water in a stainless steel pan and as it was boiling it started to become brownish red. The more I boiled it the more pronounced it became. I put the boiled water in a glass and compared it to the same water before boiling and it was clear. Just to further test if this was the water or the pan I used purified water and boiled it in the same pan and it was clear. What's going on? Why is my water brownish-red after boiling?  
697,Unconventional ways to light a fire,"In a survival situation, lets say post apocalyptic, what are some unconventional ways a campfire could be lit? Obviously there are the classic flint and steel, rod and bow, and of course matches. But what are creative non conventional ways to start a fire from things you might find in a post apocalyptic scenario?  One example i have heard would be with a battery, and a piece of foiled chewing gum wrapper seen here   "
698,Why does the Iditarod sled dog race use separate routes in alternating years?,"The Iditarod sled dog race is a competition that takes place in Alaska, USA. Each team consists of a musher, who drives the sled, and 16 sled dogs. The race usually starts in Anchorage and ends in Nome.  The total mileage is in the vicinity of 1000. Some people like to call it 1049 miles since Alaska was the 49th state, but it's generally somewhat shy of that. Having begun in 1973, the race takes place annually, usually starting in the first week of March.   The Iditarod begins and ends at the same spot every year, but at some point along the way a section of it is split off for a portion of the race. In the even numbered calendar years, it goes on something called the Northern Route. In the odd numbered years, it travels the Southern Route.  I'm intrigued by the different routes, and have a few questions.   Have there always been two routes or were they created at some point in the history of the race?  If it didn't start out that way, in what year were the separate routes created?  What's the purpose of using different routes?   At which town does the split begin, and at which town does it end?  What are the towns on the North Route that aren't on the South, and vice versa?    "
699,Is a full waterproof coat more important than waterproof trousers for hiking?,"I've spent most of my working life outdoors (forestry mostly), but have not done much hiking, which I now intend to do. When working outdoors, my clothing consisted of a wool shirt and waxed cotton waistcoat, anything else would just be ripped to shreds within a few months. If it rained we'd get wet, shelter in the truck for lunch, come home, dry stuff by the fire and then start again tomorrow.  Obviously, this system isn't going to work so well for hiking as I might not be able to have a fire so I'm looking to upgrade my gear. The thing that's confusing me is that there seems to be a plethora of coats available, but very few waterproof trousers and even fewer waistcoats. Intuitively, from my time working outdoors, getting my arms wet was no worse than getting my legs wet in terms of cold/discomfort, as long as my torso stayed dry. Most places though seem to think a full coat is the most important bit of kit with some leggings reserved for it it's really wet.  Is there some logic behind this that I'm missing, or is it just convention? As far as I can tell from experience in the rain, if you wear a short coat, the rain all runs off it onto your thighs, making them soaking wet, so unless you plan to don waterproof trousers every time you put a coat on, you're going to get wet legs. If you're going to accept wet legs in all but the worst of rain, then why not wet arms too and keep everything lighter and more free to move when it's not raining?  Since putting on a pair of waterproof trousers over boots and all every time it rains is such a faff, I'd be inclined to wear a waterproof waistcoat like I used to at work and carry a poncho to cover arms and legs if it rains. Is there something wrong with this set-up that I'm missing, it doesn't seem popular? "
700,"What is the Origin of the Word ""Sendtember"" in Rock Climbing?","Does anyone know the origin of the word ""Sendtember""? I'm trying to figure out what it means and Google isn't being helpful. I think it has something to do with temperatures in the month of September to be more favorable for rock climbing. Any ideas? "
701,Down inside of a sleeping pad does it make a difference?,"Several years ago I purchased an Exped down filled inflatable sleeping pad. It is a more comfortable pad than Thermarest pads I've used in the past, so I would still recommend it. That being said, when I purchased the pad I remember Exped making a big deal about how their pads are filled with down as if this was a major improvement in terms of warmth (and possibly comfort) over other sleeping pads. At the time I bought this marketing pitch hook, line, and sinker.    However I was laying in my tent during a recent camping trip and I started to think about what possible benefit down really offers inside of an inflatable sleeping pad. As far as I know down is warm because it does a good job of trapping air and it is light weight. How would trapping air be helpful in an inflatable sleeping pad? The air is already trapped or the pad would deflate. Down's other claim to fame is being light weight. I don't know how that applies to a sleeping pad since not filling it with down would be lighter than filling it with down. Also getting down wet is a known problem and so Exped recommends that I fill my sleeping pad using the pad's stuff sack as an air pump so the moisture from my breath doesn't foul the down inside the pad. That leads to a bulky, specialized stuff sack that I didn't need for other sleeping pads. Another mild annoyance is there are two valves on the\h pad so that down doesn't collect on one side of the pad. This makes deflating quicker but it doubles the chance a valve will fail thus ruining my pad. The more I thought about it the more convinced I became that the increased warmth and comfort of my Exped pad was due to its substantially increased thickness vs Thermarest pads.  Does filling a sleeping pad offer any real benefit or is it just a marketing gimmick that exploits foolish people like myself who blindly accept down makes everything better? "
702,How to deal with changing clothing which was used while cooking as not to attract a bears?,"It is said you not only need to keep food at least 30-100 meters away from the tent, which is easy do to, but you also can't sleep in the same clothing which was worn while eating, which can be very problematic or impossible to follow if you make a mistake.  I am concerned about European brown bears.  See my earlier question.   Let's say hiking in relatively warm weather in only shorts and T-shirt. Cooked in that clothing. Do I have to undress to being naked and put on another T-shirt and shorts to sleep in? What if I only have 2 pairs and mix them up, forget to change in the morning and eat breakfast in the sleeping clothing, and suddenly I am left with no spare clothing which I haven't eaten in, so I must sleep nude or become bears breakfast myself?  What if I have underwear, does that need to be changed too and keep cooking and non-cooking underpants?  It's so easy to mess this separate clothing thing up, I can never tell used clothing from clean, always mix them up and forget to keep clean in the clean bag and dirty in the dirty bag, never can manage to keep them apart. What if during changing the cooking-clothes will touch the non-cooking clothes and suddenly both are contaminated?  Do you use your cooking clothes only for cooking, and hike in the non-cooking clothing? This would require getting naked before and after eating. Not very practical, and not very pleasant especially in colder temperatures.  Even if the clothing is managed perfectly, still my breath can smell like food, so does this clothing changing thing even make sense? "
703,What species of bear are most and least dangerous to humans?,"Excluding hybrids it seems like there are eight species of bears.    Which are most and least likely to injure or kill a human?  Related Do black, brown/grizzly or polar bears ever prey on humans?  Related Is any subspecies of black bear more -- or less -- aggressive than another? "
704,Is there a simple at-home test to objectively measure the insulating value of a sleeping pad?,"Does anyone know of a reasonably simple means of using household items to objectively measure the insulating value of a sleeping pad, in a way that accurately predicts that aspect of performance in the field?    I would imagine that this would involve creating some of the field conditions (for example compressing the sleeping pad by a realistic amount)—-what would those conditions be?  This could be valuable either if it was able to produce absolute measurements (assigning an R-value under a certain set of conditions that would be the same as one measured by a manufacturer’s lab) or only relative measurements (Pad A is about twice as good as Pad B)  My goal here is to contribute to actual comfort and safety in the field.  I’d like to devise something either so simple people could test their own setup, or if not, then to enable some individual who is so inclined to measure a bunch of common gear and post results.  This is motivated both by appreciation for truly well made commercial products which deserve recognition, but also spotting where very cheap alternatives attain the basic safety and function. "
705,How can we be the most respectful to a moose when photographing it up close?,"We've often heard that moose are most active in the early morning or late in the day, around dusk, and are usually near a natural water source.   Every year, we travel a few hours away to areas that are known for significant moose populations. We choose the “right” time, and “best” spots. We stay on a road or trail and wait, but have very rarely caught a glimpse of one in its natural habitat, and when we do, there are often trees between us and the moose.   We've always wanted clear pictures of moose, and I'm jealous of people who get them! I also study animals online, and use videos and pictures to learn. We'll never be able to protect animals if we don't understand them, so we need documentation.   There was a very sad story recently about a group of people at the edge of a lake watching a moose swimming toward them. After he got out of the water, they gathered to take close-up photos and videos. They scared him, and he went back into the water, became exhausted and eventually drowned.   People talk a lot about the real need to protect ourselves from moose and other wild animals, but it goes the other way too, meaning we need to protect them from us. This incident made me think there must be many times we scare an animal, even to death, but it's not so obvious, so we don't realize it.   What are some ways to be more respectful of the animal's private space, to just let him go about his daily activities without scaring him, and still get good pictures?  How can we balance our desire without putting him in a dangerous situation where we may inadvertently cause him irreparable harm? "

709,Trekking near Berlin,"Last year I asked about mountain hut treks near Vienna, and the answers I got helped me plan a wonderful trip. This year I'm going to be in Berlin in June, and would be happy to do a (fairly laid back) two-three day trek somewhere near there. One thing I've read about is a 416 km trail that encircles Berlin, the 66 lakes trail. However, I haven't found much information - certainly not in English - and even in German, I'm missing something like the Austrian hut finder site which I used last year to find a good area in Austria.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a specific part of the 66 lakes trail, an alternate suggestion, or know of a good resource to help plan something near Berlin? (When I say ""near"" I mean up to a three hour train/bus ride to a good starting point.)  UPDATE: An example of a nice resource that I stumbled upon: the ""Berlin Hikers"" Meetup Group. Their list of past events is a useful (and English) guide to hikes around Berlin that I can use as a starting point for planning a longer trip. It seems like they've been to many of the places Paul mentions in his answer below. "

711,Which mid-line knot is best suited for a trucker's hitch?,"I've been using a trucker's hitch knot for a very long time (camping, strapping stuff down, line length adjustment, pulley system) I've always switched my mid-line loop when I've come to not trust them for numerous reasons (not secure, impossible to untie after loaded, rope damage, take too long, etc...).  Here is an example [website]This one is tied using a directional fig 8 as the mid-line knot.  I've used the following knots for periods of time, switching between them as I feel uncertain:   slip knot (quick, not reliable) alpine butterfly (quick, reliable, seizes up) directional figure 8 (quick, reliable, seizes up) sliding prusik (doesn't seize,  not quick if not already on rope, sometimes not reliable) bowline on a bight (reliable, doesn't seize, not quick) span loop  (reliable, quick, seizes up) ""half"" sheep shank with a half hitch to secure also called a bell ringer's knot (quick, doesn't seize, reliable?)   They all have their uses and advantages but I'm looking for that 'bomb proof' setup where I can load it to the max that the rope can handle and still be able to hold while not making this mid-line knot impossible to remove and doesn't permanently damage the rope. Speed is important as well because I will often pull out my cordage and tie down a trailer full of stuff while my Father/Father In Law will be fiddling with straps that have a tendency to become a nightmare of a mess.  My go to was a directional figure 8 for the longest time but it started to get very difficult to untie when using heavy loads (I'm heavy and like to use hammocks while camping :) some of my cordage has these in there permanently). I then switched to using the span loop for a long time but that also locks up. I've now settled on a bell ringer's with a half hitch lock.  This has worked well for me when tied properly but it 'feels' like it is not secure. I've never had it fail (even on 6 hours trips being used to tied down kitchen appliances on a trailer) but it just doesn't seem like a very stable setup.   What knot is best suited as the 'fixed' knot in a trucker's hitch? "
712,How to dry wet shoes quickly?,"Is there a way to dry the shoes out when they get wet? I am referring to situations specially when I can not hang them out to dry. Consider a situation wherein I am trekking in the night, and I need to cross a stream and then I know that I am not gonna walk much through wet places (mud, grass lands, etc), but I am gonna walk for sure. So is there a way to dry them out faster? So that I don't get blisters. Had this been a daytime I could simply hang them out in the sun for a while when I plan to have lunch or rest for half an hour or so.. "
713,License for international hunters in Canada,"How do hunting licenses work when travelling abroad for hunting? It's not a case of re-locating to a new country, just spending some time there. Is there an international recognition of a national license?

I have interest in how a international group of people (mainly from the UK) could go on a hunting holiday in Canada. "
714,Logic behind hikers yielding to horses?,"Here in California, a lot of trails have signs with a triangular diagram, showing that cyclists should yield to hikers, and both cyclists and hikers should yield to people on horses.

In general, what is the polite way for hikers to behave toward people on horseback? "
715,What to consider when buying fins for recreational snorkeling?,"I've been on a few beach vacations in the last few years and have discovered that I really enjoy snorkeling. I have at least three trips in the next year where I will probably go snorkeling (a few times per trip), so I'm thinking it might be economical to purchase my own snorkel gear rather than rent it at every destination.  I already have a snorkel mask, which was a gift; I'd like to get fins to go with them.  What type of fin should I look for that performs well for snorkeling and is easy to travel with? (I prefer being able to stick them in a carry-on, but that's not a strict requirement.)  In the searching I've done so far, I've noticed that the length of the blade varies quite a bit from brand to brand and style to style; how important is blade length for an occasional snorkeler? The shorter bladed fins seem to be recommended for people who want gear that's easy to travel with, but I have no idea if getting a short fin would make my snorkel trips more difficult or unpleasant in any way.  How do I evaluate different qualities to determine what's best for me?   full-footed v. with a strap open toe v. closed toe split blade v. solid cost length of blade anything else?    Cost isn't really a factor, though I don't see a reason to spend $100-300 for ""professional"" fins at this stage of my outdoor adventuring. "

I can't tell by looking if a peak is 100 meters or a 1,000 meters above me. I have to stare hard and look for context clues (usually trees).  This has led to some hilarious problems.   If I spend enough time in the mountains, will my depth perception improve? Are people who are born and raised in the mountains better at perceiving distances in the mountains?  "

719,Is dryer lint worth using as a fire starter even if it's also a pollutant?,"I have been reading about dryer lint as an effective kindling material, but I keep having the feeling that in some way it implies burning ""plastic"": all the artificial materials, coloring (although it might have been well washed out by then), detergents, chemically treated threads etc. Can it be considered as a polluting material, even just in such a small amount? (Wiki points it out as ""one of the primary polluters in cave exploration"") Can/should this amount of pollution be ignored because of the benefits of this kindling material? "

I do wonder if it's my rope, it's relatively thick 10.5mm. Could this be the problem? "
721,How do you make an emergency water filter and purifier?,"How do you make an effective water filter using the natural elements of the great outdoors?  Suppose your only source of water was dirty and questionable at best. How could you make it potable without having to boil it and using only what mother nature has to provide?   I've never made one before, but I imagine it involves sand to filter out the grits, and probably charcoal to absorb the nastiness, as well as a couple other layers for reasons; like herbs that may be effective in killing microbials or some other form of alchemy that will make it safer to drink.  How do you make your own water filter when you're in a desperate situation? "
722,When to know it's worth to start with agriculture?,"Based on survival series, films etc. most of the people stranded on a lonely island (not necessarily restricted to this situation of course) over a long period start with agriculture at some point. While I understand that it gives you great benefits, it also consumes resources (water, energy etc.).   When do I know that the benefits outweigh the ""waste"" of resource (my daily routine is that stable, that it can handle the additional expense), so that I should start with agriculture? Which precedence does it have (like ""Don't start with agriculture before you haven't ..."")? "
723,What should an outdoors traveler know about the biodegradability of plastic?,"I was wonder how long it takes plastic to biodegrade and if there is anything a person can or should do to facilitate the process for plastics in the outdoors.  I know that optimally ""Carry in, Carry Out"" and ""Leave no trace"" mean you should not see any plastic in the outdoors that gets left behind. Things don't always go perfectly and, so if there is a plastic item that is not going to be leaving the area with you what should you know and do?. Related What should I do about large trash left by others on USFS land?   I did a little research and found   Plastic can be biodegradable and that is good. For more on this please read: Are Plastics Biodegradable?  Plastics can take hundreds or 1,000+ years to biodegrade and that is bad. For more information read the following: How Long Does It Take a Plastic Bottle to Biodegrade? Plastics can biodegrade fast and that may be worse (Plastic Breaks Down in Ocean, After All -- And Fast).   So me and a piece of plastic are alone in the great outdoors, and we are not leaving together. There is no chance we will see each other again, and very little that a new human will bond with the plastic in next year or even for decades.  What do I need to know to limit the environmental impact of plastic in the outdoors? "
724,What is the smallest island that will support one person indefinitely?,"In the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks the character survives 4 years on a small island. But that was a movie.  It is a common cartoon image to see a single person on small island with one coconut tree, this seems unlikely to be survivable.   In real life José Salvador Alvarenga survived 14 months adrift in the Pacific Ocean.    The question What area is needed to grow enough food to sustain a person for a year? (Sister site, Sustainable Living) has answers suggesting that as little as  4,000 sf (372 m²) will support one person, but that is best case, with tools, seed and other supplies available.   Realistically, is there minimum size/configuration of an island that it is likely you could survive indefinitely?   "
725,Can I guess the size of a shark by the size of its dorsal fin?,"Is there a relative scale to which one can estimate the size of a shark by looking at its dorsal fin?

726,Mountain guide leading towards a thunderstorm - does his explanation make sense?,"I just got back from a guided walking trip to high mountains. There was one day when we encountered a thunderstorm - and the guide advised we are OK to proceed with the day's walking, instead of turning round. He gave an explanation, and I wonder if you think it is reasonable?  The situation was as follows: the forecast said 'possibility of thunderstorms', for just-about all the foreseeable future. We set off from our overnight stay up the valley, heading for a high mountain pass. We then heard the thunderstorm coming, staying about 1.5-3 km (1-2 miles) away from us, as deduced from timing between lightning and thunder.  Now, the guide said he is happy to proceed up the valley and up to the col, because      he was monitoring the pressure (with a gauge in his GPS), and it was stable - indicating that the storm was going remain where it was, and not migrate / descend towards us.   Does that make sense?  More generally, the advice I have been given was that if you hear a thunderstorm, you unconditionally turn around and seek solid shelter (mountain hut etc.). Is that too conservative, and if so, what are the mitigating circumstances? I understand you are never 100% safe from lightning outside solid buildings. "

728,How much time does qualifying for a fishing license in Germany take?,"My brother asked me lately if I wanted to join a fishing license class with him later this year. I would absolutely like that but I'm afraid that I can't handle the additional time consumption.  How much time do I have to calculate with?     Edit, since flagged:  I ask for the time a license consumes in Baden-Württemberg. I mean the actual time of the whole course. So, how many hours of fishing training (is there such a thing?), how many hours of theoretical classes and how many hours of exams. This sum is the time a course consumes.  For example: a driving license in Germany needs at least (made up numbers) 7 hours of night-driving, 5 hours of rural driving, 5 hours in the city, 12 theoretical classes with an hour each and finally the exams consuming 2 hours. That makes a consumption of 31 hours.  "
729,Should I wear a fleece while cross country skiing?,"I am a beginner. I live in Toronto. In the February/March season, temperatures drop to -20°F, sometimes it's even colder.   Is the following a good outfit for cross country skiing?   For top: base layer that wicks moisture and a ski jacket. Do I need a fleece? The fleece makes me sweat. For bottom: thermal and snow pants. Wool socks and snow boots. Ski gloves  "
730,What are the best methods for hanging food in a tree?,"My friends and I are planning our first backpacking trip and the date is less than a month away. We just have a couple of loose ends to finish up on.   We were wondering what the best method to tie your food into a tree is. I would imagine 20ft above the ground would be plenty - but then again I don't know.  Parks Canada website suggests a minimum of 100 meters between yourself and your hung food/cooking fire/cooking clothes, but the image they show with an example of hung bags seems pretty complex (see picture below). Would we really have to have someone climb all the way to the top of a tree to hang our bags effectively? Not that this would be an issue, but I feel like that is a lot more work than necessary.    Is the method shown in the picture the best/safest? "
731,What to look for in hiking shoes?,"My friends and I are going on our first hiking expedition through Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and I was wondering what type of shoes are recommended by experienced hikers? I have looked up information online, but it seems all I get is advertisements saying ""THIS shoe is meant for hiking! Best price, best quality!"", which isn't very credible.  What kind of shoes do you wear? What do you look for in good hiking shoes (i.e. comfort, wide-toe, etc)? "
732,Keeping Single Item Cold While Backpacking For 2 Days,"My friends and I are going backpacking and want to keep a single item cold for 2-3 days.  Freezing is not a problem - preferably the closest to being frozen as possible. It is medication that may be needed in case of emergencies. It's about the size of a large snickers  Our idea is to buy some kind of snap-cold pack and place our belongings in a small cooler filled with ice water. We only have to carry this stuff for 2 days, max, so the weight won't be too big of an issue.  Are there better was of approaching this? What gel packs have backpackers used? "
733,How can I safely practice trad climbing?,"I have climbed indoors and outdoors for several years, both top rope and sport, and I somewhat recently took an outdoor trad climbing class. In the class, we placed protection while on top rope and never took any falls on the gear.  Now, after the class, I would like to try putting some of the knowledge to use, but I am not yet comfortable enough doing an entire route on trad gear.  Are there any methods for practicing trad climbing on the gear while not 100% using it as protection? How do people usually transition from sport climbing to trad climbing? "
734,Is it a good idea to grind Esbit fire tabs?,"Esbit tabs can't be lit with a firesteel, unless you grind (produce a powder) some of the tab up first (here's a video about how to do that: [website]A firesteel is much safer than matches or a lighter in my opinion, as it can hardly (if ever) fail, so I'd prefer a system that allows a firesteel to be used.   So, I am considering grinding the tabs before leaving home, and to store the Esbit it in a suitable strong and tightly closed bottle.   If this would work, It would also have the advantage of being able to dose the amount of fuel you want to use.  But, I don't know how effective may that be in real use.  What I feel is, a ground Esbit could be very problematic in case of wind, if you don't protect it properly, a strong gust of wind could blow the dust away. But assuming that there's no wind or you properly sheltered the fuel from the wind:  Is a ground Esbit as effective in producing heat as the intact, un-ground, tabs? Or, if there is a difference, how significant is that? "
735,"Can I use a tent in bear country, if I ate food in it over a year ago?","In bear country, we are told, never eat food in your tent.  I no longer live in bear country but I may return in the future.  If I eat food in my tent now, does that mean that, from a bear's point of view, it will smell of food even one or more years in the future?  Or does never mean the less restrictive never while in bear country? "
736,Is it safe to cook food during a hike (on trail) when bears are possibly around?,I'm going to the Rockies (trails in Jasper and Banff). Would it be safe for me to cook food while on the trail? Won't bears be attracted towards the smell of the food? 
737,Where to almost wild camp in the Ardennes?,"Wild camping is not permitted in Belgium, but I heard about places where this is allowed. Well itś not exactly wild camping but almost. Where are these places? are there any hiking trails associated?  I googled for it, but I only get traditional camping places. "
738,Why should I take a pocket knife for wild camping / hiking?,"I've got the advice to take a pocket knife with me for 2 weeks of wild camping / hiking in Scotland (West Highland Way). However, I don't understand when I would need it.  I will take the following with me:   a knife, fork and spoon for eating tweezers tiny can opener bottle opener   Is there any other tool / reason for which I would need a pocket knife? Do people recommend it, because you can combine all / some of those tools in one compact tool? "
739,"Where to get the DOS version of ""DataTalk"" (for Aladin diving computers)?","In order to configure my Aladin diving computer, I built the interface as described here. The software ""DataTalk"" can be used to configure the diving computer. However, the Windows version (which can be downloaded on the manufacturer's website together with ""DataTrak"") only works with an original ""MemoMouse"" – which is quite expensive for just using it once (for configuration).  The DOS version of DataTalk seems to work with the self-built interface. However, all the links I find are outdated since about 2006 or 2009.  Do you know where you can still get the DOS version? "
740,How to prevent sweat washing off insect repellent?,"I just went on a 2 hour hike and was seriously annoyed by many insects that tried to get a bite of me. Through years of experimentation on hikes, I have so far arrived at using a 75% DEET solution that I liberally deposit over myself.  While very effective after application, I find that the effect only lasts around 15 minutes - presumably due to me sweating a lot, which might have a converse effect to the repellent (just speculating, really). On today's hike, I went through 50 ml of repellent, since I had to keep reapplying it often.  Is there a particular type of insect repellent that is effective in such situations? DEET has so far been the only thing I actually notice driving the insects away but I wonder if there are some more ""sticky"" formulations of it that might work (what I am using right now appears to just be a basic liquid solution without much additive effects). How do you cope with insects in such a case? "
741,With what specific techniques are various bouldering grades associated?,"Some I've noticed:   V0 – hanging by one's arms; shifting weight for balance; pushing with one's legs V1 – pinching, edging V2 – laybacking, pockets, backstepping, flagging V3 – 'more strength'?   'More strength' is what it feels like you're missing when you can't do a problem – better technique is unimaginable. It's also obviously needed too.  What other techniques should I be practicing, and looking for opportunities to use – and at what grades?  Here's the top Google search result for me just now for ""climbing grades chart"" so feel free to use any grade scale:   Climbing grade conversion - MEC   Yes, this question is similar to this existing question:   bouldering - How do you decide on a climbing grade? - The Great Outdoors Stack Exchange   This question is, in a sense, the 'inverse' of that other question. But I'm not a route setter, nor am I devising my own pitches or problems. I want to know a rough ordering of techniques and their at-least-approximate association with various grades. I understand that there aren't hard-and-fast rules and that there are lots of reasons why this is.  But I've already supplied several examples of techniques that, in my experience at least, seem to only be necessary at certain grades. I'm sure there are more. What are they?  I also understand that, in fact, basically any technique may be required at fairly low grades, i.e. V3-V4.  But some techniques, e.g. bicycling; or certain types of problems, e.g. roofs, overhangs of greater than 30 degrees; just don't seem to reasonably be expected at lower grade problems. I dispute, for instance, that a problem with a 60 degree overhang, for more than one or two moves, could reasonably be graded a V1. That absolutely contradicts my (limited) experience and I can't imagine that anyone would expect climbers at a V1 grade level to be able to climb such features consistently. "

743,How does a European Robin differ from an American Robin?,"I live in the Northeastern region of the United States, and am an avid bird-lover. I love robins for their looks, and because they're harbingers of spring in my area. I thought robins were the same here and in Europe, but was recently told there are major differences. If the information I was given is correct, they don't even belong to the same family of bird!    I'm almost certain the majority of our robins are called American Robin.   If I were to go to a European country, would I recognize the physical characteristics of the robin there, or is the bird different enough that it would not look like a ""robin"" to me?   In addition to the appearance, are the basic behavioral characteristics, such as diet, preferred habitat, and nesting, similar, or are there significant differences in those also? Do the European robins ever migrate to America?  "
744,"When, how and by whom was sport climbing invented?","A comment:     One little thing that I understand differently: Sport climbing did not   evolve from trad climbing (at least not in the modern sense), but more   of artificial climbing. Using gear for advancement not only protection   was the standard and the revolution was to ditch that and climb on   ""unclimbable"" difficulties by using bolts as protection, which allows   to fall (which wasn't an option before).   on my answer here got me thinking. What exactly was the first sport route in the world? When did it get bolted, why and by who?  By sport route I mean free climbing outside with only bolts to protect falls, not aid climbing using bolts or using the odd bolt/piton here and there. "
745,"What is a lava tube, as a place to see bats? Are there any in the United States?","I've been looking for places to find bats in their natural habitat, rather than around the house. The author of this question saw some bats in a lava tube. I've never heard of a lava tube before, and would like to know what it means, and how it happens.   I understand that lava flows from a volcano, and affects any type of terrain in its path, including where it lands on the ground, which can be quite a distance from the site of the eruption.   How does lava create a tube-type formation with space inside? Is it hard enough to become something permanent, or is it a temporary structure that caves in at some point?  Is there any place in the United States where we could go to see one? I'm hoping we might find some bats inside.   Follow-up: Since people have been kind enough to teach me about the lava tubes, I've learned that not all of them have bats. When planning a trip, it's best to look up each cave individually to see if they are home to bats. Interestingly, even if they aren't in the caves, there are often bats living in the immediate vicinity, so on a trip you can frequently see both. (It's also worth researching the area before a trip, because some caves are closed at various times to protect the maternity colonies. For instance, at the time of this writing, 7 caves in the Lava Bed National Monument in California will be closed for the summer while the bats give birth and care for the young.) "
746,I need to wash my waterproof coat without ruining the waterproofing,"hopefully this is not a duplicate as I've searched for an answer on here before posting. I found this but there seems to be conflicting views on certain aspects of the question.  What I would like to know is how should I go about washing my waterproof coat? It's not GoreTex, but IsoTex (5000 on the waterproof scale). This will be the first time I have washed it, and I've had it about a year now. From reading other answers I assume I will need some sort of waterproofing agent to wash it with - are there different types for different materials and could anyone recommend a brand in the UK?  I'm also unsure about whether to tumble dry the coat or let it hang. I've seen comments claiming the tumble dryer will ruin the coat, and others saying it helps to reinforce the chemical outer layer. Can anyone confirm what the best method of drying the coat would be?  Lastly, I've seen plenty of waterproofing sprays in hiking shops before - are these any good/appropriate for use on a coat? Or are they just for re-applying lost waterproofing?  Thanks, "
747,Searching and reading back issues of Climbing and Rock and Ice,I am looking for an article that was published in either Rock and Ice or Climbing Magazine around 1999. I know the area and route of the article topic as well as the author's name. I may even have a copy of the cover image and/or and image used in the article.  Are there digital back issues of the magazine? Is there a search function? Are there libraries that would have back issues in print (or microfilm)?

749,Why is the European robin associated with winter?,"Reading some of the comments on this answer:     ....they're seen in the UK as winter birds. Not, I think, that they're   not around in the summer; more that other birds aren't around in the   winter but robins are. Robins are often found on Christmas cards in   the UK. (Christmas being in the winter in the UK.)   Robins are around all year in the summer, spring, etc. and have a red breast, etc (except juveniles) all year. RSBP web site confirms this:     The UK's favourite bird - with its bright red breast it is familiar   throughout the year and especially at Christmas! Males and females   look identical, and young birds have no red breast and are spotted   with golden brown. Robins sing nearly all year round and despite their   cute appearance, they are aggressively territorial and are quick to   drive away intruders. They will sing at night next to street lights.   So why are robins so associated with Christmas and winter? Where does this come from? "
750,Restore knife to factory sharp condition,"I bought an old knife, the previous owner botched up the blade. The sharpening was done so bad there are sections that look like a one sided knife blade and some that are sharpened on both. I can usually get a good hone on a knife if its been factory sharpened and then I take good care of it. But I'm not sure how I would restore this blade to a factory condition. I'd normally contact the manufacturer but they are no longer in existence.   How can I get my knife back to factory sharp condition? I'd like to get it ground down, how do I do this? What is the easiest way to do this? "

But I have been seeing some vessels that blur the line between them.  It seems there is a newer category of canoe kayak hybrid.    Is there something that makes a Canoe stop being and Canoe?  Where is the line between Canoe, Kayak and Hybrid?    Note: I don't know that the line can be defined, an answer explaining why the line is not definable is acceptable, if that is the case.  "
752,Is it dangerous to go to Mountains when snow is melting?,"This year beginning of May 2018 we with my friend visited Valle Grande in Italian Alps. Begging from 1500 meters there was snow, on the high of 1900m there was pretty deep snow and it was actively melting. Another challenge was weather, starting from 3pm rain/snow started and held until early morning.      We entered from the city Trontano and turned back after Passo Ragozalle. On the high of ~1800m we were going very slowly like 2km per day because of deep snow. We didn't meet people for four days, and we didn't meet any human footprints.       Our strava:   first day [website]2nd [website]3rd [website]4th [website]5th [website]Questions:    Is it dangerous to repeat this trip?    a. The max high on this trail is 1980 meters and we got it. b. The next thing was to go by ridge on 1900-1500m. Is it avalanche risk when snow 1m deep melts? c. Thing after this is canyon/ravine on 800m. I know there are dangerous signs ""sudden rise in water level""  If it's not deadly dangerous what tools would you recommend us(like ice axe)/courses or to take professional mountaineers with us?   "
753,"Are chiggers moving north, and if so, how do I protect myself against them?","I thought I knew every pest in our woods and on the trail to Great Falls National Park, and had been bitten by all of them, but I have never encountered chiggers. Not in our woods, not on hikes to and in Great Falls National Park, not in Shenandoah.  I have always thought of them as denizens of the deeper South.   However, today the arborist who is taking down a large dead tree in our woods said he been badly bitten by chiggers yesterday.  He said it was worse than the worst case of poison ivy.  I looked up chiggers, and saw that they are in Northern Virginia.  See Chigger Map of the United States.  If so, they have been keeping a low profile in Great Falls.    Are chiggers having a good year here because we have had enormous amounts of rain this spring and summer?  Or are they more numerous because they are moving north?   If masses of chiggers have moved permanently into the northern Virginia woods, how can I protect myself against them?  I always wear long pants and long sleeves anyway; do I need to do more? "
754,"Suvival: logs/wood, split or not to split?","Given we are in a non-life-threatening situation, splitting logs is often beneficial.  However, I feel things get murkier in a survival situation. I have brainstormed about this for a while, here is the best I got:  Survival: Wood Splitting Pros   increase surface area exposed, especially useful if wood is scarce in the current environment better burn since its drier less smoke would not give away your position as easily as an unsplit, wetter round (assuming goal is evasion)   Survival: Wood Splitting Cons   a lot of effort for a questionable benefit, maybe the person is better off just sliding a large unsplit round into the fire little by little potential for injury, (probably not a big risk factor, but it's another moving part nonetheless) minimal smoke could be a disadvantage in terms of visibility to rescuers (assuming we want to be seen)   Question  Is it worth the effort to split logs in a survival situation? Ideally, I would like to have a clear-cut (excuse the pun) answer, but if it depends, maybe we can walk through some basic conditions. Also, let me know if my logic was on-par in my lists above; maybe there are other considerations I didn't think of.  Further Clarifications   Survival time-frame: uncertain Is help coming?: uncertain friendly/unfriendly territory: friendly, not evasion other concerns: availability of wood, and other concerns will be optional. These may be important in some situations, but in the interest of simplicity I will allow the answerers to stipulate their own assumptions on things like this.  "
755,"Is there a difference between a hiking trail and a backpacking trail, including if it's the same piece of land?","I saw an article about the Long Trail, a 272-mile trail through the Green Mountain range in Vermont, USA.  It's famous for being the oldest hiking trail in the United States, having been built between 1910 and 1930.   According to the Green Mountain Club, which is referred to as the organization which has protected and maintained it since the beginning:      The Long Trail follows the main ridge of the Green Mountains from the Massachusetts-Vermont line to the Canadian border as it crosses Vermont’s highest peaks. It was the inspiration for the Appalachian Trail, which coincides with the Long Trail for 100 miles in the southern third of the state.       Built by the Green Mountain Club between 1910 and 1930, the Long Trail is the oldest long-distance hiking trail in the United States. (Emphasis mine.)   A different souce lists it as the same number of miles, and the same area. However, it calls it a ""hiking path"" in Vermont, then the oldest long-distance ""backpacking trail"" in the United States. (Emphasis mine.)     The Long Trail is a 272-mile long-distance hiking path in Vermont, which runs the length of the state. It is the oldest long-distance backpacking trail in the United States, finished in 1930 by the Green Mountain Club.  (Emphasis mine.)   Since that source made a distinction between types of trails, I'm curious what that means.   Unless I'm mistaken, hiking path and hiking trail are pretty much the same. What interests me is why one source would also call it a backpacking trail .   In this instance, does backpacking trail mean something different from hiking trail? If so, what's the difference?   Is it just a matter of semantics?  "
756,Is noodling more detrimental to catfish populations than fishing with a rod and reel?,"I understand how noodling for flathead catfish can be hazardous for the human.  This activity has resulted in bloody knuckles, broken wrists and even death.  These hazards do not even include those from snapping turtles, poisonous snakes, or lacerations from unseen submerged objects.   In fact, this method of fishing is only legal in 15 states with Wisconsin recently making it legal.  The Wisconsin link video mentions the possibility of adopting seasons and bag limits to help protect the catfish populations.   Is noodling more detrimental to catfish populations than fishing with a rod and reel?  "
757,Why are long-distance hiking trails in the USA so much more famous than in Europe?,"There are several famous long distance hiking trails in the USA, connecting the Mexican border to the Canadian border.  The most famous ones are the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) at 4,279 km and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) at 4,989 km.    Europe has some well known trails such as Tour de Mont Blanc (170 km) or Kungsleden (440 km), but those are much shorter and easy to complete in a single vacation.  Europes network of long-distance trails is mostly through much more populated areas (in particular as the 40% of Europe within Russia is excluded), but does include long, wild stretches in the north.    The Norge på langs (Norway end to end) is 2,700 km, the E1 in Norway is 2,105 km, and the Grensesømmen trail is 1,619 km, all including large stretches that are very wild with up to weeks between road crossings.  Although shorter than PCT or CDT, completing any of those in a single season is certainly no easy task (some do it on skis, which allows for a longer season) and requires substantial preparations.  Yet for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me, the long-distance routes in Northern Europe are far less known than the ones in the USA.  Although I haven't hiked stretches of either PCT or CDT, I've hiked parts of E1 and Grensesømmen where I would meet no other hikers for several days in a row, and I'm not sure that would happen anywhere on PCT or CDT.  Why is it that the long-distance hiking routes/trails in the USA are so much more famous than the ones in northern Europe?  Is it a matter of marketing, just like how Yosemite is more famous than Rago, or are there more fundamental reasons for it, such as more trail maintenance (probably), more accommodation/shops (probably not), or a more spectacular scenery (debatable)? "
758,"Portable canopy leg weights, how heavy?","I was at an event this weekend and noticed that many of the portable canopies had weights on the legs.   My Canopy has stakes and rope tie downs, but often the soil is not appropriate for these (to hard or soft).  Adding leg weights to my camping supplies seems like it might be a good idea.  I googled around and found multiple commercial and homemade solutions. Commercial solutions starting at about 5 pounds (2.26kg) and going to about 40 pounds (18kg).    How do you figure out what how much leg weight you might need for a canopy? Does adding sides to a canopy increase or decrease the amount of weight needed?   Assume Canopy size 10 foot x 10 foot (3 meter x 3 meter) "
759,How are backpacking conditions at Yosemite in April?,"Looking at the webcam, it looks like things are still pretty wintery in that area.  Being Michiganders, some snow is not going to deter us (we love winter camping), but we at least want to be prepared for what we're up against.  How accessible might Yosemite be in these conditions?  Any precautions you might recommend due to the mountainous terrain? "
760,Do I need to worry about feral dogs or even wolves if I camp in random areas while hitchhiking in Georgia (the country)?,"After almost half a year working in a hostel in Tbilisi, spring has come and it is far warmer than anywhere further west in Europe so I'm going to hitchhike around Georgia with my tent in warm areas.  I've hitchhiked a lot in countries some people consider dodgy and camped in random spots when it got too late to get more rides just a few times and I usually feel pretty safe.  But the one thing I do always worry about is packs of feral dogs. And of course their natural but just as dangerous cousins, wolves.   Do I need to worry about such animals in Georgia, and if so, in which parts? Or are there some tips to mitigate any risks? "
761,Should I use my cold weather boots in 40-80°F weather?,"I need to select a pair of shoes for when I go out to Yosemite this weekend.  The weather has been fluctuating like crazy - last we checked, there was a foot of snow on the ground, but now the lowlands are completely melted.  I had originally planned on bringing my pair of cold weather boots, but it's looking like the weather might be in the range of 40-80F (4.4-26.7C) now.  I have a pair of trail shoes I could bring, but I'm not certain if they're up to doing 20+ miles in 3 days.  I could buy a new pair of hiking boots, but that's shelling out a little bit more money now.  Has anyone taken a pair of cold weather boots out in the spring before?  Did you have any issues with them being too warm?  Would you do it again, or would you rather use a separate pair of hiking boots? "
762,How should I put out a campfire while away from civilization?,"If I build a campfire, but need to move on before it goes cold, how should I put it out? I wouldn't want to use my drinking water. Should I bring a covering to smother it with? "
763,"When does a geocached area become ""saturated""?","The 161m (0.1mile) rule in Geocaching is a pretty infamous one. However, the rules also state this:     Please don't hide a cache every 600 feet just because you can. The two main goals of the saturation guideline are to encourage you to seek out new places to hide caches rather than putting them in areas where caches already exist, and to limit the number of caches hidden in a particular area, especially by the same hider. Groundspeak may further restrict cache listings in areas where cache saturation becomes a concern.    So when exactly does an area become saturated and need further restriction? I've come across lots of areas with caches every 161m or so, some ridiculously riddled with caches. Is there any example of this rule being put into practice? "
764,Is it safe to eat poison ivy berries since I don't react to the leaves?,"Is it safe for someone who doesn't react to poison ivy to eat the berries? I am not going to try it without authority from someone who knows. Is it like smoke from burning vines, that can affect even an immune person? "
765,What are some good games to play with children on hikes?,"Sometimes children find long hikes boring and tiring, but if you can turn it around to play some games along the way they can find things a lot more interesting.

767,Eating in a long sport activity (scuba diving) to keep your strength up,We're planning a 9 to 10 hour dive. We can't go that long without eating.  What kind of 'food' could replace at least 2 meals of the day so we can 'survive' a long dive like that?  We'll figure out if something can be eaten while scuba diving. But maybe someone has already done something like that or has another 'extreme' sport where normal food isn't applicable anymore.  I'm thinking astronaut food but where do you get that?  I'm looking for something that looks like tube of toothpaste or similar.

769,Can oiling keep tools from rusting?,"Even stainless-steel can rust, and I've seen axes and saws that were visibly rusted. I've been told that wrapping the metal parts of the tools in oiled paper will prevent this.  Can oil really be used to prevent rust creation? And is there a difference between types?  From a chemical point of view, I would say it makes sense: The oil and paper wrapping could prevent the access to oxygen and thus prevent oxidation. But I would imagine vegetable oil is vastly different from types meant for engine greasing. "

More importantly, the seam between the sole and boot is starting to crack and allow some water in.

776,How to choose a fire steel and use it most effectively?,"Fire steels, ferrocerium rods -- oversized versions of the ""flint"" in a lighter or torch starter, are an apparently popular survival/backwoods fire starting method.   Why would one want one of these rather than a Storm Lighter? Is one type or brand more effective than another? Sizes are all over the map.  Do these all work equally well?  Is it just a matter of lifespan? There are bare rods, rods on lanyards, and rods in handles.  How does it matter? What is needed to make sparks with one of these rods?  Will natural flint work as a striker? Do you ""strike"" or ""scrape"" a fire steel?  How do you hold it? Can you use less sensitive tinder than is needed for a fire drill or fire piston? Are there any special precautions or specific failures for fire steels?  "
777,How are backcountry campground reservations enforced?,"It seems that in the backcountry of Canadian parks, one may only camp on campgrounds, and reservations are required.  For example, in Jasper National Park, one must camp on campgrounds to be reserved in advance, and from the Algonquin Provincial Park regulations, point 6 states that you must not camp at other lakes (...) not specified in your permit (emphasis theirs).  Even the very remote Tombstone Territorial Park requires early reservations.  It amazes me that this is the case in a country as vast as Canada, but it seems this rule is universal in (popular) Canadian parks.  I understand the rationale behind the rules, but I don't understand how it can possibly work.  Maybe I can somewhat plan where I sleep on a one-night 40 km trip in Algonquin, but if I'm going to hike for 200 km in Jasper National Park, I don't see how it's possible to know where I will sleep 12 days in advance, as this strongly depends on weather and trail conditions, that vary day to day.  If the weather is very bad for a day I might be a day behind, and I would be violating this rule every single day.  What are the consequences of doing so?  Of course, campgrounds may be full, and those who are there on the specified day are going to be annoyed.  But it will surely work out in practice (perhaps by illegally camping outside the campground).  The question is: how do rangers handle the situation?  Are they flexible in enforcing the rules, or may I end up with high fines and be blacklisted for any more backpacking permits in Canada?  (Perhaps the easiest solution is to avoid parks on backpacking trips, but that means avoiding the most scenic areas that have developed trails!) "
778,"What Canadian national/provincial/territorial parks permit random backcountry camping, if any?","From my outdoor experience in the Nordic countries, I'm used to random backcountry camping.  I've never seen a backcountry campground in my life, but I've recently moved to Canada and it seems that in Canadian parks, camping is not permitted anywhere else (short sample: Jasper, Algonquin, Alberta provincial parks, or even Yukon).  Are there any national, provincial, or territorial parks in Canada where random backcountry camping is allowed anywhere at any time?  Or must I simply avoid Canadian parks (and therefore the most scenic areas) if I wish to camp on my own?  (I'm also particularly surprised that even in public land use zones in Alberta, one must be at least 1 km from a road.  This is at odds with my stereotypical view of Canada of tourists parking their camper-van somewhere and sleeping in it.) "
779,Maxpedition Condor 2 unresolved questions,"I am undecided between sitka and condor 2 packs. Can you please answer few of my question so I can deicide on my purchase.   How much can condor 2 be shrunk when all 4 side compression straps are pulled as much as they allow (when main compartment is almost empty)? Will it be thinner than Sitka? Do all condor 2 bags have that ruberry bottom or not (read different stories about that)? I am looking to order from amazon, foliage green version. From the youtube videos I see on some that zippers are turned inwards into the bag so the dust can not get stuck between the zip teeth and on some videos it is the other way around. What is the status with the current condor 2 bags? Can 13 inch macbook air be put in the condor 2 compartment for camel back (water compartment)? Also regarding the size comparison between condor 2 and sitka : Can sitka pack 1 pair of sport shoes, towel, t-shirt, 2 medium sized lunch boxes (not to big) in the main compartment, beside ordinary small stuffs and bottle in other compartments?  "
780,Does windsurfing experience help me to learn kitesurfing?,"I have some experience in windsurfing, meaning that I can perform the basic moves and handle the board and sail under normal to slightly difficult conditions. I have always been interested in Kitesurfing but had never had the opportunity to do it so far. I would like to try it out, but I would really be disappointed if I had to start from scratch and climb the whole learning curve again.   Will my windsurfing experience give me any advantage over complete beginners when starting kitesurfing?   Are there other sports that could be helpful? "
781,Activities at the campsite,"Inspired by a comment by Kate Gregory I just have to ask this question:   What to do on your spare time while being at the campsite?  Being outdoors several days while having good friends around and the weather is gracious with you might be easy. But still, good ideas are welcome. So we could read books, slackline, cook, gather wood for campfires, play the harmonica or guitar, tell some bloody bad-ass bear stories, ...   What to do if it's raining all the time? What to do with kids? What to do if you are going alone? Any other ideas?   Once with a bigger group on a camping trip we played a nice game: Blind cooking! Except some watchdogs and photo-takers we all had our eyes bandaged and had to cook something. Funny game, do you know other creative activities? "
782,Considerations for buying windsurfing boards?,"Which things should I consider when buying a surfboard for windsurfing?   I am particularly interested in the first board after finishing a beginner´s course and gaining sufficient experience on one of that huge beginner boards (220ltrs +).   How should I choose the boards size (volume, length and width)? What do the different styles (freeride, speed,...) available mean? What are other important considerations I should make when I buy a board?  "
783,Are there any phobia-friendly ways to deal with flies?,"I admit that this is not intended exclusively for the great outdoors.  In truth I rarely venture into areas that are wild and overgrown with vegetation, tending to stick to more sub-urban excursions. And a large part of it comes down to having a moderate phobia of flies (a fear sufficient to endanger driving).  Often I find myself faced with my most common of nemeses (both outdoors and in the office (insect screens installed but the smaller ones still get in)).  I could try bug spray - but not only is it less effective against faster and/or smaller flies - its a very short term solution with an ever-replenishing supply of the pests. Not to mention the health impact of spray (I swear some bug sprays include ingredients causing feelings of paranoia - more notable when used indoors)  I could use DEET products - except that I have had allergic reactions to anything other than mild doses (so I mainly apply to hairs rather than the skin these days). that and their effect doesn't quite cut it for keeping them away.  To make things more complicated, I simultaneously cannot stomach use of swatters.  Considering how easy it is to repel mosquitoes, is there no way to keep the flies at bay?  Failing this, is there perhaps a health-friendly way to exterminate the buggers from a distance? "
784,What temperatures can I expect in caves compared to surface?,"If the daily air temperature is between 0 °C to 14 °C, what sort of temperature would be found within caves?  Will it be any colder or warmer? The caves in question (Wombeyan) do not go terribly far underground. "
785,Swimming across a strong current,"Recently I had been to a hike where I had to cross quite a large stream. And I am not so good at swimming either. So after judging the possible depth, I could figure out that I can get across swimming through it. For safety reasons considering a not-so-good kind of guy with me, I picked the shallowest part of the stream. The disadvantage was: The currents were stronger at shallow waters.  So, we had struggle a bit to cross it at first place, and then had to further make our way through slippery rocks of the gorge as we moved ahead with current than we first had anticipated.   When trekking in a group, what is the most efficient way to cross the streams with strong current (If we can't avoid crossing it)? How to swim through rapid flows in a particular direction?  "
786,Resoling climbing shoes yourself,"Does anyone have experience trying to resole climbing shoes using products like the Five Ten resole kits? If so, how involved was the process and how did it turn out?   I'm trying to decide whether to send it off to a professional resoler or try doing it myself. "
787,Thunderstorms in the Canadian Rockies in September?,How frequent are  thunderstorms in the Canadian Rockies in September?  Canadian Climate Normals do not list thunderstorm frequency. 
788,How to get drinking water if I am stuck below Matterhorn summit?,"Suppose I am descending the Matterhorn along the Hörnli ridge, and night falls when I am near the Solvay emergency hut (4003 m; safe bivouac is several hours of descent away). In this case, I believe I should not try descending further, but spend the night there.  I'll need drinking water in this case, but I am not sure where I can get some snow to melt. Can I expect to find snow anywhere along the Hörnli route? What should I do if I find myself running low on water, while starting to descend from the summit?  I am talking about high season here (August). "
789,How can I keep outdoor critters outdoors?,"After 27 years of having indoor-outdoor cats, the last one died in May 2015.  (We now have only an indoor cat.)  During those 27 years, we never had a problem with mice.   During Snowzilla (Jan 2016), the storm that dropped over 29 inches on our area, we sprinkled bird seed under the eaves of our house, in addition to shoveling a space on our patio and stomping snow-shoe trails to the bird-feeders.  At least two mice came in through a space created by the installation of a new heat pump.  Sixteen trapped (and released) mice later, and with the entry space stopped up, we thought the problem solved.  A few months later -- more mice -- twelve trapped, plus one eaten by the indoor cat.  Now, another two months later, more mice.  Short of getting another indoor-outdoor cat, what do you recommend?  What would be ideal would be a spray for the outside that would smell like a cat, and would fool the mice.  We leave no food outdoors, except for in the bird feeders, which are 100 and more feet away from the house.  (We live in a semirural area.)  And, why do you suppose we were free of mice for 8 months until the aftermath of the big snowstorm?  "
790,What are the best methods to clean out a fire pits and dispose of the ash?,"Are there any recommended methods for disposing of ash from fire pits while primitive camping? I have run into several fire pits in National and State forest camping areas where the fire pit or fire ring is already filled with ash to a point that seems excessive and unsafe. What are the recommended methods for clearing the pits to maintain a minimal impact?   I've seen piles of ash just collected near the site. It doesn't seem right to just pile it up though. Is it better to disperse it around the impacted grounds? Would it be better to disperse it deeper away from the actual camping site? Should I pack it out and dump it in the municipal trash?   This is specifically referring to cool, completely extinguished ash. Please be sure to properly put out your fires and allow all ash/coals to sit for an extend amount of time (several days if possible). "
791,Is linen a good or bad choice for underwear when (hitch)hiking in hot and/or tropical weather?,"I've recently learned that linen underwear is great against fungal infections that can be contracted in hot sweaty conditions.  But elsewhere I had read that the best fabrics against sweaty or tropical conditions were synthetic fabrics that provide wicking thus preventing excess moisture build up.  I just arrived in Taiwan where it's 34°C/93°F and plan to hitchhike around Asia for a year, as I've done before.  Previously my biggest problem had been chafing. I've managed to find some synthetic short and trousers, so it should be better this year. But I'm also concerned about fungal infection. I get tinea pedis frequently when wearing shoes and I've had tinea cruris before and think that could be a showstopper for long distance walking in hot/tropical climates.  But so far I still only have cotton underwear. Is synthetic preferable? I think I read somewhere that polyester is the worst in regard to jock itch!  Or what about going with linen when not actively hiking and something else while out on the road? "
792,"Does a small antler really mean ""bad genes""?","I often here hunters talk about ""bad genes"" when it comes to bucks with a small antler. Is this kind of a running gag for trophy hunters or is this actually true? So, does the size of the antler tell anything about the ""evolutionary health"" (I really don't know how this is called :) ) of deer? "
793,Will a laser pointer work for pointing at whitewater?,"I have been doing whitewater kayaking for some time now, and still have a great deal to learn. For difficult places, it is normal for me to stand outside and talk about which lines are good and which places to avoid. More experienced people can simply point out salient features to each other, ""Go right after you have boofed over that ridge, with enough time to steer clear of the undercut rock"". I am still at the stage where I have to learn how to recognize a barely visible ridge, to know where I will need to boof, to spot which one of the dozens of rocks is undercut.   As pointing with a finger only gets us so far, I thought of using a laser pointer. I even found a model which is waterproof (meant for divers). But I am reluctant to try it, as it is expensive enough to hurt if it turns out to be useless.    if I get a laser pointer, will I be able to see the dot on the water surface?  assuming that it works, what would be the minimal strength required to see the dot in direct sunlight?  Again assuming that it works, which colors will work? I was surprised to read some diver mentioning that underwater, green is better than red, but have no idea if this will hold for the surface.  The water surface reflects more like a mirror than like a random solid surface - will this be as damaging for the eyesight as having the pointer itself pointed directly at the eyes? Yes, the water is probably somewhat foamy, but it tends to have still places too.  are there other potential problems with my idea?  are there easier solutions to the same problem?    Update I am specifically asking about good methods for pointing, not for finding the line in other ways. I am more concerned with learning to read the water than with finding the perfect line. To those who don't know what it looks like, the following picture is a good example. The important thing in the picture are not the stones, but the shape and behavior of the water in the different (small) places between them.     "
794,Where to sleep while bike-touring southern Ontario? [x-post from bicycling],"I've been on-and-off planning a (reasonably) short bike tour from the Kitchener area (about 100km west of Toronto, in Canada) to Ottawa/Montreal, followed by a train ride home. I know most of what I need, but the one thing I haven't got figured out is where to stay. I don't have a ton of money and am an experienced camper, which means I'll lean very heavily towards a tent over a motel/hotel where possible.  I know, however, that my route of choice (east along Lake Ontario from Toronto to Kingston, then northwards to Ottawa, and paralleling the Ottawa River to Montreal) is heavily developed and urbanized with nothing but farmland between the cities, which makes camping (even stealth camping) problematic at best. Canada, rather unfortunately, don't have anything like the freedom to roam, which means that, unless I secure specific permission from a landowner, I'm trespassing.  I'm planning about 2 weeks end-to-end, with a couple of days' stop in both Ottawa and Montreal for sightseeing. That works out to about 100km/day, which is achievable for me (especially given the prevailing winds). The general plan is to go a little further on the first day, to get me past Toronto, and to find myself in Belleville by day 3. Day 4 would put me in Kingston, day 5 in Smiths Falls, and day 6 in Ottawa itself. Another day's ride would put me halfway to Montreal, hugging the north side of the river, and the final day would leave me at the journey's end. In both Ottawa and Montreal I'd be staying in hotels, because I don't want to have to worry about my gear while I'm out seeing the sights.  Has anyone here been touring in similar circumstances? What are my best options for a (mostly) stress-free night's sleep in areas like this?  As an addendum, what advice is there for staying in decent (i.e. non-fleabag) hotels with a bike? Is it generally permitted in a room, or do I have to to have it valet-parked? "
795,Putting electronics inside a surfboard?,"I want to put some electronics inside of a surfboard. What would be the best way of doing this?  Just cutting a hole, put electronics in and then cover with like foam, epoxy and glass fibre? "
796,Does acid rain somehow directly harm human beings?,"Hiking in the rain often left me with thoughts about acid rain. I wonder if I'm able to recognize it and if yes, how strong the recognizable symptoms are.   Are there any direct (forest dieback etc. is indirect) harms for humans and animals (like burning skin etc.)? If yes, how should I react when ""stuck"" in acid rain?  "
797,How do I test my water filter?,How can you verify that a water filter still works?  I've had one for several years and I suspect it may not be working.  Is there a way to test and make sure that it still filters to the factory specified microns?    My particular filter is a First Need 
798,Roof rack system suitable for both bicycle and kayak?,"My wife &amp; I are just getting into (non-sea/ocean) kayaking and biking, and we're thinking about ways to transport our equipment on our car.  My guess is that once a pair of cross-bars are set up on a car roof, it would be possible to use it to handle both 2 bikes and 2 kayaks (although obviously, not at the same time -- either 2 bikes or 2 kayaks at one time).  We will be bicycling more often than kayaking, and will be doing this for recreation..., so we're not looking for a serious (expensive or complicated) solution.  Is this accurate?  What do I need to take into consideration?  How difficult is it to swap out mounting hardware for roof racks?  What are better alternatives? "
799,How to walk on the hot beach or rather hot sand?,"Last time I was on vacation in Italy, I decided to go barefooted for a run on the beach in the evening. Lovely idea, wasn't it? It was not! The beach felt like a volcano!   Which gear or techniques are recommended to walk/run on hot sand?  "
800,How does a carabiner handle make sense?,There are a few camping mugs with a carabiner handle.    I wonder how it makes sense? I mean wouldn't it be more flexible to just take a separate carabiner with you? You would be able to use it for other things as well as for attaching your mug.  
801,"Is a compound and cross bow really not ""qualitative"" shooting?","As I've read through this page, I stumbled across this quote:      Notice: This type of target is intended for so called qualitative shooting, it is not intended for shooting with composite bows and crossbows.   Is it really true that we call these kinds of archery ""quality shooting"" or did they want to make a joke (mock compound and crossbow people)? So, is ""quality shooting"" an official term to describe a bunch of disciplines (like traditional archery etc.)?  "
802,"When can a glacier be crossed without special gear (axes, crampons, rope, etc.)?","As a child, I remember walking with my family over the Gornergletscher to reach the Monte Rosa-Hütte.  I remember the same for crossing Vadret da Diavolezza.  In both cases, we did not have crampons and and did not use a rope.  We tried the same for the Mèr de Glace, but turned around as it was too icy.  In all cases, there were many other people.   Vadret da Morteratsch,   The hiking book Walking and Trekking in Iceland notes that     Eyjabakkajökull is often crossed by walkers without ice axes, crampons, or ropes   Under what circumstances can a glacier be safely crossed without special gear?  How do I judge if this can be done? "
803,Practical uses for commando/Australian rappel?,"Having watched several Bear Grylls shows, I was curious if anyone has any practical uses for a ""commando rappel"", as he calls it, or an ""Australian rappel"". It seems like they're only used for entertainment since I've never seen anyone do one outside of television. On the other hand, their name suggests an origin in military training (perhaps so one could shoot down while rappelling?)  It was briefly mentioned here as being dangerous.  Are there any practical uses for a commando rappel, or is it simply unnecessary and dangerous? "
804,MSR Sweetwater dripping,"I just bought an MSR Sweetwater pump for a trip next week.  I'm pumping a few quarts now to clean it out, and notice that there is constant dripping water out of the pressure relief valve at the top (maybe three or four drops per stroke -- not a lot by any means).  There is certainly not a strong stream of water.  I scrubbed out the filter a couple times first as instructed.  I've never used one of these.  Is this the normal behavior?  If not, can I still go ahead and use it for the trip? "
805,Fishing Rods: One Piece or Two Piece,"A number of fishing rods you can buy have models that are 2 piece and models that are 1 piece. I have heard people say their rods snapped in half when they were 2 piece. However, it would be extremely beneficial as far as portability to have 2 piece. What are the pros/cons of each? Would one be better than the other? Since this may be brand specific, I am thinking mostly about Shakespeare Ugly Stik models, but any general information would help!   "
806,Should you occasionally use locking biners on pieces of protection when using alpine draws?,"Since I mostly climb trad style, I don't use quickdraws for leading outside of the gym. I use alpine quick draws (two biners joined by dyneema slings) which offer benefits of adjustable length, reduced rope drag, and most importantly reduced movement (which reduces the chance a piece of protection wanders out).  There are some downsides to this, however: two of them being that gates of biners on alpine draws are more likely to open (at least with non-wiregate biners), and without the stabilizers found on ordinary quickdraws, the biners are more likely to move around (meaning the gate gets reversed or, even worse, ends up horizontal and a fall will load the gate—the reason I don't use wiregates for alpine draws).  I've heard before that, because of the above, it makes sense to place a draw with a locking biner every so often when you're at a place where you have an extra second to do so (easy spot, maybe a ledge).   What's everyone think of this? Anyone do this? Is it really necessary? Do you use two locking biners, or just one where the rope goes through? "
807,What clothing would be suitable for hiking and camping in 0°C?,"I intend to hike and camp where the forecast temperature is around freezing.  It can get windy in exposed areas, but I would be starting low and camping amongst the snow gums.  During the day air temperature is typically 5C. Can be windy, 30kmh up to 60km (although not if you trust this forecast).     I don't want to over pack or get cold. I have not camped in temperatures this cold previously.  Does this sound appropriate?   beanie and sunglasses long sleeve polypropylene top fleece for insulation layer waterproof shell for rain/high wind (it is gortex, I think) long polypropylene pants full length cargo pants (these are cotton) waterproof/windproof over-pants (overkill?) thick wool socks and hiking boots waterproof gloves   My sleeping bag is rated to -8C ""comfort"", so I assume that will be sufficient.  I also have one of those small self-inflating mats for ground insulation.  I have a small three-season tent.  It's only a short weekend trip.  Friday night will be camping by the car (elevation 350m), and obviously I can take all manner of warm things.  Saturday morning, drive to start and then walk to Wombat Creek (elevation 1400m) and set up camp.  Depending on energy/time/weather, then explore further.  Sunday, return to car and home.  NB. Similar to this question, but a 18 degree difference seems significant enough to me that the answers would be different. "
808,What would happen if I use a USA (GMRS/FRS) two-way radio in Europe?,"This question is the opposite from this one: What would the consequences of using a US two-way radio (GMRS/FRS) in Europe? I know Europe has their own frequency range for two-way radios (PMR), but for the moment let's remove buying new radios from the list.  Does anyone else use the same frequencies (does the radio channel matter)? Would I be able to hear official chatter?  If I were to broadcast, who (besides my intended receiver) would hear me, and would they come looking for me? Would I risk interfering with anything? "
809,Protecting Food Supplies from wild animals While Backpacking,"A group of 4 plan on hiking across Michigan's UP's Ottawa National Forest. We are finishing up our plans and have one last issue with food that we aren't sure how to handle.  We know you are supposed to tie a bag with all food/cooking/smelly materials 12 feet above ground, as to not allow a bear to get a hold of it. What about raccoons and other, smaller animals that may be able to climb down the rope?   We may be being paranoid, I don't know, but will raccoons be a threat against our food hung in a tree 12ft above the ground?  Note: we plan on using a basic mesh bag for this trip. Is this a bad idea? Bear proof bags are probably not in for consideration, but I was told in the past they really weren't necessary to begin with unless in Grizzly Bear country. "
810,"What do you hang on 1/4"" bolts while rock climbing?","So 1/4"" bolts, although not suitable for free climbing protection, are apparently still used for aid climbing to hold body weight, and for alpine rappels.   What I want to know is, what do you use for hangers on them? From what I can tell no one makes 1/4"" hangers for aid bolts, do you just string them with a rivet hanger (which are twice as expensive as bolt hangers), or do you just use the 3/8"" hangers? Is there something else out there that's made to be used as a hanger for a 1/4"" bolt? "
811,What is a hammock ridgeline and how do I use it?,"I'm working my way into ultralight backpacking (Knee problems) and have taken interest in hammock camping to drop weight during the summer months. I've hung and slept in hammocks before and found them quite comfortable, but I hadn't heard of a ridgeline until I bothered to look for a solution to rain/bad weather (kinda necessary in the Pacific Northwest).  My question contains several parts (forgive me if these are brutally obvious):   What is a hammock ridgeline? Where is it attached (to the hammock, the attachment points, etc)? What do I use it for? "
812,Why do some climbing ropes have smaller load bearing than some paracords?,"I'm not sure what kind of climbing ropes they are exactly, but the ones I saw online (a bunch of them...) are usually twice as thick (10mm~) as most paracords (4mm~) yet the paracords claim to have twice as much load bearing! Why??? Does that make the paracords stronger? "
813,What's the best way to avoid slipping on ice?,"Where I live, winter is still a good bit away, but last year I slipped on ice and ended up with a black eye and a broken wrist. This year I sincerely want to reduce the chances of that recurring.  I am wondering what common materials you can use to increase the co-efficient of friction between the soles of your shoes and the ice.  Sure, you can wear heavy iceboots with ridges, but then it's a hassle having to put them on and off when entering the house, especially the serious mountain type ones.  Two questions that users in cold climates might be able to answer to save myself trouble this winter,    Are rubber soles the best alternative to heavy boots, or has anyone found another material that maximises friction with the ice? Is  there a walking style that minimises your chances of a fall?   Penguins (and some other winter hardened birds) seem to have the ability to keep their balance, although in the penguins case, possibly at a cost of the most undignified walking/waddling in the animal kingdom.    On TV,  you do see them slip occasionally , but they seem to manage ok with a high center of gravity, unless they deliberately want to slide on their stomachs. "
814,What is the difference between back-stepping versus a layback in rock climbing?,"At the gym today, a climber referred to ""back-stepping"" for a move that I would have referred to as a layback. I said, ""I would have called that a layback,"" and he said, ""Yeah, the difference is kind of subtle."" (Clearly nobody is talking about back-stepping the rope, which is simply a mistake.) This guy is a 5.11 leader, so I assume he knows what he's talking about.  Can anyone explain the difference?  Does back-stepping simply mean turning your body sideways, while a layback implies using your arms to apply pressure at your feet and gain stronger friction? "
815,Backpacking Through Rain,"My friends and I are setting off on a hike this Friday through Michigan's UP. I've been watching the forecast which, to be fair, is never accurate in Michigan. Nonetheless, it shows a good amount of rain. We have been planning this for a little over 3 months now, and already have the time taken off work so moving the trip isn't possible.  What precautions should you take when going on a backpacking trip around the length of one week?  We are water-proofing our bags and tents tonight, and all of our food are in safe containers to keep that dry as well.  How would we dry wet clothes, if need be?  I don't think cold will be too much of an issue during the day - it should be in the mid 70's consistently, but at night it can get down pretty low (40 is normal, could be lower).  If we need to dry clothes/towels/bags/etc WHILE it is raining, what methods are best?  This may not even be possible. We may just be stuck avoiding getting our clothing wet, which shouldn't be much of an issue. "
816,Rock climbing grading theory,"How to grade a route when cumulating grades for multiple sections? Is it based on the overall feeling of difficulty or is there some cumulative formula to apply which yields a more or less accurate grade?  In the following explanation, I'll use the french sport climbing grading system (see link for details).  This question is better explained by using an example:  The route ""Chilam Balam"" is a long route (80m) which is made of 3 sections. In [website]This route was rated 9b+ during the original ascent, but then 9b by Adam Ondra and even 9a+ by other repeaters.  Is there a formula where 8c+ + 8c + 8b = 9b?  In bouldering too, I heard things like ""it's an 8B that goes into an 8A+, so the overall grade is 8B+"".  If there is no formula, what is the difference between a short 9a route and a long one? Like a long 9a is just an 8c that is really long?   I also heard that you could explain sport climbing routes using bouldering grades, for example a route that contains a 7A boulder problem is ~8a (that is, you add +1 to the boulder grade to get the sport climbing grade). "
817,Hiking in France in August - Grenoble,I know that in the mountains around Grenoble there are some huts. I would like to go on a two-day hike and spend a night in such hut. I mean how much snow there is? How low can a temperature drop during the day and at night? Are there avalanches? 
818,What's the best or easiest way to attach a loop tag onto canvas?,What's the best or easiest way to attach a loop tag onto a canvas tent?   A loop tag is a loop of canvas so that I can tie a guy string to the loop tag and then down to a stake so that I can implement the solution to this question.   Should I sew it on? Glue it on? What type of glue? 
819,Eye safety when starting a fire with a magnifying glass,"TL;DR  What are some reasonable (ie: safe, portable, reusable) ways to start a fire with a magnifying glass without damaging my eyes from staring at the focused sunlight?  Background  I recently started practicing some different fire starting techniques than I usually use, including starting a fire with a magnifying glass. When starting a fire with a magnifying glass, you focus the sun's light into a small but super-bright spot on a material to heat it up.   Image Source: ScienceABC    My biggest problem when trying to light my kindling with a magnifying glass is keeping track of the blindingly bright spot that is necessarily part of this process. It is difficult for me to keep track of what I am doing since I try not to stare at the bright spot too much. Looking straight at the spot for an extended time is dangerous to your eyesight.  The last two times I tried this I have burned spots into my vision. One of the times I gave myself temporary color blindness for a while.  Per comment by fgysin, I will try to find something more than my anecdotal evidence for the danger of this.  Criteria  Now I'm worried about this and want to make sure I stay safe. Fire safety factors aside for this question; I am asking strictly about eye safety, and strictly about over-exposure to sunlight when concentrating said sunlight with a magnifying glass.  Some criteria to make a good answer:   Must allow user to look at the focused spot without damaging eyes Must allow user to look at the focused spot long enough to start a fire with it (One minute is probably more than enough once I get better; less is needed in optimal conditions) Must be reusable a lot of times. If the method requires something to be continually replaced, like batteries, then I might as well just bring matches and keep replacing them Should be portable for recreational use such as while camping or hiking; the more portable the better since I would like to take it in a long-duration hiking pack.   Please keep other reasonable factors in mind, even if I have neglected to mention them.    Some ideas I had which I don't think will work  These ideas can form a baseline by demonstrating what I think is almost reasonable but not quite good enough. If you think I am wrong about any of the following, then please do make an answer refuting my worry.   Sunglasses Welding mask Mirror Phone camera (or other digital camera) for indirect viewing   The sunglasses I assume are not strong enough, and after my previous two attempts I'm too scared to try it.  A welding mask would technically work but it is big and bulky and would serve no other purpose.  My welding mask does allow me to remove the small viewing ""window"" from it, essentially allowing me to hold up a small (approximately 2-or-3 inch by 3-or-4 inch) light-blocking lens. This is almost an answer, but my welding mask requires batteries to operate.   Likewise, other bulky eclipse-viewing devices should be considered out of scope if they are not easily portable.  A mirror just redirects the problem, I think, but maybe there is a clever way to use a small hand mirror to safely redirect the image that I'm not aware of.  I have read that some cameras can be damaged by imaging the sun if I use it a lot combined with the magnifying glass, I'm afraid it will be ruined and therefore not be a good solution.   So, does anyone have any ideas for how to do this without going blind after a few camping trips?  Experience from people who do start their camp fires with magnifying glasses is obviously great but not necessary, so please don't hesitate to pitch in with ideas you think could work. If they sound safe, I'll try to attempt them.    Update  All the answers here have provided great tools (+1 all) for the magnifier-lit fire, and you should add all of them to your fire-lighting skill set. I have found that a combination of them works best.  Since getting the advice from you guys nearly 2 years ago, I have started many, many fires with magnifying glasses. It has even become one of my primary fire starting methods as long as the sun cooperates.  All of the answers were great, but since I can only accept 1 I accepted the one which was closest to what I actually prefer doing now, and which also is the most direct answer to the question the way I asked it.  Now that I've honed the skill, I have even added an answer of my own, and I have also included in that answer my commentary on the other answers, combining them all together and discussing some of their synergies.

820,How do people camp on ice?,"When walking on Hofsjökull glacier in Iceland, I wondered: how do people camp on multi-day trekking trips across icecaps, such as when crossing Greenland?  My primary choice of tightening a tent is to put pins into the soil; this doesn't work on ice.  My second choice is to use rocks to fasten my guy lines; this doesn't work either on an ice cap.  How would I fasten my tent?  And not to forget, it can be very windy on those ice caps and glaciers, as there are no obstacles. "
821,Is this rock I found on the Toiyabe Crest Trail an arrowhead?,"I found this arrowhead-shaped rock on the Toiyabe Crest trail in Nevada, USA. I'm wondering if it actually is an arrowhead. It's about 1.5 inches long.    The reasons that I think it could be is that it's about the right shape and the edges looked like it had been sharpened. It also has what looks like a notch on one side (pointed to with the red arrow). It was also of a different kind of rock than everything else in the immediate area.  Could it be an arrowhead? "
822,What is a dish or dish-like hand hold in rock climbing?,"I saw mention of a 'dish' hold, and cannot figure out what this means exactly from Google searches. There are many sites selling dish holds like this one, but I don't understand what 'dish' means from the pictures. Plates? Something to do with their flatness?  "
823,"What exactly constitutes a ""road"" in Iceland?","In Iceland, off-roading is strictly prohibited.  Unfortunately, it still happens and one can find tracks of off-roading all over the central highlands.  On the other hand, in the landscape, some roads that are mapped on Atlaskort do not look like much more than some tracks in the landscape either, and may have neither an F-number nor a sign where they depart from larger roads.  Under these circumstances, how would I tell a road from a place where several cars have illegally off-roaded before?  Must a road have an F-number to be permissible for driving?  If I have a (possibly old) map that shows a road somewhere, and I subsequently see that road in the landscape, does that mean driving there is fine, or is there some more official source stating what exactly are the roads that are officially recognised? "
824,What kind of baby carrier is best for use walking and climbing in the hills?,"I'm going to be a Dad for the first time early next year. My wife and I are very active outdoorsy kind of people. I've started looking at a baby carrier so we can take our wee one out on short walks and for me when I take our dogs out for a walk (which I do a couple of times a day).   I want a carrier as we live quite rural and a lot of the places I go on a day to day basis have no pavements, etc. So a pram simply won't be practical. I also often climb the local hills and I'd like to take the baby with me occasionally.   Looking at baby carriers though there is a bewildering array of different styles, positions, etc. From the high end fully outdoors backpacks:    Source  To simple baby slings:    source  Obviously money is a factor here, we've got a baby on the way, we're not exactly flush for cash so I don't want to spend a lot.   Given activities such as:   Gentle hill walks Walking in low country   What kind of carrier should I be looking for? What features do I want, which are over kill and which are required? "
825,How to get a beached pontoon boat back into the water?,"My neighbor has asked me to pull their pontoon boat out of the lake to store for winter.  However, this particular boat has been beached, so much so that I cannot push it back in to the water which I need to do before I can store it.    I'd like get it out of the lake before the lake freezes and potentially damages the boat and the boat ramp is on the other side of the lake.  What are some tips on the best/easiest way to get the boat back in to the water?.....aside from the obvious, pull with rope from another boat and push from shore?  Update: I took a picture of the boat, it's worse than I thought.  Unfortunately there is no easy way to get to the beach where it stuck, with any equipment, due to a large hill.  I do not have a lot of manpower available, just 2-3 guys.  Thanks. "
826,Can horses ford deeper/faster rivers than humans?,"Is it safe to follow a equestrian trail and assume I can ford where the horse-trail does?  Or should I expect equestrians to ford rivers too deep or swift to ford on foot?  I'm thinking of the situation in Iceland, where the topographic map may suggest routes for hikers or equestrians, and some of those may ford quite sizeable rivers. "
827,Can a click-up belay tool cause rope wear?,"I am regularly using the Click-Up belay device from Climbing Technologies together with a 40-meters rope from Edelrid I bought recently.  Now, after using the two only about 10 times together (always indoors) I noticed that there is abnormally strong wear on the rope but only on the second half, i.e. the part of the rope that is needed when lowering the climber.  Therefore, I am wondering if anybody else has observed something like this? Or whether it might be related to edges highlighted in the picture below?    The edges don't seem to be extremely sharp but the only thing I can imagine that could cause this problem, in particular because when lowering the other climber and pushing the rope over to the left (so that it's running over the dark gray plastic part), I see pilling (from the rope) is collecting there.  Some additional information:   The rope is 9.8 mm in diameter (it's the Edelrid Freedom), so within the recommended range given by the manufacturer (8.6 - 10.5 mm). There is some wear on the caribiner but it doesn't really have sharp edges. My (very subjective) definition of ""abnormally strong wear"" is based on other people being surprised by the wear of my rope in comparison to theirs (made by different manufacturers and used with different belay devices), and on my feeling that after 10 times (some 30-40 hours) a rope shouldn't look like one long toothbrush... We both are rather lightweight (~ 65 kg).   Here's some photos to illustrate what I mean:   Part of the rope that shows strong wear  The first meters still look good as new (this is the same rope although the color seems different in the photos...)  The carabiner (which belongs to the Click-up and is a few years older than the rope) has some dents which could be related...  And finally, this is what is looks like after lowering somebody.   "
828,Why is there a cock vane/feather?,"Last weekend I went to the range with a youngster. Naturally he was very curious and asked me a lot of question. One of them was, why there even was a cock feather which needs to be pointed away from the bow.  Well, I had to admit that I don't really know the exact reason for it. So why do we need the cock feather concept?     Clarification for lay people:  Every arrow has a so called cock feather. It's basically just the same as the others but in a different color (not necessary but is a common practice). This feather indicates how the arrow needs to be positioned on the bow.     Often the cock feather points to the left on traditional bows. On compound bows it's either up or down (can't remember and I'm not a compound shooter).   This is just something you get told when doing a course. ""The cock feather needs to point to the left."" But why is this the case?  "
829,How long until I develop immunity to stomach flu / travelers' disease?,"I was in Nepal two years ago and got the stomach flu. Last time I was only in Kathmandu and Pokhara and didn't do any trekking, so it was not critical, although it was very unpleasant.  Two years later, now, I am in Nepal again. I thought surely I would have developed some kind of immunity.  I was proven wrong when I reached Annapurna base camp and got the stomach flu there. Needless to say the next days trekking down where a pure nightmare.  When I got back in Kathmandu, feeling better, I got another version of the stomach flu again.  Can I expect to develop immunity against these diseases? I am planning on doing the Everest base camp expedition in another two years, but am now having doubts if this is a good idea. I really am not mentally prepared to walk sick for days like that again.  How do other people deal with this kind of problem? I had anti diarrhoea meds with me, but they did absolutely nothing for me. "
830,How is elevation gain and change measured for hiking trails?,"If a trail is listed as 1500m of elevation change, what exactly does that mean?  For example, if the trail goes up 500m, then down 200m, then up 100m, then down 300m, then up 400m, is that considered a 1500m (500+200+100+300+400) elevation change trail?  Or would it be 500m elevation change, since the end is 500m above the start? "
831,Can I tie down ski/snow board to my roof rack like a canoe?,"I have raised cross bar on my SUV roof as the image shows:  I also got a couple 15ft. long Thule ratchet straps for tie-down canoes.    Now my question is, can I tie down ski and snowboards on the roof without a ski holder? How safe is it on high way? Any good setup examples?  Any instruction or tip is welcome. I am not skiing enthusiast so I prefer not to invest in a ski holder.  "
832,Start a fire with key fob battery?,"We know that you can start a fire with a battery. the better prepared you are the easier it is going to be.  I am not prepared and all I have in my pockets is my car keys, which includes a keyless entry fob that has a '3v Lithium Coin Cell Battery'  is it possible to start a fire with this battery?  All I have is the metal key ring, finger nail clippers, and a couple of other keys on the ring.  I don't have a tiny screwdriver to get the battery out, so I am going to have to use a rock to break the key fob.  I suspect that banging two rocks together would be a more effective fire starter, but I might be wrong.   Can I start a fire with  my key fob battery? "
833,When did wearing a helmet become the norm for climbing?,"This is going out primarily to those who have been climbing for 20yrs + Back in the day, helmet use was optional and not particularly popular. These days, things seemed to have taken a dramatic change. Do you always use a helmet? Do you only use a helmet on Trad Climbs? What about sport climbs or indoor walls?  I am looking for both pros and cons on wearing a helmet, please.  I am also interested in when and why helmet wearing became the norm.  Was the transition gradual, or was there a person or event that prompted the change to helmets?  I own a helmet, wear one, but at times climb without one. "
834,What could I keep in rucksack hip pocket?,"My rucksack has a small pocket on the hip belt, but I can’t think of anything useful to keep in it while day hiking. What types of things is such a pocket intended for? If there is no common purpose for such a pocket, what are some things I could keep in it that would be useful? "
835,What is a good way to clean the inside of a water bottle straw while on a multi-day backpacking trip?,"When coming back from a day of hiking and eating I often notice that the top of the straw of my water bottle is dirty on the inside.  I've come across quite a few options to clean the inside of the straw with tools such as brushes, pipe cleaner, or a dishwasher.   However, when on a multi-day hike, with only the equipment you can carry in your pack, these implements will likely not be on hand.  In the past, I've drawn some water up the straw on the cleaner side and blew the water out on the more dirty side.  This does help some but what I'm wondering is if there a more thorough way of getting the inside of the straw clean without the typical household items?  This questions assumes you didn't pack any replacement straws or little brushes, as shown below, specifically for this purpose.    Source: Amazon.com "
836,Hiking and camping with medium size dog and keeping safe from mountain lions,"For some reason I have had multiple encounters with mountain lions.  In my 20's while camping in a somewhat remote campground near the continental divide in CO I woke to a large mountain lion laying outside our tent but half on top of me. Guess it was getting warm. I was able to get out from under it then listened as it got up and walked around the tent. When it got to the side where the tent had a window I looked out and saw it was a good sized lion.   There was only one other group in the camp ground that early spring. We never went back there. Lucky to be alive.   Since that time, I have been stalked 3 times when hiking off trails and seen cats multiple times while on trails. This has freaked me out enough that I'm especially afraid to bring my dog on hikes.   Why would cats be so drawn to me (or my dog)? I wasn't menstruating or carrying food usually and had at least one other person with me. I miss hiking so much, but am afraid I won't be able to protect my dog and others near me.   What do you suggest as prevention? Gun laws are so strict. "
837,Is there anywhere to dive in the Mediterranean that's like the Red Sea?,"Have heard great things about diving in the Red Sea.  However,  Egypt's not the most stable and safe place to visit.  What are the alternative locations for diving in the European side of the Mediterranean where there's similar diving experience?    Thinking pretty fish,  abundant life and good visibility.  Have dived in France and Spain where these are ""OK"" but not the amazing colourful experience which the Red Sea's purported to be.  Oh and wrecks.  We all like diving in wrecks,  especially those covered in life.    Anyone have any suggestions for pretty fish in the Med?    Not many answers;  could we expand this question to: Where is the 'prettiest' place in the Mediterranean to dive with lots of fish and interesting things to see?  Is it better in the west or east,  south or north? "
838,What is the life expectancy of Propane/CO detector?,"NOTE the following is while the camper is unoccupied and stored in my back yard.  The Propane/CO detector in my camper started going off randomly a few weeks ago. I thought it was from some random issue that I had caused invertably. I pushed reset and everything was fine for a while.  Then a couple to a few days later I would find it going off again.  Now it will not reset. I have ordered a new one, after validating there is no GAS leak or CO issue.    Comments in reviews for a similar model suggest the expected life is 5 years, but some indicate less then a year. (product link on Amazon.com )MTI Industries 35-742-WT Safe T Alert 35 Series Dual LP/CO Alarm - Flush Mount, White  I know in the old days many CO detectors had a life of one event. If it went off, you had to replace it, no reset.   I suspect that my fumes from mowing with my old lawnmower are getting into the camper, and causing some of the alerts.    What is the life expectancy of Propane/CO detector?  Do trace amounts of propane or CO impact the life expectancy? "
839,Can I eat Rabbit Poop?,"I know that rabbits eat their droppings (cecotropes) and I have heard of feeding rabbit droppings to pigs.  Rabbits are vegetarians. There droppings do not have the same consistency or negative secondary factors as carnivores or omnivores (i.e. people, dogs, cats, etc). In essence rabbit poop is partially digested plant material.  In a survival situation, finding and catching rabbits can be done, but it's not easy. Finding and picking up rabbit droppings, would be a lot easier.  Can a person safely eat rabbit droppings? If yes is there any nutritional value in it?   Note: this question is only about the fecal droppings NOT the cecotropes.  Cecotropes are NOT easy to find. "
840,Yellowstone back country camping trip?,"My wife and I are trying to figure out if back country camping in Yellowstone is something we are prepared for. We've never done this before, so the planning is the hardest part for us right now. We would like to stay 3-4 days. I have a series of questions that are broken up individually.    What type of supplies are needed (beyond tent, sleeping bag)?  If we are going to do some day hikes, what should we realistically expect to take and leave behind? Food, water, tent, etc. Are any hikes &amp;/ campsites recommended?  "
841,How can I improve on the straps on my travel pack?,"I'm not back packing in the wilderness. I hope that doesn't disqualify me from asking a question that I think is still relevant for back-packers in general.  I have an MEI Travel Pack that I'm pretty happy with.  I used it for a 1-month back packing trip through central Mexico last month.  The main thing I don't like about it, is how cumbersome it is to adjust the straps on the exterior of the bag:    Getting these straps (there are two) tight takes a while. I have to loosen it by pulling the strap through, so there's some give between the buckle and the clasp (is that a proper term?). Then I close the bag, and tighten it, then work the strap through the clasp until it lies flat again (as pictured).  Is there a better mechanism I can use to make tightening this down much quicker, while keeping it secure?  Removing the clasp would make tightening easy, but it wouldn't hold.  Is there some kind of clamp I can put in place of the clasp, that I could open when packing the bag, and close it down on the tightened strap to keep it secure during use? "
842,"The outdoors, solitude and dealing with loneliness","I have been out camping a few times, once with a group, the other times with my girlfriend. Although I enjoyed those times very much, I often wondered what would it feel like to enjoy the complete solitude of nature on my own. But every time i think of it, the combination of solitude and nightfall together seem to freak me out. I just cannot handle it. Last night around 11 I went for a bike ride and as soon as I left the last houses and malls, and saw the big open sky and the lake, I got spooked and turned back. What a shame!  My questions are:   How do you deal with loneliness and solitude on a a solo camping trip? Does loneliness make the trip more or less enjoyable? Does dealing with solitude in wilderness make you feel like a stronger person when you return?  "
843,How do I store my sleeping bag for long periods?,   Possible Duplicate:   What is the best way to store my sleeping bag for long periods of time?       We're at the point where we have more than one set of gear.  We use different gear for different hikes.  One of my sleeping bags will only see use once or twice a year at most.  What is the best way to store it so that is is not destroying or damaged during storage? 
844,Turkey Broadheads,"I have seen many specialty broadheads for turkey hunting, like the Magnus Bullheads.  What are the benefits of specialty turkey broadheads and are they necessary or can I use normal broadheads I would use for whitetails?  Also are there any benefits to meat retention? "
845,What to look for when purchasing a fixed blade knife,I'm planning on doing some back country canoe camping this summer.  I would like to avoid bringing a hatchet if possible.  I also find my folding knifes get full of gunk and I am a little bit afraid I am going to poison myself.     What should I look for when buying a fixed blade knife? What materials are the best? What is the ideal length? What kind of sheath should I look for?     I am in Canada so if anyone has any specific recommendations on where to get a good knife that would be helpful too. 
846,What is the most suitable cooking equipment to use for a long duration in central asia countries?,"I'm about to go on a 2 month trip from England to Mongolia via  Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakstan to mention a few far flung countries. Ideally I'd want a gas stove top such that refuelling the canister wouldn't be a problem.  Is gas the best solution, or would some sort of alcohol based fuel be better? If I was to use gas, could I take with me a 'universal' adapter of sorts in order to use local canisters? "
847,Is there a kayak / paddleboard for large people?,"I am a very large man - I am 6'4"" and weigh 450 pounds (I've lost a 100 pounds in the last year).  I bike or walk everyday, (and swim laps occasionally) but want to add another sport to my exercise routine.  I live in a gated community with 5 lakes - so I have a lot of places to go just outside my door.   Does anyone know of a good resource to find a kayak or paddle board for large people?   Are you a large person already been down this path? I really haven't seen anything out there - I assume most people my size really don't do such things - but I can swim over a mile nonstop now so I have no fear of getting out on the water.   "
848,What can an injured person in the outdoors do to prevent infection by flesh-eating bacteria?,"Perhaps you've heard about Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old adventurer who contracted a flesh-eating disease after getting injured in a zip line accident over the Tallapoosa River. She's already lost her leg to the rare disease, and doctors say she may lose her hands and remaining foot.  I understand that this disease is extremely rare and nearly impossible to predict when considering all the things that may go wrong during an outdoor outing. But what could Copeland have done following the zip line accident that may have prevented her from contracting the disease? What can someone like you or me do to make sure it doesn't happen to us? "
849,Where and how is it allowed to hunt cougars in the US?,"Cougar population is in decline. I wonder where the hunt for them is still possible in the US? Also what are the specific regulations for the hunt (especially in regards to the endangerment of the species)? Asking for facts including without limitation for example seasons, open gender, amount per hunter/state etc. "
850,Are Trangia and MSR fuel bottles inter changeable?,"In other words, could I purchase a 1 litre Trangia fuel bottle and the MSR Dragonfly liquid-fuel camp stove and use them together? Or would the smaller, slightly more expensive MSR fuel bottle be the only option with the stove? "
851,Is it possible to have wild meat inspected or graded?,"Is there any way to get wild meat inspected and graded in the same (or similar) way as domestic meats for parasites, contaminants, etc.?  If so what are good starting resources or methods for finding a local source for grading? "
852,How do I check paracord to determine if it's genuine?,"Given some paracord, is there a simple check that I can make to check that it's genuine and not the cheaper knock off stuff? Number of strands seems like the most obvious point, but is there anything else I should check?  Sometimes the cheaper knock off stuff has its place when strength isn't required, but for uses such as repairing guy ropes in windy environments, I wouldn't really want to chance it! "
853,What gear for sleeping in wild camping in western Scotland in May?,"I intend to go camping in Scotland (mainly the Isle of Mull, that is Western, central Scotland) next week, i.e. last week of May. I have read quite a lot about the weather and know I should prepare for wetness, unexpected changes in cloudiness, midges, possible wind, and 2 to 15 °C temperatures at day. However, I could not find much information regarding the sleeping part of wild camping.  What kind of temperatures should I prepare for at night, and what kind of gear (sleeping bag grade) does it mean taking?  Considering the wind and rain, may I take a standard tent, or are the winds really strong at night? Is there any specific advice beyond securing all pegs and stretching strings far away? "
854,Under which conditions are weather forecasts reliable?,"All outdoors activities precautions include taking note of the weather forecasts for the day.  However, I have seen those forecasts be terribly wrong in many places, even for a two-hours ahead prediction.  So, what are the conditions that make weather forecasts reliable? Up to what duration?    Example:  In the French riviera, near the Alps (Nice backcountry), where both the sea and high (~1200m) mountains are within 10 km, the weather forecasts are totally unreliable, from one day on the next one, but even from 8 AM (storms announced, rain visible) to 11 AM (storms announced, bright sun visible).  Inversely, in central France (Burgundy), in a much more continental weather,  predictions are reliable up to 2 days ahead with good confidence, both for temperatures and rain. 1 hour-ahead to-the-minute rain predictions are correct 90% of the time.  Based on that limited experience, I would tend to say that sea and mountains are reasons for unreliability. But up to which distance? What about oceans? From which heights to mountains impact? Are certain seasons more error-prone than others? etc etc "
855,How do I correctly clean (remove) Tri-Cams?,"Tri-Cams have a reputation for fitting where other protection will not, and they are light weight and inexpensive compared to SLCDs.  Unfortunately they also have a reputation for being hard to clean (remove from the rock) after being set.  Therefore:   What is the correct technique to remove Tri-Cams? Do some nut tools work better than others for these? What should be considered during placement to prevent getting one stuck?    "

My question is what are some good gym exercises to prepare for a 8 day trek in Himalayas? We go a max height of 5000m at thorung la pass. Are there exercises specifically to train you for lack of oxygen? Or does any aerobic exercise(running,biking,swimming) count? "
857,What should I replace guylines with?,"I need to replace some guylines on one of my tents. I normally use some paracord lying around but they have been getting tripped over more and more.   I found some glow in the dark paracord, but before I buy this stuff I wanted to know, has anyone used it? How well does it work? Is there something else I am better off using to prevent kids from tripping over it? "
858,Eating Matches to repel insects?,I have heard that eating the tips off a few match heads can help keep the bugs off of you. Supposedly you sweat out the sulfur and it repels the bugs. Has anyone else heard this or is there any truth to it? Is it harmful? Would garlic work better?   Note: I have this on and off for years from random people and always assumed it was hogwash. 
859,How to toughen up hands?,"So I climb. It keeps my hands pretty rough, but for my day job I am a desk jockey now. I was wondering, are there exercises can I do to keep my hands rough so they don't get torn to shreds when I do get out?

860,Rules for Carrying flammable subtances in UK,"I am planning for a trek in Northern and Eastern parts of England. I am planning to cover the Hull to Liverpool section of the Trans Pennine Trail, which is roughly 290 km or 180 miles.  I have managed and planned for accommodation and camp-sites. As the weather in England is rainy most of the time of the year, I need a way to set-up a bonfire if I am allowed to. In India, we have a lot of restrictions on carrying flammable substances like Kerosene, Rockel, etc.  Are there any restrictions in England about carrying them? Whats the best organization or local body to fetch that information? "
861,Does drinking tea cause problems at altitude?,I've heard from a tour leader that you shouldn't drink tea in high altitude because it makes you thirsty and cause problem in blood circulation. Is this true? Should'nt we drink tea in high altitude?

What is the safest thing to do, to minimise the risk of injury (or worse) as a result of a lightning strike?  Should I stay where I am, cuddle up in my sleeping bag remaining on my sleeping pad?  Or should I get out and crouch on top of my sleeping pad, while minimising the surface area of my contact with the ground?  Am I safer inside my tent or outside?

864,How to anchor a raft on a river,"The past couple years I've been taking a homemade raft out onto the Charles River in Boston to see the fireworks on July 4th (think an old boxspring mattress holding 4 people). One problem we always run into is anchoring the boat in the middle of the river (about 10-20ft deep, ~5mph current).   I'd like to have the raft anchored to stay in a specific orientation (so it's easier to view the fireworks), and also strong enough to not move downstream. What kind of anchors should I use, what weight, and how many? Also, is there a specific technique used to drop anchors?  Previously, I tried just attaching 2 10lb weights and dropping them on opposite sides of the raft, but that didn't work out well. We still seemed to be drifting and turning. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! "

What differences are there between different countries? "
866,What is SPF in sunscreen cream?,What is SPF in sunscreen creams? I go to 2500m-4000m altitude. What should I use? And I've heard that SPF more than 55 is not for men. Does more SPF mean more sun protection?   
867,"If a national park trail with its campsites has been decommisioned, can I still hike and camp there?","I am considering a hike along the Canadian Great Divide Trail from Jasper southward.  As described in Dustin Lynx' book Hiking Canada's Great Divide Trail, the middle segment inside Jasper National Park passes through the upper reaches of the Maligne River valley over the Maligne Pass.  However, this trail is no (longer) listed in the Backcountry Guide(PDF, 5 MB), nor are its campgrounds, and it has apparently been decommisioned.  Considering that one may only camp on designated backcountry campsites and that it's 42 km from the (former) Maligne Valley trailhead to the next designated campground on the Brazeau loop, is it permitted to hike this former trail and camp on one of its five former campgrounds?  Strictly speaking I would think no, but this tripadvisor post states that one can still hike and camp there.  What is the official rule?  It would be very difficult to hike this segment of the Great Divide Trail if it is no longer permitted to hike here.    Of course, I fully expect that hiking here would be significantly slower than in the past. "
868,How to repair rubber welly boots?,"I have a pair of wellington boots (aka rainboots or gumboots), they are now a few years old and getting a bit worn out. They have a few small punctures in them, and are splitting where they bend at the toes. So this means water can leak in.  What is the best way to repair the holes, and restore their waterproofing? Some sort of glue or rubber cement? Or maybe a bicycle puncture repair kit? "
869,Why does sunscreen not work all day?,"All over the internet it says that sunscreen does not work all day, but does not say anything about why.  Why does sunscreen not work all day?  Does the matrials get destroyed by the UV rays? Or is it because they evaporate?  A product called p20 claims 10 hours but does not provide any evidence, which does not seem trustworthy.     The general principle is to reapply every two to four hours,"" dermatologist James Spencer, MD, of St. Petersburg, Fl, told WebMD. ""Sunscreen does go away with time.   [website]"
870,How long is an activated charcoal filter good for after initial use?,"I have a water filtration system that uses activated coconut shell carbon as its media. The filter is listed as being able to purify up to 50 gallons, but I won't be using it for anywhere near that amount in any one use.  How long is the filter usable after initial use?  If I use it to purify a couple of gallons one weekend, then don't need it for a couple weeks, or maybe even a month, will it still be usable? Or will it need to be replaced?  Is there anything I can/should do to preserve it between uses (e.g. dry it back out somehow)? "
871,Wood versus plastic trail signs?,"My town (Groton MA, USA) has 110 miles of trails open to the public, but virtually no signs helping people navigate at intersections in the woods.  I am on the Trails Committee, and I'm pushing hard to address this.  Initially I figured we'd just do whatever other organizations do that have been at this for a long time.  Just about all backwoods trail signs I've ever seen have been simple routed wood.  It seems the US forest service has been using this type of sign for many decades, perhaps a century.  For example:    This happens to be from the Tonto National Forest in AZ.  It's about as typical a trail sign as there is in the US.    This one is on the top of Mt Lafayette in the White Mountain National Forest of NH.  Again, it's basically the same design.  The sign at top was recently replaced, and I'm not sure if it is more yellow due to being newer and not weathered yet (this location is above treeline open to the sky all year), or whether it's the new ""composite"" material that is plastic and wood.  Presumably the Forest Service has looked into this and converged on something that works and has low lifetime cost.  If it's good enough for the US Forest Service, it's good enough for me.  However, we have had several people pushing us to use newer plastic material that is claimed to last longer than wood, although its also much more expensive.  The main body of the plastic is white, but the front has a layer of dark green on it.  Routing lines into it cuts thru the front layer to expose the back, so you get white letters on dark green.  I've seen these signs and they are quite readable.  The question is, do you know of any experience with different materials for trail signs?  Are most wood because that's all that's been available until now?  Are there organizations that are using newer materials where they would have used wood signs in the past?  If so, is there any longevity data, lifetime cost data, etc?  Also, any opinions on the esthetics?  If you were hiking the back woods of a small town in New England and came accross non-traditional trail signs, would you think Yuk, this high-tech stuff doesn't belong in the woods, or Cool, these guys are keeping up with the times, or something else?  Added about plastic signs  I didn't have a picture of the type of plastic sign I described, so I took one yesterday afternoon:    This sign is by the side of a road, so is larger than what would be in the woods.  However, this is the material I was mentioning.  Apparently it is also available in brown.  I have been told that this material will last much longer than wood, and is supposed to be able to stand up to long term UV exposure.  I have meanwhile heard back from one sign maker with some good arguments against pressure treated wood.  That and Karen's point about not knowing what volunteer resources might be available in the future to replace worn signs has me leaning towards a format like the wood signs shown above, but using the plastic material shown here.

872,Travelling and taking climbing chalk through customs,Anyone had any experience getting climbing chalk though customs?   I'm off to Guernsey and I don't think I'll be able to buy chalk there so I'm putting it in my hold luggage. Are customs likely to open it up thinking its something illicit?  
873,Can groundwater still be consumed if after boiling the water turns brown with an oily substance floating on top?,"This weekend we went ""pole camping"". A pole camp site (dutch link only) is a camp site offered by the departments of forestry in the Netherlands and Belgium. It is very basic. What is offered is a handpump providing ground water, a fire place and and a place for three trekking tents usually some where along hiking trails in both the Netherlands and Belgium.   At the pole-camp site we stayed at this weekend, the ground water looked very clear. Directly from the source you could see right through. However, upon cooking the water turned brown with a fatty film floating on top. The longer the water boiled, the more brown the water became.     What makes clear ground water turns brown upon cooking and more importantly can you still consume it after thoroughly cooking it? "
874,Camping with a dog for the first time,"In a few months my fiance and I will be joining two friends camping. My friends chocolate labrador will be joining us for the weekend. My fiance and I, whilst both dog lovers, have no experience camping with a dog.   We have a decent four man tent with a large living area, which you can easily stand upright in and a bucket ground sheet. So there should be plenty of room for the four of us and the dog.  The dog is well trained but as a chocolate lab is rather excitable at times and has a tendency to want to play with wild animals (especially squirrels!).   What would be a good way to:   Keep her entertained in the tent whilst we are not hiking? Keep her free to move at night but not allow her to escape and run amok?   Edit: Just to say this is regular camping (not wild) but would likely be on farmland in North Wales.  Second edit: Also predominantly on the first night we won't have hiked at all and we would have driven for a few hours so she will likely be excitable then, as stated by both answers and comments I understand she will be knackered after our main days hiking.  Just an addition as I made some assumptions which lead to some confusion (I'll know better next time I ask a question), firstly that it would be understood a bucket groundsheet is separated from the main tent - this assumption is due to the bi-annual tent show we go to never having a connected groundsheet for 4 man or larger tents so my apologies there! And also for the confusion about where the dog would have to sleep as leaving her outside the tent in the UK is not an option (despite the high chance for rain, we wouldn't want a kind soul calling the RSPCA on us for neglect, or risk her running off, or the slim chance she would be stolen...) so apologies for that confusion also.  UPDATE: From advice from some family friends we're staging a trial run in a few weekends to see how the dog gets on with our tent (and allow us to prep it) thanks again for all the wonderful answers / advice here.

875,Am I liable for damage or injuries caused by my dog?,"If I am in my woods with my dog, and it kills a protected species of songbird (which it knows it shouldn't), should I report this? If so, to whom? Should I expect a fine? This hasn't happened yet, but I like being ready, just in case. "
876,Kayaking in the UK,"My husband and I are both avid walkers / hikers but for a long time have been wanting to get into kayaking. Both of us have kayaked in the past. Separately we did it on school trips - many years ago - at adventure/team building week locations (for Americans, think of a summer camp that lasts a week and you do a bit of everything once or twice). I've kayaked on both a lake and the sea, he has just kayaked on the sea. Both of us did capsizing as well. Together we've probably totalled a weeks worth of experience kayaking, enough to know we both enjoy it.  We're in the UK, and likely our options for locations are either the local canal (Bucks grand union arm), local rivers (the Thame/Thames), travelling to the Lakes (Lake District) or travelling to the coast and kayaking on the sea. It is unlikely we will do any rapids or white water currently. We will be more likely to be on lakes/canals than the sea but the sea is an option for weeks/weekends away.  We know we will need licenses in the UK to kayak on any body of water, life jackets, paddles, etc. Just to note we'd also prefer two singles rather than a tandem.  A few things I would like to know before getting started:   After a few hours scouring the internet and getting overloaded with information, could someone provide a reliable UK book / website with kayaking information? If we got a sea touring kayak, would that be acceptable on canals/lakes or would it be better to have a light touring kayak instead (or as well as)? What would be the minimum requirements for a repair kit? Does anyone know of a location in the UK where you don't need a license?   Due to licenses we'd obviously like to keep equipment costs down, but is it possible to go too cheap - and if so could someone give me a reasonable minimum spend on a kayak? (for the UK so in pound sterling, if in dollars can you take into account most things in the UK are more expensive than the US?)  Update: We ended up talking to a nice guy over at Canoe England who confirmed their licences for us. We've purchased our kayaks - after much discussion with the kayak company we went for sit-on-tops - from a Cornish company and are now waiting for them to arrive. Thanks to Rory and Vclaw for your help.  "
877,"""Tag line""/""pull cord"" for multipitch trad: what kind and when needed?","I normally climb with a single 10 mm x 60 m rope. On some multipitch trad climbs, I don't expect to have to rappel off, but I might have to in an emergency. Many people carry a special-purpose 6 mm rope for this purpose, referred to as a ""tag line"" or ""pull cord."" They can then do a full 60 m single-strand rappel and use the thin rope to pull down the climbing rope after them after each rap.  It seems as though there is probably not a single rule as to what to bring: no tag line, a tag line, or a second climbing rope that you could lead on. There should be some decision-making process based on knowledge of the route. I'm not very experienced at multipitch.  Folks who are more experienced, what factors would you look at? For example, if there are three pitches, each more than 30 m, do you say something like this to yourself? -- ""If I split each pitch in half and rap off with a single rope, then that means leaving gear behind in six places, and I would run out of gear before I get to the bottom.""  I guess the argument for bringing a second real climbing rope would be that otherwise if you pull on the tag line and it gets stuck, you're in real trouble. However, canyoneers do this regularly.  You can get 6 mm spectra rope, which is lighter than nylon but expensive and just as bulky. Polypropylene ropes are almost as light as spectra, but I haven't been able to find a dealer and don't know how the cost compares with spectra. "
878,What are wildlife hazards/precautions near the treeline at 8200ft on Hearst Lake in Montana?,"I want to drive to Hearst Lake (map here) and explore the area on foot, but I am unsure what wildlife precautions I should take at a high altitude.

879,What is an equalette anchor?,"When setting up belay there are many ways to connect the anchors. One way is called equalette and is supposed to adapt to a certain extent to the direction of pull.  How is such an equalette constructed? If there is not one definite way: What are different ways of setting up an equalette and how do they differ?  There is a question ""When to set up a Cordelette and an Equalette?"" where an partial image is supplied and a commentary debates whether this even is an equalette, so the topic seems to be debatable.

881,US vs central European bear advice,"I was just reading through a couple of posts here on outdoors.SE and saw some advice which was a lot more strict than I am used to. For example, in the country where I hike (central europe, brown bears, but that's it) you wouldn't worry about the tent or shirt you sleep in smelling after food from 6 months ago (something I saw in a couple of answers here). And there are tens of other answers that also contain far stricter advice than I grew up with (no toothpaste in tents, bear bells, food canisters, etc.).   So what my main question is is:   Are those things related to bears in the US actually acting differently or is this just a difference in mentality? And if this is an actual difference in behaviour, are there parts of Europe where bears act similarly to the US?  "
882,Should I go to New-Zealand on November instead of December just to make it to the Milford track?,"(I know this is subjective, but I'm really at loss with all the confliciting advice I get from my friends... help me stack-exchange! :) )    Hey, I'm planning on doing 2 months trekking in New-Zealand. Original plan was Dec-Jan, for the best weather. However, the only date I was able to reserve for the Milford Sound track is Nov/7th.   WDYS? should I go on Nov-Dec and risk crummier weather just so I won't miss the Milford experience? OR is it just another amazing track among many others and aiming for the best chance of good weather is more important.   background: I have no other work/family constraints, and I'm really into outdoors trekking.

883,Is any subspecies of black bear more -- or less -- aggressive than another?,"There are 16 subspecies of Ursus americanus, the black bear.  The Wikipedia article describes their different physical characteristics and geographical distributions, but not differences in temperament.  The article discusses attacks on humans, and attributes the majority to habituation to people and easy access to food.  When access to food was made more difficult, bear attacks dropped off sharply.   Is there any analysis or evidence -- even informed anecdotal -- that suggests that any subspecies is more aggressive or more easily provoked to aggression than another?  Can any differences be attributed to the frequency and nature of exposure to people?  I read one article a long time ago in connection with an attack on several male teenagers that said that eastern black bears were more aggressive than western; this is all I remember about it.     My first hand knowledge is limited to Sierra and (to a lesser extent Colorado Rocky Mtn) black bears.  None has behaved in the least aggressively towards me, but I still respect them.  Should I be even more respectful elsewhere?          "

886,How to deal with unethical campers?,"Earlier last month I witnessed someone fell a tree in the Eagles Nest Wilderness while I was on a backpack trip. Its quite obvious that you're not supposed to cut down trees in a national forest, in this particular wilderness fires are also prohibited. I hadn't any idea how to deal with this group of individuals. I feel that yelling at them would have done no good, as its obvious that what they were doing was wrong and they knew it.  Should I have reported these individuals? I had no way to identify them, and its hard to track who was even in the area during that time frame.  Should I have said something? Threatened to report them? Or is it best to just let it happen, because it seems there's not much that can be done.  It really upsets me to see someone do something so detrimental to a protected area. Its such an obvious trace of human presence. I've heard this has become a big problem in the Maroon-Bells Snowmass Wilderness, which isn't far from where I was hiking. "
887,Protein-intake on extended minimal-weight treks,"I enjoy doing quite extended treks in the backcountry that rely on us (mostly 2-4 people) being independent from any kind of civilization for up to two weeks.  For me the foremost problem in these kinds of treks is the weight of the food: I've been on treks where we easily started out with 15kg of food per person, which is obviously a big strain for everyone carrying it.  I have already spent quite a lot of thought and time optimizing our trail food to reduce weight:   We only bring food with very high calories-to-weight ratio. We bring food that require as little fuel to prepare as possible (reduces overall fuel weight needed). All the food is repackaged into the most light-weight packaging possible.      Example: Instant Pasta, Couscous, Chocolate, Peanuts (best   calorie-to-weight ratio out there), dehydrated instant soups and   sauces for pasta, porridge, powdered milk, energy bars...   So... we're set on carbohydrates, sugar and fat, but I'm guessing what we're still struggling with is protein intake: many protein-rich foods are either fairly heavy (dried meat, hard cheese) or spoil quickly. The few I know that are both light weight and durable (like beans and lentils) take forever to cook, meaning that we'd have to bring a lot of extra fuel.   Do you have a suggestion on how we could improve our protein-intake on extended hikes? What kinds of protein-rich trail food with low weight exists out there? (bonus points if it is tasty)     P.S. We use light-weight trangia camping stoves, as they are quite efficient and their fuel can be bought almost anywhere. I'd rather not rely on open fires as this will limit our treks to routes that go through territory where open fires are allowed and where there is plenty of firewood.  P.P.S. Somebody is bound to bring this up, so I'll just say here: fishing/hunting is not an option for me. Both require a lot of time (and often permits/licenses) and are simply not reliable enough: I can't stake the meals of our group on getting a lucky catch. "
888,Safe ways to abseil last,"When being the last one to abseil you obviously need to make sure that when you are down, you can retrieve the rope. While the most common way is probably to use twin/half ropes and to put one rope through the anchor and join it with the other, there are numerous other possibilities.  What methods to set up a safe abseil where you can retrieve the rope exist? When are they usually applied (e.g. for a specific kind of abseil anchor)? How is the setup done and what material is used?

889,Backpacking with a dog,"Please note, this question covers different material than that in Camping with a dog for the first time.                                                                              I've often seen dogs on high-altitude multi-day hikes with their people, many of them (the dogs) carrying packs.  Part One of my question is:  Does a dog require about the same acclimatization time to high altitude (8,000 to 12,000 feet) as a person does?    Part Two of my question:  At these altitudes, how many days of his own food can a dog carry? Water is not a factor; there is always a nearby stream.  I don't have any immediate plans to go out with a dog, but I am intrigued.  "

891,How do I keep my shoes from rolling around my feet while trail running?,"This summer I started running on trails through the woods, and I'm loving it.  Problem is, running on trails seems to involve a lot more lateral force on the soles of my feet, mostly from sharp turns and trails that bank the wrong way.  As a result, my shoes tend to slip around my feet.  I've been tying them quite tightly to counteract this effect, but they still roll a little bit when I push off sideways.  These shoes have been fine for many miles on pavement; the problem has only arisen on trails.  It's gotten to the point the shoes have formed themselves into a slumped over shape - this is the direction they slip due to lateral forces:   Is there anything I can do to make this pair of shoes hold up better? If not, what can I look for in my next pair of shoes to avoid this problem going forward? "

899,Will a Rocky Mountain Goat attack a person?,"  We went to Gargantua this weekend, I've been going at least once a year for the past few years, and it's not uncommon to see rocky mountain goats up at that elevation, but this time around we ran into a family of nine, some of which were hanging out right in the cave entrance.     Just inside the cave entrance, I'd live here if I was a Mountain goat:   I'm not really fond of mountain goats... They're big (up to +300lbs/140kg!), they're muscular, they can scramble up cliff faces faster than I can fall down them, and they have sharp pointy horns that hook just enough to rip your bowels out after they gore you. Also, in my experience, despite what I'm told about goats, they aren't really afraid of humans. I'm not very fond of any animal in the woods that isn't afraid of humans. Last time we came out of these caves there was a goat just around the arrete from the exit (image at bottom). He seemed to challenge us, and kept moving closer instead of bolting like most hoofed animals do in the rockies.   There are eight goats in the picture, we came up behind some of them on our final approach to the cave, and they scrambled back over to the entrance to meet up with the others as the five of us approached (with me shouting at them to move along). The ninth goat was a big billy that had the high ground directly above us before we even knew he was there (no picture). I've had this happen a couple times; where we've run into a goat high up above the treeline, and it doesn't run away, instead it gets the high ground directly above you.  What I want to know is what that billy was planning on doing. There were a fews kids in the herd, no doubt his offspring, and I've seen videos of ibex and rams diving off rocks horns-first at each other. Would a mountain goat attack a human? Was his grab at the high ground defensive, or offensive?    We popped out from underground then discovered this guy up around the corner just before heading out. He kept approaching us as if he were intent on standing his ground and driving us off. "

902,Can I get fresh water from ocean fish flesh?,"Ocean water has about 35 Grams of salt per liter.  For the human body salt content in body fluids is about 9 Grams per liter.  See related question How much sea water can I safely drink?  While it is best that your fresh water only contain very trace amounts of salt, water that is equal or less than 9 grams of salt per liter can help maintain your hydration level (trying to simplify a complex concept)  Many desert animals get all most of their hydration from food  If stranded at sea, and I eat a lot of fish flesh.  Will it have a low enough salt content to help keep me hydrated? "
903,What sort of glue (if any) to use to fix replacement tips onto carbon fibre trekking poles?,"I have a pair of quite old Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork Flicklock trekking poles.  After much use and abuse the tip on one of them has finally gotten bashed in (the carbide tip has either broken or been pushed back completely inside the plastic mount and although still usable the pole is now nowhere near as secure when in contact with rock).  I managed to remove the busted tip by following the instructions here which suggest dipping it in boiling water then wrenching it off with pliers.  It did actually come off surprisingly easily once heated (but before that I couldn't budge it at all).  I have also secured a Black Diamond ""Flextip Replacement - Long"" (well actually a pair, and small ""trekking"" baskets).  Black Diamond don't provide any useful instructions, and the site linked above just says:      To secure the new tips, tap them on a hard surface like concrete a   half-dozen times. Do not use glue.   but I'm dubious about this: I can easily imagine the new tip disappearing into the next sucking Scottish quagmire it encounters if not firmly fixed to the pole.  I'm guessing the original tip was glued on by some sort of thermal-sensitive glue; hence the boiling to release it.  The site linked above also mentions ""old glue residue"".  What sort of glue should I use to fix these?  Obviously something which will let me repeat the boiling trick if/when the next time the tip wears out would be ideal, but my Google-fu isn't having much luck identifying such a thing.  Or does the just ""tap them on"" approach actually work in practice?  The photo here - from left to right - shows the old broken tip, the tipless pole and the new ""Flextip replacement - Long"" I want to fix on the pole.   "
904,Can I get fresh water from ocean plants?,"In the answer to Can I get fresh water from ocean fish flesh? I learned that the water I can get from eating fish has a low enough salt content that it will hydrate me, BUT the high protein count will cause increased urination to purge urea and leave me dehydrated.   Many land animals get all or most of their water (hydration) from eating plants.    If stranded at sea, can I balance my hydration by eating ocean plants?   "
905,How much fish can a saltwater angler catch per day?,"If a saltwater angler goes out on a boat, how much could we expect that person to catch during a typical day? I would like to set some personal expectations.  Obviously if the variables are against you (eg: bad spot), the lower bound would be 0. But if you get it right (see the linked question What are the variables that will significantly affect saltwater fishing success?), what is a good, or maybe upper bound, that we can expect?  If we have an estimate based on good anglers (eg: records or sports champions), that would help us know what not to expect, which is useful, and I suspect that info might be easier to come by, but all I can find is records for the largest fish caught, which really is not helpful here.  Since I fish to eat, I am interested in total weight, so I don't really care if it is a single 20 pound fish or 20 single-pound fish. If that information is not available, then whatever info is available is acceptable as long as it is useful for me to make estimates to set my expectations.  It doesn't need to be exact at all; very rough estimates are fine as long as they are useful. If location matters, assume Atlantic ocean, off the eastern coast of the United States of America. "
906,How to recognize an ocean desert from the surface?,"There are large areas of the ocean that are essentially lifeless, often called ocean deserts.  If I am traveling the ocean, and not familiar with potential sea life in the area, can I tell from clues on the surface that I am in an Ocean Desert?    If I need special instruments to identify an Ocean Desert, what are they? "
907,How reliably can you assess the condition of a reverse-osmosis desalinator?,"Handheld desalinators operating on the principle of reverse osmosis are available for emergency use in lifeboats.  Sometimes they appear for sale unused in their original packaging at a very steep discount because they have been replaced at a scheduled interval by their owners (merchant marines, navies, etc).  Is there any reliable means to assess the condition of the device and determine if it is reliable enough either for convenience (reducing the quantity of fresh water carried) or for possible life-sustaining use?  Checking the condition of mechanical parts (pivots, levers, body) and of any seals (no cracks) seems straightforward, but what about the reverse osmosis membrane itself?   (Inspired by Portable desalination hand pump filter life?) "
908,How can you identify whether brackish water is too salty to drink?,"Sometimes there are sources of water which are slightly contaminated with salt, such as coastal wells or pools of rainwater in rocks near the coast, or water containers with pinhole leaks which have been stored in proximity to seawater (e.g. aging Dromedary bags in a kayak).  In these cases, is the subjective taste adequate to warn me when water has become too salty to drink safely?  Is there another means?  I find the following answer regarding the danger of drinking seawater to be compelling: here I would like to know at what point these issues become decisive and the water should be avoided. "
909,"What are these concrete posts near the Gallow Hill water tower in Dundee, Scotland?","I've been walking my dog recently in the Templeton woods in Dundee, Scotland. When I walked past the Gallow Hill water tower I came across these concrete (?) posts. There were about 20-30 of them and I'd like to know if anyone can tell me what these are and why they're there?    This is where the water tower is, but I can't see the posts on the satellite image:  56°29'43.3""N 3°02'02.6""W (Google Maps) "
910,Why is (almost) no one climbing hard routes on Half Dome?,"I follow the international rock climbing scene, and we constantly hear of repetitions of hard routes on El Capitan.   On Youtube, it is possible to find many videos of strong climbers from all over the world climbing (sometimes free) routes such as The Nose, Golden Gate, Zodiac, Freerider and Salathé Wall.   But if you look for videos of people climbing Half Dome, or articles about ascents on Half Dome, you find almost nothing.  At first I thought that it is because most of the routes there are aid climbing routes, and aid climbing is not very fashionable right now. However, most of the routes on El Capitan are also aid routes, and many of them have been free climbed, so this explanation is not very satisfactory.  Is it because of the difficulty, i.e. is it much harder to free climb Half Dome (apart from the Regular Northwest Face), or are other factors involved?  That rock is just so iconic, and it seems very strange that no strong climber is interested in it.  (I am looking from the factors that could explain why Half Dome is much less frequented than El Cap, possibly with facts to back up the answer, like interviews to climbers or statistics.) "
911,What to do if someone gets impaled in the stomach?,"Background:  This question is motivated by an accident that happened to my sister in a very rural area. She was on a fence and fell onto a t-post which basically impaled her, but which fell out by the time she hit the ground. (Details are gruesome.)  We padded the injury with some shirts and then basically panicked until we saw a helicopter. We signaled the helicopter, which landed; we put her on a tarp and transferred her to the copter, which flew her to a hospital 15 miles away.  The Question: We were lucky.  I've thought about this incident and wondered how a similar (not identical) incident could be handled far from help.  Assume you are in the wilderness. Phones are dead, you don't have a PLB, and if you walked out, help could not arrive in less than three days. You have a first aid kit and some other equipment that might be helpful, including but not necessarily limited to, gauze, hydrogen peroxide, pliers, scissors, fishing line, iodine, tape, and rope  You have a well set-up campsite and plenty of easily accessible food and water.  Your hiking partner gets stabbed through the stomach with a tree branch. The branch is still all the way in and is small enough so your partner can be moved. Your only options are to attempt to treat them or watch them die. What can you do?  What should you not do? What aid can you give before hiking out for help?  One commenter asked if the branch had splinters. Branches often do, but an answer that does not account for splinters could still be useful.  I chose branch instead of generic object, which seemed vague, and because my own experience, which was a t-post, would make the question too narrow. "
912,Should overweight people ever climb?,"I used to be a regular climber, and unfortunately I have put on some serious weight over the last 4 years, and I have not been able to climb as much as would have loved to.  While, I am still working on my schedule to get back to climbing gym, many of the people I know have been trolling me that the apple have fallen far away from the tree now (That, its too late for me to start climbing again). I do my best to avoid those talks, but can't help but notice that it is actually making sense, I haven't seen fat climbers around.  My current BMI is ""26.8 Overweight"".  Why aren't there any fat climbers? Or more importantly, should fat people ever climb? "
913,What are those white spots on the sea,"Yesterday I was flying above the Mediterranean sea, it was a nice day, without storms or strong winds. I fly around 20 minutes above it before arriving to the ground.  During these 20 minutes I saw that the sea had plenty of white spots, some of them really big, more than a ship. They were not changing size, changing shape or disappearing as waves would do. Really, each one of them did not change at all during the minutes I could see them.  It looks as foam from a chemical product or something similar. But there was A LOT of spots during long time in the whole sea, as far as I could see and during the whole travel. Close to the shore, the white spots disappear. What can that be? If is some chemical, where does it come from? Waves? I dont think so...  -I am not sure if I should ask this here-  See this photo I did. They seem at the beginning waves but they would change. These spots in the photo didn't change at all    I was flight through more or less this route:   "
914,Possible snowy owl seen in the trees,"I was out hunting last weekend (end of October) near Yellow Pine, Idaho. While walking up a hill during the late morning with moderate timber coverage (thin enough to ski comfortably but thick enough to prevent grass from growing) I spotted a large owl sitting on a branch about 20 feet above the ground. It was really fun to see the owl. The owl was large (roughly 18 to 24 inches tall) with a white face. The feathers appeared to be white with light brown tips giving the bird a banded look. It had a large wingspan too at approximately 4 to 5 feet wide. We tried to take a picture of the owl with my father's cellphone but the picture didn't turn out because the bird was in the shadows.  This morning I turned to the internet for help identifying the owl. In this Owls of Idaho resource the only owl that looks close is the Snowy Owl. The owl we saw seemed to have a wider/bulky body, and more dense brown banding. When I did a photo search on snowy owls I found a National Geographic Kids picture that looks much closer to what we saw. The owl in the NatGeo picture looks smaller than the bird I saw but that could just be a trick of the camera.  Normally I'd be comfortable declaring I saw a Snowy Owl since that NatGeo picture looked reasonably close to what I saw. My only lingering doubt is because we saw the bird in a moderately dense pine forest. All the resources I've seen on the internet state that snowy owls prefer open terrain. Here is a quote from the Owls of Idaho resource:     When snowy owls come south, they may be found on open ground (such as marshes, meadows or prairies)   The NatGeo article states:     These large owls mainly live in the Arctic in open, treeless areas called tundra. Snowy owls perch on the ground or on short posts. From there they patiently watch for prey.   It seems like the terrain that I spotted the owl in doesn't fit with these descriptions of the snowy owl's preferred territory. Are there any other owls that can be found in Idaho that I might be confusing for a snowy owl? Alternatively are snowy owls known to frequent moderately timbered hill sides in Idaho instead of more open terrain? "
915,Can I use a bicycle helmet as a climbing helmet?,"I have a bicycle helmet that fits well.  Can it be used effectively as a rock climbing helmet?  Most climbing helmets have a hard shell that the bicycle helmet does not.  However, one of the more expensive climbing helmets, the Petzl Meteor III, appears to have the same construction of a thin plastic shell over foam as the bicycle helmet.  The bicycle helmet clearly has better impact protection on the sides, with a thick layer of expanded bead foam that is absent on most climbing helmets. On the other hand most cycling helmets have vents on top that the climbing helmets to not.   How do the safety tests and standards for climbing and cycling helmets compare? What protection would I give up by using a cycling helmet for climbing? Does a cycling helmet provide better protection in any applicable way?  "
916,How often should I waterproof a tent?,Currently I waterproof my tents at minimum once a year and often times 2 or 3 times a year. Other than condensation I don't usually have too much of a problem. On the other hand I live and often camp in one of the dryest places in the country so it rarely comes into play.  My question is am I proofing it too often? Does anyone else actually bother with this stuff? 
917,What is the ultimate car camping bed solution -- for two people?,"I've been camping since I was a teenager in the scouts, and I've never really had a very comfortable night out.  As an adult with a girlfriend, 20 years later, I'd like to just throw some money at the issue and be done with it and have ourselves a comfortable bed for car camping.  (""Car camping"" meaning we will have the car next to the campsite and don't care about weight or size much.)  This Memorial Day weekend, we went out with a few other couples, and I don't think a single person had a successful sleep.  We brought a feather bed as an experiment and it was pretty terrible, feeling only slightly better than the ground (warm though).  Other people spent 30-60 minutes fussing with getting their air beds inflated, and then they leaked or went flat by the morning.  I've used self-inflating Thermarest pads and I'm sure those are the best for backpack camping but they aren't great and they get quite expensive once you start buying two of the XL ones.  Are there other choices I'm missing?  Or is there an air mattress option that isn't fussy and frustrating? "
918,Pros and Cons of paracord,"From a comment on the How to select paracord question I was curious, what is the benefit of paracord over hardware store yellow twisted poly stuff?  The yellow stuff is cheap, readily available, floats, strong enough and easy to see as guylines and in trees.  I have almost always used paracord, because, that's ""camping"" rope and that's just what I used. But that comment got me thinking, what is the big deal with paracord? Why is it better? "
919,Group protocol should the group become separated,"A small group (2-10 people total) is travelling in a wilderness area. For whatever reason a person or a couple get separated. What is the best strategy for the lost ones? What is the best strategy to be employed by the group. The goal is to reunite. How important is it for the group to sit down and talk about this before a trip?  A couple of algorithms I have seen my buddies perform:  First one: Both group proceed to the next checkpoint, that was defined for example at the morning looking at the map.  Second one: Both groups return to the point of separation.  I would love to read some theory on this, so quoting sources is very welcome.   Here is one example. We are talking military here, special forces mind you. They go on a mission, get separated, and that is one of their major mistakes. One survivor.  Another example: just yesterday evening I was riding bike with two friends. I turn left, they shout at me that they are going another way, I do not confirm (as I had not seen or heard them).  "
920,Formula for rough amount of water to carry on hike?,"Is there a formula which can be used (I'm thinking one that gives amount of water needed factoring in time or distance covered and temperature) to roughly work out the amount of water that needs to be carried for a particular hike?  Obviously this will be a very rough guide - I know how much I generally drink, but I tend to drink quite a lot, I'm wondering as a rough approximation I can give to others to form an idea in their head.  Is there an ""official"" such formula, or have others coined their own that they use? "
921,"Is a compass generally accurate in only one hemisphere, or both?","   Possible Duplicate:   Navigational gear worldwide       I'm not that well travelled (never been outside of Europe!) but at some point I'd love to head elsewhere to perhaps hike somewhere a bit more exotic.  I've heard (quite a bit) that most compasses only come calibrated for one hemisphere - how much ""out"" is a compass in the wrong part of the world? Is it generally no more than a few degrees, or potentially completely wildly out?  Following on from this, can I get a compass that does work pretty much worldwide to save the hassle of swapping back and forth between them, or is it just a case of always the right compass for the right place? "
922,How to minimise erosion damage to footpaths when walking?,"As a fair-weather walker I frequently find myself on routes that have suffered from erosion due to the large numbers of people hiking along them. I wish to cause the least possible amount of further problems of this sort and I wondered what was the best way? Ought I to stick to the worn path, minimising the extent of the damage, or bypass the badly-affected areas, minimising the intensity of the erosion. Or is there some other better way? "
923,Things to keep away from climbing ropes,"There are some no brainers like don't throw your climbing rope next to car batteries in the back of your car. The effect of bug sprays containing Deet seem to be controversial. I have also heard a degreaser or citrus degreaser in particular can damage a rope. I try to keep my rope as clean as possible but is there anything I should keep away from my rope or climbing equipment in general? Please don't hesitate to state anything that you might think is so obvious it's not worth mentioning.  Edits:   Is there any substance that I could reasonably come into contact with that if my rope does contact the substance the rope should be retired immediately and unquestionably? Again, a car battery in the trunk seems like the first thing that comes to mind.  Any reason to be concerned about things like hand-sanitizer or sun tan lotion?   "
924,Long or short sleeves on a hike in the Desert?,"I have heard different things from different people, but here in the South West we do a decent amount of desert hiking.  Protection from bugs is usually little concern because most of the time in the summer day it is too hot for them. So mainly my question is what is cooler to hike in, all else being equal, short sleeves or long sleeves? Any real reason why??  "
925,Practicality of Beards,"I have several friends with full beards. After talking at length with one, he started to convince me the protection it offers might be worth it.   So, I thought I would come and ask. What are the Pros and Cons of beards as they relate to the outdoors? Does it provide any protection from the elements? Fires? Bugs? Does it keep you cooler or warmer in the summer? How about the winter?  I understand the choice to wear a beard is a personal one, but I would like an answer that outlines actual practicality (assuming there is some) beyond looks.  "
926,6 day trek in Nepal Himalaya,"What are some easy/moderate hikes in the Nepal Himalayas that do not span more than 6 days of walking? I looked at Jomsom trek but it is 8 days. I am looking for a trek that offers nice scenic beauty and good views of some 8000+ peaks. I also looked at everest base camp but that is a 21 day ordeal. What options do I have here? I am not a climber, so difficulty level is w.r.t walking and fitness, not climbing :) "
927,Reacting to tornado warnings while camping with no buildings nearby,"This afternoon there was a tornado warning - TAKE SHELTER IN A PERMANENT BUILDING IMMEDIATELY - for the west half of Algonquin Park issued through the usual channels including Twitter. I believe by ""permanent building"" they meant ""not a tent, not a camping trailer, not an RV"". What we would normally call a building, but I guess they wanted to emphasize that whatever you're camping in does not count.  Algonquin Park is not what you'd call rich in actual buildings and it's trivially easy to get yourself hours of travel away from one. Just head off away from an access point and however far you've travelled, that's how far you are from the nearest building. Cell phone service is spotty inside, but let's say you have coverage and you're at a campsite, and you get this warning. Or perhaps you have no electronic help but you see a large dark rotating cloud like in this tweet. Everyone says ""go inside"" but if the nearest inside is two days travel away, then what?  What do you do? There is no building to get into. Are you safer out on the water? Are you best off just going in the tent to keep dry (figuring that only a tiny stripe will actually get tornadoed, while the whole park will be rained on and have stuff blown around, and while the tent can't protect you from the latter, it can from the former) or is being outside able to see and run of any value? Should you at least pick up your emergency kit (I have a small belt pack I wear both ways on portages with a whistle, a little first aid, a flashlight, some matches etc and usually some food) so that you'll have it with you if everything else blows away? Should you move your canoe? Tidy the campsite? Try to put all your heavy stuff together and maybe tie packs to each other? Take the tent poles out to make the tent less likely to be picked up by wind?   What if you're in transit, on a lake or at a portage? Same set of questions I suppose but with less options.   Typical Algonquin geography: lots of large coniferous trees, rocky or sandy shores, lakes of various sizes, paths and trails generally leading back at least 50-100 feet from a shore, small clearings and open beaches for campsites, some small islands.  Things to keep in mind: if you're in your house and the house next door is destroyed by a tornado, you were very lucky. You have a roof, you possibly have power and water, and you have all the possessions that were inside at the time of the storm. Maybe you have a broken window. But if everything you owned was on the lawn at the time, and has blown away, you have no food, no shelter, no dry clothes etc. And if my canoe has blown away too, I have no way to leave my current location and have to wait for rescue. The severe thunderstorm itself could be as big a problem as an actual tornado. Since more of the park will get the severe storm, high winds, lashing rain, I would feel saving my ""stuff"" was a matter of life and death. Yet I don't actually know how to save my stuff. And I don't know if saving my stuff works against possibly saving myself. I'm beginning to think saving myself is impossible if an actual car-throwing, roof-ripping, house smashing tornado comes through my campsite, in which case battening down the hatches against merely high winds and stuff-ruination becomes a better use of my time. For example, I can't get more than 20 feet away from a tree unless I go out on the water, which is the worst place to go in a lightning storm. Cliffs, caves, overhangs etc are close to nonexistent in Algonquin. "
928,What to look for in a snorkel?,"I recently read over this post: What to consider when buying fins for recreational snorkeling and found some great advice in what to look for when purchasing fins for snorkelling.  However I was wondering what to look for when buying a snorkel. I've snorkelled a lot before, mostly on holidays in the Mediterranean, in swimming pools and once I was lucky enough to do it on a reef off the island of Mauritius. I've always either; brought a cheap set that literally lasts a week or two (whatever the length of my holiday) then it becomes too worn to use, or I rent / borrow equipment from someone.  When looking over potentially buying my own decent set (which is what lead me to the above post) I found myself coming up with a few questions:   Which is better, an L or J shape (or would this solely depend on the shape of my face?) Is there a preferred material (eg. Rubber or plastic?) Is it worth buying one with a sump in the mouth piece? Is it worth buying one with a ball and cage?  "
929,To pack Vertical or Horizontal?,"I always wonder, in what way I can pack my things so that the weight distribution will be good and I can find it handy to get the things quickly instead of unpacking the entire backpack.  I know that light and bulky stuff should go to the bottom, then a bit heavier stuff to go in the middle, and finally on the top of that should be what you need frequently through out the day.  Is there a benefit to pack it in a Vertical manner? Or should one stick to Horizontal packing sense?  EDIT: I am considering this in context of 3-4 days of trek. "
930,What format should I use to report my location to emergency responders?,"Suppose I am out in the wilderness and an emergency arises.  I have an accurate fix on my location (from GPS, map and compass, astronomical observation, etc...).  I manage to get in touch with emergency services and need to tell them where I am.  But there are many different formats I could use to report my position.   Latitude and longitude in degrees / minutes / seconds Latitude and longitude in decimal degrees Latitude and longitude in degrees and decimal minutes UTM   (And with any of these systems there is the finer question of which Earth ellipsoid or datum my map or GPS is based on, which could make a difference of a few tens or hundreds of meters in the position; in dense forest this could make it considerably harder for rescuers to find me.)  Obviously I want to avoid any confusion; if I give my position in (say) degrees / minutes / seconds, and a helicopter pilot blindly types it in their GPS which is set to decimal degrees, they'll go to the wrong place (perhaps many kilometers away).  UTM is less ambiguous, but will they even know what that is?  I may be speaking to a dispatcher in an urban office, perhaps over a noisy and unreliable phone or radio connection, and that's hardly the time for a technical discussion of the fine points of geodesy.  So in short:   Is there a particular position format that's preferred by emergency responders? Are dispatchers and responders sufficiently trained to understand the difference between these positions, so that I can use any format if I tell them which one it is? Are there other general ""best practices"" for this situation?   I suppose the answers may differ between different countries or regions (I'm in the US) or between land and sea emergencies (I'm usually on land). "
931,Why shouldn't I buy an ultra light tent?,"I have a workhorse of a tent, an Alpine Meadows, (described in this answer) that I really like. We bought it 30 years ago, and at first we just had way more stuff than we should, and eventually we had two small children (and their stuff) in the tent with us. There were times when I read stories to five children at a time in that tent. But now, it has more space than we need. And it's 30 years old, and tent technology has really changed. So we're thinking of replacing it with a tent that weighs less and takes up less room in the pack. (We canoe camp primarily, and create extra bedrooms at a cottage every few years.) I understand I will have to give up something I really like about the Alpine Meadows: I can stand up in it, which makes dressing much easier. I accept that modern 2 and 3 person tents are all generally shorter inside, and I'll take that in exchange for the weight and the pack room.  Step 1: go to a 2 or 3 person tent instead of a 4. No problem. Step 2: enjoy the lighter materials even ordinary tents come in (example). No problem. Step 3: what about an ultralight (example)? Wow, one-third the weight of a regular tent! That's amazing. I'm ready to buy one but hang on, why do they still make regular tents? What's the downside here?  I'm comparing floor area, peak height, and so on and don't see significant differences. I have several hypotheses:   a tiny difference is huge. You can endure 1.2m peak height but not 1.12. fabric thickness and material affects durability and I need to pay attention to the numbers and whatnot in that area ultralights can't be 4 season (don't care: I never winter camp.) there is some other important difference that isn't included in specs that keeps many people away from ultralights the only difference is the price   I'm really hoping it's that last one. At 30 years per tent, $600 doesn't seem like a big deal. But I worry that it's actually something else and I just don't know about it.  Here is what a tent is for on my trips:   keep the rain off us while we sleep and provide a rain free refuge where it's possible to move around a little while reading, or to play cards etc if it is cold (for a summer definition of cold) keep us warm. We have sleeping bags and clothes of course, and the very coldest we've ever camped was a morning we woke up to -1C. That is nowhere near the norm. The norm is 18C nights. keep the bugs off us while we sleep, and provide a bug free refuge once in a while guaranteed shade when I want it (I sunburn incredibly easily) keep our stuff from blowing away when we are away from camp provide a little privacy when traveling with others, whether to change clothes, or just to be alone for a while   I would never consider a tarp-only or tarp-and-hammock setup. A tent to me is a place to put stuff and a place to hang out if the weather is bad, not just a place to sleep or a way to keep rain off me. There will be two adults in this tent. Also, we camp during high bug season - blackflies, mosquitos, horseflies, you name it. We never cook in the vestibule - we set up a kitchen tarp across the campsite. We keep lifejackets, empty packs, shoes, and coats in there. It's also a place to put your shoes on while you're exiting the tent, and to take them off while you're entering.  We're quite capable of carrying our current tent, but I won't deny looking forward to carrying 8 pounds less on every portage. "
932,Selecting a rotary hammer for bolting climbs,"Setting up a (sport) climb, requires a good cordless rotary hammer (SDS shank compatible).  Besides the price-tag, things to consider, for selecting such a tool, are its weight, its shape and the handling experience.  Besides these, which make life easier while hanging on the wall, Which are the important technical specifications of rotary hammer machines?  For example, how important and why are each of the following characteristics, for a drilling machine suitable for bolting climbing routes?    Battery Voltage? BPM Rated RPM (vs. actual RPM?)   Are there scientifically sound references that explain their significance?  Last, but not least, are there important health and safety specifications that should not be overlooked? For example,   Noise level Vibrations on Acceleration   Are there scientifically sound references that explain their significance?

933,Compare running fitness to hiking,"I'm currently in the US for an internship and the idea of climbing Mt. Whitney appeals to me.  I know you need a permit, but there is a good chance on getting one spontaneously. I know about proper equipment and I have hiking experience from the Swiss and French Alps, up to 13,000ft, but this is 2 years back.  However, I find it hard to estimate if I'm physically fit enough. The trip would be about 22 miles (in 2 days) and 12,000 ft. of elevation gain and loss, not to forget the thin air.  I regularly go running and do weight training.   Is it possible to compare stats from this to what is required to be able to do this hike? Say like running 15 miles in a certain time? "
934,Water filters - why sand and rocks?,"Saw a video on youtube where some guy made a water filter out of a bottle, charcoal, sand and little rocks. He commented that since the charcoal is very porous it's great for filtering. Then, after constructing the filter he continued to filter some dirty water and commented that the first little bit is going to be nasty since its getting the dirt off the sand and rocks in the filter.   This doesn't make sense to me, if the charcoal is so great, and all that the rocks and sand bring to the party is dirt, why not just fill the bottle with all charcoal? Not to mention that charcoal is much easier to come by than various grains of sand in a forest or a jungle or whatever. "
935,What is a tour book used for?,"I recently started to write a little tour book. The main reason for this was, I was told some guides want to see this as requirement to take you along.   Is this true?  If so, for which tours/organizations is it standard procedure to check your tour book first?   Of course it's nice to have a short overview of your tours for personal reasons. I just write down mountain, route, height and tour partner for now. Maybe later I will extend this arbitrarily and maybe end with a short diary.  But still,    doing alpine tours where do I really need such evidence?   To be fair, this might not count as evidence, so for bigger undertakings    do we even need this as proof or what else do we need to convince the guides of our proper qualification and therefore legitimacy for the tour?   I would really like to hear some infos from experienced mountaineers, doing classical alpine tours or expeditions. Maybe the last question is the most important one and I could sum my concerns up:  How can I convince the guides that I am qualified enough and where is this even necessary? "
936,Can I preserve a freshly caught fish with a soft bag cooler?,"I am currently in Denmark without access to a car. During the weekend I use the bus to go to some remote coastal place in order to fish. It takes 1 hour to reach that place. I carry one rod with me and some food/tackle inside a backpack.  Because coolers are really heavy to carry by hand, when I catch a fish, I release it. However, sea trout is really tasty here in Denmark, so I would like to be able to bring one with me back home.  From what I read online, the best way to preserve a fish is to gut it immediately and throw it in a cooler packed with ice. Another option is to keep it alive as long as possible, but the fish will have to die before I leave, which means it would have to be dead inside my backpack for at least an hour that I need to reach home.  To me it sounds that I need to buy a cooler no matter what. The weather these days is 15C/59F. I usually spend 5-6 hours fishing. Could I preserve my fish fresh by buying one of these bag coolers they sell online, for example this one?  Has anyone tried these types of bag coolers before? How was your experience? What other options do I have? "
937,Which altitude profile and height is optimal for Everesting by hiking?,"Everesting is an activity where the goal is altitude gain of 8848 m or more by repeatedly going up and down a selected route.  This is most often attempted by biking; however, hiking/running is practiced too. The whole process takes 20-30 hours; however, the time seems to be less important than the feat itself.  I would like to understand how to choose a route which makes this possible.  The rules (described on the site, but I added a few of my own) are:   Total elevation gain, 8848 m Only natural scenery: no roads or stairs No bicycles, chairlifts, buses, etc; no abseiling Must travel the same route back and forth repeatedly No sleeping Resting, eating and drinking are allowed; no restrictions on resupplying along the way The spirit of the challenge implies that your route should be mostly altitude gain, followed by descent on the way back - not a ""10 m up, 10 m down"" type of trail   So I wonder, first of all, which elevation gain is best for one leg of the challenge (assuming I can find any route I want, within reason)? I imagine that 3 times 3000 m would be inconvenient because of temperature differences, and 89 times 100 m would be a burden for the brain. What other factors should I take into account?  Also, which altitude profile should I use? Make it too shallow and you should travel a big distance; make it too steep and it becomes hard to go down. Should the angle be uniform, or is it better to have flatter sections along the steep ascent? "
938,Etiquette of playing musical instruments on popular hikes,"I enjoy hiking, but I'm not very well-versed with the general expectations other people have about noise, especially serious hikers. I generally do trails that take between 3-6 hours, usually up hills/mountains (depending on your definition) on the Appalachian Trail. Often those trails are popular enough that if it's a nice day, I'll see another group every 10 minutes or so, and if there's an overlook at the top there may be a good 8-15 people up there at any point, usually a mix of casual hikers like me and others just passing through on their way up/down the Appalachian Trail.  Some of the groups I've gone with enjoy singing while hiking, or while resting at the top, and a couple of times I've brought an instrument (clarinet) along, to play both during the hike and at the summit. I do enjoy playing like that, but I don't want to bother people unnecessarily; I don't really have a good understanding for how far the sounds carries, or how other hikers, especially serious ones, feel about the music.   Let's assume that the instrument is being reasonably well-played (i.e. gentle tone, not squeaking/squealing, with not so many missed notes as to be distracting), because otherwise I'm sure the answer can't be anything besides ""Please stop"".    Is there any general etiquette or expectations about playing/making music on hiking trails?    I'm also linking this tangentially-related question on whether playing musical instruments while hiking is sufficient to keep away animals.    EDIT: Well, this was more contentious than I was expecting; answers range from ""Hearing music on the trail can be enjoyable"" to ""Don't even make a sound"". I appreciate the feedback from the people of the latter opinion, and I am not ignoring their statements.  Surely, though, there must be a balance, between allowing people who don't want to hear anything that would betray the presence of humankind in the area to enjoy themselves, and allowing people who like music (or especially, in my case, the feeling of playing gentle music in nature) to enjoy themselves as well. At the least, if I play again, I will endeavor to remove myself or my group from other people, to ask anyone nearby if they mind, and in any case to not play for long.  Regardless: if anyone (in the last year) hiked past someone playing snippets from hymns, Disney, and Broadway on a clarinet in the Shenandoah Nat'l park, and found it annoying, I apologize.    EDIT 2, in response to close-votes:  The question was about etiquette - a set of arbitrary, (at least originally) opinion-based, rules that are followed by a majority of people. It's inseparable from people's opinions, but surely it's a useful thing for new hikers to learn.   ""Does mild vinegar taste good?"" is hardly a useful question for a stackexchange. ""Do most people enjoy drinking vinegar?"" is an important question for a new chef to know the answer to. "
939,What is this black and yellow-striped caterpillar with four toothbrush-looking tufts of hair along the top?,"A friend found this caterpillar while hiking in the woods on Wachusett Mountain, in Central Massachusetts, United States, in the first week of September. It was on a fallen log under the leaves of a deciduous tree, but she didn't know the exact name of the tree. She only saw one. It appeared to be just over an inch long. It was close enough to touch, but she didn't want to in case it would sting or cause skin problems.  I've never seen anything like it!   The most unusual feature is a row of four white fur-looking tufts growing out of its back not too far from the head. I used ""tufts"" for lack of a better word since I don't know the real term. They look like toothbrushes to me!   The body has black and yellow stripes. It has some small yellow circular areas on the black stripes.   The head is bright red with tiny black eyes. There are also a few bright red spots on the back toward the tail. The two antennae are black, and the tail is brown.   Pretty much the entire caterpillar is covered with white furry-looking spikes, including some in the front of the head that look like whiskers. There are black spikes dispersed along the body. These are longer and there are fewer of them than the white ones. There are no spikes coming out of the tufts.  What is this fascinating caterpillar? What will it grow into and when? Is it poisonous or in some way irritation to skin?   "
940,How do people carry camping propane in a car when traveling?,"I'm very new to camping. In fact..I'm trying to prepare for my first camping. One thing that I can't find answer even after googling and searching this site is..how people travel with camping stove and its fuel.  It looks like storing propane in a car is somewhat dangerous, especially when it is hot outside. I plan to camp in a desert in summer.  Is it safe to travel in a car with camping propane?  What's the safety guideline? "
941,Why do people lock their tents at Everest Base Camp?,"I recently read Everest climbers worried about oxygen bottle theft which says:     What can you do when thieves break the locks of the tent and take away   oxygen bottles, food and even cooking gas?   which suggests that the people climbing Everest are locking their tents.  Obviously, the locks are not protecting their supplies.  Perhaps the broken locks could indicate the tents have been raided, but the raiders could just as easily have cut a hole in the tent.  I really think the climbers should be inventorying their supply whether or not tampering has been indicated.  What is the purpose of locking tents? "
942,How to rappel with a dog?,"My wife and I are planning a camping and climbing trip and we would likely need to rappel with our medium-sized (45lbs/20kg) dog. Holding the dog is obviously unacceptable, and using the dog's backpack is also unacceptable due to the flimsiness of the straps and buckles.  Simply from a technical perspective, and assuming the dog is capable and isn't traumatically afraid of heights (she's basically a mountain goat in a dog disguise), what equipment would I use to rappel with a dog? Would it be similar to rappelling with a child (except with a dog-specific harness, of course)? "
943,How would you protect yourself from Rocky Mountain Goats?,"After finding out that Rocky Mountain Goats have killed one person and have been known to harass hikers, how would you protect yourself from an aggressive goat? In most cases I would guess that simply staying a good distance away would be enough, but what if the goat decides to try and gore you? "
944,How safe is a chest harness when used without a sit harness?,"How safe is it to use a chest harness without a sit harness? I ask this question because of an experience I had while on holiday.  A couple of years ago I was in China and hiked/climbed HuaShan (see this link for some info/pictures). This is basically a hike but with some very steep sections protected by chains. The most dangerous (but optional) sections are cordoned off and, to access them, you are provided with what seemed like a chest harness by staff - I found a photo of one here. Would a harness of this kind be effective in the event of a slip/fall? I'm not sure; naively I'd have thought that a fall could leave you in an awkward position from which self-rescue would be impossible, or you could even slip out of the harness??  EDIT: thanks for the responses. Some more info about the specific situation at Hua Shan...   Until a few years ago there was no safety equipment whatsoever, despite the fact that this is an extremely busy route with access seemingly regulated by the authorities. I guess that China is not well known for its high standards of health and safety.  The harness photo doesn't tell the whole story; there are also some very steep (almost vertical) sections - the first link contains some photos which hint at these sections. It's not 'real' climbing - it is, however, a spectacular example of a situation where the use of wooden planks and pieces of iron has allowed access to terrain which would otherwise be considered a very highly graded and exposed rock climb. Some people would probably be happy to follow this route without any protection. However, I think that many people would prefer to have some level of protection on the route. I'm just concerned that the protection provided may offer only a false sense of security.  "
945,What's the policy and cost regarding picnic area in US regional parks?,"I've been to US regional parks a few times and managed to get a grill and picnic table for free, without reservation.  At the same time, when I look up park websites, for example Cabin John Regional Park, picnic shelters cost substantially:     Per 1/2 day morning (9am-2pm), residents  $80   So do I have to pay and/or reserve for picnic tables and grills or not? If not, is there a way to look up the availability of these free tables and grills? "
946,"What is a butterfly tag, and what's the procedure for applying it?","I was recently told that there are organizations, at least in the United States, that study migration of monarch butterflies by tagging them. The purpose, as in most animal migration monitoring, is to learn as much as possible about the animal, keep that animal population safe, and enable researchers to educate people regarding various species.  While banding and tagging of larger animals doesn't seem so difficult to me, I'm wondering some specific things about tagging a butterfly.   What does the tag look like?  What information does it contain?  How and where on the butterfly is it applied in such a way that the animal isn't damaged, either at the time or later, and so that it doesn't fall off?   "
947,Can I repair my climbing helmet strap?,"The other day the strap on my helmet snapped. It's not the main strap but the one that sits across the back of you head and has a tightening dial. So the helmet doesn't fall off but it also doesn't stay still anymore when moving my head around.  It's now effectivly useless as it rattles around on my head getting in the way and obstructing my view, etc. I'm considering fixing using gaffer tape (the old mountaineering adage that if you can't fix somehting using gaffer tape, you likely need to use more gaffer tape)?   Is this a good idea or should I discard it an get a new one?  Here's the model, it's a DMM brand:    The broken strap isn't quite visible on that photo.  Here's a similar helmet, see the plastic strap with the dial on it. That's what's broken. Notice it doesn't actually anchor anything in place, the main straps attach to the helmet itself:   "
948,"Is ""scat"" used to describe the droppings of any animal?","I understand that when you see animal droppings in the wilderness, it's referred to as ""scat.""  I have heard scat referred to when referencing bear, coyote and mountain lion droppings.  Is this the case for all animals?  For example, would you refer to pig or chicken droppings as ""scat""? "
949,Butterfly Migration over Lassen Peak,"Roughly 10 years ago I hiked up Lassen Peak in Northern California, and there was a huge (hundreds of thousands) butterfly migration going right over the top of the peak around this time of year. It was an amazing sight that I would love to share with my children but I don't know of any good resources that will let me know when the butterflies are passing over the peak. I was under the impression that this was part of an annual migration to Mexico. However, the park website states their migrations are human caused:      One of the most noticeable species is the California Tortoise Shell butterfly. These butterflies are orange-brown in color and can be seen by the thousands at times especially on the tops of peaks where wind currents have carried them. These population explosions are believed to be movements from areas that have been defoliated to new areas in search of a food source.   What is the real scoop is this an annual migration or something else?   Gratuitous picture below that I took and here is a link to a YouTube video that someone else took.  Neither one really captures the scale of the event though.   "
950,How should latex socks be fitted to a drysuit?,"I've picked up a surplus used aircrew Beaufort Mk 10 Immersion Suit (for aviation use, but I think there's more likely knowledge among watersports enthusiasts). It needs latex socks adding to the bottom of the legs.   (source: picclick.com)    There are plenty of YouTube tutorials, showing the basic principles which seems to be fairly straightforward - stick the latex sock on the inside of the suit, cover the joint in and out with tape.  Except, my suit has two layers of cloth at the end of the feet. They seem to have old glue inside, so I presume I should sandwich the latex feet between them when I glue?     "

953,Safety in re-slinging old trad gear,"I have read some posts here regarding the expiration dates of climbing material, especially trad gear. Friends and nuts (as all climbing equipment) have a lifespan of 10 years according to all manufacturers, but I believe the expiration dates of some pieces are longer than our own lives. This is the case with friends, nuts and hexes: there are no parts that should change a lot in time, and even less if you're climbing in mild environments (away from salt water, ice that has a very low pH, etc). Regarding friends, the only part that should be substituted is the sling, and many manufacturers ask you to send old equipment to them so that they can re-sling it for you.  The point here is that climbing is a major (since last week, olympic) sport now, but 60 years ago it was an unorganised niche of potential suicides. There were no companies that would do that for you: people would build hexes and nuts out of old bathroom plumbing, and would sling them with chords and cordelettes. Modern climbing material still teaches how to re-sling old trad gear or build belay cordelettes, which means tying mainly the water knot or the double (ot triple, etc) fisherman's knot, presented below.       Now, keeping in mind people have used both of those knots in climbing for the last century, it's hard for me to believe they aren't safe. I've read that the impact of a hard fall would be enough to ""melt"" something and then bla bla, but I didn't find any evidence of that on the web. In fact, I think it might be possible to prove that this sentence cannot be true. I have some gear that I have re-slinged with the water knot and it has been catching me every day (this doesn't mean it works, I just might have been lucky 200 times in a row).  Now, does anyone have any evidence of re-slinged material or any of those knots failing?  All those pictures of climbing heroes like Chouinard and Long climbing with dozens of cordelette-slinged hexes on their racks... Were they at risk?  "
954,What is the working range of TRUBLUE auto belay?,"The local climbing gym has several TRUBLUE auto belays but one can soon tire of the same routes. Will the auto belay work if one climbs a route next to it? At what angles does it still arrest a fall?  I found this mention of belay lanes but it only cites swinging and webbing wear as factors, not potential arrest failure. "
955,Why do some birds fly in a V-formation?,"When birds gather into groups, they fly in a variety of different formations and patterns.   Some birds fly in a formation that looks like the letter ""V"". Several species of geese, pelicans, and ibis are just a few of the more commonly known. This is their normal flying behavior, but can be more evident during migration due to the large numbers headed in the same direction.   Many of the other common birds fly in swarms or flocks without any obvious pattern. There's also a type of flock, exhibited breathtakingly by starlings, which is called a murmuration. It's a group of literally thousands of birds flying in magnificent and unique patterns.  I took the picture below over a lake in Rhode Island, United States, recently. The geese had just taken off and were flying in some side-by-side V-shaped groups. As they got farther away they gathered into smaller, tighter, individual V-shaped groups. Of course I've seen this behavior before, but on that particular evening, as I watched these geese leave the area, I began to ponder it more deeply.   Why do some birds fly in a V-formation? Is it just a random pattern or is there a reason for it?   "
956,Camping on top of a mountain,"I have experience in backpacking but have no climbing experience. I am trying to learn how to camp on top of mountains after class 2 or 3 climbing. My motive is to take sunrise and sunset photos. After tons of research, camping on top seems to be the only way to avoid climbing at dark. I know there are many other things I need to learn. So I am looking for some help. I want to use Mt. Agassiz as an example, as it is the first one I am going to attempt.  My biggest concern is lightning and thunderstorm. How do you guys minimize the risk? I know thunderstorm is common in summer afternoons. Should I absolutely avoid camping on top in summer? For the tent, I have Hilleburg Nallo 2 and Big Agnas Copper Spur 2, for my wife and me. Are they suitable for this kind of camping? I know it is hard to find a flat space on the rocks and talus. I am open to buy something new if it is necessary. From weight standpoint, I do not see that bivy has much benefit as two bivys weight might be close to my Copper Spur. Also should I expect high wind at night? "
957,In what situations is it irresponsible not to carry a PLB or satellite messenger device?,"The motivation for this question is the impalement question.  The impalement question asked what to do in a particular catastrophic accident if      Phones are dead, you don't have a PLB, and if you walked out, help could not arrive in less than three days   I think it is irresponsible to be three days away from any type of communication, given the availability of a PLB or a satellite communication device.  Obviously, one doesn't carry such a device when walking the dog to the grocery store, and maybe not on a well travelled trail, with many access points, such as the C&amp;O Towpath.  But does there come a point where one should carry such a device, not only for one's own safety but out of consideration for family and rescuers?  If so, what are the these minimum conditions?    Several questions have asked about features of these devices, and the conditions under which they should be activated, but I could not find a question about when it is irresponsible not to carry them.      "
958,Can I safely eat grass?,"A recent comment      Cows eat grass, doesn't mean you can!   got me thinking.  Corn, wheat, rice, etc are all grass that we eat regularly.  I am not sure the human race could survive on the planet without eating grass.    But in all fairness, for the most part humans only eat the grains of the grass.  Can I eat the other parts of the grass also?   If yes, what do I need to know and/or do to prepare the grass for eating? "
959,What is the responsible way to sell a firearm?,"I am moving to a different state soon. In order to make the move easier I have decided to sell some of my firearms. I live in a state that doesn't have universal background checks, unfortunately.   What is the most responsible way to sell my firearms? From other listings I have seen, most people just take an approach of only selling to CCW holders. That's not a bad idea - are there other good ways? I'm making the assumption that selling to a pawn shop will give me nowhere near good value for my collection. But they would conduct background checks on the future buyer right?   What type of receipt should I be issuing with the firearm?  "
960,Why does poo smell more after someone is back from a trek/hike?,"Blaming it on my roommate all the way.  He goes for a 3 day hike, whenever he is back, he is tired, thats obvious and evident. The night he comes in, he goes to washroom (for poo) and his poo smells real bad.  Is it common/normal?   (I too face the same issue once in a while). What might he be doing wrong? Is it related to hydrating habits and/or diet?  Hydration: Never dehydrated really. Water intake might be a bit low as compared to a regular day, but manageable. Diet: Mostly white bread and pickle/jam/sauce or butter as lunch. Lots of tomatoes, carrots and cucumbers to munch on. Some variant of steamed rice as the dinner. "
961,How is a fifi used in aid climbing?,"While reading this question it stuck me as odd that a fifi hook is mentioned on par with a daisy chain.  Not being trained for aid climbing, I'm not sure why I'd want to use a fifi at all. The only use I know for a fifi (and a somewhat dangerous use) is to retrieve the rope if you're the last descender and can't retrieve your rope using the common means (such as using double rope and pulling one end).  How is the fifi hook used in aid climbing? And how is the need for it replaced with a daisy chain?  What other uses does the fifi hook have? "
962,What are offwidth cracks and what makes them so hard to climb?,"There is a notorious kind of crack called offwidths. Several friends of mine stated, that they were pretty devastated at first when they were not able to do 5.8 offwidths in the valley. Later they learnd, that this was quite common. There has even been an epic film called ""Wide Boyz"" about two british climbers taking on the hardest american offwidths. My questions are:  What exactly is an offwidth crack?  What makes offwidth hard to climb? Or less subjective: What technique is required ascend an offwidth? "
963,De-stinking my water shoes,"I have a pair of water shoes with a thick rubber sole and a neoprene upper. They provide good protection from coral cuts, stonefish etc.     In the past I've used these in the Ontario wilderness (fresh water and mud) for a day or two, then left them kicking around my house, and never had a problem. On this trip, I'm wearing them in the ocean, and walking along trails that cross rivers repeatedly or involve long sections of walking in the river. I am wearing them almost every day, and when I'm not wearing them they are often in a plastic bag in a suitcase. ([website]Well, you can probably guess where this is going. They reek. But I don't think soap or detergent are good for neoprene. And I don't have access to newspaper as a general rule. At the moment I am getting a bit obsessive about getting them out of the plastic bags as soon as we arrive at a new hotel. If there's a deck or balcony, I put them out there. It is helping a little. Is there anything else I can do? Should I get obsessive about finding some newspaper and packing them in that when they have to go in the plastic bag again? Should I rinse them out with clean water whenever I take them off? I wasn't expecting them to need so much looking after and I don't really know how to give them whatever looking after it is they need. So, what do they need? "
964,What types of trees are in these intertwined groups in Massachusetts?,"Last week we were walking at the Wachusett Reservoir in Central Massachusetts, USA.  Next to the path was a group of mature trees, the largest of which was a maple, with various sizes of smaller tree trunks intertwined among them.  In some of the groupings, the narrower trunks are wrapped around the wider sections. Their barks vary, and none have leaves.  One has fur, but only at higher elevations. Our picture of that is at least 8 feet up a maple tree. I didn't get too close to the bases, but as the pictures show, some appear to be growing sideways directly out of the ground. Although the area is draped in vines, we couldn't find leaves attached to any of the trunks, with the exception of the large maples. They have lots of healthy foliage, but only above the area where the intertwining ones end.  The whole tableau is beautiful, almost surreal. What are the names of these trees? Why do they behave in this manner?  Click on pictures for full size.  [              "

970,What to do if you cross paths with a buck?,"On my last bike ride I was riding on a trail and I was going pretty fast, fast enough that I went around a corner really fast and there was a doe right in front of me. I stopped as fast as I could. We both looked at each other and it looked more scared than I was. I was looking around to make sure there wasn't a buck near by. If it was a buck I had run into, it would have been more likely to attack me. So now my question is, what should I do if I run into a buck? Should I bring anything to protect myself that won't kill the animal? Pepper spray perhaps? "
971,Does a red headscarf or hat provide better protection from the sun?,"I read in an old tourist guide (from the beginning of the 20th century) that during mountain walks on sunny days one should wear a red headscarf or a hat with red lining to avoid heat stroke, because the red colour gives better protection against sunlight.  Is this really true? Does red colour actually provide better sun protection?  "
972,Using a Girth Hitch in Alpine Draws,"I've recently started making my alpine (or ""trad"") draws by girth hitching one end of a sling to the gear side carabiner and then clipping and passing the rope side through as usual. The girth hitch makes it easy to lengthen the draw one handed as all you need to do is unclip the two loose loops from the gear side carabiner and the sling will lengthen automagically.   Its a technique I learned from a german mountain/climbing guide friend of mine. Personally I think it's a lot easier to lengthen the sling than the standard way of making alpine draws. The knot reduced the runner rating in half, but since there are two strands , its back to the UIAA standard of 22KN, well above any forces seen in lead falls on intermediate pro (not to mention the ratings on the pro itself).   On a recent trip a climbing partner pointed out that the girth hitch can induce horizontal forces on the carabiner, and if the hitch slips ""up"" the carbiner it can even load the gate and slide off.  Which got me to reexamine my alpine draw technique.  Just to demonstrate, (not my image), the way a girth hitch looks on the biner. The two loops have a slight tendency to slide up the two sides of the biner if the knot isn't loaded/tightened (I make sure to give it a yank when placing).    So is what I'm doing bad or known to be wrong? I trust my guide friend, but maybe I should pass on this particular tip?  "
973,How much garlic in the mountain kitchen?,"How much garlic should I use in the mountain kitchen during backpacking camps?  I'm asking from the perspective of the person who wants to plan such a camp and the menu on it. Walking a lot with a heavy backpack, often in bad weather condition, and sleeping outside when the nights can be cold is a very high effort for the body. Garlic stimulates the immune system, which in such situation is very important.  On the other hand, large amounts of garlic may increase the risk of bleeding by thinning the blood: [website]I'm considering a daily dose of garlic for the participants. For myself at home I'm adding one clove of garlic to dinner, so I think that should be a daily portion for the participant. But many people suggest it is too much.  So, my question is, what portion of garlic would be consider safe, and still have a positive impact on immune system? Is the one clove per person per day too much, too little, or just enough? "
974,Will boiling be enough to decontaminate standing water from pathogens and toxins?,"Will the boiling of the water itself be enough to decontaminate water taken from such standing water reservoir as that:   This water looks horrible, and probably drinking it raw would cause serial diarrhea, however, is boiling of this water enough to be safe to drink? What would be required to make it safe to drink?  Beside from killing bacteria and possible parasites, the problem are the toxins, especially from carcass, like those from staphylococcus, that, according to articles like Detection of Bacterial Toxins in Food are heat resistant. Does it mean, that no matter how long the water is boiled, the toxin will stay?  Of course, I'd filter this water using a screen (e.g. my shirt) before pouring it into mess tin. Iodine would also be useful. But what else can I do to minimize the danger of poisoning? "
975,Can I eat rotten meat and carcass given enough cooking?,"I've met often with the concept that rotten meat and carcass is inedible because of bacteria and toxins. The most harmful is the botulinum toxin.  However, in the question Can any waterborne pathogens survive boiling?, a link pointed to an article with some pertinent information. That link now leads to a missing page. However, it mentioned that:           The botulinum toxin is destroyed by boiling the food for 10 minutes.      The pathogens mentioned there are also destroyed by high temperatures, so, at least theoretically, it should be safe to eat rotten meat, as long as it is cooked or baked long enough, so that the high temperature penetrates it fully, and we let it work for at least 10 minutes.   So, meat baked in a fire for about an hour or two should be safe. Is my conclusion correct? "
976,What types of resources are best for identifying trees while hiking?,"I'd like to start identifying trees in my area as a project with my kids while we are hiking.    What is best for tree identification? Is it a good color book such as the Audubon Field Guide to North American trees, which they have for the Eastern Region, and the  Western Region? Is there a good tree identification app for smartphones, or some third option I'm not aware of?  I know tree identification is often complex as leaves can be similar, and usually require a combination of factors (bark, leaves, etc).  I'd like a resource where I look up a tree based on its leaf and bark features, not its name, so that I can avoid spending hours flipping through pages. "
977,Avoiding compression when packing synthetic sleeping bag,"I came across the following comment (From durable 3-season bag.):     don't forget that synthetic doesn't last nearly as long even if you take extremely good care of it (i.e. never compress it) – Ryley   It got me thinking if I might be packing my bag wrong. I store it in a larger uncompressed bag when not on the go, but on the go I use the tiny bag it came with.  I don't doubt the small bag is fine, but how do I take the best care? What should I consider doing to pack my sleeping bag best?   Rolling or stuffing? Loose or tight? Completely avoiding the tiny bag?  "
978,How does one steer a two-person kayak?,"My wife and I recently bought an inflatable, tandem kayak.  I grew up canoeing and we've had many enjoyable outings on the water together, so I thought two-person kayaking would be relatively easy.  When I take the craft out solo, I find it very responsive, easy to steer, and (for a recreational-class craft) straight-tracking.  But when I take someone else out, it's a different boat.  We can't steer and the tracking is all over the map.  It's not just the extra weight&mdash;when I ask the other person to stop paddling, the craft becomes sensible again.  Obviously, we're doing something wrong.  In a canoe, I can teach my partner the basic stroke and we can get into the water right away.  But a kayak doesn't seem to work that way.    Google gives lots of results but they can be divided roughly into two categories:   ""Tandem kayaks require teamwork"" (Really?) Fairly technical discussions about strokes and weight distribution and the purpose of skegs/rudders and etc.   What none of the results (or at least none that I've found) explain is how an experienced paddler can guide their partner to work as a team.  Any suggestions? "
979,How harmful is the rising/setting sun?,"Often, while hiking, my companions and I treat the very early/late sun as being less harmful (as far as skin cancer and UV radiation are concerned). For example, we might not apply sunscreen immediately after waking, but only after an hour or so, or skip putting on another round of sunscreen if it's relatively late (say, an hour before sunset).  My question is- is the sun less dangerous at these times? Is this bad for us? We don't backpack/hike that often, so it's not a very common occurrence, and it hasn't led to sunburn as far as I know. But I would like to know if there is gradual damage being caused to my skin.  I asked this related question on the Fitness Stack Exchange, but it doesn't seem to be getting the attention (or answers) I'd like. "
980,Is there a consensus or ethic for rappelling off a tree?,"When trad climbing I have seen many people wrap their rope around a tree and then rappel, and then yank the rope down at the next belay station or tree. I have also seen the scarring as a result of this over time on some trees. I can see doing this is remote places where there simply is no other option, but I am concerned about trees at high traffic areas like the Gunks, and moreover I am concerned about people's safety rappelling down on damaged trees.    Are my concerns about tree damage warranted? Is there a consensus in the climbing community whether this is an acceptable practice?  If this is an issue, is there a way for me to minimize this personally or within the climbing community as a whole?  "
981,How to make two strand cord or string?,How is two-strand cord braided? What shape cordage material works best for this technique?  Do you need to start from relatively round cordage or can something strong but more flat (like a tough grass) be used? 
982,How to use campus boards,"I'm looking at improving (actually starting) my training regime. My local climbing Gym has just installed various campus boards.    How do you use these to train effectively? What's the technique process for using them, etc?  What area's of your climbing are they aimed at improving? "
983,Is it safe to be in a vehicle during lightning/thunderstorms?,Recently a friend and I were offroading in the local mountains and while ascending a trail a storm blew in. We were out in the open near the top of the mountain when lightning started. We weren't sure if we would be safe inside our vehicles so we stopped and got out and moved away from them. After talking a few minutes some other people came down from the other side of the mountain and we decided to follow them back down.  Did we make the right decision regarding exiting the vehicles and moving away from them? Or is it safer to stay inside your vehicle during a lightning storm? 
984,Fatigue on high altitudes,"Time and again I read how climbers feel incredible fatigue on altitudes 7000+ m. Most of us have probably flown in airplanes on altitudes greater than that in pressurized passenger airplanes and didn't feel any fatigue at all.  Likewise climbers can bring their own oxygen with them, but still complain of incredible fatigue. So much so, that they cannot even carry away the corpses of deceased climbers off some mountains. What causes this incredible fatigue? The low pressure? Or is it a lie? "
985,Hiking and wild sleeping in California wilderness,"I want to spend a few days in California, near Nicasio, hiking and sleeping under the sky (no tent, just a tarp in case it rains). I have a lot of experiences in Europe, but I have never been in US. What things should I take in mind?   Is it generaly OK with the land owners? I have read sleeping might be a problem. What about hiking? What potential predators are present in this area? Black bear, brown bear, grizzly, coyote, wolf, mountain lion? According to what I've found, there is only mountain lion and coyote. Black bear shouldn't be present around Nicasio Is it generally desired to make fire? It might fend off predators, but could offend land owners?  "
986,How well does solar recharging work when strapped to the backpack?,"This answer recommends solar cells to recharge batteries.  However, this likely works best during a layover day.  I usually don't have those.  For a nice-to-have situation, how well does it work to strap a solar cell/panel to the backpack to charge a set of batteries?  When walking, the panel will not be optimally oriented toward the sun.  Will I be able to charge a set of 2 rechargable AA batteries during a full day hiking in mountains on a sunny day at 50-55°N in September?  What about a cloudy day? "
987,"Using a ""tarp"" over the entrance of a snow cave",Is it true that a tarp shouldn't be covering the entrance of a snow-cave while sleeping in one? What's the reasoning to that? Is using a sleeping bag in them just fine? 
988,In a survival situation is it actually efficient to eat edible plants?,"In a survival situation is it actually efficient to eat edible plants?  Assume late spring to early fall in a temperate climate.  We have plenty of questions about where to find edible plants and how to identify them, but I have read that one would expend more energy in gathering them than it would be worth and that the energy would be better spent trying to get back to civilization.  If I remember correctly, nuts are energy efficient enough to be worth gathering, but berries are not.  Is there any evidence to back this up one way or another? "
989,"I didn't apply enough DWR treatment to my jacket, can I just add more?","I went and applied grangers DWR treatment to my waterproof cycling jacket and put it in the dryer for a few minutes to set it. After my first couple rides, it appears there are a few small spots where it is wetting out immediately.   Can I simply wet the jacket and apply more DWR? Should I dry it in the dryer again? Or do I need to wash and re-proof? "
990,Drinking water while standing vs seated,"I have heard people suggesting to drink water when you are seated after a tiresome activity. They usually ask to avoid drinking water while standing upright.  Does that have an actual scientific reasoning, or is just baseless advice?  You could slam me for it being easy to google, and I have googled for it. But when we talk about trekking, climbing, swimming, cycling, etc... its a different situation. As a trekker or cyclist I'd be mad at me sitting periodically to get a sip of water.  Any thoughts? "
991,"What are directional, height, and distance guidelines for marking trails?","Generally, I'm more used to methods described here for the US.  Our task this past weekend was to use dots to remark a trail, but the method of placement was opposite to what I'm used to: the dots were placed inward toward the path - only one dot.  I questioned the wisdom of such placement, but the ranger was adamant: one dot placed facing the trail in a perpendicular fashion.  He affixed the first marker to be sure his point was made.  So he seemed to be following advice more or less offered here.  Is there ever a good reason to place markers facing the trail, rather than facing the direction of walk?  What about height and distance - how far apart should blazes be posted? "
992,At what angle should an ice screw be screwed into the ice?,"Recently we were climbing up a glacier with the ice at an angle of around 80°. We were placing the ice screws angling slightly upwards with respect to the slope of the ice wall.   However, one from our team, who stays in Norway said that the screws should always be angled downwards such that the weight is taken completely by the threads of the screw and not by the ice patch surrounding the ice screw. Apparently, this is how he was taught by a guide while climbing up a frozen waterfall.  For us, it felt natural to angle up the ice screws so that in case of a fall, the screw held on to the ice (similar to angling the pegs of a tent away from the tent). The claim that the weight of a fall should be taken completely by the ice screw and its threads seems a bit risky to me.  So is the claim correct? What's the general practice? Does the practice vary for a waterfall climb (as damaging the ice there could potentially lead to a whole slab of the waterfall falling off?)? "
993,How can I safely use a candle lantern inside a tent?,I have a candle lantern housed inside what I think is an aluminum frame. I'm concerned it will get hot enough to melt fabrics.   How can I safely use it inside a tent?  Should I suspend it from the tent ceiling somehow?  Is it safe to fall asleep with it lit? 
994,What is the energy difference between green and seasoned fire wood?,"I know from personal experience that greenwood (freshly cut) does not provide as much heat energy as seasoned wood (has been down for 6-12 months).  When burning it spends a lot of it's energy boiling the water out of the wood.  It takes more green wood to provide the same amount of heat as you would get from seasoned wood.  Assuming I let my firewood season for 12 months, if I burn seasoned fire wood and my neighbor burns green wood, how much more fire wood will he burn in season?   According to the Wikipedia article Heating value of firewood there are a lot of variables.  I am just looking for general rule of thumb.  I always burn seasoned wood, but my neighbor just moved into his homestead and will need to burn greenwood this winter.  How much more wood should he expect to need, compared to my normal usage?  "
995,Trekking Poles - Carbon Fiber vs. Aluminum,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of carbon fiber vs. aluminium when buying trekking poles?  Are carbon fiber really lighter, do they break easier if jammed wrong, etc.?   "
996,Nose-diving when catching a wave on a longboard,"I tried surfing for the first time recently on a yellow foam longboard, the type typically used for teaching as it is less likely to damage you if it hits you on the head ;)  I started out just trying to catch waves lying down, to gain familiarity with the balance of the board and paddling it around. I found that even positioned quite far back, as soon as I caught the wave, the nose would dip underwater and I'd somersault over the top of it.  Is this normal, and something that wouldn't happen if I jumped to standing position as I caught the board - you're not supposed to surf these boards lying down after all - or does it indicate some other issue with what I'm trying to do? I didn't see anyone else reporting similar issues when I had a quick look along the beach or on the web... is it just front/back weight distribution or should the board not be pointed completely at 90 degrees to the wave, etc, etc? "
997,How can I clear spiderwebs in my path while hiking?,"I went hiking this weekend in a national forest on trails that see little use. In parts there were many spiderwebs crossing the trail - sometimes full webs (which I could usually, but not always, clear before passing) and sometimes just a few strands of silk between trees, which were nearly impossible to see depending on lighting conditions.  After a couple times getting spiderweb to the face, I started waving a stick in a figure-8 pattern around eye level every so often and when I suspected there may be a web (for instance, foliage sticking in on either side of the trail). This helped mostly on the full webs I found, but I still kept running into random strands, which made for a very unpleasant hike.  Is there a better way to clear spiderwebs when I can't see them? Are there tell-tale signs that strands of web might be crossing in my path? "
998,Camping stove with plane allowed fuel,"Is there a camping stove that works with fuel you are allowed to take on a plane?  Often I fly somewhere without possibility to buy any fuel for my stove after landing. In those cases I take an Esbit stove with me. The Esbit tablets are not allowed on a plane, but don't stand out when going through the scanner so they almost always pass without a problem.  However, illegal is illegal and I would feel better having an option that will not get confiscated when detected. Does such an option exist?  I realise that there is a very bad fit between the words ""flammable"" and ""airplane"", but hoped that someone knows an option that I didn't think about.   Border condition: regular commercial flights where you have to go trough a security check at an international airport. Liquid fuels and camping gas are usually mentioned in the pictograms with forbidden objects. The time that my Esbit tablets were caught the discussion was over when the flammable icon on the package was spotted.  Problems that I've encountered with gas/diesel:   I usually depend on public transportation. A pump is often not exactly within walking distance of the airport. Especially troublesome if you have a limited connection time to get the bus or train. Pumps often don't like filling my small bottle. They want a minimum amount (usually solved if you pay for that minimum amount) and I've had cases where filling a metal container was not allowed. I've solved that by buying a bottle of some drink, drinking it, filling the bottle and pouring from drinking bottle to fuel bottle. Messy to get rid of the remainder when flying back. The best way to do that would be another question.   By taking my fuel with me I basically want to eliminate a factor that is largely out of my control, not always predictable and a potential time sink. I often fly somewhere for 2-4 days and then you don't want to burn that time running errands. "
999,Machine Washable Sleeping Cot,"I am looking for a machine washable sleeping cot (metal/aluminum frame off the ground). I have seen that most cots are made out of a water resistant material (nylon/polyester/canvas) 600D. I have seen that most cots are not listed as specifically machine washable; there are a few but they do not meet other requirements (price, size, color, height). If it matters, I am looking for an XXL. Most of my searches for ""machine washable sleeping cot"" return results for dog mats. To be clear, I am not talking about a washable ""sleeping pad"" that can go on top of the canvas.  Questions:   Does water resistance affect machine washability? I guess I've washed plenty of water resistant synthetic material before, but these may not be the same. If it does not say machine washable, are there coatings or other reasons why Nylon/Polyester/Canvas 600D base material cannot be machine washed? Is it more likely that a cot not listed as machine washable will be designed such that it might be too  difficult to quickly remove the nylon material from the frame? Or do they know people will possibly want to wash them? Are there any modular options, wherein the nylon portion is not dependent on the frame, and can be purchased seperately depending in needs, mixed and matched, etc. What has been you experience machine washing these types of products?   *Not sure if people are allowed to suggest products or manufacturers. The most promising appears to be the Teton Sports Outfitter XXL, but it is not listed as machine washable. Yes, I can contact the company myself. "
1000,What Suction Cups Were Used To Climb Trump Tower?,There is a video here.    Basically I won't say I'm planning to do the same thing but would like to find out more behind how he did it.  Someone told me the suction cups were intended for construction and not climbing but I'm not really sure.  The following which looks similar requires an air compressor. If it requires a small air compressor how did Steve do it? 
1001,Alternative Gooseneck options for small home built sail boats,"I am planning a homebuilt sailing craft that uses a sail similar to the Sunfish (image below) I have seen a few homebuilt sails that use metal electrical conduit for the mast and spars, and am working on a similar design for myself.  In the sunfish a Gooseneck is used to connect the boom to the mast. $84 seems a bit much for one peice of a homebuilt sailing rig.    I had contemplated a Forged Swivel at $13 it seems more cost effective, and looks to be at least as strong. (Working load weight 3600 lbs for the 1/2 model) but would probably need to be connected to the mast and boom with rope or ""C"" clamps.  What is a good solution for the low budget homebuilt sailboat maker?    "
1002,"When making camp in the mountains, which direction should I face my tent?","Sometimes I hear that, when making camp in the mountains, a tent should be pitched so the door is facing a certain direction, usually downhill. I've repeatedly asked why I should do this, and the answers I've received are always ""I don't know"".  Should I pitch my tent so it faces downhill - or some other direction? Why? "
1003,"Is Off Trail Travel Between Lakes in the Humphreys Basin, CA Feasible","I'm looking to explore the a number of High Sierra lakes in California's John Muir Wilderness; specifically in Humphreys Basin. Geology (from photographs) appears severe with rock, scree, and debris, Topography appears manageable, and the vegetation appears sparse. The trails move across the North side of the basin and continue out of the area. Inter-lake trails are not denoted on the USGS maps.    Does anyone have any experience bouncing between these lakes in this area? Is the geology and vegetation easy to pass through within the basin? "
1004,Could spray foam insulation be used effectively as an emergency sleeping bag?,Is it harmful for our health? How thick should the foam be around the body to be okay down to 0degC with warm clothes underneath? Is there enough foam for this in a 500ml can (average man)? Or two?  I thought this could be a great cheap and compact alternative to expensive and big sleeping bags.  Note that a waterproof and windbreaker cover should certainly be used around the foam. 
1005,Can rock climbers easily transition to canyoning?,"Rock climbing and canyoning/canyoneering are very different. However, it seems like the two disciplines would also have significant overlap in skills and gear-- knots, rappel techniques, harness, rope, belay/rappel device, etc.  Can rock climbers easily transition to canyoning? If so, what sorts of canyoning-specific knowledge and equipment would he or she need to begin, assuming they already have climbing basics?  Note: I think my question is different from this one since they stated they do not have climbing experience.  "
1006,"What order of response time can I expect if I hit the ""911"" button on my SPOT Satellite Personal Tracker?","A friend gave us a satellite communication gadget that has three buttons to send three messages, two of them to a programmed address ((1) location and (2) alert), and the third is a ""911"" button.  We've never been close to needing emergency help, but of course that is no guarantee of the future.  Does anyone on this site know what happens when one hits ""911"" in the Rockies or Sierra? (It's OK to narrow it down.)  Personal or second-hand experience?  (Rest assured, I am not going to perform the experiment to satisfy curiosity!)  And, what should I do to maximize being spotted from the air?  Assume above timberline.   Long ago, before GPS and commercial satellite communication, I was relaxing beside a stream in the Bear Lakes region (over Italy Pass), when a helicopter that had been making repeated passes over the area landed near me, a man jumped out, and asked me if I had pneumonia.  They were looking for a sick hiker near Vee Lake ""and you are the only person we see lying down.""  They weren't sure which lake was Vee Lake.  Several hours later, I saw the actual evacuation. The campsite was tastefully hidden among rocks.           "
1007,Alternatives to Dacron backing on fly reel?,"I am thinking about changing the backing on my reel for something thinner and stronger like gel spun line (I'm currently using 20lb Dacron). The goal is to fit enough backing into the reel for Atlantic salmon fishing.  The reason is that I bought a new fly line that is both longer and thicker than the previous one, which was a sinking tip one. Now I can't fit the previous 200 yd of backing that I had.  I know that the answer is to buy a larger reel, but before that I would like to try some alternatives. I have heard that there is gel spun and that some people use fireline as well, but will these work well? Will the attach well to the reel spool? Won't they damage the fly line where it is attached to them? Will I risk cutting my fingers? "
1008,Recommended ascents for the improving mountaineer,"Considering a high level of fitness, but limited mountaineering skills (some indoor climbing, a few via ferratas and high altitude hikes), what hikes would you recommend as training (and perhaps some acclimatization) for the ascent of Mont Blanc? Ideally they would be in easy/affordable reach from London (via Geneva, Venice, Zurich) and would provide similar technical challenges but perhaps at a lower altitude. The last high altitude hike was painful between 3500 and 5000 meters. After that the diamox kicked in :)  The question was aimed at suitable routes that will provide the training to build the necessary experience. The area where I lack the experience is the use of crampons/glacier hikes. The tour would be guided.    Edit: the comments have proven that this question was misworded, so let me try again. What short trips would you recommend for the novice/improving mountaineer in order to build up the necessary skills to tackle more challenging peaks? The focus is on safely acquiring the technique, rather than physical training. Shorter (1-3 days) treks would be preferred, and so would the travel accessibility. Thank you "
1009,How to repair a plastic canoe?,I have an older plastic Coleman canoe. It gets a lot of abuse I have noticed some weak spots that may be a problem in the future.  I looked around online and seems that they are made of High-density polyethylene (HDPE) one of the first things I found was this welding video which seems like a pretty sweet solution.  But I am also finding some references that suggest repairs to plastic canoes don't last long.  I was not able to tell if welding as shown in the video was a long term or short term solution.    What if any solution is there for long term repairs to plastic canoes that will hold up as well as the original canoe materiel?  
1010,How many miles per hour can a person travel a day on foot?,this is my first question.  I want to know how many miles can walk a person in different terrains. The terrains are:   Flat (Prairie) Snowy  Desertic  Boggy   If a person have a backpack with some weight... How this weight affects his speed? How much it decrease? 
1011,Restoring water repellency in leather hiking boots,"I have a pair of leather boots that are a couple of years old. They were fairly expensive and I'm not a big fan of discarding and replacing things so I'm hoping they can still be of use to me. The problem is that the boots leak through the leather.  The sole seems well sealed and I recently had a cobbler apply a new layer of glue at the sole to ensure this wasn't the issue. I believe the problem is the leather because my feet become wet after an hour or so of hiking in wet conditions and there is little to no beading of water droplets on the surface - the rain just soaks in.  I have waxed the leather repeatedly and tried both solid (at room temperature) and water-based waxes, following the label's instructions each time.  I have taken great care to not dry my boots close to a heat source but they have at times been left in a sealed car on a hot day in southern Canada.  Is there any hope for the leather in my boots? Does anyone have a novel remedy for reinvigorating the material and restoring some greater level of water repellency?  Any thoughts much appreciated. "
1012,Does touching the tent outer wall from the inside make it leak?,"This question about how not to make anything touch the outer wall of the tent implies that doing so lets the outer tent leak water through. I never head this problem with my vango mirage tent during a recent trip in heavy rain and wind even though my bag touched the outer tent and the wind pushed the outer tent onto the lower parts of the inner tent on the sides. Still from scouting I know that with this Spatz tent the outer tent will leak when touched from the inside.  What materials/surface treatments of tent outer walls do/don't leak water when touched from the inside?  As a bonus but not really outdoor related: What is the reason for one material to (not) leak?  EDIT: The distinction that it is not leaking before touching and leaking after touching is important. It is obvious that when it leaked before and you touch the outer, that the inner gets wet. "
1013,Why do some fisheries have a lower size limit and others have an upper size limit for keeping fish?,"My home river has a minimum size limit of 50 cm for keeping atlantic salmon, while I have seen online that some other places have a maximum size limit above which fish cannot be retained. Why is there such difference between fisheries? Which way is more efficient in terms of conservation? What are the arguments for one or another? "
1014,Sports tape to prevent blisters while backpacking?,My doctor just used sports tape on me for a hip injury. I had never used sports tape before and realized that it might work well for blister prevention on my feet while backpacking. It seems very similar to the Spenco brand from the US that I order and keep on hand because nothing like it is available in stores here. Sports tape is much cheaper and readily available and therefore would be a good substitute. Has anyone used this very adhesive cotton(?) tape for foot blister prevention?  
1015,What accounts for the predominance of Kendall Mint Cake over York Peppermint Pattie in mountaineering expeditions?,"I have eagerly consumed many accounts of early mountaineering expeditions in which the mountaineers always eagerly consumed Kendal Mint Cake (KMC). I got the impression that they would have found it unthinkable to set off without it.   Note that it is difficult to digest anything at very high altitudes, because digestion involves oxidation.  Sugar, a simple carb, is the easiest thing to digest, and that is about all KMC is.  Wikipedia, Kendal Mint Cake says:      Sir Edmund Hillary and his team carried Romney's Kendal Mint Cake with   them on the first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953.[2] The   packaging currently includes the following: “'We sat on the snow and   looked at the country far below us … we nibbled Kendal Mint   Cake.'[this quote needs a citation]       A member of the successful Everest expedition wrote – 'It was easily   the most popular item on our high altitude ration – our only criticism   was that we did not have enough of it.'”[2]      Mint cake was provided for the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of   1914–1917, which was led by Sir Ernest Shackleton.[13]      Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman included mint cake in their supplies   for their 2004 motorcycle trip around the world in Long Way Round.      The Kendal Mint Cake is also a standard part of the 24-hour ration   pack issued to the Irish Defence Forces.   The basic ingredients (sugar and peppermint flavoring) -- and the picture in the link above -- seem very similar to the York Peppermint Pattie, which     was first produced in York, Pennsylvania, by Henry Kessler at his York   Cone Company in 1940,[1] for sale in the Northeastern United States,   Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Florida.   The preeminence of Mint Cake in extreme expeditions may simply be because it got a much earlier start than the Peppermint Pattie, but were there other factors in play also? Is there any evidence that PP even tried to compete in that niche?  (I have no connection to the producers of either.)     "
1016,camping equipment testing if no yard,"I am looking into getting camping equipment and doing so long term hiking. Haven't been camping in years. How would test my equipment if I live in the city? I would be hiking solo across the USA, How much should I need for such an endeavor? "
1017,"Dos and Don'ts in an area signed with the shield ""Rabies! Endangered District"" in Germany","There are often town signs featuring another smaller sign reading ""Wildtollwut! Gefährdeter Bezirk"" in Germany. This directly translates into ""Rabies! Endangered district"".     How to react to such a sign? What are Dos and Don'ts in such a district?  "
1018,"What is the meaning and proper usage of the term ""irruption"" in bird behavior?","The author of a question on this site wondered if they had possibly seen a snowy owl.   A quoted source in this answer to that question used the word irruption in part of a sentence about where the owls spend the winter.    Another answer to the same question also used the word irrupt. Here is the pertinent part:     Snowy owls sometimes irrupt southward in substantial numbers (unpredictably), so it will be interesting to see if this is the beginning of a big winter for snowies.   I'm interested in the definition and usage of irruption, and what it means in the context of bird behavior and bird watching.   I understand that birds, including owls, have migration patterns. Is irruption a migratory behavior? If not, what makes it different?   Is it something that happens only with owls, or with other birds too? Can a layman tell by observing a bird if it is one that irrupts, and, if so, whether or not it's in a period of irruption?  "
1019,Is Germany or any of Europe really rabies free?,"Answers at a recent question say that Germany has been rabies free since 2008.  My first response was how could that even be possible, must be some significant border protection that keeps wild animals from crossing.  So if you look at the CDC site Rabies-Free Countries and Political Units     Dogs may be imported without a valid rabies vaccination certificate if they have lived for a minimum of 6 months, or since birth, in a country that is considered by CDC to be free of rabies in land animals, as listed below.   And goes on to identify those countries, of which Germany and it's neighbor Czech Republic are both listed. (presumably this is consistent across all of Europe, not just these two Countries)     Europe:   Albania, Andorra, Austria, Azores, Balearic Islands, Belgium, Cabrera, Channel Islands, Corsica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Finland, Formentera, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ibiza, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Majorca, Malta, Minorca, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway (except Svalbard), Portugal, San Marino, Spain (except Ceuta and Melilla), Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.   BUT if you look at the individual countries on the CDC site such as Germany or the Czech Republic it says,  Health Information for Travelers to Germany, Traveler View     Rabies is present in bats in Germany. However, it is not a major risk to most travelers. CDC recommends rabies vaccine for only these groups:      Travelers involved in outdoor and other activities in remote areas that put them at risk for bat bites (such as adventure travel and caving).      People who will be working with or around bats (such as wildlife professionals and researchers).   While most bats don't have rabies... Rabies in humans is rare in the United States. There are usually only one or two human cases per year. But the most common source of human rabies in the United States is from bats.  So it seems like these areas are Rabies free, as long as you don't go outdoors.   Is Germany or any of Europe ""really"" rabies free? "
1020,"Can a rope&bucket used to gather water from a well be kept outside, tied to this well, or does it have to be kept inside?","Is it feasible to tie the rope and bucket to the well and therefore keep it outside or do the rope and bucket have to be kept inside to protect them from harmful weather?  Or does the well, bucket and rope need to be covered by a roof to keep the bucket and rope dry and prevent rot?   I am interested in actual practice during or slightly after Medieval times. "
1021,What is the lightest arrow practical for target practice?,All things being equal a lighter arrow will travel faster when shot from a bow.  A faster arrow tends to drop less over a given distance.  Both will have similar kinetic energy over a short distance.   A longbow or a compound bow requires an arrow long enough to span the draw length.  A crossbow arrow (quarrel or bolt) is supported by the barrel of the crossbow so can made lighter just by making it shorter. Different materials and options (i.e. arrow tips) can also result in lighter weights.  What is the lightest arrow/bolt practical for target practice?    If I am not worried about penetration (killing power) is there any arrow weight that is to low? i.e. is overly susceptible to cross winds or travels so fast that it creates safety issue? 
1022,Trick from a Novel to find cardinal point,"In Treasure Of Khan by Clive Cussler, the main protagonist is lost in a desert and uses his watch to determine directions, here is the quote :      An old survival trick, he knew that south must be halfway between the   hour hand and twelve o'clock if he was standing in the Northern   Hemisphere.   I didn't quite understood it. Is this a real trick ? Is there a name for it ? How does it work ? "
1023,"What do surf report terms like ""fading WNW swell"" mean?","I'm confused about whether these headings refer to the direction of the source of the wind/swell, or the the direction they are blowing into. My understanding is that they are talking about the source.  For example, this morning's Surfline report:     Fading WNW offers up head   high-overhead surf to good exposures... Winds are steady N-NNE now, adding a bit of texture   to unsheltered breaks...   My interpretation of this is that there is a swell COMING FROM the WNW (so it's actually heading towards ESE?) and that wind is coming from N-NNE,(so the wind is actually blowing TOWARDS S-SSW?) Is my understanding correct?  Also, on the left column in Surfline, it describes the following, along with a logo of an arrow. The arrow is POINTING at the direction that the wind is blowing TOWARDS right? Whereas the text (NE 42) is specifying the direction the wind CAME from right?    Also, since the reports specify the direction of the source, can I always assume that the swell and wind is going TOWARDS the opposite direction of the source? "
1024,How important is thermal underwear for skiing?,"I am going on a Ski trip with two days in the snow. Given that I am unlikely to go skiing again for a long time, I would like to minimise the amount of gear that I purchase. The minimum temperature appears to be about -2 or -3 degrees Celcius. How important is it to have thermal underwear? Is it something vital, or can I wear something else instead? "
1025,Is backcountry hiking in northwestern Russia safe?,"Is it safe to go backcountry hiking in the Tundra's of northwestern Russia, e.g. the Kola peninsula, such as the Khibin mountains? There is some heavy industry around there; can one safely go around, camp, drink from the rivers etc. as one would do in Scandinavia or the Alps, or should this rather be avoided? What about other risks that one doesn't need to worry (much) about in western or northern Europe? "
1026,How to get started with packrafts?,"I love hiking and I'm starting to love longer cycling trips too. I've done combined cycling/hiking trips (cycling to the trailhead of a hike). Last summer I met someone who carried an inflatable raft on his bicycle, as well as hiking equipment. Ever since, I've been thinking of the unprecedented possibilities of such a combination. However, I've never done any packrafting (nor other kinds of water-navigating, though I can swim well).  How much skill and experience does it take to use a packraft (with or without a bicycle)? My intention would be to use it on lakes and sheltered fjords, not on wild streams. However, it can be windy on lakes, and the lakes in question are quite cold (usually 4°C), so it's not without danger. Is it fine to get started by simply reading info from books, websites etc. and get on the raft, or should one really start with a proper course in safety? "
1027,Is there anything that can be done to stop my insoles sliding?,"About 3/4 weeks ago I bought some Karrimor Traveller Supa Men's Walking Shoes and I've noticed that the insoles are starting to move around inside the the shoe. After a few hours of wearing them, the insoles have slipped back away from the front, leaving about an inch at the toes. So far I've just been wearing them with light cotton socks, but tied quite tight.  Is there anything I can try to stop this? Should I try to glue them back down, or is there a better way to stop this?  I'd rather not have to try and return them, the store's a bit out of my way, and I got them on sale. "
1028,Replacement tap for Coleman 5 gal. water carrier,"We have couple Coleman 5 gal. water carriers. They are nice sturdy canisters, but they have major weak spot: their taps are of poor quality and easily broken — both ours are, and seems like a lot of people having same issue.  Coleman offers replacement part (cap assembly, Part# 5010001049), But there are issues with that. First of all, if they are so shoddy, why get same thing that only going to break in few uses. Secondly — the price: replacement part itself is about [tex]5 making the total about the same as we had got the whole thing for (bought on sale). Thirdly, it is “temporarily unavailable”, and no telling when it shall become, indeed, available.  Is there other places that would have replacement available at better price? Is there aftermarket replacement that is of better quality and reasonably priced? If not a functional tap, is there some sort of standard “non-interactive” cap that could be used as replacement?  Edit. Open mouth dimensions: 1 and 7/8"" in diameter, 3/4"" out from the surface of the canister, 1/8"" thread pitch. "
1029,How to choose a class of rapids for a variety of skill levels?,"I've been whitewater rafting (and inadvertent whitewater canoeing ;) a couple times, and I'd like to get a bunch of friends together to go with me. I'd bring enough people to fill a raft (5 or 6), but the problem is, everyone will have different levels of skill and experience.  What should I consider when choosing which class of rapids we paddle? Are there any rules of thumb for how the ratio of experienced to new whitewater rafters corresponds to the rapid class we can safely manage?  For example, if three people are experienced whitewater rafters and three people have never been before, would class IV rapids be unsafe for the group as a whole?  "
1030,When do I need a permit to go into nature?,"When on holiday, I want to get as far as possible from civilisation — the furthest I've come is seeing only a single cairn during a full day. In Scandinavia, hiking and camping is permitted unless explicitly forbidden (the right to roam or allemansrätten in Swedish). In most of western Europe hiking is allowed, camping by default is not (but may be tolerated under circumstances). From browsing the web, I have the impression that it's yet different in e.g. the U.S., and that there exists such a thing as a ""wilderness permit"".  In the U.S., is there anything like the Scandinavian right to roam (e.g. the right to hike and camp anywhere away from habitation)? Am I by default allowed to go and camp where I want unless otherwise stated, or am I by default forbidden to go and camp unless otherwise stated? Where can I find a clear overview and what exactly are those permits about? Are those something to worry about in practice, or are they just a bureaucratic formality? "
1031,"What's the difference between a 2, 3, 4, and 5 season tent?","I'm looking to buy a new trekking tent, a good quality one, e.g. Hilleberg, Fjällräven, Vaude, etc. At Vaude they categorise tents in 2, 3, 4, or 5-season. What's the difference between a 4- and a 5-season tent? I know 4 seasons (although the Sami have 8 seasons) and have camped in all of them in a sub-Arctic mountain climate (northern Fennoscandinavia) with my Wechsel Rafter tent, which now starts to leak water after 6 years.  How important is the ""seasonality"" of a tent? In my understanding, a tent protects against wind and precipitation, which occur in any season; a sleeping bag protects against the cold. Then why are tents sorted by seasons? What does a 5-season tent have that a 4-season tent does not, how does this differ from a 3-season tent, etc.? And what is the 5th season? "
1032,Is it normal for a double skin popup tent to leak in slight rain?,"About a year ago I was given a three person dual skin popup tent. Almost new but possibly a factory second.  (It's made by ""Vango"" and I think it could be a ""reject"" because one of the four guy ropes is not attached to the tent and looks like it didn't get ripped off but was never attached.)  Anyway it's a great tent and I have used it on a grassy area, properly pegged, in reasonably solid rain with 3 people and luggage with minimal wetness.  But now I'm camping wild at the beach and water has made it into the tent twice, always from one of the corners.  When I first set it up on the beach instead of trying to use the pegs I weighed it down with rocks inside between the inner and outer skins. (The standard pegs are not heavy duty enough for dry sand and windy conditions and I was too lazy to use sand-filled plastic bottles instead of pegs.)  Another factor is the sand was on a bit of a slope so I dug down a bit at the back and used that sand to build up the front, thus making the area flat but the rear is a bit like a trench and also it's not a perfect fit for the tent. Some corners are a bit outside the flat part and the rocks between the skins could slide down a bit, especially when there's some rain, wind, or both.  When I added the tent pegs and guy ropes after the first storm, because they weren't very deep, I dug down a little so the pegs would hold better, put a rock on top to weigh them down, and covered them with a pile of packed sand. In some places I may have heaped a bit of sand over the lower edge of the tent wall too.   Were the rocks between the skins the cause of rain getting in at the corners? Or possibly the imperfect fit in my dug out slope? Or possibly having some sand piled on the tend walls? (not much) Or are all of these factors usually no problem thus pointing to more possible manufacturing defects? Or maybe Vango is known to be an inferior brand of tent?   Are there some general ""dos and don'ts"" for setting up a dual skin tents or popup tents or tents on sloping sand? "
1033,"Dome tents vs popup tents, are there any inherent pros or cons besides price and ease?","I was lucky enough to be given an almost new double skin popup tent.  Where I'm camping right now it's got windy a couple of times and rainy a couple of times.  A friend of mine who is camping in his (several seasons old) dome tent says he thinks they're an inherently better design than popup tents against wind.  But is this necessarily true? Is it generally considered that popup tents have a particular set of advantages and disadvantages in comparison to dome tents? ... apart from these points which I think are obvious:   Dome is cheaper than popup. Popup is quicker and easier to pitch, and arguably quicker and easier to stow (at least once you've learned how!)  "
1034,"What are some good kayak fishing areas in Friendship, Maine?","I am going to Friendship, Maine, USA, 04547, for the first week of August 2014. I am thinking about kayak fishing. Are they any good spots? What kind of fish species should I expect to find there? "
1035,Legality of parking and setting up camp on side of mountain roads in California near Los Angeles,"I plan on living out of my car for a while, and was trying to find out about the rules/legality of pulling off on the side of mountain roads to setup camp; roads like the San Gabriel Canyon Road.  On the San Gabriel I know you can pay for a parking permit to park at the top, where many tourists/hikers venture, but I'm wondering about just pulling off much earlier than that without many people around. I wouldn't be spending more than 3 or 4 nights in any given location, so as not to upset anyone.  Do I still generally need a permit? Are these rules strictly enforced? Are there other places around the LA area where this might be allowed?  I can't seem to find much information on this topic. I'm ultimately just trying to find secluded places near LA that I can legally (or not get caught) drive to and spend a couple nights. "

Kerosene Unleaded Gasoline / White Gas Alcohol ( isoprpyl, ethanol, methanol ) others? Naptha?   I am preparing to go on a bicycle trip with an MSR Universal Whisperlite, the multi fuel stove.  I had a really terrible experience with kerosene, and Coleman fuel is expensive, and bulky.  I was considering E85, since its 85% ethanol I thought that maybe it would burn cleaner. Thoughts?

1038,Differences for bivi packs,"I would like to do a winter bivouac but have no gear for it yet. Especially the choice of a bivi pack is really tough for me because I'd prefer to be able to use it also in summer as a rescue item and therefore size and weight matters a lot.   For bivi packs, what do we have to look for referring to emergency and planned situations? There are big differences for bivi packs pricewise, what are the technical distinctions?     Edit regarding the answer of @RogerB  I already checked the packs in stores, breathability is an expansive feature. Somehow this seems to be very similar to the Hardshell jackets market. You get very cheap rain- and windproof stuff but when you want breathability it gets expensive. When you additionally want a durable item, it gets high-end.   For your question: I don't have a bivi pack yet and I don't really want to buy two. So I need it as a rescue item for mountaineering/alpine tours and I am thinking of using it for planned overnight-stays. You are right though, I won't start right away to do this in winter. And I won't do this on my own. "
1039,What permits and reservations do I need for the Adirondacks?,"I'm considering to go on a multi-day backpacking hiking trip in the Adirondack Mountains, New York, USA, soon.  In Canada one must often purchase a permit and reservations, and one can only camp on specific campgrounds.  I was looking for information at the Adirondack Park Agency (APA), but their FAQ does not seem to contain any answer.  For a multi-day hike in the Adirondack Mountains, do I need permits and reservations?  Where can I camp? "
1040,How to follow an existing angle when sharpening?,"This question was prompted by the advice to ""follow the existing angles"" in this answer on sharpening ice screws. I have heard the same advice when it comes to resharpening knives. Of course, there may be considerations to not do that, but for a beginner and a suitable knife, it's a good starting point.  However, how do I do that? I can't really measure the angle, after which I could improvise a guide or at least manually control how I hold the knife/tool from time to time. And just eyeballing it seems quite imprecise.  Are there any tips and tricks or techniques to following an existing angle when sharpening?  Apparently I wasn't sufficiently clear: I have a knife that I do not know the original angle nor do I know the ideal angle. I want to follow the original angle and thus either need a sharpening technique that allows to do that or a method how to more or less measure the preexisting angle. I am not looking for ways/tools that allow to keep a specific angle while sharpening. "
1041,Is a hole in a cold place warmer?,"I'm working on a setting for a tabletop RPG game. This place is located high on the mountains and it is cold.

Would it be the same temperature as it is outside or would it be warmer? If it is warmer and given that the temperature outside can be around 35 to 44 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 7 Celcius), would it be warm enough that you wouldn't need to use warm clothes there? "
1042,"What behaviors in bees change just before, during and after a solar eclipse?","I've heard from a friend that some bees exhibit behavioral changes during a solar eclipse event. I'd like to know what the changes are.  Apparently there's a cycle that starts as the eclipse begins, enters a different phase during the eclipse and another phase as the eclipse wanes. When the whole event is over, they go back to normal behavior.   Is this true? If so, what are the actual behavioral changes at each phase? Does the species matter?   Ideally, I'm looking for information from reliable scientific sources, but trustworthy anecdotal evidence is acceptable too.   To keep the question from being too broad, I'm limiting it to North America. However, if the same behavioral changes are evident in other parts of the world, answers about those are fine with me, and I can remove the limitation.  "
1043,Why are there so many wasps attached to this air conditioner?,  I wish to get rid of these wasps. I am not sure what they are trying to do. Are these wasps creating a hive? Or is there something from the A/C they are collecting to create a hive somewhere else? 
1044,Skull soaking in hydrogen peroxide for days still brown,"  Hi there! First time poster here. 8 months ago I found a deer head in the woods. At the time it was less than 24 hours dead. So I put it in a tub and buried it in the woods. Dug it back up a few days ago. The tub had filled with water at some point and the skull was clean (ish) but stained brown. So I threw it on my back porch in a container of dish soap and h2o2. But the color is still the same. I’ve been replaced the peroxide occasionally and trying to clean off some bits of remaining flesh. I’m considering putting it in a stock pot and simmering it with the peroxide to really whiten it. Downside is that I have no access to an outdoor heating element so doing it inside could get gross fast. Any advice? Also picked up a doe skull yesterday on a hike. It also still has flesh attached to it. Should it get simmered?   Note: I live in an apartment. So I can’t hang up skulls outside, use a hose, or heat them outside as I have no outdoor property outside my porch. "
1045,Can I eat the rabbits my cat catches?,My cat gets a rabbit every other week or so. He usually eats the whole thing himself but I was wondering if I should try and cook it for myself. Is there even enough meat on them to make it worth the effort? If I had to guess they probably weigh about 1lbs (cat weighs 15lbs). Would it be legal in the state of Washington?   
1046,Why are stove jacks NOT normally made of metal?,"   A stove jack allows you to safely extend a stovepipe through the roof or   wall of your tent. Our stove jacks are constructed of fire proof   17-ounce [0.48 kg] silicone-coated glass material (18"" x 18"" [46 cm × 46 cm]) with a solid   silicone ring. Stove jacks are temperature rated up to 700°F (400°C).       More photos here.       Question: Why are stove jacks NOT normally made of metal?  A. Metal would be difficult to transport.  B. Metal would conduct heat to the flammable tent fabric.  C. Something else.    Source "

1048,How much food is needed for three months of food when rowing across an ocean?,"Related to this question, if one were to go on a three-month rowing trip across an ocean, is there an estimate of how much the food would be needed?  It's certainly possible to give an estimate when backpacking, but rowing would be different and while I am sure that it would depend on the person, it should still be possible to get an idea.  What is an estimate of how much three months of food for a single person rowing across an ocean would be needed? "
1049,"What is this just-hatched black caterpillar with white and black hairs, found in India?","Can anyone tell me which caterpillar this is? Its body looks black and it has  hairs that are white and black, with a little bit of brown.   It was on a utensil which was kept in a dark place. I watched it come out from the cocoon on the left after my mother poured water on it, then it tried to climb the walls of the utensil.    I live in Punjab in the northern part of India, which is in Asia.  It was about 5cm long but i couldn't measure the actual length. Now it is gone.  But i will try to find another one of these around my home. If i can i will put a picture of it on this site.    And it came out of cocoon so is it even a caterpillar? I think caterpillars make cocoons to become moths and butterflies. "
1050,What diseases can be transmitted through skin contact with a dead rabbit?,"About a month ago, my youngest son found a dead rabbit in the woods while camping and brought me to the spot to show it. The rabbit looked like it had just died and didn't show any obvious cause of death.  Even though denying it, I made him wash his hands since I suspected he might have touched it (despite me having told him to never touch dead animals found in the woods).  He later admitted having petted it briefly.  Are there any diseases that could have been transmitted through the brief fur to skin contact? Any ones that I still need to worry about?  This is in The Netherlands, more specifically in the province of Zeeland. "
1051,"What are these round, spiny, puffy, green things from the ocean in Northeast United States?","Last October, we were on a road above a beach in a small town near Bar Harbor, Maine, in the Northeast United States. We looked down and saw two fishermen loading their trucks with piles of something fascinating they had just brought in from the ocean with large nets.   I'm trying to learn what they are, and for what purpose they're used.   They're round, probably 5 inches in diameter, spiky, and mostly green with a bit of brown. The fisherman was inspecting one closely in his hands, and we were able to get a good picture of that. I didn't get a close-up of the other side, but some in the pile look more puffy, so maybe those were upside-down, or right-side up, depending on what it actually is!  At first I thought they were totally covered in those spikes. However, if you click to enlarge the picture and look closely in the middle, there's something that almost looks like it could be a mouth or other opening.  My guess is they either end up in salt water aquariums, or at a type of restaurant where I've never been.   I know all seaweeds are alive, so I assume they're alive at the time of harvesting, although I don't know for how much longer, especially in a big pile on a hot day. Are they some type of sea plant, or animal in the sense that we generally think of animals? If it's the latter, and they're bound for a restaurant, what and where are the individual body parts? What parts are edible? How are they served?  If they are indeed edible, and someone has actually tasted or cooked with one, and has something more familiar to compare it with, I'd love to know that.     "
1052,Using Gri Gri 2's Carabiner with Another Belay Device?,"I've been using an AustriAlpin autolock carabiner with my Gri Gri 2 for around 9 months, a few times a week (1 to 3 times). It's a very solid, robust and big carabiner, which means that's not too smooth in Gri Gri's hole, but IMHO, it's way far from being retired. I had been told that if a carabiner is used with a Gri Gri, it should never ever be used with any other device. I do understand the concerns, but I've been googling this, and checking Petzl's site as well, but I don't see any evidence on that.  Now my issue is that I have just bought a Mammut Smart Alpine and a Grivel auto-locking carabiner. I love this Grivel, and I like the Mammut Smart as well, because it's smoother for lead belaying, yet has some assisted braking in it. However, there are two issues with this set:    Grivel biner [despite being labeled as red] is pinkish purple with a gold gate, where Mammut Smart is gray and red. The color isn't matching and I'm a bit annoyed at this! It's somewhat curved on the wide end which means that Smart can't fully sit in it. I haven't tried them yet, but I feel like the Austriaplin biner fits Smart better, and then I won't have the color mismatching problem!! (though the set will be heavy again (I don't mind it for indoor use, but I still do like to use this Grivel!)).   Any clues on this? Shall any biner used with a special belay device, marry it and stay with it forever?             "
1053,A method to retrieve a carabiner,"I saw this a few times, years ago  I met some guys who were top roping next to us in Jackson Falls, IL 25 years ago who showed us a method of retrieving your top carabiner(s) when you were done top roping.  They attached the rope to the 'biner in a strange way AND I seem to remember some para-cord being used to pull on and the 'biner would just 'unsnap' from the anchor and come down, on the rope maybe?  Does someone recognize what I'm describing?  I also recall the method as being a bit unsafe and never used it, therefore my imprecise description of the practice. "
1054,Using Gri Gri 2 as a Self Belaying Device,"The other day I was so desperate to go climbing, but I couldn't find a partner, so I ended up self belaying after googling and watching this video. I did check Petzl's site to learn that modifying Gri Gri and self belaying using it is prohibited.   I'm not a crazy, careless climber and when it comes to safety, I try to be as cautious as possible. I searched and read several threads on the topic, but yet, I'm not convinced why this isn't allowed.   Now a bit more detail on what I did: similar to the video, I tied myself in, and then attached the other end with Gri Gri to the belay loop. I only climbed a few really easy routs, so that I could be certain I can hold myself up while taking the slack, and did make knots in several points as I ascended.   I understand that Gri Gri is not an automatic device, but I have also never seen it failing (at least with the 9.8mm&lt; ropes), and I also try a few small falls and they were fine, too.   I wouldn't make this a habit to practice all the time, but I'm wondering what the issue is with it, with the added knots on the way up? If it fails (no!), the knot will stop it, right?  P. S. I would not dare to do this outdoors, but only indoors on easier route on that I badly want to climb and there's no one around! "
1055,Why would fatigue cause fever?,"I've already experienced this twice.  The first time was a year ago, on a hiking camp: on the first day I recklessly went out with one of the best groups there, and while I didn't lag behind, this was very exhausting. On the second day I had to stay in guesthouse due to moderate fever and vomiting. On the third and subsequent days, however, I was fine and could resume hiking, however I was choosing less advanced groups.  The second time was yesterday. I went out by foot to visit two neighboring towns, after spending a year with hardly any physical activity. This took nine hours of walking, still I succeeded. In the evening I again had moderate fever.  Why does this happen? Do other people also experience this, or is such a body reaction specific to me? "
1056,"Hiking uphill, two choices of trails: how to deal with each one?","There are two trails leading to a beautiful spot in a nearby park. One of them has a steady climb all the way (trail A) while the other has some sharp climbs followed by relative level segments (trail B). Start an end points are the same. Sunlight and wind exposure are also the same.  The distance on the map for both is around 2mi and differ by only a few yards (A is longer). I've walked both several times and to me it seems that I always end the hike more tired after going through trail A.  So, a few questions:   Is it common for the steady climb trail to be more tiresome than the sharp climb with level segments one? How should I deal with each type of trail in order to lessen the exaustion? What techniques can I use?  "
1057,How much flotation does a canoe need?,"Yesterday for the first time I turned my canoe over, then I tried to get back in it.  I have been thinking about adding a sail to my canoe and now that I know a bit about sailing, I know I need to plan on being able to right the sailing canoe and get back in it.  So I took the canoe to the lake to practice self recovery (solo) with just an empty canoe.  I have a 17 foot two person plastic canoe as seen in my answers to this question it has built in flotation at both ends. With the canoe empty, just me in a life jacket and a wood paddle.  It turns out will float the canoe just barely if the canoe is full of water it floats until I get in. The flotation will not support me and the canoe, I was sitting in the canoe floating by my life jacket with the canoe 2 feet under the surface.  When I get out  it surfaces with the sides just breaking the surface.    There is a cool video of a guy doing solo recovery at Solway Dory, but he is in a smaller lighter canoe, I think he is wearing a dry suit, and he has added side flotation. I watched that video before going to the lake to try it myself.  Real life me and my canoe (big &amp; heavy). I can't throw it and have it land empty! (no surprise) Best I can do is turn it over slowly which results in it being half full of water when right side up.  I was not able to get back in without filling it the rest of the way with water.   Later I took the canoe to shore emptied it and a couple of attempts to get back in the canoe when it did not have water in it.  By this point I was tired, and could not make it happen.  I know it is possible, but it is difficult, if I could not do it in warm water while a bit tired, I don't want to bet my life on it in other scenarios. In sailing class I was easy able to get in a Sunfish without difficult, but that is a very different boat.   When people take canoes white water rafting they add A LOT of flotation (image below), essentially the canoe is all flotation except room for one person.  At that point you might as well get a kayak, what is the point of the canoe? All it holds is you and flotation.   So I want to add some flotation, at least enough so that I can get in over the side as long as I have enough strength to turn it back over.  Optimally enough so if I am caring my normal load or if I have a sail I can get it upright and get in. I don't want to fill it with float bags.  The point of a canoe is that you can put a lot in it.  How do I decide out how much flotation I need, and where it needs to be?    "
1058,How can one assess the fit of a shotgun?,"How can I determine whether a shotgun fits (or can be easily adapted to fit) me without having the chance to test fire it?  (And without spending thousands of dollars for customization?)  Whether for shooting clays or birds we know that ""fit"" of a shotgun to a shooter can be critical to the shooter's ability to hit what he points at.  When I take people clay shooting I bring several different guns.  Even with first-time shooters, I can see that if they're missing wildly with one gun, simply handing them another with a stock of different proportions can allow them to start making consistent hits.  Can this sort of general shotgun fitment be done without access to a range?  If so, how? "
1059,Is ankle support a myth?,"There seems to be an ongoing holy war with ""boots people"" vs ""shoes people"". A comment on this question caught my eye:     ...Ankle support is a myth for most folks....   Now I've always worn boots and I beleieve that ankle support helps a lot, especially when I'm tired. When I do wear shoes (approch shoes etc) I get sore ankles. So for me boots work. But I've seen many opinions stating the opposite.  Opinons aren't much use though...   Has there been any studies on this? what were the results?     Parameters of the question  I'm only really interested in the use of boots in a hiking setting. Not climbing, technical terrain, etc. So imagine walking a moderate mountain trail with a moderate pack in summer. Which would be best.  I don't want this to turn into a I prefer question. So please do not state your personal opinion in an answer. I really only want quotes from good studies on the subject "
1060,"Is rope-soloing inherently dangerous, and if so, why?","I've never tried rope-soloing and don't have a very detailed idea of how it's done. But reading the 2015 edition of Accidents in North American Mountaineering, I was struck by how many accidents happened to people who were rope-soloing. My impression is that only a very small percentage of climbing is done using this technique, so the number of accidents would be disproportionate, suggesting that it's either an inherently dangerous activity or maybe one that a lot of people do incorrectly. On the other hand, it seems like a technique that could be useful for self-rescue, for example if your partner gets hurt.  Why does rope-soloing seem to be so dangerous?  Related:   Technique for lead solo climbing with rope   Most common avoidable reasons for climbing accidents? "

1062,"Leaving a fire unattended for a few hours, then returning","What is the best way to leave a fire unattended for a short time and then to return to use it again?   Here is my imagined scenario: arrive at a camp site and start a fire in a pre-made iron fire pit. Cook and eat dinner over the fire. Then, leave the fire unattended and go hiking for a few hours. Then return and cook dessert over the fire. There will be tents in the vicinity.   Should I put it all the way out and then restart it from scratch, or is there a more effective, but still safe, way to leave the fire unattended?  Edit after @ShemSeger's answer:  Of course I do not want to leave ANY chance of a fire spreading, so maybe a better way to phrase my line of thinking is: what is the best way to completely put out a fire that I will be returning to? I imagine that soaking all the wood in 6 inches of water will make it difficult to restart. Is burying the best way to go? "
1063,When will a rattlesnake strike?,"There are a few questions about how to avoid rattlers, and what to do if you're bit, but at what point does a rattler actually strike?   I had my first rattler encounter ever yesterday, just out in the coulees down by the river, right on the walking path. I was pushing my little girl on her bike and all of a sudden the grass 2ft to my left started rattling, the instant I glanced down and caught a glimpse of the coiled snake hiding in the grass, I quickened my pace and got past it, but had it decided to strike instead of rattle, my little girl could be dead right now (most scared I've ever been with an animal encounter, and I wasn't at all worried about myself).  This was the snake in question (see the  video the taken with my camera phone).  If you encounter a rattler, how should you act, what should you do and what shouldn't you do? Do you freeze and back away slowly? Do you turn and GTFO? Do you dive for cover? When a rattlesnake gets his rattle on, what exactly is the desired reaction it's expecting from you, and what other indicators does it give you that a strike is imminent?  "
1064,Where can I find additional resources about Wildlands Provincial parks in Alberta?,"I'm planning an overnight hiking trip in Alberta, it will involve one night of camping. I know that in Alberta you are allowed to ""random camp"" in Wildland Provincial parks, so I'll be heading to one of those.  The problem is that besides the difficult to read overview maps provided in the previous link I can't seem to find any other info about these parks.   Specifically I was looking for a province map that shows all these parks, and parking lots that are available so I can plan my trip accordingly. Is there any info available, provided by others who have done hiking and random camping in the province? "
1065,Surviving a forest fire while backpacking,"A friend of mine recently was forced to cancel a backpacking trip because Waterton Lakes National Park (Canada side of Glacier National Park in Montana) canceled his backcountry permit due to a forest fire flare up on the USA side of the border. I was in the park that day, the fire ignited and spread pretty quick, but was easily kept under control due to it's proximity to Upper Waterton Lake (and with the added help of a couple of Canadian helicopters).  What if you were already out in the backcountry when a fire started? Say you woke up one morning (or in the middle of the night) and you smelt smoke, then when you step out of your tent you can't see anything but a thick haze of ash all around you from a new fire which had very recently flared up near by and you're a day's hike from the trail head. What do you do? "

1067,Attaching a mosquito net to a tent,"Some time ago I bought a Quechua T4.2 Dome tent. Lately, when I was on camping holiday with my cousin I saw quite clever solution on their borrowed Quechua 4.2 Xl Air. In such tent, there's always a space between tent's wall and ground to provide ventilation. However, their tent was equipped with mosquito nets all around on the bottom, what provided quite good protection at least against flying bugs.  I was wondering, if it is possible to attach such mosquito nets to mine - for instance, by sewing them to the bottom parts of the tent. I guess, that the biggest risk is that sewing holes might cause tent's walls to start ripping, because it's constantly under tension.  Is it generally a good idea? Or maybe there is a different solution, which will be better in this case? Or should I simply buy another tent? :) "

1069,At what point is a rattlesnake mature enough to control its venom?,"Young rattlesnakes are more deadly than large rattlesnakes, the reason being because when they are young they are more likely to strike, but more importantly because they can't yet control their venom. As a result, when they bite, they inject all their venom instead of just a controlled amount.   At what point is a snake mature enough to control its venom? I know that rattlesnakes can't rattle until they've shed their skin a couple times, so does that mean if it can rattle then the snake is less deadly?   "
1070,Transporting Large Amounts of Fish,"I'll be going on an multi-day deep sea fishing trip where we are expected to catch between 150lb to 400lb of fish each (Yellow Fin, Ably, Dorado). I'll have a 3 day drive back home across the Midwest. Last time I looked into this about 15 years ago, it seemed like it was easy to buy/find large styrofoam ice chests (like 3 ft long.) Now it seems these are nowhere to be found.  What are people doing to transport fresh or flash frozen fish or any meat really on a plane / vehicle / boat where maybe dry ice is involved? Am I stuck with buying Igloo coolers at $50 each? Or are these foam ones I used to pay a few dollars a piece for still available and I'm just not looking in the correct place? "
1071,How do permits for US/Canada public land work?,"I recently read an article stating that to access Banff National Park, you need several permits: A park permit, a backcountry permit and, if you want to, a fire permit.  I also read about these permits frequently on TGO, for example here and here.  For me, this system is completely new, since everywhere I visited so far things either had been allowed without permit or forbidden (maybe apart from fishing, but I never did that). In my understanding, a permit is something you apply for, and which can be declined.  How can I understand the concepts of these permits? Are they more like a fee or can the permit be declined? Do I get a piece of paper I need to carry around?  I understand some of the answers may vary for different types of public land, for the US and Canada or even for different national parks. I try to understand the general concept. Also, I know this question is very close to the first linked question, When do I need a permit to go into nature?, but I want to know how this system works/looks like from a practical point of view rather than when I have to care about it.

1073,Affordable Festival Tent,"I'm off to a Festival in late august and am looking for a cheap festival tent. I'm not exactly asking you guys what I should buy, more about the considerations I should take into account.  Some details:   Preferably under £50 and obtainable in the UK (ideally online) I'll throw it away after one use Preferably lightweight and extremely easy to set up. I would literally like to throw it on the floor and it pops up. Size doesn't matter, as long as it can fit myself in comfortably (5'9) I don't particularly care for comfort, but I don't want to get wet, the tent to break, etc.   What do I need to look for in a tent? Where are the best sites? Amazon? Any tents that are known for being awesome for festivals? "
1074,"In an abandoned quarry, is it possible to pry loose rocks from walls until stable?","I have an abandoned quarry near my house, in which I would like to make a hiking route.  Almost all of it is enjoyable hiking and easy scrambling, except one part, which requires climbing (estimated French grade - 4) up about 5 metres, on a wall with mostly unstable holds. So I wonder whether it would be possible to remove (with bare hands or tools like crowbar) all the unstable rocks, and leave a rock face that would be safe to climb.  The rock at the quarry is limestone with varying quality. We have a climbing wall with bolted routes not far from there (I mention that to make it clear that the rock itself is climbable).  So, is such ""cleaning"" possible? Does the answer depend on whether explosives were used in the quarry?  (BTW I am not interested right now whether this is legal)  For reference, here is a picture:  "

1076,"Week long trek, how far each day? pace?","Background info: For environment, it is southwestern British Columbia and the weather is fair and there is plenty of water around.  Pace wise, on level terrain, with or without water I have sometimes been able to travel 20-30km (~15mi) with no break but feel quite sore and dead in the end beyond my lingering endurance. Going on 10-15km with breaks seems to be nice, and recoverable.  How should I go about my first week long trip in terms of distance, each day?  My draft plan:   Wake up and do my morning routine Hike from 7-noon (5hrs = ~20km with my ~40lb (18 kg) pack big pack) Take an hour or two break for a main meal Hike until 5pm or so (~4 hours = ~10-15km) Set up camp, small nightly meal for energy and soak in the sunset.   The journey is roughly 150km in a valley route by the way, which if I do that routine each day without falter can be done in ~4 1/2 days, but I plan to give myself lenience and visit small towns/and interesting things along the way giving 7 a good margin.  How's my routine sound? should something like every second day be half the distance, to help preserve my legs from lugging 40lbs (18 kg) or as felt is needed? (I tend to overdo it.) Any tips or hints on sustaining long distance travels for journeys many weeks long if I were to above this relatively simple starting trek, that I can practise? "
1077,How can I test out my equipment before a backpacking trip?,"I'm in the slow process of acquiring all of the gear I think I will need to do a week-long backpacking trip somewhere in the Midwest. Many of the more experienced backpackers I've spoken with or read about say that you should test your gear out before you take it on the trail.  I want to test out my setup without breaking it, and hopefully without taking up too much of my time. What do you recommend as a thorough yet reasonable test for a backpacking setup?   I want to develop a backpacking and camping routine with my portable gear but don't have much experience with anything other than car camping. What are your tips and tricks for backpacking success?  EDIT: The gear I have that I would like to test out includes (but is not limited to) the following: Gregory Baltoro Backpack, sleeping bag, tent, stove, water filter, first aid kit, knife, machete (possibly not included), water bottles, and a cheap, bulky sleeping bag pad.  I suppose I probably need to assemble a mess kit, acquire cooking supplies, and select clothing before I'll be able to do a full test run. "
1078,"A winter month in New England - what to do, looking for thru-hikes or other suggestions","I hiked the AT this summer and the PCT three years ago, and it's looking like I may have the chance to return to New England for about a month sometime in Dec/Jan.  Does anyone have any recommendations for how best to spend this time in the great outdoors? I love thru-hiking, backpacking, skiing, snowboarding, and I have a lot of winter mountaineering experience and winter gear, so I'm looking for some suggestions really.  I'll be flying from UK into Connecticut and then I can drive from there to anywhere nearby, probably north since the AT took me that way and I really liked it - Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine.  How realistic is thru-hiking in that part of the world in Dec/Jan, in terms of weather, snow, etc? I was considering the Long Trail but wondered if that might be too ambitious in winter.  Oh, and I'll probably be solo - my friends are too fond of their sofas!   So, in order of preference:   Thru-hiking/backpacking an established trail for multiple weeks, do-able in winter Multi-day cross-country ski routes Downhill skiing/snowboarding at a resort likely to have good snow at that time of year Anything else you think might be fun  "
1079,Has a person ever got rabies from a marine mammal?,"I just saw this 2009 article Can a Whale Get Rabies? which includes this statement,     Although there is absolutely no record of a rabid whale, and only one documented case of rabies in a seal—a ringed seal caught in 1980 in Svalbard, an archipelago off Norway—the scenario may soon be of greater concern. ""Starting 10 years ago, coyotes began to prey on harp seals here on Cape Cod,"" Moore says. ""Because of that, I like for my staff to get vaccinated. There's a very small chance that a seal will have rabies.""   It would seem that there is a vector for rabies to cross oceans and potentially infect land mammals, slight but plausible...  It has been nearly 10 years since the article.    Is there any documentation of a person getting rabies from a marine mammal?  "
1080,Use normal urban jacket for skiing/snowboard,"I am new to snowboard. I am not yet prepared to spend a lot of money on it. I know a special jacket for skiing is better but won't it suffice to just use normal urban jacket for skiing in the beginning?   Is a normal cheap non-specialized jacket that bad for this activity?  I'm going to a ski resort at about 1,600 meters.  Last time I was there, it was unnaturally warm in Winter with about -1C temp. But I can't predict weather next time.  To answer one of the comments, I was going to go for a snowboard rather than ski, but itsn't there no difference? I have never heard of jackets made for ski or snowboard specifically. "
1081,Hiking with boots untied?,"I recently came across a hiking boot maker with a front page photo showing someone walking off trail in ankle high boots that are untied.    Source  This seems to be a current fashion trend, and if you google untied boots look you get several hits showing and describing how to get the 'look'  Shopping in the mall, with untied boots is one thing. But I wonder if there are negative impacts from trail (or off trail) hiking with untied boots.    We have the existing Q&amp;A Is ankle support a myth? that goes into detail about ankle support, presumably all the linked studies had people wearing properly laced foot wear. I am not asking about ankle support in this question.  We also have a Q&amp;A about When is it OK to hike off trail? which is not the subject of this question.

1083,How should I walk or hike barefoot?,"I've been some months reading as much as possible about walking biomechanics, and unfortunately I haven't found too much information or usually contradictory information. Usually everything is focused on running biomechanics.  This is the information I've gathered from different resources:   Head should look forward, ear over the shoulders, even though in some resources they say you should lean forward a little bit to let gravity move you forward. There should be counter rotation movement from the arms, but it should come from the upper thoracic cage, not from the shoulders or arms. Some resources say the arms should move at all. The abs should be slightly activated keeping the lower back still, always in the same position.  The motion should be initiated with the gluts, which should push forward. Each side of the hips moves to allow a bigger stride while the gluts are holding the weight.      The knees should land with the knee straightened but not locked. Some resources say you should land with them bent. It's not important how you land with your feet, you should let that the foot adapts to the terrain.  The external side of the foot should should be parallel to the other side, making the toes point forward. But some resources say it's ok to have them pointing outward.    Some things I've realized by walking barefoot from 2min to 2h a day during one month after a metatarsal fracture:   I think that the heel should stay longer in the floor than what I used to do. Having a shortened calf doesn't allow the whole range of motion of the leg to have a stride long enough, that makes me put too much weight in the ball of the feet too soon. I think, as opposed to running, we should keep always some weight in each foot, and before rolling into the forefoot is important to already have some weight in the other foot. I don't know and can't find what's the utility of the 4 little toes. I used to have some kind of metatarsalgia between the second and third metarsal and I realized that I was  griping the floor a lot while walking causing hammer or claw toes. After a while trying to relax them and training myself to stay on one leg without using the toes that pain stopped. I don't know if I was using them to get stability in the foot instead of using other muscles in the foot or leg. I'm aware of the big toe windlass mechanism, but I'm not sure it is also applied to walking.  Should we extend (dorsiflex) the toes before landing? How much width should there be between our stride, I've seen in some website that we should walk with our bigtoes touching the same lines, but in some other running resources I've seen that there should be a bigger gap, between 10 to 20cm.     What do you think about this points? Which one are ""correct"" and which one are ""wrong""?. Any other important aspect? I know this depends a lot on how the terrain is and a lot of things, but let's say I would like to know about the biomechanics walking in a flat hard surfaces with some backpack (under 10% body-weight) and the priority is to walk a long distance minimizing the risk of injury, and I don't want to rely on any kind of shoes as shock absorber. "
1084,"Are there any natural materials that can work for a ""fire roll"" friction fire?","I have seen a few videos of people using an interesting friction-fire technique, and a couple of them called it a ""fire roll."" To do this, they fluffed up a cotton ball, put something in it such as ashes, rolled it up in their hands into a worm-like strand, then they very vigorously rolled it back and forth between two wood boards. It did not take long at all, looked fairly easy, and they got a fire started.   While this is cool, it was done with household items (2x4, cotton balls). Is it possible to transfer this technique to wild foraged resources? Obviously, use split wood that you collect instead of 2x4s, and use the smoothest wood you can split so it doesn't catch. But what about a cotton ball substitute? And the ashes that were put into the cotton ball to provide increased friction?   Yes, ashes we can grab from a previous fire if we have had one, but it would be nice if we can find a substitute for that too in case you have not had a previous fire.  Are there any natural resources that can be foraged that can be used in a ""fire roll"" friction-fire technique?  The cotton ball replacement is the most important part of this question. And yes, I know that cotton comes from a plant, but I am not sure if this will work with raw cotton, and cotton does not grow in the north. Also, it would be preferable, though not necessary, if we could get an affirmative answer that lists a general way to process many plants to do this. "
1085,Tent floor waterproof rating,"I'm currently looking to buy a new tent.

Is there any guidance that says, ""For every x thousand metres your exposure is doubled"" or your sun factor should be increased by y? "
1089,Is a Tanto or Utility knife best to carry when mountaineering?,"I have been mountaineering for about four years now and one of the things I have learned is how important a good knife really is.  A knife that is sharp, durable, and can take a beating can make a world of difference when you're outside for weeks at a time.  Recently I have been looking to purchase a new knife, and I am going to go ""all out"" this time and get a FOX Carbon Titan (Tanto/Utility) fixed blade.  Now that I have a knife in mind I'm not sure if I should get the tanto or utility style.    Currently I own a mid-range 3.25' folding knife that has a utility blade and I am very happy with it.  From my research I have found that tanto blades are better for piercing things, and are good for combat because of that.    My real questions is: for mountaineering which is mostly kitchen work, cutting rope, plants, other small objects, and in a survival situation killing and skinning an animal would a Tanto or Utility knife be a better option?    Of course the name ""Utility"" hints that it would be a better option, but is that really true?  Right now I really want a tanto blade because they look so cool, but if it really isn't a good option then I will go with the utility blade. "

1091,How to inspect climbing bolts?,"I am most interested in setting up a top rope anchor on 2 bolts side by side. I feel like in this case you almost have to be more careful using bolts for a top rope than sport climbing because in sport climbing you are clipping a bunch of bolts all the way to the top, so if one fails, there is another one in different rock that will probably save you to-where-as if one of two bolts for a top rope are in bad rock, both bolts are probably in bad rock. Specifically I am asking:  How to inspect a climbing bolt?  Are there any non-obvious things to look for when inspecting a climbing bolt?   If a bolt is placed very close to the edge of a corner of rock, what proximity is considered safe? I am thinking of some climbs where the bolts are literally only a foot from the top of the cliff - could the combination of the bolts shear off a piece of the rock?  Also, do bolts ever fail catastrophically? I.e. just blow out of rock, or do they tend to fail over time so you can see it coming and avoid those bolts? "

1093,How to estimate distance in sea,"While kayaking or swimming out in the open waters, it is quite important to be able to judge distances accurately before attempting to get from one point to another, such as from island to island. Without a map, a GPS and a good geographical knowledge of the area, it can be quite a daunting aspect.   With no landmarks in between to serve as a gauge, is there a method to judge distances with a fair degree of accuracy, for example from one spot to a desolated island in a distance?

1094,Walk-away fishing,"From a beginning fisher:  Can I, say, float a raft out into the middle of a lake, with several fishing lines/hooks/bait hanging into the lake, with the whole thing tethered to the shore by a long rope, and hope to catch some fish?  In other words, can I put some baited hooks in the middle of the lake and walk away for a few hours and then pull the raft back with some caught fish, or will they have gotten away during that time?  Or is it necessary to cast line out from a pole with reel and start reeling in as soon as a fish starts tugging the line? "
1095,Bleaching Dyneema/Spectra,"My white full Dyneema backpack is old and dirty and stained.  How do I clean it?  Can I wash it in chlorine bleach or some other fabric bleaching chemical? If so, how? Even if the bleaching agent does not damage the fabric, is there a chance it could damaged seams and stitching? "
1096,"How big a fall is a ""major"" fall?","I answered a question about rope safety with some advice about retiring the rope after a ""major"" fall. Another user asked me what would constitute a major fall - and I have to admit that I can only give a gut feeling about this, not any properly referenced answer.  Personally, I'd be wary of a rope that took a significant fall of more than several metres, and a number of shorter drops - but is there some more definitive answer? Perhaps manufacturers advise on how much strain their ropes could take before retirement? "
1097,"What are ""Aggressive"" climbing Shoes?","This question was borrowed from a comment on this question. But what is meant by an ""aggressive"" climbing shoe? What is the difference in a non-aggressive shoe? And when would you use one over the other? Please use pics, I am a visual person. "
1098,"I am lost, I found a trail, which way do I go?","If I am lost in the woods, and I find a trail or a road, how do I decide which way to go?   Autumn Veatch was 16 years old in 2015, when her grandparents small plane crashed in the North Cascade Mountains.  It was two days of hiking before she found a trail.     Just ahead, spanning the small river is a mystical-looking bridge made of logs. To either side of it, heading in opposite directions, is a well defined, trampled down trail. Getting Out Alive: The Autumn Veatch Story   Finding a trail or a road, is only the next step in a journey to survive, how do you decide which way to go?  "
1099,What to do if woke up in a tent hearing a bear/boar or something else close by?,"What should I do if I am in a tent, have been sleeping, and was woken up by the sounds of some large animal quite close to the tent? Just hearing some branches broken by presumably something large.  At this point I don't know what animal it is, but presumably it can be either a brown bear or a wild boar. Maybe a wolf. Not sure if its possible to differentiate between them without seeing it, just by the sounds of walking, broken branches.  I also don't know exactly how close is the animal to the tent, and if its thinking about charging the tent or not.  The main question is: do I stay in the tent, or go out to investigate / pepper spray, try to scare the animal off? If staying in the tent is preferred, keep quiet, or make noise?   Obviously if I am to go out, I would make noise, but if I stay, should I keep quiet, hoping to make the animal think that the tent is just an uninteresting, inanimate object? I have no food in the tent and changed my outer clothing after cooking, so I have no reason to believe the animal will find my smell interesting. Unless un-brushed teeth after eating meat some hours earlier may be a problem (no meat residue in the teeth).  Assuming the only things I have are: pepper spray (260 gram / 9 oz can, Sabre or UDAP) and a flashlight. No guns or anything like that.  The territory I am asking about is Europe, where there are brown bear only (no black bears), but they are not Grizzly, just European brown bears. This is for example about Scandinavia or Carpathian Mountains.  This is NOT about Russia and super-hungry bears in Siberia, this is a territory with relatively available sources of food, like fruits on trees around, so the animal would not be so desperate for food to seek humans as prey. "
1100,What is the longest dead end road on US public land?,"In this answer at; I am lost, I found a trail, which way do I go? It claims      ...logging roads These may extend many miles into the forest, with multiple branches, all ending in dead ends. There can be 10's or 100s of miles (or kilometers) of roads.    If I am hiking on public land in the US, and find a road, just how far might I walk in the wrong direction, before getting to the dead end and needing to turn around and go back?   Without considering all the dead end branch roads, how long is the longest dead end road on or crossing, US public land?  Clarify: Where dead end = ends in the forest without any services or civilization, at the end or along the route.  "
1101,"How do you take field notes at below 0 °C, without freezing fingers?","I'm taking inventory on my tree farm. The temperature today is -7 °C with a light breeze. Windchill of -10&nbsp;°C.  I figure that there are lots of people who have this problem. Writing a journal, describing observations, and so on.  How do people who work in the outdoors take field notes, or write things down?  Additional information.  The problem is NOT the writing implement -- at least so far.  The problem is fingers being too cold to function.  Here's what I've done so far:  Approach:  Partial protection for writing hand. I've found I can wear a fleece mitt liner and still write.  Issues   Fingers still get cold, but I have about 15 minutes per session between times I have to thaw out fingers. This is the current solution. It's between 1/3 and 1/2 the normal speed of taking inventory, plus more frequent breaks and job shifts.   Approach:  Clipboard and pencil  Issues:   While I can wear a mitt on the clipboard hand, bare fingers quickly go numb writing.   Approach: Used my iPhone with dictation enabled.  Issues:   Only will record 30 seconds at a time, then you have to touch the mic button again. Transcription is ragged: Count becomes account, 4 becomes for 2 becomes 2. But not consistently. The phone shuts down when the battery gets cold. (About 20 minutes at -7&nbsp;°C)   Approach: Just make an audio recording.  Issues:   Hard to review. Phone still has cold problem.   Approach Keep moving to stay warm.  Issues:   I do this. But it's more of changing jobs to warm up. Go mulch trees with gloves on while fingers thaw, scout for firewood, play with the dog, and go for coffee. The plot is about 8 acres (3 hectares) — 400 feet (120&nbsp;m) wide by 800 feet  (240&nbsp;m) long. I have 20,000 trees in that space more or less, ranging in size from 3 inches (8&nbsp;cm) to 15 feet (5&nbsp;m). Counting is a lot of 'museum pace' strolling, combined with standing. (The step counter on my phone says I do between 8,000 and 15000 steps a day. Inventory days are on the low end of this.)   Approach  Write the message out in snow, then take a picture. (added in response to one answer)  Issues:   Cold temperatures don't always occur with snow cover. Snow cover is cluttered with tractor, sled, deer, and dog tracks. On an overcast day, contrast between letters and snow is limited. Amount of text for each block is a bit much for a medium such as snow. Go outside and write with your gloved hand:  HGE17 AshMtnCard 216  7'-9'  T15 80%   That's my abbreviation for Block Haida Gwai East, lot 17, Cardinal columnar mountain ash, count of trees present, height range of 7 to 9 feet (2 to 2.5&nbsp;m), pot size of nursery trade 15 gallon (60&nbsp;l), and fraction salable. The information is dense. You will note in the pix below that even a day after the snow, it's not a blank canvas.  Approach: Take a series of photographs, then work at the house with the pictures.  Issues:   Counting is difficult. Height estimate is difficult. Species identification in a broad picture is difficult between some pairs.  E.g. white spruce and balsam fir, high bush cranberry, and amur maple. If taking multiple pictures of a row, identifying the overlap point is tricky.   This is a popular question, and there are good answers here for people with various similar problems.  Normally inventory takes about three afternoon sessions of 3-4 hours. During that time I move a few feet between blocks for a block estimate, or walk the length of a block once for each species for a mixed block, or walk a block twice stopping at each tree for a tallied block.  Here are samples of what I'm inventorying.    I grow in mixed blocks. This decreases pest problems, and often allows pots to be spaced closer. This block is a mix of spruce, larch, birch at this point.    Further up the block, both birch and fir are still present, but the other two species are amur maple and high bush cranberry. Can you tell me the heights of each?    Two blocks one of northwest poplar and black spruce, and one of northwest poplar and balsam fir. These trees were transplanted only weeks before so are quite uniform in size.    For the larger trees I measure each one individually and run a tally. The stick is 8 feet (2.5&nbsp;m) long. It is still tricky to estimate.    This is a block of young dogwood in styroblock, next to a block in #2 pots. Each block is 15 trees. I need to count the blocks, examine trees to estimate salable, dead, and runts that may become salable later. Dead is taken off the count right away. "
1102,"When filming wild animals with a drone, how far away does the drone need to be?","There is a video of a cub trying to follow the mother bear up a steep snowbank and then rolling back down at first.

There are guidelines for how close one can get to an animal to prevent harassment, what are the guidelines for drones? "
1103,"What is ""catskiing""?","On a hiking trail recently, I overheard some people talking about going ""catskiing"" as part of a winter vacation from school.   Obviously, that doesn't mean skiing with or by means of a cat.   What is catskiing? How is it done and in what situations? Does it require a special type of skis?   "
1104,Making a compass from magnet and needle -- which end is north?,"I was watching one of those Discovery Channel wilderness survival shows last night and one of the ""survivors"" made a compass from a piece of wire tie and an earbud's magnet.  He stripped the plastic from the tie and rubbed the magnet in a single direction on one end of half the wire, then suspended it from a thread.  How would he know which end of the wire was north?  As best I can tell, if you don't know the orientation of the magnet, you can't determine the orientation of the needle.  Did magnetizing only one end of the wire make a difference?  Edit:  In their scenario, it was daytime, but in a jungle.  The view of the sky was pretty obscured and I believe it was somewhat overcast.   I figured if they couldn't actually determine east from west (they wanted to go east), they couldn't tell north from south to calibrate the compass by the light/sun.  I believe it was midday. "
1105,Is it safe to tie a canoe to the top of your car like this?,"This time of year, you see a lot of canoes and kayaks going down the road tied to the top of cars. Some of them not as smartly anchored as others.    One of the configurations that I see a lot is the ""It's not going off the back"" method. A quick look at google finds these two examples:      Is this method to transport your canoe safe or will it be likely to be lost while driving? What is wrong with this tie down method?  "
1106,Does urinating from the tree stand ruin your hunt?,"When you're up in the tree stand and need to urinate, is it okay to do it just from above or should one seek another solution? So, does your game somehow smell the urine and will stay away? Any other considerations?  "
1107,Designing a sustainable and portable high-energy diet,"I need some help designing a diet for extended multi-day treks which is sustainable, provides high-energy but still remains somehow portable. For some reason my efforts so far were not very successful.     Example: I recently did a part of the GR-20 in Corsica. Admittedly, it is a rather hard alpine trek including a lot of ascends and descends (easily 1600m a day) - and we did our route completely independent of resupplies, meaning 20kg packs. But in just 5 days me and my friend lost 2kg weight each, even with a diet of more than 4000 calories a day! This is clearly not very sustainable (however great it might be to lose weight in some situations).   We brought:   porridge with lots of sugar for breakfast, pastas with pesto/olive oil/mayonnaise for lunch, pasta for dinner (various sauces) chocolate, peanuts and sunflower seeds as snacks   The obvious thing to do seems to be to just cram in even more calories per day. But there is really a limit on how much you can eat and still be able to do a fairly exhausting activity afterwards...   Even eating 'just' 4000 calories a day requires you to stuff your face with sugar, starch and fat at almost every possible moment. (Ever tried eating 1kg of pasta in one day? :P) Food makes for the largest share of the pack weight by far. Unless one starts living of fat alone 4000 calories mean 1kg of pasta per day.   I'd appreciate your advice as to how I can design a diet which allows for a sustainable trek over longer periods of time.    Related to:   What is the most efficient food to take a for a 12-15 day hiking trip? Is there a straightforward way to calculate energy requirements for a trek  "
1108,Portable ladder for sailboat?,"I have access to a 23ft Sonar sailboat that isn't mine. It's pretty difficult to get back into after going for a swim.  Can anyone recommend a type of portable ladder I could bring with me when I use this boat? How would I secure it to the boat?  Priorities are, in this order:    must not damage the boat portable (I take public transit to the boat, not a car) makes getting back on the boat easier     "
1109,Does inside vs outside make a difference in a bowline on a bight?,"This question asks whether the bowline knot is better with the tail inside or outside the loop.   When climbing and tying in with a bowline on a bight, does it make a difference whether one starts with an inside or outside bowline? "
1110,When considering GPS battery life where are the best options?,"I believe the 3 main options for portable GPS currently are:   Dedicated GPS unit  Smart Phone GPS Watch   They all have somethings in common, and each have other considerations also.  For this question, if my only concerns are GPS and battery life.  Out of the box and/or with available modifications, what are my best options for battery life per dollar?    Related: What are some ways/devices that I can use to charge my batteries in the wilderness?  "
1111,"Is using ultralight gear possible without sacrificing safety, comfort, or skills?","I recently came back from a 17-day backcountry hike.  At the start of the hike, my backpack was 28 kg.  At the end of the hike it was around half of that or a little bit more.  I'm fine hiking with 20 kg, but 28 kg is rather heavy.  The first couple of days of my hike I was wondering: is it possible to significantly reduce the mass for a backpack for a long hike, without compromising on safety or comfort, or requiring substantially more skills?  I have a big backpack, a strong tent that is light but not superlight, a solid stove…  The details are really distracting from my point.  I'm not looking for advice on my gear specifically, but more asking in general: hikers who migrated from “traditional” light but-not-ultralight backpacking gear to ultralight, minimalist gear: do you find that it is in any way less safe, less comfortable, or requiring more skills?   Some examples of my gear, along with alternatives: I've tried an ultralight tent in the past (Big Agnes) and it felt far less weather-proof than my Hilleberg.  When I got stuck in an unseasonal winter storm in the Canadian Rockies in 2014, I was very happy that I had a tent I trusted.  Apparently, some people use single-roofed tents or even no tent at all, but I've never seen either in the wild.  I spend most nights in treeless areas. A sleeping bag with less mass than my Haglöfs Goga Pro is inevitably going to be less warm, so it would compromise both safety and comfort. My backpack is 110 litre and was full at the start of my hike, so with a smaller backpack I'd have to attach stuff to the outside. All my food is freeze- or air-dried and if I eat any less, I lose even more weight than I already do. Any alternative to my Trangia stormcooker is going to be harder to operate in bad weather.  I've often seen people struggling even in moderate 10 m/s winds, whereas I've never failed to light my stove.  Of course, I would survive without hot food. I bring a GPS receiver, camera (optional), headlight, and satellite phone.  Apart from the camera they all improve safety.  I enjoy my GPS receiver and camera. I hike in areas where I'm never more than 10 minutes walk from drinking water, and have no need to carry more than 0.5 L of water at a time. I use a dedicated wading staff.  I don't use trekking poles, but wouldn't trust them for wading.  I ford on average 1–2 streams/rivers per day, usually knee-deep. I do use some ultralight gear, such as my trowel.   (Ultralight backpacking appears rather uncommon in Scandinavia.  I've never met an ultralight backpacker in the wild, but they do exist.)  (Note: For the purpose of this question, I am interested in any products, regardless of cost.) "
1112,"How do you get back in canoe, by yourself?","Getting back in a canoe is not as easy as I thought it was going to be.  I also learned that Extra Flotation might be needed  So if I am alone in the middle of a body of water, how do I get back in?    Are there any device that I should have that might help?   I have not been drinking and I am wearing a life jacket (PFD). "
1113,"What breed is this very large, black, turtle/tortoise found in the Northeast United States?","My husband found this very large turtle (or tortoise) crossing a road from an industrial park towards a wooded area. It was in June, in Massachusetts, USA, at 8:00 in the evening. He didn't touch it, just walked alongside to make sure it crossed safely.  The prominent features are as follows:    Very hard shell, primarily black, with some dark brown areas Approximately 18 in, (45 cm) long, and 15 in (38 cm) wide, not including head or tail Tail at least 8 in (20 cm) long  Very wide feet with long toenails Head sticking out only a few inches Pointed upper part of mouth Low rounded shell Serrated edges, especially on back of shell All body parts wrinkled and bumpy    I've heard that one difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that turtles fully immerse themselves in water, whereas tortoises spend most of their time on land, and drink at the edge without swimming. I'm not sure if that's true. My husband hasn't gone into those woods, so he doesn't know whether or not there's a pond or other body of water nearby.  What is the breed of this gorgeous creature? Is it a turtle or a tortoise? I'd also like to know some other things, such as approximate age; preferred diet; nesting habits; best place and time of year to see them; conservation status (some turtles in Massachusetts are protected or endangered); and any other interesting characteristics.

1114,Inexpensive ways to learn cross-country skiing,"I am temporarily relocating from a region with mild climate to Montréal. I run almost every day, in summer and winter, as the temperatures rarely go much below freezing point. Now, I guess I will have to switch sports, at least for the cold season. Also, I think it would be a shame not to cross-country ski in Canada. Doing work and travel, I will be on a budget. Hence my question:  What are inexpensive ways to learn cross-country skiing? Could I teach it to myself? Is it advisable to buy gear off craigslist or ebay and if yes, what would I have to consider? "
1115,BMC Discount on Climbing Walls,"What does the BMC membership discount encompass? Is it just climbing and mountaineering shops or is it other paid for services?

1116,What is the difference between accessory cord and prusik cord?,"Aside from Prusik cord being a different weave, what's the big difference? When would I choose one type of cord over the other? Is there anything I shouldn't I use the different types of cord for? What's the significant difference?  Yellow = Prusik cord | Orange = Accessory Cord   "
1117,What's this knot called?,"I came up with this variation of the flat overhand knot (also known as the Euro Death Knot) for pulling ropes on a rappel. I've never been comfortable using the Euro Death Knot (EDK), but it's hard to deny the virtues of the EDK for retrieving ropes. I set out to try and come up with a knot that had less of a tendency to roll than the EDK and eventually came up with this:     It's a flat overhand with one of the strands tied in a double overhand, which, if anything, makes the knot feel a lot more secure.  What I want to know is if this is an original knot, or if it's already been discovered, has a name, and most importantly: whether or not it's being used for rappels.  I came up with a different knot while experimenting, but found out online that it had already been invented and named ""knot number 1452"" back in the 1940s. This knot however, I can't find any evidence of it being used before.   Does this knot have a name? Or have I come up with something new? "
1118,"When transporting hot liquids, is it better to use one large flask, or two small flasks?","If I want to transport a litre of a hot liquid, what's the best option?

Which option will keep the liquid warmer for longer (accounting for the fact that the liquid will be drunk at regular intervals)? "
1119,Snowboard Boots with the Throwback?,"I've just got a new Burton Throwback, and was wondering how you use it. The instinctive choice seems to be to wear snowboard boots with it. However, there are no ski lifts in my test field  so to prevent excruciating pain when walking up and down the hill, would wearing normal walking boots work?  Just an extra question, do I need to wax the base? "
1120,How do I calculate how much lift an outrigger needs?,"I have been thinking of putting a sail on my canoe with will probably require the use of an outrigger. (related: Outrigger and/or leeboard when sailing a canoe?)  I was thinking about using a section of PVC pipe as an outrigger, this reference indicates a 4 inch pipe will hold 0.653 gallons of water per foot weighing 5.44 pounds, a 5 inch pipe will hold 1.02 gallons at 8.50 pounds. Every pound of water displaced is a pound of lift. The farther out you place the outrigger the more leverage is applied, but at the same time it applies more strain to the arm that connects the outrigger to your vessel   The first image below could be considered two outriggers with a sail between them. At this point my mind spirals out of control with all the variables. If the base was wide enough they would not tip, but then it would require stronger cross bars, which would add more weight...  Many of the off the shelf out riggers for canoes, only have a couple feet long arms with volume of a couple of gallons, but if you see professional sea going outriggers they have much larger volumes with much longer arms (second image).    What are the basic things I need to consider and how do I calculate how much lift I need from an outrigger?  I am planning on inland water (river, lake) sailing, so will not be at the extremes in the images, but I want to understand the principles required to keep the canoe from tipping over, and keep away from putting to much pressure on the outrigger.      "
1121,Can fish sense a person's heartbeat from vibrations through the line?,"Fishing is 95% waiting and 5% action, well at least that's how it is for me. During the down time, I contemplate deeply on some obscure and inane things. For a while I've wondered if an angler is holding his or her rod when the line is in still water, would it be possible for a fish to actually sense any vibrations of that angler's heartbeat through the water? I know that fish in general are able to sense currents, and vibrations but to what extent? I started alternating fishing without holding my rod (using a bell to indicate a bite or nibble of course), and holding my rod for the whole day and my results were inconclusive. Thanks for not laughing:P "
1122,How to deal with Serbian scorpions?,"I always wanted to visit Balkan region, but I'm affraid of scorpions. As far as I searched there's plenty of those terrifying creatures, but none of species I found was poisonous. So I have two questions:   Is my reasearch correct?

1123,Rain soaked leather jacket- how to repair?,"I have a genuine full grain 1.3 mm cow hide motorcycle jacket that was caught in rain. It wasn't a downpour but I was in the rain long enough for the jacket to be pretty wet, not just the surface. I have previously treated my leather with conditioner frequently, designed specifically for motorcycle jackets that boasts waterproof ability.   When I got home, I dried the jacket surface out with a cloth, and applied conditioner very generously. Then left it to hang dry in my closet.   After a few days of hanging to make sure it is completely dry, I noticed parts of the leather had stiffened/hardened. No cracks or anything like that. But rather it feels and looks like it became tighter on certain areas, and it doesn't look as smooth. (since it got tighter parts of my jacket now have a funny concave.)  My question is, is damage like this repairable? By applying conditioner? Or is it permanent? What is the recommended procedure to treat leather jacket after it has been soaked?   Ps. My leather gloves made of genuine full grain leather also has the same issue, the palm patch felt nice smooth and soft but now it looks and feels dry and hardened. Since my gloves are thinner leather, it seems a lot worse than my jacket. Can this be repaired as well?   Edit: I have read about this stuff but they all seem different, and I can't find a certain answer. Anything would help! If you had any experience please share!  "
1124,Footprint or no Footprint in a TNF Assault,I'm planning to camp over rocks and snow in a The North Face Assault (TNF Assault). It's necessary to buy or make a footprint?  There's not one for this model at their website.  What you recommend?. 
1125,Bouldering in California in the summer,"I have a few questions concerning bouldering in California (Mickey's beach and Castle rock) during the month of August. We have two crash pads and a guide book for bouldering in the area. I have had experience bouldering outside at a number of places (Swede's forest, Taylor's falls, and Cooper's rock, to name a few).    Should we bring bug spray? How can we avoid the heat? Do you have any general tips? Like do these areas have any special things we should look out for?  "

1127,Optimal size for crayfish (crawfish) trap entry hole?,"I'm interested in taking advantage of the delicious, invasive and underutilized crawfish here in Minnesota. I recently purchased several minnow traps (they look like two metal mesh cones placed together) but once receiving them I noticed the entry holes seems pretty small (approximately 1"" diameter). It would seem crawfish can get larger than this, I'm wondering if I should return them and try to find traps with a larger entry hole. What is the optimal range for this opening?  (I've checked with state regulations and there is not explicit size range, so I'm looking for the optimal size for catching medium to large crawdads, so basically can a large crayfish fit through a 1"" opening?) "
1128,Making a Make-Shift harness from Tape-Slings,"I have some common knowledge about knots used for Climbing and Rope-care.  There was an incident last week, where I needed a Seat-Harness which I didn't have with me. I needed one for tying up a friend when we cross water streams. I could do that with just a Bowline around her waist but then on the other hand I always carry tape Slings like shown here.  Have anyone ever made a make-shift harness out of such tape slings?  Now, Why don't I carry a actual Harness with me, is valid question. I'd do that most of the times, but yeah the way like the last time around I missed it, I may again do the same. "
1129,"Altitude sickness when going from sea level to 14,000 ft (4,200m) in a single day","My sister lives at sea level -- Baltimore and Chicago. She is coming to visit me in Denver (5280 ft or 1600m). She wishes to climb Mt Bierstadt (14,065 ft or 4200m) the same day she arrives.  I have read over the answers to ""What are some proven methods of training for week long backpacking trips at high altitude?"", which covers coming to Colorado for a hiking trip across several 14-ers. My sister is in excellent physical condition, however, and I am mostly concerned about the adjustment in altitude given the very short period of time involved.    Will the effects and onset of altitude sickness exacerbated by the short time-frame involved and the drastic change in elevation given what her body is acclimated to? Most questions relating to altitude sickness agree that the best way to acclimate yourself is to go to high altitude regularly. Given that this is not an option, is there any way to mitigate the risks somewhat?  If she climbs the mountain the day after she arrives, will this make much of a difference?  "
1130,Taking Aspirin in higher altitudes,"Reading this answer and especially the comments leads me to questions:    Should one use Aspirin in high altitudes?  Should one use it as a precaution or only when actually getting headache or other problems?   I heard that the decreasing oxygen level in the blood will cause the body to produce more (and bigger) red blood cells if you acclimate properly. This thickens the blood, to get it thinner a drug like Aspirin could be used. But also drinking a lot helps. Still, disguising headache and therefore the major sign of acute mountain sickness (AMS) might be a drawback.  I know this is a general question about medicine which is difficult to answer without doctors and for the specific person of interest. Still, I would like to know the pros and cons of Aspirin in high-altitude or in general the influence and consequences for mountaineering. "

I have a small 4 door car no rack and my wife has a slightly larger 4 door crossover style vehicle no rack.  I'd be transporting this maybe 30 miles or so for general usage but would need to take this as much as 300 miles for some family vacations. I'd love to use a ""cheap"" solution(plain foam blocks) but I do want to be as safe as possible so my guess is that cheap is not an option.  What is the best way to transport a kayak? Are foam blocks ok or am I asking for trouble? Is there a strategy for using plain foam blocks without a rack over long distances? I'm fine with pulling over every 45 minutes or so to check things.  The kayak I had in mind is the Wilderness Systems Aspire 105. "

1137,Can I heat a shelter with fire?,"So I built my survival shelter and I decide a nice fire would really warm things up. Is there a way I can build a fire that would heat the shelter without too much smoke? I know I could make the shelter better and warmer, and I would need to sit and stare at the fire making sure it didn't burn the shelter down.   Is there a way to build a fire to do this? Side note, I am assuming a typical low crawl in shelter, would there be a better one to use with fire? "
1138,Which types of wood will make food taste bad?,"So other than toxic burning wood, which types of wood are safe to use for cooking fires but will just make my food taste bad? I live in the Southwest, and all types of woods that I have cooked over have been delicious (well, okay at least). An answer on another question brought my attention that some might not taste okay, though:     Make sure you know your wood. Some woods produce toxic fumes. Others   will produce a very unpleasant taste.   So which woods make food taste bad when that food is cooked over the wood? "
1139,How much waterproofing spray to apply to my softshell jacket,I have a Showers Pass Portland Rain Jacket.

1140,Is my tent pole a lightning rod?,"I have used the Mega Mid tent almost exclusively for hundreds of nights out over the last many years. It's versatile, well ventilated, light... but has this pole sticking straight up the middle.  Is this configuration more likely to attract lightning than, say, poles in a dome-type tent? How good are tent-poles in general for attract lightning?  I've had a few nights when I have jettisoned the pole -- tossing it far away (and huddled under the sopping fabric) in a attempt to try and distract the lightning gods -- is this futile?  Assuming I leave the tent pole in, is it better to insulate either end (say with a rubber sandal)?  Or am I over-thinking it all, and what will be will be, so sweet dreams. "
1141,Will Iodine Tablets Ruin My CamelBak?,"In the past, I have gone backpacking with some fairly expensive, heavy water purification tools. But the more I read about water safety in California's Sierras (here and here), the less I think these high-tech solutions are necessary.  Can I just drop some iodine tablets into my CamelBak?  Will the tablets:   react with the plastic bladder and destroy it? stain the plastic bladder dark purple? make the CamelBak taste like iodine permanently?  "

1143,What backwoods trick to get pure water produces the most safe water?,"So I read this answer and I was wondering what contraption produce the most water when you don't have a water source? So what water trap produces the most water? Specifically, what should I do with my plastic bags/baggies that will net the most water per bag/baggie so I can spend less time setting up water traps and more time on other survival necessities?  I am assuming I would have to make several a day, but knowing what produces the most would be helpful.  I assume this would change for environment so for this question assume a mountain forest.   "

We have an existing question How do you fashion a spear with a fixed blade. All of the blades pictured are long handled and/or have a long tang. A long tang provides a solid mounting point as shown in the accepted answer.  Half a dozen multi tool blades would be a small and light addition to my survival gear.  If they were all potential spears it could make a huge difference in a survival scenario, and would keep my primary long handled knife from being at risk of loss or damage in a spearing event.  Can I use the blade of a multi tool as an effective spear point?  If so, how would I attach it?    "

1152,Hunting for aurora near Tromso - few questions,"I'm planning to fly to Tromso in February with my friends. We'd like to stay for 3 - 4 days and have few questions, I'd be glad if someone could answer them.   We are going to get a tent so we can use the ""right to roam"" and change our place of visit. Do you have any special tips for us? Which place is best for setting up the tent? We have some experience from wild camping in Poland and we always choose dense forest for this, but I know Tromso region lacks woodlands. We are taking food with us, too. Can we set up a fireplace? Can we use sticks already laying on the ground (I guess yes) or even cut down the tree (I guess not)? We always clean up after ourselves to leave place untouched, but don't wan't to bring or buy fuel if we can use what nature offers. I know there are free and open cabins in the area. Some of them are possibly reachable for a one day hike, but some are quite a distance away. How easy is to hitchhike in Norway? What would happen if the cabin is already occupied? Or if anyone else comes to it after us? Is there some kind of reservation system?   I'll edit the question if anything comes to my mind. Thank you! "
1153,"As an outdoor beginner, what features in knife/tool combinations should I look for?","As an outdoor beginner, I was interested in some possible tool combinations for shorter outdoor hiking trips, say, 2-5 days.  From what little experience I have, I reckon that the most common tasks will be   the preparation of food minor woodworking (firewood, skewers, replacement tent pegs/pole)  occasional minor digging   According to what I've read, it is common to use a heavier field knife in combination with a smaller swiss army knife or multitool, omitting any additional tools like a pocket saw or a small axe.   In your experience, are the features in those types of tool combinations reasonable for what I'd like to do? Is there other criteria I should consider when making a choice, and why?  "
1154,Grigri+ vs grigri 2,"I just got a sample of Petzl's new assisted braking device, the Grigri+. I must admit I look at it with a lot of disdain, mostly because   It's bulkier than the Grigri 2; It's heavier than the Grigri 2; The possibility to choose between lead and top rope modes adds a new mechanical component, which should pretty much weaken the system; It has almost no ear to grab when using Petzl's recommended belay technique;   On the other hand, the device has very clear advantages over its predecessor:   Stainless steel reinforcements to high friction areas; Added anti-panic handle; Internal components made of a different, higher friction material - this makes it possible to build a larger chamber, which should (in principle) decrease the friction when paying out slack; Casing improved in order to cover the whole interior of the brake - this should keep dirt out; Petzl finally addressed a very serious problem with Grigri2: the stupid, sharp, wrongly placed casing's tail;   I need to decide whether or not to sell the device without using it, otherwise the price will fall down - and I'm the first among my friends to have one of these, which means I can't just borrow one and test it. I've read multiple reviews, but everyone's just praising the device and the criticism is mostly expressed as ""this brake is made to  help beginners, and its functions should make the life of someone who just started to climb much easier"". The thing is that an anti-panic handle, lead and top rope modes and stainless steel reinforcements mean pretty much nothing to me. What would really make me choose to keep this device are advantages 3 and 5: if it's really much easier to pay slack with this thing, and if it wears the rope less, then I'll keep it. All disadvantages are really important to me, specially 3 and 4.  Check the picture below. Notice how the back of Grigri2's casing (right) was smartly substituted by a new chamber design on the Grigri+ (left)... But notice also how the area to place your finger has disappeared in the Grigri+ (you can't see it in this picture, but the small orange button to place your finger is flat and not very anatomical).    So: have you used this device? Does it wear the rope less than its predecessor? Is it really easier to pay slack with? Have you had any problems with the belay/top rope button? "
1155,How to identify good winter boots for walking on ice?,"I just saw this BBC news clip Does Canada have the solution to slipping on ice? at about 1:20 into the clip (not counting the commercial) a scientist says ""most footwear performs poorly"" he also says just looking at the tread of the shoe/boot is not a good guide.    For those who can't watch the video.  Canada has an indoor lab with ice floors that can be angled to test traction on both frozen and partially melted ice. There is a related web page that has ratings for different boots. Neither the news clip nor the web page tells me how to identify good footwear, there is an option to see ratings for tested boots.   We have a couple of existing questions about footwear and ice, that mostly talk about how to walk, or what &amp; when to use add on traction devices.   What&#39;s the best way to avoid slipping on ice? Is it worth getting snow shoe chains/spikes for only a one week trip to a snowy area? Are Ice grips worth buying?   Choosing boots is complex, and the top rated boot might not fit my foot or maybe it is not available in my area or...   If I am in the boot store without a rating source for boots, how can I identify which boots will have the best soles for walking on snow and ice (and be safe on hard floors indoors)?   "

I am using my alpine boots with Tyrolia Aambition (10 and 13 models that are both frame touring bindings).  The toe of my boot wiggles a bit in the bindings.  Is this ok?  Or is there a mistake in the installation?  (with my alpine boots and bindings, the toe is always very solid and fixed...). "
1157,Can you really get Frostbite within 30 minutes at -35 'C,"Just got this Weather advisory, and it appears over-dramatic, so would like some feedback if it's actually possible to get frostbite within 30 minutes if it's only around -30-35 Celsius (that's not really that cold, just 5-10 degrees less than normal temperature).     WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON MST TUESDAY... *   WHAT... VERY COLD WIND CHILLS EXPECTED. THE COLD WIND CHILLS WILL   CAUSE FROSTBITE IN AS LITTLE AS 30 MINUTES TO EXPOSED SKIN. EXPECT   WIND CHILLS TO RANGE FROM 20 BELOW ZERO TO 30 BELOW ZERO. * WHERE...   PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND NORTH CENTRAL MONTANA. * WHEN... UNTIL NOON   MST TUESDAY. * ADDITIONAL DETAILS... THE COLDEST WIND CHILLS ARE   EXPECTED LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH MID-MORNING TUESDAY.   PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... A WIND CHILL ADVISORY MEANS THAT   COLD AIR AND THE WIND WILL COMBINE TO CREATE LOW WIND CHILLS. FROST   BITE AND HYPOTHERMIA CAN OCCUR IF PRECAUTIONS ARE NOT TAKEN. MAKE SURE   YOU WEAR A HAT AND GLOVES    I find it simply hard to believe that if I never got frostbite at -25 Celsius, that 5-10 degrees more would be enough to cause it Is -25 some kind of biological threshold or something ? For longer walks(>1 hour), I usually start using gloves&amp;hat below -12-15 and a lambskin fur coat (below -18 C), though front half of face is obviously uncovered. But that's the part of body which is 'trained' for cold the most, no ?  Doesn't the face's frostbite threshold move further, because that part of skin is frequently exposed to cold ? Or it doesn't really work that way ? Perhaps there's a difference between ""1. Real -35 C"" and ""2. Windchill -35 C"" that's making this confusing? Not sure if important to this, but there's a larger river right next to our village (hence the ""lake effect"")   Around 3am tonight (at least according to weather.com interpolations) the windchill should be around -30 F, which is about -35 C. I'm gonna stay up and walk my Husky (who, btw, isn't really bothered by these temperatures) then to see for myself.  I would appreciate your input to either of the questions, thanks!  EDIT1: It's 3.30 am, but the -30F is now moved to 9am, so no luck...  EDIT2:      These are my [non-scientific] observational findings/opinions from the   experiment of spending 45 minutes at -33 C (-27 F) Windchill at 9.30am   yesterday:    The thermal face-slap when walking out of building was strong, but definitely far from the worst ones in past (like that blizzard), which to me confirms you also really need a proper base air temperature (air  was only -15F (-26 C) after all). It did provide a proper ""lung bite"" though as breathing was a notch more painful My current gloves/hat combo cost $15 at a local HW store, so it should be obvious how well it [does not] protect against cold compared to the pro gear The gloves are, however, very good at gauging the temperature, as the time when my hands get cold inside is , empirically, linear to the temperature At -33 C, my hands got really cold inside under 5 minutes After 15 minutes I did a bit of exposure - 12 minutes of no gloves and taking picture of the very interesting [NatGeo-worthy] river fog phenomenon. It was pretty painful the whole time fingers got totally white within few minutes After 12 minutes I put on gloves and walked for another 20 minutes I also noticed there's a surprisingly huge difference in perceived cold between walking right on the river bank and walking, say, 10 minutes away from it, between the houses. That [very] local river humidity in the air, that beautifully frosts all the twigs and branches on the trees by the river, makes quite a strong difference at -33 C, though. Much, much stronger than under -25 C When I got back home after 45 minutes, it took about another 15 very painful minutes for my fingers to regain the full dexterity so I could work on computer. Right hand took slightly longer as I got carpal tunnel there (it's also much more sensitive to cold than the left hand) Face was alright (other than the slight pain) - I was periodically touching it with gloves to check (as per the recommendations I received here below) - like I said, I don't really care if I freeze to death, but sure as hell don't want to walk around face-disfigured (with stage-3 necro chunks of skin)   So, it turns out after all, that those 5-10 degrees more [base point being at -25 C], are indeed just that : few degrees more and not really a big deal for a short exposure.  Of course, on a mountain or on a multi-day tent hike, it'd be a whole different story...  Moral of the story : Ignore the [triple-facepalm-worthy] bombastic local weather alerts filled with overly dramatic TV tone (""OMG ! SNOWMAGEDDON !"") and really - just use common sense. If it's 5-10 degrees more, it really is just 5-10 degrees more, duh !!! "
1158,Adding extra hydration to a CamelBak backpack,"I've had a CamelBak backpack for years (a Rim Runner that I bought in 2005), and for Christmas treated myself to a new MilTac H.A.W.G. as one of the zips on the old Rim Runner was starting to break and, well, I wanted something new.  I'm very pleased with the backpack, but one old issue persists; the 3l of water just isn't enough on 4+ hour hikes in hot weather (I'm in Australia, so it's summer here).  Has anyone had any success adding a second hydration reservoir to a pack? Is there typically space in the main reservoir pocket? "

What are the considerations for combining a frontpack with a backpack while hiking?  "
1160,Most comfortable way to adjust boots while in tour mode on AT skis?,"I'm new to alpine touring and skiing in general. As such I (stupidly?) bought some beginners (cheap) alpine ski boots. They don't seem to have a lot of flex in them, even when they are in ""hike"" mode (with the little tabs at the back flipped up).  I've noticed that some people recommend not doing the main (top) boot strap up at all when touring and only doing it up for skiing downhill. However, these boots are a little uncomfortable anyways and rub a little in the heal.   I'm wondering, what's the best way to make alpine boots comfortable while touring on AT skis? "
1161,"Are ""Dynafit""/tech ski boots compatible with frame-style touring bindings?","I'm new to alpine touring skiing, and I'd like to purchase some new (more comfortable) AT boots.

Can I purchase and use tech-style boots in my current ski bindings and then (one day) buy new tech bindings and use the same boots?  Or, will I have to get new tech bindings at the same time I purchase new tech-style (""Dynafit"") touring boots? "
1162,What are the considerations for using chemical heat pads in sleeping bags?,"A now-deleted answer to this question suggested using chemical heating pads in sleeping bags at night to provide added warmth.  The product suggested is the 'Thermacare ... Fe-loaded material' I looked and it seems to use a chemical reaction to create heat over a period of about 8 hours.     ThermaCare® technology combines iron, oxygen, water and salt in single-use HeatWraps to produce real heat. Source   ""Do not wear while sleeping"" is one of the instructions on the official product usage label from the manufacturer. But, as long as it is just in the sleeping bag with me and not stuck to my skin it should be fine, right?  "

1164,GPS data management software,"Is there any good software to manage GPS tracks and POI efficiently that you would recommend? My dream would be an offline computer based (macOS and Windows) software, with a modern GUI, which allows a multi-level structure as Base Camp does, with meta-data search and the ability to display offline (OSM, GMAP as a wish, it is probably proprietary) and online maps (OSM).   I am currently using Garmin Base Camp and MyMaps in Google Maps for sharing routes and POI with other persons. Both lacks of some key functions:    Base Camp: No batch export of tracks with the file structure, no good meta data search, no integration of online maps (Apple Plan, Google Maps...), ergonomics and GUI from another century MyMaps: Online only (export as KML possible, sync with Google Earth App is not working well, and the ergonomics in Google Earth is terrible), only one level of hierarchy, import of track in a separate layer (not possible to import a track in the active layer).    What software (computer based, no App for smartphone or tablet) for managing GPS tracks fulfill these criteria? And if there are multiple, what are their respective (dis-)advantages? "

1166,How can a Common Kingfisher bird balance on a tiny swaying reed without moving its head?,"This is a one minute video of a Common Kingfisher bird standing on a tiny reed swaying in the wind. It's from the BBC Network in England.     For much of the video, especially the beginning, the bird doesn't seem to be moving its head, but the body is moving back and forth on the reed. Even when it moves its head a bit, the body still appears almost independent, and its feet don't move from their original position.    I initially thought it was fake, that the picture of the head had been manipulated to stay still while the body moved, at least for parts of it. It's obviously real, though, but I still don't understand the mechanism.  How does a Kingfisher literally sit on that tiny moving reed without moving its head, and why? Is it asleep?  "
1167,"Down is escaping my jacket, especially over a wool sweater","I recently bought a down jacket and noticed that some down is leaking, especially if I am wearing a wool sweater underneath.  Everytime I wear my jacket with my (dark, which makes the down very visible) wool sweater, I notice anywhere between 20 and 50 filaments stuck on my sweater. I assume this is because of static.  The jacket is not 1 month old yet. Is it normal that I still notice some leakage from now and then (even when not wearing wool underneath)? Do people not usually wear wool with down jackets? "

1170,How should I dress for sweat inducing activities in cold weather?,"I never seem to find the perfect way to dress for sweat inducing activities in cold weather. By sweat inducing activities I mean mostly activities in the mountains, especially hiking uphill or ski touring. By cold weather I mean weather that would normally require a jacket, or at least a thick jumper. If that is too wide of a description, let's say I mean between 0°C (32°) and 10°C (50°F).  What I normally do is choose materials that breathe well. So no hard shell or puffy jacket, but instead some sort of warm fleece hoodie or a windstopper. Naturally, I avoid anything made of cotton, and use (technical) synthetic clothing instead. I make sure to cover my neck, as I am much too prone to getting throat colds and similar problems. I also make sure to bring warmer clothes for later, and a change of t-shirt/long-sleeved shirt that I wear as a base layer.  All this effort seems to work just partly: I am still sweating more than I would e.g. in summer. At the same time I am still getting cold when a cold gust of wind catches me.   Is there anything else I could be doing/doing differently? Are there some magical technical clothes that I am missing?   "
1171,What should I consider when planning my first multiple-day hiking trip on hills?,"I just relocated from north Germany into the south of Germany.  Last weekend I went hiking for the first time and visited the top of a hill close to Heidelberg. It was spontaneous and I was fascinated, and surprised by the time it took me (mostly because all was so new and exciting, but still).  From the highway driving with my car I can see that the hill I just hiked on is connected in a chain with other hills. Since I really enjoyed my first hiking trip, seeing the hill chain made the idea arise to hike along that chain for a multiple day trip.   I'm used to walking for longer distances a few times, even up to like 30KM on kinda even areas, but I've never done a multiple day trip in a hilly area.   My problem is, I never did something like this before and don't know anyone who did a trip like this before (or at least no one I am aware of having done it). All I could figure out myself so far that I would absolutely need to take with me would be warm clothing, a tent, a sleeping bag and of course provisions.  I am planning to start on a Friday morning/noon and be back in Heidelberg in the afternoon/evening of Sunday.  Now I feel quite sure that what I considered so far will be too little preparation for a 3 day trip, and probably cause me to abort my trip earlier.  Also I feel like there might be dangerous situations I could be facing that I'm not aware of, and have no idea how to prepare for them yet.  My question is:  Doing such a trip alone, as described above, what are the mandatory items I should have with me to be able to finish my hiking trip? And what are the situations I should definitely be prepared enough to face, either because they happen often enough that it is good to know about it, or situations that are dangerous enough that it would be careless to not be prepared for it? "
1172,Best practices for physical and inventory management of a ready pack/bug out bag,"Hopefully this is acceptable. I figure this could be relevant as my bug out bag is essentially what I would bring on a camping trip (first aid, fire starters, some food, shelter materials, mess kit, survival knife, cordage, etc.) but my 'camping bag' is more of a stand-by for emergencies. So you can use substitute ""bug out bag"" with ""camping pack"" if you feel so inclined.  TL;DR   How do you manage larger survival bags?   Since I don't use it every day and don't really have time to drill with it or whatever people do, I have an Excel spreadsheet so I can remember exactly what I have and where it is (not to be used in an actual emergency)  Also looking for improvements to current design (I know what works for some, may not work for others) Noticeable flaws with my design? (aside from complexity) Is it generally better to have a modular system (such as mine) or multiple packs for different purposes? Money is a factor else I'd have seperate bags (24 hr, 72 hour, camping, urban get home, etc)   It's supposed to be a general bag, mainly a 72-hr SHTF pack but can also double for camping.   In my spreadsheet, I have info such as:   Categories and subcategories (e.g. Water: Purification or Water: Storage)   Brands/Models/Description/Features/Directions (e.g. Snugpak Jungle blanket, 24""x36"" rated to 36 deg F, polyester, compressed to 6""x6"")   Item weight (in 0.00lbs) so I can track the overall net weight of the bag (using a postal scale)   Expiration dates if applicable and a field that tells if item should be replaced soon (I have set to 90 days), plus another sheet that notifies if items expire within &lt;1 year, &lt;6 months, and &lt;90 days which I aim to compress to one spreadsheet Item $ cost (for personal reason) Location within bag (I'm reworking this but maybe have a picture of the bag with each compartment labeled by a number, maybe with a color and buy the colored dots used for yard sales to I know where each item goes) Retailer (with link if applicable) where I purchased said item (for replacement or additional feature descriptions   A bit overkill but so far works. Does anyone else do something like this? Aside from not doing it, and I know most people don't do this, I'm looking for improvements/alternatives to make it easier.  My Current Setup:   I'm using two bags: A 5.11 Tactical RUSH 24 main bag with the RUSH tier system attaching a 5.11 MOAB 10 Bags are attachable to each other to create one large pack One bag is more of a 24-hr pack, the other is a compliment to make it into a 72-hr pack  "
1173,How to tie nylon straps to trees of unknown diameter,"When outdoors with my hammock, I prefer to set everything up with a pair of nylon tree straps. It gives things a more secure feeling and I've heard it's better for the trees too since the cordage won't be biting into the bark.  The trouble is I am at times confronted with trees that have a diameter that does not match the length of the nylon straps. That is to say, after I finish wrapping around the tree my end loops are spaced apart a lengthy, cumbrous distance from each other. And if I ratchet-back a wrap, the end loops are closer of course, but the straps dangle down too much. That makes the subsequent hammock setup process more difficult than it needs to be. No matter what knot/fold voodoo I try to invoke on the nylon straps, nothing seems to help. It's supposed to look something like this (note that the end loops are very close to each other, this is ideal):    Question  Is there an outdoor hack of some sort that I can bring to bear here? Or are my options limited to bringing multiple sizes of nylon straps (some longer, some shorter)? "
1174,When should I avoid geotagging?,"I did not use to think of geotagging photos as a leave-no-trace issue.  In fact, one slogan says leave only footprints, take only photos.  Yet the Leave No Trace Social Media Guidance states:     Tag thoughtfully – avoid tagging (or geotagging) specific locations. Instead, tag a general location such as a state or region, if any at all. While tagging can seem innocent, it can also lead to significant impacts to particular places.   This to avoid visitors loving nature to death (see Crisis in our national parks: how tourists are loving nature to death, The Guardian, 20 November 2018)  I tend to quite successfully choose to visit places that get very low visitation, yet are quite spectacular.  In 2017 I hiked for 2 weeks on Iceland and met only one other hiker.  In 2018 I hiked for 10 days in central Norway/northern Sweden and met no other hikers.  Also in 2018, I hiked all day along the Grand Canyon North Rim with canyon and river views, yet I met no other hikers.  In all cases, I have uploaded geotagged photos on the internet without giving much thought about what the potential impact my geotagging may have.  I tend to quietly assume that places that are quiet now will be quiet later.  Am I inadvertently threatening the solitude of the beautiful and quiet places I have visited, such as Lónsöræfi, Þjórsárver, Kinnarodden, Fajana de Franceses, Ljusfjällskåtan, Glenthorne Beach, or Tuweap?  Or are they likely to remain quiet in any case, with visitors flocking in ever greater numbers to more famous places in the area instead?  Some places are already so busy, that I can't think that my geotagging will add any visitors (such as Lofoten or anything within a 10 minute walk from the road in a popular U.S. National Park or Monument).  Other places are so remote and quiet, that I can't imagine they'll ever be busy (remote corners of Laponia WHS come to mind).  Yet other places have strict visitor limits in place already, so an increase in popularity will only lead to more disappointed tourists (I've experienced that only in the USA and Canada, but it's being discussed in parts of Iceland, although not in any place in Iceland I've hiked).  But perhaps there are also places where I should be more careful in advertising their beauty?  What criteria should I consider in whether or not to geotag photos online? "
1175,How to prevent rubber on hiking boots from degrading?,"I have Lowa leather hiking boots with a rubber toe cap and sidewalls which I bought around 5 years ago. I've gotten great use out of them and the leather is still in great shape, but the rubber is starting to crumble.   It's basically very brittle and is slowly peeling away from the leather upper. As a work around, I've used an adhesive to coat the rubber and reattach it to the upper, but I'll need to buy new boots soon.  My question is how to postpone the rubber's degradation on my new boots. Since the rest of the boot is in great shape, if the rubber were not cracking, I could get another couple years out of the pair. What care tips can keep the rubber flexible and in good shape?  I've seen suggestions about using glycerine soap or silicon oil for boots with full rubber uppers. Would these products also work for my issues?  "
1176,Is there a fuel cell that would be clean and quiet enough for RV/Camper/Trailer use?,"Gasoline generators are notoriously noisy (some are more quiet) and smelly.  Many areas like US national parks have restrictions on the use of generators.  Fuel cells are used in many space applications, they are perceived as clean and quiet.  Generators can cost upwards of a few thousand dollars, clean and quiet having value. If I had a budget of $10,000 (US) , could I purchase a fuel cell that would be appropriate for powering a RV/Camper/Trailer?   Why not solar?  Solar cells don't work well on cloudy days and under tree cover,  Most (not all) campsites in the US that are primitive (without amenities like power) are under the heavy cover of an established forest.

1177,"Does the male or female Emperor penguin incubate their egg, and for how long?","I've been told that the only place Emperor penguins live is Antarctica. They live in colonies which can be anywhere from 500-20,000 birds. Unlike some other birds, including other penguin species, they only lay one egg at a time, and on ice rather than land.   Thousands of people travel to Antarctica each year hoping to see the Emperors. Excursions take place in the form of cruises, airplanes, and helicopters, combined with long walks and camping. Those who've gone report that it's an absolutely magnificent and unforgettable experience.   Since each pair only has one egg per breeding season, if I were fortunate enough to witness these penguins during the incubation period, would I see males, females, or a combination of both?   Also, in order to plan the trip, how long of a window would I have, meaning what's the length of the incubation period?  "

1179,"Appropriate terms for activities like camping, hiking, trekking, mountaineering, wilderness survival?","Outdoor adventure activities seems like a mouthful, so I was wondering if there was a more appropriate term for such activities?  Wikipedia suggests 'Outdoor Recreation' but that implies these to be leisure based activities and doesn't account for people like a lot of us here for whom it is a serious passion or pursuit.  'Outdoor sports' could be an option but it seems too broad and sports has a connotation of being competitive.  'Wilderness Adventures' seems like the only other term which would be appropriate?  What would be an appropriate term that encompasses these activities?  Posting here based on suggestions on original thread: [website]"

1185,Is it practical to tap a tree for syrup on an overnight stop?,"We have a couple of questions about the legality of and how to tap trees to get sap.  Tree sap is the source of sugary syrups like Maple or Sycamore.  The sap can then be evaporated over a fire to leave a high sugar syrup (i.e. Maple Syrup).  While the process is not complex, it takes a lot of time and a lot of sap.  If you want a cup (8 fluid ounces, 0.25 liters) you would need 40+ cups of sap (2.5 US gallons, 10 Liters).  Additionally for Maple and maybe other trees as well, the sap is best for making syrup during certain times of the year, where particular weather patterns are occurring.    Assuming you have packed all the required implements with you, if you stop to camp for the night, could you tap a tree (or three) as you are setting up camp, and produce syrup for breakfast, before hitting the trail again?

1189,Choosing a sleeping pad for camping,"I currently own the most basic closed cell sleeping pad that one could buy. I'd like to upgrade to a better self  inflating pad. I've narrowed it down to about two options: REI AirRail 1.5 REI Trekker  The first has a higher r-value, is cheaper, and is flat which may be nice when sleeping with another person. However, it's about twice as large as it doesn't fold when wrapping up. Now I'd like to take this on car camps, bike tours, and backpacking. It shouldn't be a problem on my bike as my previous pad is about the same size.  But when backpacking, would there be a significant disadvantage to taking the larger pad? I assume it would have to go on the outside of the pack. Would the smaller one reasonably fit in a pack? It's a pound heavier but I don't plan on going on week long hikes just yet. Is this just a question of whether I would prefer the comfort of a nice pad or the comfort of less clunky gear? "
1190,How to become a falconer at a young age?,"Last year, we had an assembly at school where two falconers came and talked about the craft. I thought it was amazing and the idea captivated me. But I don't quite remember all the details. He said that once you are the age of fourteen you can go to a master falconer and learn under them as an apprentice. But how does that work exactly? Is it like in the cartoon Chowder, where you live with them and they teach you school and the craft? Or do you stay where you live and just learn under them. Here are the questions I would like answered:   How old do you have to be to become an apprentice? (I'm 14 r/n) Do you live with your master and school under them? What are the specific rules for California? Where do I go and what do I do to become an apprentice  "

1193,How to humanely kill an injured rabbit?,"My girlfriend was walking the dogs this am when she came across what she thought was a road kill rabbit. One of the dogs ran over to the ""dead"" rabbit and tried to take a bite out of the stomach. The rabbit screamed and hobbled off! So the rabbit wasn't dead just critically injured.  I wasn't there, but if I was I would of wanted to put it out of it's pain. How would I do this most effectively? I do not routinely carry a knife or a gun (illegal in the UK)    Hardly anyone is actually answering the question (How to humanely kill an injured rabbit?), I didn't ask for advice with what to do with the rabbit, I asked how to kill it.   I think the scenario is maybe confused everyone, this rabbit was injured but I was also referring to a hunting scenario, hence the tag hunting .  "

1195,Tactical Folder vs traditional knife patterns for EDC,"A lot of knife owners who have carried pocket knives for 30+ years talk very fondly of the traditional patterns, like Barlow, stockman, etc. However when it comes to explaining exactly why they carry their old knives over newer styles, it usually comes out something like ""sometimes you just want a plain old fashioned knife,"" or ""they don't make 'em like they used to.""  I'm trying to come up with a reason why they keep saying that (and there must be a reason right?), but here are the only advantages I can see of an old fashioned pocket knife: 1. Build quality/finish 2. Availability of carbon steel blades, if that's your thing.   Whereas a modern ""tactical folder"" design like the one I currently carry (which at 2.5"" blade is decidedly non-tactical in reality) has several advantages: 1. Pocket clip 2. 1-hand opening with thumb stud etc.  3. Easy cleaning inside the open frame 4. 1-hand closing with liner lock and other blade locks not found on traditional knives 5. Screw assembly allows for easy disassembly if required, or re-tension of the joint if the blade gets loose  In order for me to switch to a traditional knife pattern I would have to find somewhere to carry it, in a belt sheath or at the bottom of a pocket that's already full (I carry a leatherman and flashlight as well), and getting the knife out and opening it would take 2 hands. I love the classic looks of the wooden scales and shiny bolsters, but my knife is a practical tool, and utility comes first. I'm not trying to start an argument, but there has to be something about old folders that I'm missing. Can someone clue me in?  And lastly, let me be clear: this is for everyday use around the home and office, opening packages, cutting threads, paper, food (I once at an entire steak with nothing but my EDC knife because that's what I had on hand and nobody thought to bring knives/forks), etc. I'm not planning on skinning game or surviving in the wilderness with my EDC knife.

1199,Is clipping directly onto a dyneema sling safe?,"I was recently doing a scramble route in North Wales. We needed to get past a large rock spike, though easy climbing, it was quite exposed and not a good place to take a fall. As a safety backup I attached a long dyneema sling over a large spike and clipped this directly onto my harness. This was more confidence protection than anything as the move was straight forward.   We did this for speed, we did have a rope but didn't want to spend the time getting it out, etc. just to pass a relatively small section.  It occurred to me afterwards though that maybe this wasn't such a great idea. There was nothing in the system to really absorb any impact. The fall onto the sling would have been minimal (maybe 1m).  Are there any problems with attaching a sling directly onto your harness like this? We didn't use a crows foot or any other knot. Just a sling and one carabiner.  Here's a video of my girlfriend doing the above for context "

1201,What to do if the second seems stuck and absolutely no communication is possible?,"Backstory:  A few months ago, I experienced the following situation: We (two people) were climbing the last pitch of a multi-pitch route. Near the end, there was a cave-like chimney. Basically a chimney where the opening was narrower than the chimney itself, and the whole thing getting narrower towards the top.  When I lead that pitch, I had no problem going up, noticing that I had to leave the chimney because the top opening was too narrow for my helmet, downclimbing a meter and continuing on the outside. When I was belaying the second, she got stuck inside the ""cave"" because of her backpack with no way of going up, down or out. The whole situation looked a bit like this (left: side view, right: front view):    Our problem in that situation was that we absolutely couldn't communicate (cave roof between us, open sea to the back, so no echo), and I had no way of knowing what was happening down there. She finally solved the situation by letting go, falling for at most half a meter and then (with great difficulty) wiggling out of the cave. If I had known that she needed to be lowered like 1-2&nbsp;m, the whole situation would have been solved in a minute, but like this, it took like 15.   Question:  While it worked out fine in our situation, what is the generally recommended way of handling a situation where the second seems stuck and absolutely no communication is possible? Also, what would have been the appropriate reaction of she hadn't been able to move?  This is mainly about how to handle such a situation if you haven't prepared specifically. However, recommendations about preparing for the case of such a situation are also welcome, if this doesn't make my question too broad! "
1202,Is it normal that a down sleeping bag loses its loft after ~5 years ~150 nights?,"I have a 5 year old Haglöfs Para M5.  I've used it for on average 30 nights per year, perhaps 150 nights in total, with one long trip and some 8 short trips per year.  I store it uncompressed in a dry and dark place, and I pack it in its bag inside a drybag (heavily compressed).  I don't use a liner.  Increasingly, there is no loft and therefore little insulation in the upper part, above the chest.  The loft in the lower part, above the legs, is still fine.  Is this normal for the level of use I describe?  Did all the feathers somehow accumulate in the lower part and can I somehow redistribute them, or do I need to get a new one? "
1203,Tent Fly Coloured Reflective Tape,"I have an MSR Elixir 2 tent with footprint that is great for my spring/summer/fall rock trips and is made of quite durable fabric.  It has worked quite well at very cold temps and has very effectively kept rain out.  I am hoping to use this tent for weekend ice climbing trips during the winter months.  The only issue is that the fly is silver/white! I have reflective guy lines but am wondering:  Is there a bright coloured tape, preferably orange, that I can apply to a portion of the fly so it is more visible in snow during daylight and also has some reflective properties so it is visible at night?  Reasons for wanting to do this is to save ~$750 on a four season tent until I actually need one!  There may be hunting permitted in the area the tent is pitched, emergency situations where we would need to be identified from the air...  Also please consider that the tape or markers need to accommodate the stretch in the fly.  Does any such product exist? "

1205,Good canyon (or canyoning) websites,"I was wondering if you guys knew about some good websites to find canyons on with the necessary information ? Necessary information being:   Longest abseil French level (V.A.I.) Wether the canyon is open/closed The entrance of the canyon and the exit of the canyon The sensitivity to weatherconditions ...   A fine example is given by the French canyonsite. There you can search the name of your canyon at the right of the site. For example if I look at the canyon ""Barranco del Furco"" (in Spain) i find the following technical sheet. It gives the necessary information (mentioned above) together with some pictures of the canyons and the state of the water in the canyon. This site mainly deals with French canyons but it also knows a lot of other canyons. Once you have enough reputation on this site, you are free to add other canyons.  Now I've also discovered an English canyonsite. They put the different canyons they know on a Canyon Locations Map. This site is very handy to find places which have canyons. However the data about canyons outside of England is rather limited. And the data about the canyons that they do know is not that extensive.     The thing that I was wondering is the following:      Are there more websites like the two above?      The answer will probably be yes, so my follow-up question would be:      What are the addresses of these websites? How much information do they give? What region do they cover?      And maybe a followup:      Any tips to find these kind of websites ?  "
1206,How to arrange 2 Prusiks when ascending a rope?,"If I want to ascend a rope with minimal equipment, I use 2 Prusiks: one tied to my harness, and the second one for my foot.  However, there are two ways to arrange the Prusiks on the rope - the foot below the chest, and the opposite way. The first arrangement is most intuitive and described and in all places on the Internet I looked, e.g. here. Also, this site tells that it's the right arrangement:     Notice that the waist Prusik (E) is above the foot Prusik (F)   but doesn't explain why.  When we practiced crevasse self-rescue, I noticed that my friend used the second ""counter-intuitive"" way; he said that he always used it, while I always used the ""normal"" arrangement. I tried the ""opposite"" arrangement, and it worked marginally better: I could ascend a bit higher each time I extended my leg (this might have been by luck). One difference I noticed is that you have to choose the length of the Prusiks carefully (use a long one for the foot) in order to avoid getting stuck. Otherwise, the arrangements seemed pretty similar.  Is there any reason to choose one arrangement or the other? Should my choice be different in different situations? (assuming I have Prusiks of any length)  P.S. I am not talking specifically about crevasse rescue. "
1207,What are good items to leave in a geocache?,"I started geocaching roughly a month ago and it's really fun activity to get into.  I had a few questions (though one was answered already here > What should be carried in a standard Geocaching bag?) but my main question is typically for the UK due to people nature here, though all ideas are welcome.  So far we've a small geocaching kit consisting of pens, extra paper and lunch bag style plastic bags to help protect damp logbooks (of which thus far we have found many). Sometimes we pick up a few small items that we add in - so far we haven't taken any items out of a cache - these were mostly small toys, coins, etc. This is commonly what we find in caches as well.  Most caches we find currently are small (excluding micro) with the odd regular. And per item we would look to pay £3 or less, as we can find 6-7 caches per day out, but price does not necessarily constitute value to an outdoorsman. I would reserve pricier items for harder caches (4-5) but we are currently only finding 1-3 rated caches.  I am loathe to leave things like matches or fire starters or other useful outdoor tools such as that due to idiots who might abuse them. Though once or twice I've seen a compass in the caches and think these are a good idea. Caches should be, I believe, useful outdoors items, but to avoid caches being filled with toys and money, and wanting to overall improve the quality of my local caches:  What are considered good items to leave in a geocache? What items should be avoided? "
1208,What are the most common stinging plants to be aware of in North America?,"What are the most common plants that can cause rashes when touched in North America?  What are the most important ones to be aware of and avoid?  Before coming to the US I was only familiar with the nettle.  I've heard about poison ivy, but I had no idea what it looked like, how common it was, or how bad a sting could be.  Since then I learned to identify poison ivy and poison sumac and avoided them, but I got stung by something which was neither of the two (the severity of the sting was comparable to the nettle).  So, from a practical point of view, which stinging plants should one be aware of when hiking in North America? "
1209,Are self-inflatable sleeping pads more slippery than other mats?,"I was camping recently and someone was complaining that they were finding it hard to sleep, as their new self inflating mat was much more slippery than their old foam one.  Is this a real effect, and why does it occur?  Is it a general feature of self-inflating mats vs foam, the particular design, a factor of age, or are they just imagining things?  To be fair we were camped on a fair slope, but no one else had this problem (or at least didn't complain about it). "
1210,How to use all the fuel in a bottle with a MSR Whisperlite Internationale?,"I make heavy use of my MSR Whisperlite Internationale, the version from 2010 or so.    Virtually always I use unleaded gasoline in the small 11 fl oz (325 mL) bottle. I carry a larger bottle for carrying more fuel, but I find using the small bottle in camp is easiest.  The problem is once the level of the fuel in the bottle below 1/4, I can't get the stove to stay lit, regardless of how many times I pump it.   I've noticed that at this low level, if the bottle was sitting upright, the fuel tube and filter are sitting above level of the fuel. Of course I use my fuel bottle lying on its side.  Its quite annoying because there's always a decent portion of fuel I can't burn in the bottle.  I do perform regular maintenance on my stove, though I haven't had to replace any components in a year or so.   Does anyone have any tricks for using the remaining fuel in the bottle? Am I doing something wrong? "
1211,"If injured and lost, what are your biggest priorities for survival?","Let's imagine for a moment that you're solo hiking somewhere you've never been before and take a fall off the edge of a trail, injure yourself (to the point of limited mobility), and become entirely disoriented.  Obviously, this is a scenario that could be avoided with proper planning and better practices. The best solutions would have been preemptive. Regardless, this scenario is where my question is to be asked from.  You're alone, injured with limited mobility, and lost. Assuming a normal load out (normal clothing, some water, a knife, etc.), what do you do to survive and make it back to a safe place? What are your priorities, and what is your course of action? "
1212,City tickets as exchange objects?,"Is it good idea to use city tickets for public transport (laminated or in string bags) as exchange objects or traveller objects (krets)? Are such items welcomed by the geocachers community?  From the one side, simply throwing validated tickets into caches in the same city is not welcomed, because such 'items' are considered thrash. But from the other side, the ticket from the other city (or the other country) can be welcomed by collectors, and when it is secured from wet (lamination etc.) it can look quite nice in the cache.   "
1213,How to be safe on lake and river ice and what should I do when I fall through?,"It's late October and in cold, northern hemisphere climates, winter has arrived, and moderate northern hemisphere climates will follow soon. In my area, small lakes are already frozen and people have been ice-skating already. The rivers and large lakes will freeze soon, too.  Fresh, blank ice can be amazing for ice-skating, ice-biking or just walking on the ice. Snow-covered ice is often passed through when skiing or snow-mobiling. But ice can be quite dangerous, certainly in the beginning of the season.   From a safety point of view, what should one always carry along when crossing lake and river ice? What should I do when I fall through such ice?   My question covers all, from small ponds to long rivers to big (>100 km²) lakes. "
1214,Tips for outdoor during the dark winter?,"The dark winter is approaching on the northern hemisphere. At my latitude (67½°N), the sun sets at 15:00 by now, and a little more than a month away the polar night will start. So far, I'm virtually not doing any outdoor activities between October and February, due to the dark, cold conditions. But I still crave for the mountains!  How can I still enjoy outdoor life when daylight lasts only a few hours?   Some thought:   Headlights, but last only a short time Full moon, particularly with snow-cover, should be quite bright. Bright enough for longer trips? Any other thoughts?  "
1215,What characteristics should I look for in a good torch/flashlight?,"I'm looking to buy a flashlight/torch (or build my own even if that works out cheaper), and am looking to take the following into consideration:   Good battery life (LEDs would probably suit best in this regard) Takes rechargeable batteries of common size (so AA, C, D - some don't seem to) Rugged (when used for hiking / backpacking, you don't want something that might just give out!) Bright (I'd like this thing to be bright enough for night walking - say at least 150-200 lumens.)   Is there anything else I should consider? And would you recommend purchasing one, or building your own in terms of value for money (and considering I'm comfortable with electronics?)  I'm mainly looking to use it for night hiking and night geocaching. "
1216,How do I recognise quicksand and how do I get out if stuck?,"This year, a Danish citizen went missing without a trace in the mountains of northern Sweden. It is not the first time; in total, ten people are registered as missing after venturing into the mountains of the Swedish county of Norrbotten, including two this year (a Polish citizen in May, and a Danish one in August). This Swedish language article describes the story of several of them.  One is the story of two Polish citizens in Sarek National Park, who went missing in the 1990s. One of the less esoteric theories is that they may have disappeared into quicksand. The local Sami inhabitants know about quicksand in the area, as it occasionally kills some of their reindeer. Quicksand might have killed one or more of the missing people — but it is far from certain.  Suppose I am hiking by myself in a remote wilderness. How can I minimise the risks of disappearing into quicksand? Can I somehow recognise quicksand in order to avoid it? If I don't recognise it and do get stuck, what can I do to get out?  Fortunately, the risk is probably very small, isn't it? "
1217,"How can I build a safe, effective igloo?","If I want to build an igloo to keep me warm in a snowy climate, how can I go about this?   What size blocks should I cut? How big should the entrance be? How can I mitigate the risk of the igloo collapsing?  "

1220,Does camping in polar bear country require someone to keep guard during the night?,"Some animals are big and dangerous and, when hungry, may realise that humans contain a pretty decent amount of meat. I've never hiked in such areas, but they do exist.    Photo from Wikipedia, CC-BY-SA 3.0  When on tour in Svalbard (and presumably in other polar bear territory as well), one is required to carry a rifle in order to protect oneself when attacked by a bear.  But what about during the night? Must someone stay awake all night to keep guard in case a polar bear comes for human meat? "
1221,What natural (non-synthetic) fabrics are good for the winter?,"Which natural (non-synthetic) fabrics are good for hiking winter weather?  I know cotton will generally trap moisture and invite hypothermia, while wool is warm but heavy.  What other natural fabrics will work well in winter conditions? "
1222,Trekking Pole Length,"I was recently convinced to buy a pair of trekking poles for backpacking. But how long should they be?  What is the optimal length to adjust my trekking poles, when carrying a heavy pack?  I have tried walking around my living room, and I cannot decide what length is ideal. How much does it matter? Should the poles be different lengths for going up or down hill? Does it depend on how much weight I'm carrying? Does the type of handle matter? "
1223,How do people safely trek in polar bear country?,"For hiking in polar bear country, this answer cites a page that advices to avoid camping under the stars at all times. Yet people do go trekking on Svalbard, and I don't think the density of huts is such that people stay can avoid camping. For example, this company offers a multi-day trek including a night in an expedition tent.  How can those two statements fit together? Does this company take risks? Do they know areas where polar bears don't go? Or is the expedition tent somehow polar-bear proof (sounds unlikely)? In summary, how do people safely engage in multi-day treks in polar bear country?   "
1224,Winter food : Should I change my habits for winter?,Should I change my food habits for my winter activities? Is simply increasing the quantities or choosing food with higher calories enough?  
1225,What lower temperature limit should I look for in sleeping bag for the Appalachian Trail?,"I'm planning on hiking about half of the AT Northbound at the start of May 2013. What sort of temperature ranges can I expect to encounter, and what should I look for in a sleeping bag to best suit these?  My main consideration has to be weight, so the lighter the better. However, I would like to be comfortable at least some of the time but appreciate that lower temperature comfort limits will add weight.   As well as this, I'm conscious that lightweight + warmth = high cost, and bearing in mind I will be on a fairly strict budget I'm reluctant to just drop £300+ on a bag, so are there any specific manufactures that offer the best value for money?  I am from England and know nothing about camping / hiking in North America so any other advice, however general, would be greatly appreciated. "

Is there some room for leeway? "
1228,How to properly wash a snowboard/ski tech jacket?,"I have a 10k mm waterproof jacket from Quiksilver and I was wondering if there is any supposed way I should wash it properly.  I know about Nikwax tech wash and have a bottle of it, but how much should I use of it?  Do I need to prepare or clean the washing machine before (from other detergents and residue) and what setting should I put it on?  Do i need to use 1k spin centrifuge? What sensitivity should I pick, a more harsh like cotton or something more easier like wool? Should I dry hang? "
1229,Inside waterproof coating of backpack has become sticky,"I have a 50-liter backpack which I used very little and that afterwards was kept stored for more than 10 years.   Today I noticed that some parts inside, I think the waterproof coating, has become sticky. This is apparently a common problem (read here and here) due to the breaking down of the urethane coating.  What one can do to remove the stickiness? From what I've read, one should avoid machine washing, and some people solved the problem by rubbing the inside with talc powder. Are there any other solutions?  EDIT: similar question: What is this brown dust/powder inside my old pack? However, in my case the coating looks perfect and is not delaminating; it's just sticky at the touch. "
1230,When is a good time to go hunting for deer antler sheds?,"I have been told that the best time to look for deer antler sheds is during February or March when there is some snow on the ground so it is easy to spot the antlers. I do not have a dog, so I cannot train one to find them. I plan on trying my best to find them come this February, but any tips to maximize my efforts would be great!

In which Europese countries is it legal to hunt small game like rabbits and ducks, without or with an easy to obtain licence?  The best answer would be comparable to this one: Where in Europe is wild camping permitted? "
1232,Are there particular grades that indoor climbers often struggle with,"Somewhat motivated by How to progress in rock climbing after grades v4 / 5.11+? I am curious if anyone has tried to document if there are particular grades that climbers plateau on and need more time to work through. In other words, do many climbers get stuck at V4 an need to work hard to progress and then again at V7, or is it an individual thing that some get stuck at V3, other V4 and some V5? "
1233,What kind of ropes are used for very long sport routes (like Chilam Balam)?,"This is a question that has bugged me for some time. Some very hard sport routes are very, very long. Some examples:   Chilam Balam: 80 m (260 ft) - Video (Adam Ondra) Jumbo Love: 75 m (250 ft) - Video (Ethan Pringle) Change: 55 m (180 ft) - Video (Adam Ondra)   As far as I know, commercially available climbing ropes are max. 80 m (260 ft) long; however, to descend from a 80 m long route, you would need a 160 m long rope! Maybe something less if the route is overhanging, but still much longer that what -as far as i know- is commercially available.   So what kind of ropes are used for these ""super-routes""? Some kind of ""custom"" ropes?  Disclaimer  I know perfectly well (as I've done it myself many times, only on shorter lengths) that it is possible to climb an 80 m route with two 80m ropes (half ropes or twin ropes), then join them together and rappel down for all the 80m. But from the linked videos it is clear that a single rope is being used (see for example Ondra on Chilam Balam). This makes perfect sense, because we are talking about cutting-edge routes, at the limit of modern sport climbing, and carrying two ropes, even if thin half ropes, with all the added weight would probably decrease the performance.     Updates   In this article, it is specified that Chris Sharma used a 80 m, 9.2 mm Sterling Fusion Nano to send Jumbo Love. The route actually tops out on a plateau, as it is clear from Ethan Pringle's video, so you can probably walk down from it. However, what if he couldn't finish the climb and had to get down? I don't think that anyone would climb an 80 m long 9b knowing that the only way out is to finish the route... Similar thread (with no definitive answer) on rockclimbing.com. They point out that Jumbo Love should have one or two intermediate anchors that would allow you to rappel down. But in Ethan Pringle's video you can clearly see that he is carrying no gear at all, so either he was sure he would have topped out (but what if he got hurt?), or the rope was long enough to allow him to descend. Also in Chris Sharma's pictures you can see that he was only carrying one quickdraw with him, not enough for a rappel.  "
1234,Shooting into tree,"A few weeks ago, I strapped a target onto a tree that was about 1.5-2' in diameter to sight my muzzleloader on private property. I fired about a dozen .50 cal bullets into the tree.   In addition to liking firearms and hunting, I also happen to be a so called ""treehugger"". Shooting a tree ain't exactly hugging so my question is, how bad is firing bullets into it? For example, how much damage did I inflict on the tree in the example above? Will the tree die? Will it recover? How many rounds can an average tree take? "
1235,"From the perspective of someone engaging in an outdoor sport, is there any fur that confers an advantage over all synthetic materials?","In the largely indoor sport of oneupswomanship, real fur, especially mink, sable or chinchilla, offers a great advantage; no one wearing a synthetic fabric, however stylish the coat or jacket, is in the running.  This extends to the partially outdoor sports of après-ski and outdoor dining at fashionable ski-resort restaurants.  However, from the purely utilitarian perspective of keeping warm and dry while actively engaged outdoors, is there a fur that outperforms any synthetic material or combination of synthetic materials (i.e., layering) on the market, and if so, which fur and for what sport or activity?  (Ignore considerations of cost; any synthetic on the market will be cheaper than almost any natural fur.)  I remember reading that reindeer hairs are shaped in a way that cause them to trap air extraordinarily well; a garment of reindeer skin is thus an outstanding insulator.  (Anyone: feel free to expand on this in an answer.)    Thus, while I dislike the use of fur merely for display or to signify wealth or status, I am open to information that fur outperform synthetics for prolonged activity (or inactivity such as waiting at a seal hole) in extreme conditions.  Weight and flexibility should be considered as factors as well as insulating properties and water repellancy. Whether modern synthetics and design match fur even in extreme conditions is also of interest; relevant would be what Himalayan climbers and modern Antarctic explorers use.  This question is prompted by an article in The Washington Post on the Canada Lynx.   "
1236,How do you protect yourself against crocodiles when you have no option but to camp on the banks of a croc-infested river?,"I am reading Escape Routes by David Roberts.  This is a collection of 20 articles ranging from a winter ascent in Iceland to the first descent of a river in Ethiopia, the Tekeze, a major tributary of the Blue Nile.  There are a lot of crocodiles on the Tekese, which runs through a deep canyon, 7,000 feet at its deepest.  Roberts and his companions (founders of Mountain Travel Sobek) had to hike down 1,100 feet to get to the place where they could put in their rafts. So it doesn't seem like they could get far away from the river, particularly since they had 8,000 pounds of equipment.  They were making a film for Mungo Park, an online adventure magazine funded by Bill Gates in the mid-1990s.  Roberts talks a good deal about the crocodiles in the river, for example:     On other Ethiopian streams, the guides had had boats bitten by crocs.    Sure enough, by our fifth day, the occasional croc was charging a boat.  Our   response was to throw baseball-sized rocks (which we loaded up every   morning) at the beasts. A week down the river, Bart Henderson drily   mentioned that his boat had just dealt with our first ""four rock   croc"".   But every evening, they had to camp by the river, and they also pulled into the river bank at other times for photography.  Roberts says nothing -- nothing at all -- about how they protected their camp and themselves from the crocs while ashore or getting ashore.   They noticed that there were no habitations along the river, although people lived high up the surrounding cliffs and came down to cultivate the river banks because of lack of rain.   An inhabitant explained that the lack of dwellings beside the river was because of ""the shaking sickness"" -- malaria.  He said his people could live with the crocodiles.  The last few sentences of the article kill the possibility that crocs cannot move fast on land:     The boat floats past a big croc on shore, who looks asleep. Suddenly   the reptile spots the boat and charges towards the camera, running   like a tailback across the stones, plunging into the water and   swimming hard for Steve's offending lens.   My question is:  How does one deal with crocodiles when there is no option but to camp on the shores of a croc infested river?  The article does not give even a hint. "
1237,Where can I find good UVI forecasts?,"I normally use weather.gov and/or weather.com for weather forecasts. Neither provides UVI (or at least I can't find it). Also, I rarely go outdoors, so I don't have an intuitive sense of when I get get away without sunscreen. I hate both sunburns and sunscreen, so I have a dilemma when I do need to go outside for extended periods.  Googling finds a few resources, but they mostly provide a UV max, i.e. at noon. Doesn't help if I'm going out for an extended period in the morning/afternoon.  Are there any good sources of hourly-ish UVI forecasts? Alternately, are there detectors I can buy to estimate how long it will take me to burn? "
1238,Can I theoritcally climb The Mount Erciyes in the summer?,"I recently wanted to climb that mountain because I literally love pushing myself and it looks fun.

1239,Tent in the rain,"I have an MSR Elixir 2 tent bought 5 years ago and used three nights since (a shame I know). In any case, it was used for 4 nights camping in Spain in dry conditions and was an amazing tent.  A few months ago went camping and it started raining. We set up the tent but stayed in a shelter next to our tent until it was time to hit the sack. After I opened the tent, there was quite some water all over our gear. It wasn't a pool but it wasn't something where we would want to spend the night.  The tent is a double wall tent, been stored in dry conditions for the last 4 years of non use.  In any case, my questions are as follows, if someone has any experience with this:  1) Is it possible that this can be caused because of condensation? No one was in the tent since we pitched it until we went back into the tent so somehow it feels odd that the condensation would form in such an amount.  2) The fabric seems to be leaking when I put it under water at home. Is this normal? I live in an apartment and don't have the opportunity to do the hose test, but I took the rain fly into the shower and opened the shower. After a while the fabric started being most on the inside and forming tiny bubbles of water.  3) During the testing I did to the tent, it seems that when I'm pouring water over the tent and the rain fly is touching the pole of the tent, water seems to go through at these spots in large quantities. Is this normal for a tent?   I only owned canvas tents before so unfortunately I have nothing to compare to, but would like to know how you handle these conditions as now I'm afraid to take the tent for my next hike. I emailed the manufacturer but haven't received a reply since August  EDIT: 1st of December 2018  I managed to find a place to set it up on the roof of my building. I watered it with a watering can and used 10 of those. There was still water in the tent (a bit less than the last time but last time it was exposed in the rain) but it seems that all the water comes from the mid column (the tent has 2 main poles and a smaller pole across that holds the rainfly). All the water seemed to have come in one location and was in the middle of the tent. The rest of the tent was perfectly dry.   What could cause this? Could it be that there is something structural to the tent or is it worth just to give it up? I mean, I haven't had a tent like this before and don't know if this is normal to happen in other tents as well.         "
1240,What are quality differences between Fleece?,"I'm currently preparing for 3 weeks of Trekking in March in Nepal (Lukla / Cho La Pass / Everest Base Camp...). One thing my guide told me to bring is a Fleece jacket.  I'm confused by the wide range of prices. What are objective quality metrics for Fleece jackets?  When I looked at them, I saw that the thickness of the product is one difference. Likely, thicker means warmer, but it seems not to be connected directly to the price:   Regatta Thompson Herren Fleece Jacke: 15 EUR; Outdoor-Fleece, 240g, 100% Polyester Patagonia Better Sweater Herren Fleecejacke: 96 EUR; 339g/m² => 449g; 100% Polyester Russell Herren Sweatjacke Full Zip Outdoor Fleece R-870M-0: 15 EUR; 100% Polyester; 320g/m² => 424g Arcteryx Delta RT Fleece: 99 EUR; 100% Polyester; 281g  "
1241,What are those other three holes in the boat's transom?,"The second one from left to right is the only one I'm currently plugging. Is it alright not to close the other three?     The boat hull is MAKO 86 23 feet . The boat is not currently sinking, but every 10 minutes I can hear the bilge pump pumping water (Like a jar of water) outside the boat. This is all new to me. I only know is that the second hole must be plugged before going to the water, but what are the other three for?   It is an outboard , center console and it also has a living well. I never use the living well. It always empty. The one I plugged each time I go into the water is the bilge drain. If not plugged the boat would sink. The other three I believe are called thru hull fittings. The other three I don’t understand the usage of them, I'm also suspecting that water is coming through them into the boat causing the bilge pump work every few minutes "
1242,"Is Salmon caught in the seawater or freshwater? Which is the preferred way, and the most ecological way?","Salmon is an anadromous fish, that means it is born in fresh water, it spends most of its life in the sea and it returns to fresh water to spawn. I was wondering when fishermen fish salmon. I guess they aim for adults (more meat), right? But do they catch adults when they are in seawater or in freshwater (i.e. while climbing up a river to spawn)? Which is the best moment in order to have a better catch? And which is the best moment in order not to endanger the species? "

1244,Rock climbing over edge - What can I put under the rope to protect it?,"I am working on a very fun problem with an overhung roof that induces serious rope drag (Goat Rock Roof @ Castle Rock if you know it). I am very nervous about training this beta intensive problem given how easy it is to cut a rope on an edge. What techniques are normally used to protect edges? I've tried placing shirts, but they are useless. What I need is a placeable plastic or metal piece that will stay on the edge and allow the rope to smoothly pass over it.'  I need a solution for the dynamic climbing line, not the anchor line. Is there anything that will stay on the rock while a rope goes over it?  Note that this route is top rope only:   "
1245,What do you call the bags which help organize items inside a backpack?,"I'm a beginner to hiking. Last time, I had trouble easily accessing my stuff. Putting things inside the pack was also taking nearly an hour of my time.  The problem is that I have to empty the backpack at night and bring out everything to access something at the bottom. In the morning, I have to put everything back in the bag.  There are some things which won't be used frequently, like my clothes. I have to fold them every time.  The solution I see, is to use some small plastic bags like in this video.  What is the name of those bags and where can I buy them? "

1248,"What easy 6,500m peaks would serve as easy qualifiers for Everest?","So there's been talk of this for a while, but it seems like the Nepalese government is finally committing and closing Everest to inexperienced climbers. So from now on, as a safety measure, if you want to climb Everest, you will be required to prove you have summitted at least one mountain higher than 6,500m in elevation. This is meant to alleviate much of the traffic on the mountain, particularly the bucket-listers who have money, but no climbing experience and pay some guiding outfit to basically hold their hand all the way up to the top, if not carry them up.  My first thought after reading this news was, ""So which mountain is going to turn into the qualifier mountain that people climb first so they can go ahead and do Everest anyways?""   Which mountain is the most likely candidate for guiding companies to use as and easy qualifier for their clients to summit so that the Nepalese government will let them climb Everest? Are they likely to just pick a mountain close to Everest? Or are we going to see an spike in mountain tourism to South America?

1249,Advice for waterproof winter jacket for city and cycling,I'm looking for a winter jacket that is waterproof and breathable. The main use is as a main jacket during the winter for going around so needs to be warm and as a waterproof shield for short cycling (&lt; 5km) possibly under the rain.  Hardshell are waterproof but likely not warm for walking around. What about 3in1 jacket like Northface Triclimate? Or some paramo jacket?  I've never had such a jacket before so I need some advice.

1252,Similar knots to be avoided,"There are knots that have similar sort of a structure or a look-alike looping which can easily confuse someone who is not seasoned in knots and safety associated with them.  As a thumb rule, beginners are always advised to get their knots inspected by a veteran before they bank their safety upon it.  But, yet, Can we list out knots that stand a chance to jeopardize the safety due to a minor mistake? Well, a minor mistake in any knot puts the safety into a jeopardy, but still.  What are similar-looking knots which are not an alternative to each-other?  For example, a Butterfly knot and a False butterfly. Or a Reef knot and a Granny knot or a Grief knot. "

1257,Running shoes for asphalt + winter conditions?,"What is the good choice for the running shoes for winter conditions in city (mostly running on asphalt)? When the snow is shoveld, normal running shoes would be no problem, but when the snow falling, they are soaking immediately and they have poor adhesion.  So, I was thinking about running in light trekking shoes with elastic soles, because of good adhesion and light membrane. But, aren't such shoes too overloading for ankles? "
1258,Performance of fur garments?," How does the performance of genuine fur garments, as might have been used traditionally, compare to that of down and modern synthetics?  (Insulating power (wet and dry), water repellency, and any other quantifiable comparisons.) What types of furs were used historically, by whom, and for what applications?  What furs are still used today?   Ideally I would like to see actual data and sources for the comparisons, not merely inferences and anecdotes.  "
1259,"What is the true risk of suffocation from different combustion sources in a tent? (CO2, CO)","Aside from risk of fire (which for this question we will assume has been fully mitigated) what is the real risk of suffocation if one were to use a stove, lantern, or candle lantern in a tent?  There have been some reports of death from this (whether it be from CO2 or CO), but others have used such products in their tents without issue.    What is the relative CO and CO2 output of various products? How much air circulation does one need to keep it ""ventilated"" enough?  "
1260,Applications of a slip knot in climbing?,"I'm joining a rock climbing club that requires an evaluation test in order to become a member. (I think this is a great idea.) They have a detailed handout listing exactly what you need to know for the test, including a bunch of knots. Most of them I was familiar with, but one knot they listed was the slip knot, which I've never used for climbing. Googling turns up this page, which says     You might use it to sling a horn (""chicken head"") of rock for example.   What would be the right way to do this? After you tie the knot, pulling on one strand (call it strand 1) tends to tighten the loop, but the other strand (2) won't support tension. Presumably you need to do something else to make it safe. Do you tie a stopper knot in strand 1? Tie the two strands into a butterfly? I'm assuming that in this application you wouldn't have tension on either strand yet, and you may only have access to one end.  Is the slip knot the best knot for this purpose? Are there other rock-climbing applications of the slip knot? "
1261,Dealing with large runouts during sport climbing,"I was doing a sport climb recently where there was a pretty good distance between bolts, resulting in long rope runouts. Falling before the next bolt could easily cause a person to deck on a ledge. Luckily, no one fell at this point, but it was very precarious.   My question is: What are some techniques, as a belayer or climber, can you do to minimize risk of injury in a fall during long runouts? For example, if the  belayer sees the climber falling, should they run back to take up slack quickly? I've also heard of the belayer standing on high ground so they could drop at the same time as the climber to take up slack.  Assume this is a sport (not mixed) route and no additional protection can be placed.  "

1263,What foods are unsafe to cook over an open fire?,"My friends and I went camping this weekend and I bought a package of Johnsonville brats to cook over the fire. Many a person said that one should 'never bring raw brats to cook over a campfire', their rationale being that raw brats are dangerous to eat because of the possibility of bacteria and/or undercooked meat, but moreso than other types of raw meat.  Specifically, if the brats are fully cooked (I checked, they were!), is there inherently more danger in brats vs other raw meats? Is it a 'pork thing'?  But more generally: assume that no external factors would make the food in question unsafe to eat (such as hot dogs being left out of a cooler - becoming a haven for bacteria, or woods that put off toxic smoke) - are there any foods that are simply not a good idea to cook over an open fire? "
1264,Camping on a uninhabited island in Sweden's skärgård near Gothenburg,"The Swedish skärgård located just west of Gothenburg is a beautiful place. I have travelled there a couple of times, taking the bus-ferries around between the islands.  There are quite a lot of uninhabited islands, with some grass and rocks, and sometimes a few animals. I was thinking of the possibility of renting a boat and go tenting (camping) on one of these uninhabited islands.  What should I be aware of if I plan to go camping on one of the uninhabited islands?  With aware I mean things that might be a problem which is not clearly obvious, that could be:   Is it legal? (according to the Swedish right to access rules, I would assume yes but there might be some restrictions that I am not aware of.) Are there some special equipment that are would be good to bring? Non-obvious dangers (desolate island, perhaps the tides may be a problem?)     (Another link to Allemandsrätten for those that might be curious.) "
1265,Is Paradoxical Undressing a stage beyond Hypothermia?,"We all have discussed and read Hypothermia quite a lot of times and are aware of general concepts about it. What made me wonder the most was an incident about a mountaineer on Mt. Everest. With the sort of wisdom I have, I still can't see why he is still alive (No offense, that is a great thing and I am awestruck as well as very happy for him) and how he made it.  That guy was stranded, it was a team of two if I got the whole documentary right. And they did summit and this fellow here, got stranded and had a Bivouac between Camp III and Camp IV. Later in the morning he was found undressing himself and standing at a cliff which seems like he is totally out of his mind. He was later rescued by a team who gave up on the summit attempt and chose to bring him down.  Looking at the situation, He should have died of the Hypothermia. Is Paradoxical Undressing a later stage of Hypothermia? Because the actions/symptoms speak absolutely otherwise.  Have anybody more study or information about this stuff? Yes, I can simply browse for it, but there is too much sci-stuff and physiology stuff said about it, and that didn't help much.  How can it be treated? Does the same treatment as Hypothermia helps to treat this thing? "
1266,"What batteries would make sense to power 12v devices (e.g. blankets, lights) for camping?","I have looked into a number of solutions to power 12v devices:   Goal Zero battery packs (too expensive? $300+) 12v sealed lead acid battery with adapter (too dangerous? impractical to recharge? ≈$50) Anker Astro Pro2 20000mAh (would this even work? ≈$80)   I have a Goal Zero solar panel which ideally I could use to cycle the charging of my power source(s) during the daylight hours. One of my use cases might be heating a large family tent and I don't really want to use propane as an energy source. Are there alternative (low power draw) heating solutions that might work for this use case?  Assumptions:   I'm already bringing at least one fully charged Sherpa 50 power pack as I use it for several other things as well. So, I'm kind of trying to maximize its utility during the trip. In fact assume any battery I bring will be fully (solar) charged prior to the trip and will (hopefully) only need a partial trickle charge during the sunlit hours. An electric blanket adds insulation on its own even without supplying power. An electric blanket has an automatic shut off after 30 min, and moreover will only be used intermittently during the night. I don't intend to draw 8 solid hours of power for this blanket each night.   Additional devices I'm considering running on these batteries:   Tablets Phones Speakers Lights Frying Pan Electric blankets Air mattress pump Anything else?   Extra credit implied question:   If one were to go all in with solar powered camping; what would the ideal core of that system look like?... and why?  "
1267,What happens if I inadvertently set off a personal locator beacon?,"I'm considering buying a personal locator beacon.  As I understand it they should only be activated in case of dire emergency.

Can anyone advise me? "
1269,How to get weather forecasts at Yellowstone?,"We'll be camping at Yellowstone for a week.  What solutions are there to get weather forecasts?  I am aware of:   NOAA weather radio: would prefer to avoid if there's anything better because it's bulky and costly (for something that's only used this once and only works in the US) Smartphone + data plan: do not have a smartphone Sign up for text message alerts: weather.com had a service, but despite the still existing webpage it appears to be discontinued (no command works and calling support plays a message saying that subscriptions are discontinued).   Are there other simple solutions that I may have missed?  My cell phone does have a standard FM receiver built in. "
1270,Is it possible to 'moisture trap' from trees while thru-hiking?,"I'm toying with the idea of collecting water from tree leaf transpiration, while hiking:    Obviously, vegetation with larger leaf surface area (and certain types) would be better than others.  But is it useless to try and collect water from trees during the night? Do trees not transpire as near as much during the night as the day - or maybe not at all?  Obviously if you are thru-hiking, daytime tree water collecting is simply not possible (as a principal water source at least), it could only possibly be done at night time.  So how practical might this idea be? Perhaps it is more practical in certain climates but not others? "
1271,Which color of these Swim Goggles would be easiest to spot in/ on warm coastal ocean water?,"Which color of these Swim Goggles would be easiest to spot in/ on warm coastal ocean water?    Aqua Sphere Kayenne Swim Goggles   PS: This is not a shopping question (I'm already planning to buy, just need Color Contrast and visibility question for Coastal Ocean water - from people who understand such waters).   One of the reasons I posted the following question, was that a large part of beginners lesson (still learning) was hampered by ""sand particles"" that got lodged in my eyes, and the water burning/ aggravating the eyes and my patience.   Any swim goggles that may be beneficial for a surfer?    The side benefit is I could use these for Pool Swimming, Open water swim lessons, duck diving lessons, and various other water sports &amp; related activities, if I ever need to/ want to.   I do understand that these are not a permanent solution for a surfer or wind surfer or major water sports, but I'd rather pick the one that has a better visibility if/ when ever they're lost in ocean (or non ocean) water.   What color(s) would be easiest to spot in warm coastal waters?  "
1272,What's the purpose of the huge amount of stone piles on the trails in Gran Canaria,"I went for a few hikes in Gran Canaria. The trails were perfectly signposted and everything. My beautiful experience was a little bit disturbed by the sheer amount of stone piles everywhere. You couldn't walk anywhere without seeing 5 - 15 of these piles! This made me angry (bad for the ecosystem and a violation of the leave-no-trace concept) and wonder why people do this? What is the purpose of them?     Don't get me wrong, even if the answer is rather emotional it is a welcome response. So answers like ""they do it just for fun"" or ""they do it for Cthulhu"" are perfectly valid.   Edit for clarification:  I know that people often use stone-piles instead of wooden signposts etc. to mark the trail and that's not a problem at all. However, signpost-stone-piles are pretty rare. They appear here and there where you have to turn or take a specific direction. You barely see one per km. That's not what my question is about! Check out the picture. The sheer amount of them is ridiculous! In this mass they obviously don't serve the purpose to just mark the right way to go. You see at least 30 of them per km. "
1273,Sources of Nubuk (Gore-Tex lined) Leather Conditioner,I have a pair of Lowa Tibet Pro GTX (Nubuk leather and Gore-Tex Lined) and am wondering what conditioning creme I should use besides the stuff that Lowa sells as I generally like to buy from dedicated care companies such as Nikwax.  This is what I am thinking of currently purchasing to take care of my boots:   To clean boots before water proofing - Nikwax Footwear Cleaning Gel Waterproofing - Nikwax Nubuk &amp; Suede Proof Conditioning - ?????   Nikwax has the Conditioner for Leather here but it does not say anything about using on Nubuk leather.  What I am looking for:   A Nubuk Leather Conditioner without beeswax as my boots are Gore-Tex lined   Any suggestions would be great.  Thankyou  UPDATE  I emailed Nikwax about their Conditioner for Leather product and got this response:     Many thanks for your enquiry.   We do not have a conditioner specifically for the use on Nubuck and Suede. Our Conditioner for Leather is for the use on smooth leather and will smooth out the appearance of nubuck and suede which is why it is not recommended for that use. It will condition nubuck and suede but it will change the cosmetic appearance.   So will need advice on another brand if anyone is in on the 'know-how' 
1274,When does a Rope become a Line?,As pointed out in a comment by cobaltduck in the question What type of rope to use for the mainsheet of sunfish? the proper name for rope when used on a boat is line.  If I go to the store and buy a length of rope and put it on my boat it is now a line.    When does it become a line instead of a rope?    When it becomes attached to the boat. When I took a sailing class and learned better.  When I buy it and it does not belong to the store any longer. Or ...  
1275,How can I prevent a fiberglass crack in my sailboat from getting worse?,"There is a crack about 12 inches (30cm) long on the edge of my Sunfish sailboat.  I am not sure if the crack is all the way through the fiberglass, or just the gel coat.  It is on the corner between the side of and the bottom of the boat.  When I push on it I can hear a little noise that could be glass fibers moving around.  I suspect the fiberglass is at least partially compromised.  Googling around I find people who are using lots of products on fiberglass with super glue and gorilla glue, often considered but maybe not the best choice.  Pending a proper fiberglass patch with a new gel coat application, is there anything I can use to fill and join the crack, that will work well and not create a problem later?   I am looking for a solution between ducktape and a full fiberglass patch as described in these two questions How to fix a leak in a fibreglass kayak? &amp; I put a big gouge in the bow of my canoe going across rocks. How can I fix it?  Image of Sunfish, upside down showing crack   "
1276,How can I capture some really small no-seeums to find out what is plaguing me?,"In 2014 I moved to Alaska. After a few days there I started feeling something crawling and flying around my head and neck area.  At first I thought I was imagining things because it would only happen periodically and I couldn't see anything flying.   After several months, they got worse and they started crawling/flying on and around my face getting into my eyes. After a year the problem was so bad that I have to keep my eyes covered with sealed goggles and I sleep with a head net to keep them off my face and eyes. No matter where I go I have this problem, indoor, outdoors, home, work, shopping, driving.  These flying creatures are extremely small and very difficult for anyone to see unless the light hits them just right.  Then they appear the size of dust particles and can be hard to differentiate from dust until you notice their pattern of flight. They seem to be attracted only to me, They don't bother my wife and son even when they stand right next to me.   I tried many products, supplements and changed soaps, deodorants, etc., but nothing slows them down.  My doctor thinks I 'm experiencing phantom crawling sensations or psychological issues, but I assured him that is not the problem.    My doctor wants me to catch a  specimen to show him but I don't know how to catch what I can barely see.  These are much smaller than gnats I'm used to.  Does anyone know what these things are?  And why are they attracted to me?  How can I catch a few so my doctor has something to work with? "
1277,Headlamp and flies,"Post-monsoon we have lots of flies and insects in the forests. I was hiking up an easy trail last weekend. It got dark and I still had a couple of hours of walking distance to cover.  With no light around, flies tend to hover over my head and in front of my face all the time as I was a bit sweaty and obviously due to the headlamp, which is very very irritating. Most of them were typically attracted by the light.  How do you deal with this?  Closely related: How to deal with little flies flying into the eyes?  "
1278,What is the life expectancy of an avalanche airbag backpack?,"I am evaluating the acquisition of a backpack with an avalanche airbag. I have a good overview of the different technologies and of the products on the market.   However, I find no information from users about the typical life expectancy of such bag. Can I expect to buy a product with a similar life time as for normal backpack (with similar use)? Are some technologies or brands known to have shorter life expectancy?   I of course exclude the fact that the gas cartridge must be exchanged regularly and the case, when the airbag is triggered for a real avalanche.  "
1279,Under what conditions can a guide be highly confident of protecting clients against brown bears without using firearms?,"A friend travelled to Alaska last summer, and took several guided trips in areas with large brown bear populations.  In each case, according to his report, the guides were armed only with bear spray.  On one of the trips, to Admiralty Island, my friend said that the guides were rangers. (He did not say about the other trips.)  The guiding companies or, in the case of Admiralty Island, the Park Service, must be confident that they can protect their clients  with bear spray alone.  A client mauled by a brown bear on a guided trip under the explicit protection of the company or the Park Service would make for very bad publicity.  Tourism is important to the economy of Southeast Alaska.  See KTOO Public Media, Report shows economic impact of tourism in Southeast.  What are the reasons for their confidence? I can think of several possible reasons or combinations of reasons:  (1) The tourists are taken to places where brown bears have become acclimated to people. This doesn't mean that the bears are tame; they are still wild and dangerous. However, they see people as a normal, harmless part of their environment.  (2) Bears are much more wary about a group of people -- say 4 to 8 people -- than one or two hikers, and the guides keep the people together.  (3) People don't smell yummy. They smell somewhere between yecch and meh  (4) The tourists are taken to places where the bears have an abundance of food.  (5) The bears do not associate people with food.   In other words, are the guides relying on managing the pre-encounter situations to prevent encounters ?  Another possibility:  (1) There is a backup guide/ranger with a gun out of sight of the tourists.  An answer specific to protecting tourists on guided tours in Alaska would be ideal.  A more general answer about protecting clients who are on a guided tour against brown bears would also be useful.     "
1280,Understanding a ski resort weather report,"I am planning to learn snowboarding for the first time and would like to take some classes. I am trying to plan a visit to a ski resort and for that I am looking at the weather report shown below and would like help understanding it.   What does the Mountain, Valley and the height mentioned mean? What does the ""Fresh snow"" (in centimes?) mean? What amount of fresh snow is ideal and is it better if it has snowed the day before but not on the day of snowboarding? What does the rainfall(in liters?) mean?

1282,"Are coasteering routes graded, or does one have to rely on a qualitative description of the difficulties of a route?","What, you may ask, is coasteering?  Does saying it is similar to kloofing help? Thought not.  Many sites describe coasteering; here is a brief description exerpted from outsideonline.com, What Is Coasteering, and Where Can I Do It?     Coasteering is a combination of rock climbing, swimming, and optional   cliff jumping. As you’ve probably guessed from the term, this sport,   which got its start in Wales, takes place on a coastline. It has   allure for those looking for an adrenaline rush—and some exercise—in a   beautiful environment.       One of the greatest things about coasteering is that almost everybody   can do it. Andy Middleton, founder of the TYF Group, which facilitates   outdoor adventures in southwest Wales, says that “anyone who’s capable   of walking the coast would be OK to coasteer. We introduced our kids   to it not long after they’d learned to walk.” His organization has   hosted coasteering excursions for people well into their seventies.   This sounds thrilling, but a coasteering experience that would be fine for a child soon after it has learned to walk, or a person in their seventies, however athletic and proficient, probably doesn't offer much of a challenge to an experienced coasteerer (if this is a word) in her prime.  And vice versa: a route that would challenge an experienced coasteerer is probably no place for a beginner.   I have searched Are there grades in coasteering, and the few hits I got were about training coasteering guides, such as this one.  Hence my question: Is there a grading system, even an embryonic grading system, for this sport, similar (but perhaps more complicated) to the grading system for climbing?  Or not, for reasons of the newness of the sport or the nature of the sport?  Or would someone thinking about trying a route have to rely on a qualitative description of the route?  My thanks to @gerrit for raising this in Chat.  He declined to post a question.  As for kloofing, it seems to be canyoneering with a South African accent.         "
1283,What route does the E1 European Long Distance Path take through Børgefjell National Park?,"Wikipedia notes that the E1 is marked from Okstindan to Børgefjell National Park, but is ambiguous about the national park itself.  Indeed, Norgeskart has a route northward from the park boundary (which at this point is at a lake).  Wikipedia goes on to describe the route south of Børgefjell National Park.  What is the route for the E1 through Børgefjell National Park itself?  Does it follow Grensesømmen and/or Nordlandsruta in this area?  And where do those routes go, then?   As far as I know, there are no marked trails at all in Børgefjell, but a route suggestion can still be useful planning information.  This E1 Hiking Tours website does not list the route in Norway and Sweden at all.  This old forum post (Google Cache) describes it starting north of Børgefjell only.  "

1286,How to land when jumping off a bouldering problem to minimize injury potential?,"A recent question made me wonder: A while ago, there was a nice route in the local bouldering gym with a rather high crux. The repeated jumping-off lead to minor knee pain for a few days. Now, there is a new interesting route with no down-climbing options from the top (which means that jumping off in a somewhat controlled way is neccessary).  How do you best land when jumping off a bouldering route? How to minmize negative effects on joints such as the knee? "
1287,How many tea light candles are needed to equal the heat output of a person?,"A recent answer said:     In an emergency a tea light candle carefully set on/in a disposable pie tin can heat a 4 season tent enough to aid the drying process - just be sure to isolate, ventalate, and insulate the flame properly! -- (tent model, size, wind, temp, and humidity will all change effectiveness)   A tea light does not have a lot of fuel, and if you consider food that a person eats as fuel, it would seem that a person burns a lot more fuel then a tea light. By extension if you have a person and tea light in the same enclosed area it would seem that the majority of heat being generated would come from the person. Keep in mind that both the person and the candle are combing (burning) Carbon and Oxygen, both include a supply of Carbon, but require Oxygen to be replenished from the environment.    I googled around a bit, and did not find an authoritative answer, but it seems like most hits are listing a resting human body as 100 watts of energy and tea light as 30 watts of energy. I have personally used a 60 watt incandescent light bulb as a heat source, and in a small area it is significant. It does not require ventilation, but is a fire hazard.   To answer the question: Can a tea light candle safely generate useful amounts of heat? I think there are couple of points that need to be addressed.   What is the heat/energy output of a person? What is the heat/energy output of a tea light? Do both consume similar amounts of Oxygen for the amount of heat/energy given? If we assume a two person tent provides sufficient gas exchange for two people, can an equivalent number of tea light candles provide the same heat/energy without additional ventilation?   "
1288,Finding out if a road is paved or not,"Is there a good way or method of finding unpaved roads? Any map, where I can tell which road is asphalted, and which isn't?  I have looked at wikiloc, and there are some trails for my country listed (Austria), but I was wondering if there is a way to ""filter"" for such roads in google maps, google earth or something else?  In most countries finding off road roads is just a matter of driving around, but I am located in Austria, and it seems here there are less such roads.  "
1289,What features to look for in a small snowshoe for getting up and down a long driveway and around the yard during what may be a snowy winter?,"I have old snowshoes which were fine for hiking in TGO when I was younger, but they are too large now for comfortable walking in TLO (The Little Outdoors), by which I mean walking up and down an unplowed 300 foot driveway and stomping down snow to make a firm surface for birdseed to supplement the birdfeeders. We expect a snowy winter here, which means a lot of trips down to my car at the bottom of the driveway and up with mail, groceries and other stuff.  I also want the snowshoes to be very easy to put on and take off.   What features should I look for in a snowshoe that is adequate for the tasks described above?  I am 5'9"", weigh 135 pounds and am unusually strong for my age, which I am not going to tell you. However, I am not strong enough to enjoy postholing down a long driveway or to stomp down the driveway comfortably in my old 30 inch long Sherpa snowshoes, which are a pain to put on.    The logical question is ""why not get the driveway plowed?""  It may come to that, but I would prefer not to, mainly because I do not want to drive down and up a steep, narrow, icy driveway with a 15 foot drop on one side and because, well, because.  Also, a plow really messes up a gravel driveway.  Addendum to make Q more TGO-ish:  Such a snowshoe would be useful for hiking on snowy trails for people who do not want to manipulate (pedipulate?)  large snowshoes.  I'd probably use them to take short hikes in Great Falls National Park or on the trails at Scott's Run and Difficult Run.  "
1290,"When should I report a potentially injured-looking animal to authorities in a large, monitored, wildlife area?","We prefer watching animals from a distance, to try and cause them the least disruption. Every so often I've seen an animal in a distant part of a large area that doesn't appear to feel right. For instance, it may be limping a little bit, or missing an area of fur, which could indicate injury. Some animals that fight with each other, especially during mating season, can cause great harm, which is often obvious. Other times the damage is less obvious. Many times it's just natural changes that are part of being a wild animal.    Of course if we saw something drastic, like bleeding, crying, having trouble standing or running, or being picked on by other animals, I'd immediately report it.   I'm more confused if I feel that something doesn't seem right but am not sure. I'm particularly sensitive to animals, and can worry more than necessary. I've left places wishing I'd spoken up, but have just assumed that the rangers will see what I saw as they tend to their inhabitants.   If I don't have real evidence that an animal's in trouble, should I just leave it alone and assume the park rangers will handle it? Is it more helpful to at least report it, even if I might be over-reacting?   For this question, I'll focus on animals that permanently reside in an area which is fully-staffed with people who closely monitor them. There are many of those places world-wide. If that's too broad, I could use an example such as America's National Park System, where a  standardized strict animal care system is in place.  "
1291,Given limited space and weight what should I carry to get a fire going with damp wood?,"Assuming firewood can be found, but it's likely to be damp, how can I best be prepared for getting a fire going? This is for a light hiking situation, so I'm not going to carry a sack full of kindling, but am prepared to carry a fairly generous supply of tinder/firelighters/equipment. We can assume that there's deadwood (standing and fallen)  and green wood but there's been some recent rain.  Related:    How to light a fire with wet firewood? is mainly about car-camping and pre-split wood. Are there any specific techniques that should be used when starting a fire in the rain? is closer but assumes that you've got matches and little else, while I'm interested in preparing.  "
1292,How do breathable fabrics like Gore-tex and DWR (Durable Water Repellent) work?,"Gore-tex, and other waterproof breathable fabrics are often coated with a durable water repellent (DWR) finish that helps prevent the fabric from wetting out. It is not uncommon to hear people complain that their rain jacket has wet out and is now leaking. While obviously if the fabric is so worn it is compromised, or if the seams are not properly sealed, a rain jacket will leak, but what if the jacket is in relatively good shape by the DWR is compromised.  In the absence of a DWR and the presence of dirt, oil and other contaminants on the outer layer, does a Gore-tex jacket become more permeable to outside water seeping in or does it become more like a non-breathable waterproof fabric? In other words, in the absence of a DWR finish, if I prevent overheating and sweating and ventilate the jacket to mitigate the effects of perspiration, will it still keep me dry? "
1293,"When using a compass, why not follow a degree mark without rotation?","Instead of taking a bearing the ""official"" way, why not just see what degree mark corresponds to on the direction I want to go (in real life or on a map), and follow that degree mark? That is, why do I need to go through aligning edge of compass, rotating the bezel to align the meridian lines, rotating body so compass needle aligns with orienteering arrow?  Clarification: Assume point B is exactly NW of point A. If I want to go from point A to point B on a map, I'd be tempted to do as follows: Orient map so magnetic north on map corresponds to north on compass (needle), then see where point B is in relation to point A (at compass bearing 315). Then, I'd pick a landmark in that direction, head to it, and then repeat. My point is at no point in this process did I need a compass with a baseplate or travel arrow and I never needed to rotate my bezel to align to meridian lines, etc. So I'm stumped about why I need to go through all of those steps. I do fully understand that those may be good skills to have for other more complex needs down the road... just wondering if I'm missing something in my simple approach to issue at hand. "
1294,Trekking with a donkey,I've just seen a documentary in which a guy trekks through some rugged terrain while he has his cargo on a donkey. It's a pretty cool and versatile animal overall.  What are some pros and cons of trekking with a donkey? The obvious disadvantage is having to keep a donkey (unless you can rent one some places) but are there any other? E.g. can they eat brush along the way or would you need to bring food for it?

1296,Should I travel through freezing areas with hot or cold water in my RV tank?,"This question is specific to the hot water tank in an RV.  In my case it is 6 gallons, propane heated and insulated with the only exterior contact the access panel, as seen in most standard RV's in the US.  Hard as it is to believe hot water can actually freeze faster than cold water. How it happens is not fully understood, but undeniable it does happen. See related posts on physics.stackexchange What is the status of Mpemba effect investigations? &amp; Hot water freezing faster than cold water     Hot water can in fact freeze faster than cold water for a wide range of experimental conditions.  This phenomenon is extremely counterintuitive, and surprising even to most scientists, but it is in fact real.    Source  The RV is currently winterized and located outside in temperatures that are freezing and below. I am leaving from a frozen area, traveling hundreds of miles through freezing areas, and arriving in a warm area (Florida USA).  I must flush the fresh water system and top off before departure.  Which means my hot water tank will be full.  I can either leave it unheated with cold tap water (from my home, temp unknown but not ice) OR I can start the water heater and bring it up to temp before leaving.    All the plumbing and the fresh water holding tank are inside the RV. We will be stopping occasionally and heating the inside of the RV, so no concerns about the pipes or fresh water tank.   Driving with propane heating on (air or water) is possibly illegal and definitely unsafe.   Should I travel through freezing areas with hot or cold water in my RV hot water tank? "
1297,How serious is bear safety in the sub-polar Ural / Komi Republic / Yugyd Va?,"In Norway, Sweden, and Finland, there are resident bears, but they rarely go near people, nobody practices the kind of bear safety that is necessary in parts of North America, and this does not lead to problems.  The only problems I've heard about involved people with dogs, often while hunting.  How is the situation in the Virgin Komi Forests World Heritage Site, including the Yugyd Va (Clear Water) National Park?  Do I nead to hang my food and/or use bear boxes, or can I act like I'd do in northwestern Europe? "
1298,Why is doubling up hearing protection when shooting not more effective?,"I keep looking for better ways of protecting my hearing when shooting, and it looks like doubling up (where you wear both plugs and muffs) is recommended for indoor shooting (centerfire gunshots range from 160-170 decibels).  However, if you look at the OSHA recommendations, one will notice that they say that doing so only adds,     Note: 5 dB can be added to the NRR of the most protective device when using both earplugs and muffs.   Given that earplugs often have a NRR of 32 decibels and muffs 22-28 decibels, why is doubling up not more effective?  Wouldn't the noise be reduced by 22 decibels by the muffs and then 32 by the plugs instead of just 5 more decibels? "
1299,Different woods and how they burn/what if we are unsure of the wood?,"I'm keen on learning more about different woods and how they burn in particular in the context of bushcraft. There is a lot of existing literature on all the different woods out there. I started to read up on the subject and quickly found that it's rather daunting. What I was able to gather was: There are so many wood types and there is a lot of variability in how they burn.  (for example: Hazel burns well, but Alder tends not to burn so well, and it just goes on and on)  In good time, perhaps I will make sense of it all. In the mean time, I hope that I can find some other general rules to follow until I have the proper experience to know for myself. I'm familiar with the hardwood/softwood dichotomy, but I'm hoping there is more to it.  Question  Are there any tells or heuristics I can use when evaluating a wood I am unsure of to gauge how well it will burn? By how well it burns, I mean things like burn-rate, smoke, ect. This way, even if I'm unsure of the exact wood, I can at least have a vague idea of what to expect from it. Or are woods just too heterogenous to generalize their burns?   Further Clarfications   Let's try to hold environmental factors constant, clearly wood that is wet from a recent rain is different than if the wood is just naturally more moist other physical properties of the wood are fair-game, like: water content, hardness, structure, ect  "

1301,Where in the world do you need a cave diving certification to dive?,"Firstly a preface:  all training's good and especially overhead training where the environment's so unforgiving.  Plus lots of practice.  Where around the world are dive locations where you must have the cave diving certifications to dive?  For example in Mexico or Florida.    What level are these requirements, if any,  what is the legal status of these qualifications?  N.B. ""Must have"" meaning that you can't access the site without showing a card to the ""guardian of the site"" or it's an actual legal requirement.  For most places around the world there's no such thing;  you can just jump in and take responsibility for your own actions,  i.e. you're suitably trained and experienced for the dive being planned. "

1303,Questions about specifics of black bear encounter with mother and yearling cub,"I hope the bear experts on the site can shed light on several aspects of a black bear encounter my husband and I had some years ago in the Sierra.  It was mid-May, about 9500 feet, well above timber line, and the ground was almost completely covered with snow, except for a few bare patches.  I concluded: ""No bear in his right mind would be here.""  So we did not bury our food in a snowbank.  Mistake. Big Mistake.  Shortly after we fell asleep, we were wakened by banging pots.  A bear walked across the campsite, grabbed my pack, which contained all our freeze-dried food, in her teeth and disappeared into the darkness.  My husband tracked her by flashlight and moonlight -- the dragging pack left a clear path.  Soon I heard snarls and growls, and went off to rescue my husband.  I came upon my husband, a bear and her yearling cub.  Here is where I would like your input.  It seemed to us both, and I can't tell you why, body language, I suppose, plus something in the snarling, that the cub was saying ""Let me at him!"" and the mother was saying ""Be quiet! I'll handle this!""  We froze.  After what seemed like a long time, the mother and cub turned and went off.  Q1:  Is this interpretation plausible, or are we just anthropomorphizing?    The two bears had ripped open my pack, pulled out stuff, zeroed in on the freeze-dried food, eviscerated five packages of freeze-dried food and had eaten it all.  Q2: When the food reconstituted in their stomachs, did they get stomach aches, or are their stomachs large enough so the expanding food was no problem?   The bears stopped at a layer of very dirty clothes near the bottom of my pack, and so missed the last package of freeze-dried food, which was a reserve.  Q3: Is it plausible that dirty, smelly clothes repelled the bears?  It could have been that my husband interrupted them, but I'd like to think the smelly clothes stopped them.   We hiked out for two days on one pkg of FD food and tea.  The sugar and all the fresh food were gone. A great experience!  Clarification:  There were no established bear boxes -- we were far off trail.  This was before the era of portable bear canisters -- or at least before it was common to use them; in any case, they aren't practical for a 14 day trip, which this was.  We should have buried our food in a snow-bank; it was a big mistake not to. We have used the snow bank strategy successfully many times; once we saw bear paw-prints going right over our snow-covered cache. For Sierra black bears, the snow bank trick works.  We have no experience with brown bears.      "
1304,"Proper food storage against black bears on a LONG (e.g., 14 days) trip, partly in black bear country? (enough bear canisters not practical)","This question is prompted by the replies to Questions about specifics of black bear encounter with mother and yearling cub.  That question was about an encounter over 30 years ago, before the era of portable bear canisters, or at least before they were routinely used.  And it was a 14 day trip, and there is no way we could have carried enough canisters for a 14 day trip. Maybe some of you supermen could have!  So...the current question.   From my point of view, this question is theoretical, because we aren't going on any more 14 day backpacking trips without assistance from a packer.  But I am curious.    How can food be properly stored against black bears on a long (say 14 day) backpacking trip at least partly in black bear country? Assume no campsites with established bear boxes beyond the first and last days.  Assume no brown bears.  Can you really carry enough bear canisters?  If so, tell me how!  Do you rely on trees (bear-bagging)? Or what?   In the Sierra, with black bears, we have dug into snow banks to store food where there were no good bear-bagging trees available. This has never failed, and in several cases we know there were bears around (pawprints, neighboring campsite being ripped off, notorious bear traffic.)  "
1305,"Acclimitization: Would 20 min at an ""oxygen bar"" deliver more than an ephermal boost to a healthy person?","My last trip was just a hiking trip, so I stayed at a hotel.  For $35, the hotel offered 20 min at their ""oxygen bar"".  I was tempted, but did not succumb.  I didn't have a headache, or feel nauseated, just low in energy.  Thus I don't know exactly what was on offer -- I am guessing it was a mixture with the partial pressure of oxygen similar to that at sea level.    Question:  For a healthy person, roughly how long a benefit would a 20 minute ""return to sea level"" confer?   (i.e., minutes, hours, a day, a speedup to acclimatization?)  The hotel also had ($19) what looked like 1 or 1.5 liter can of pressurized O2. (portable, essentially weightless.)  The can said it delivered ""up to 150"" squirts or hits or inhalations -- I don't remember the word -- of pure O2 .  Would this do anything more for a healthy person than a fleeting boost? "

1307,"Within the U.S. Grand Circle area, where is the number of daytime trail permits limited?","Within the U.S. Grand Circle region (very roughly Las Vegas NV /Provo UT/Aspen CO/Santa Fe NM/Phoenix AZ), for what trails are the number of permits issued limited considering day use only?  I am aware of the Coyote Buttes area in Vermillion Cliffs National Monument near Page, Arizona (lottery-based for Coyote Buttes North including The Wave, and based on who applies first for Coyote Buttes South, but the Paria Canyon in the same area has no daytime limit).  Are there other areas where the number of daytime permits is limited for day-time use?  For the scope of this question, I am not considering trails with a limited number of overnight use permits, nor am I considering trails that require a permit, but do not limit the total number issued.  I am also not considering trails where access is only permitted with a guide, such as Antelope Canyon or areas in Canyon de Chelly National Monument. "
1308,Case example on Altitude Mountain Sickness: How to detect and react properly?,"I know the theory behind effects of high altitudes on the human body is not entirely understood and because of cross-influence it is a difficult topic. It's not an exact science.  Having said that I will give an example case which happened to myself this year. I try to give all relevant information. And I am asking myself for quite a while (and therefore I am asking you now) what exactly occurred in my body in high altitude and how I could react better the next time.  My background is:   quite a few alpine tours under 4000m (13.000') good fitness level but no fitness enthusiast (I am able to do tours with 10 hour walking and/or 2000m elevation gain without big problems in a proper speed) mild lung problems (no 100% capacity, maybe 80-90%)   So we did a trip to South-America, started doing proper acclimatization tours where we always slept around 3000m (10.000') and climbed 4 mountains with increasing height between 4200m (13.800') and 5100m (16.700'). On that tours I had no problems at all and seemed to be very fit. We also had days to rest.  Then we tried to climb a mountain of 5900m (19.300') height. We were supposed to sleep from 5pm to 10pm which I wasn't really able to. I slept maybe 15 minutes which of course is not the best preparation for a long day. Still I was motivated, ate and drunk as much as possible before we start. We were driving by car until 4800m (15.700') I think. There we start climbing. From 5000m (16.400') on I got problems with the stomach. I felt bad and this got worse. As a consequence I wasn't able to eat and I even stopped drinking properly. Later on I was starting to feel weaker and weaker. I had no lung problems or problems breathing but I felt so extremely exhausted. I had no headache at all. Finally at 5500m (18.000') I made the decision to turn around. Even descending I had to stop and even sit down each few minutes because of the exhaustion. I never felt like this before.    I know it's normal to fatigue when you are not sleeping/eating/drinking enough. But the body has reserves. Because I had no headache I asked myself over and over again if I got AMS (wiki) and how serious my situation is and when I have to stop ascending. This is the main question here, how to decide and react properly in such a borderline situation.  There was a lot written about AMS and I knew the symptoms before my trip. This question covers the general ideas of diagnosing severe altitude illness. I doubt my question is a duplicate, it is just a very special case (a case example) which shows how difficult correct judging about the necessity to turn around is.  Like the linked Lake Louise Score states, it is always headache plus symptom X and maybe others. Because of the missing headache I was really unsure of my situation and how far to proceed. The mountain guides climbing with me are not able to assume the responsibility.  While descending under 5000m (16.400') I started feeling stronger. That's the main reason I assume afterwards that I got altitude sickness. But I (and also the mountain guides) was not able to judge correctly on the way up.  How would you judge? How would you react? What to do better next time preparing a high altitude climb? "
1309,Can nylon ropes fail from bend fatigue?,"Everyone knows that bending a paperclip back and forth will eventually cause it to break. This is due to a process called fatigue. And while this answer discusses the elastic limits for fatigue, I don't know if that directly applies to the bending of the rope/cord through knots and movement over parts, etc.   So can nylon ropes fail from being bent like metals, or do they only fail from repeated/excessive forces? In other words, if I bend a rope back and forth a bunch am I increasing its risk of failure? "

1313,Why don't we apply the principles of layering when it comes to pants?,"Whenever I see clothing articles geared toward hiking and backpacking that discuss layering (base layer for wicking, mid layer for insulation, etc.), they always seem to discuss these things in terms of things you wear on your chest.

1315,Canadian Law with respect to knives,"I keep seeing slightly different answers for some of these questions.  In summary of what I know already, please tell me if I am wrong.  You can own any knife of any length, with the following general exceptions:    It is stereotypically related to gang violence (like the auto/easy opening variety).   It is designed to be concealed. (I do not really care about the specifics, as I personally am not interested in any knives like either of these)   You can carry around anything that is legal to own, but there is a length restriction for concealed knives? Do you need a lawful reason to carry it, in either situation?  Question 1: Self defense is not a lawful reason to carry a knife. Does this mean that if I end up defending myself (from an animal or a human) that it is unlawful to use a knife? Do they just not want you carrying one around just for this reason since pepper-spray would be better?    Question 2: I am rather leery of this ""lawful reason clause"". Is just general survival/cutting of things a good enough excuse? It just does not really make sense to me. A knife is designed to cut things, and I carry one around to cut things with.    Question 3: So it is lawful to carry around, in full view, any length of blade? What is the restriction for concealed knives (I have heard numbers from 4"" to 6"")?    Question 4: What is classified as ""carrying"", exactly? Does that mean that I cannot transport a big knife in a backpack or bag? What is required for transporting big knives so that police will not call it concealing?    Specific situation: I really want to get a big-medium sized Kukri as a general survival knife that works well as a replacement hatchet. It is 100% a tool, but it looks like an intimidating sword. So this Kukri is not something that can really ever be carried around in plain view in public; it would attract too much attention. It is specifically related to the ""how do I transport a large knife in public"" Question 4.  But I also like a smallish utility knife. I am thinking of getting a small Bowie within that range (4""-6""). So the exact length requirement is important. "

1321,Is it dangerous to sleep in a tent alone in a forest in -20°C?,"Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20°C without risking my life?    The backstory  From the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)  I do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from ""civilisation"". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.  However: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20°C (-4°F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?  I do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer. "

As you advance in your climbing experience you achieve higher grades and learn new movements, new aspects of already known skills and  new combinations of them. Moreover, there are route setter certifications for  local, national and international level and a proper organization e.g. ([website]When a route setter creates a new route with a wished level e.g. FB 6c+ - he or she probably has some movements and some skills in mind.

I'm only wondering because rappelling you just tie the two together so no need there and if doing running belays and making your own belay stations in an alpine setting a middle mark warning to the belayer doesn't seem to be of concern.  Do Half/Twin/Double Ropes get Middle Marked? If so, why? "

1327,Should I bring my dog with us to a Cabin,"Recently my girlfriend and I were invited to go camping with our friends at a cabin in Flagstaff, Arizona. My buddies have already left and we're supposed to  leave tomorrow to go and meet them up there. Everything has worked out great so far... except for one thing.... I want to bring my dog. Now I'm sure your wondering what the issue is, and well my friends have already left and took their dog with them. Now both theirs and mine know each other very well for they have played together during SEVERAL bbq's, so thats not going to be a problem. The problem we are currently facing is apparently if my dog goes, according to my girlfriend, that my friends will have to tie up their dog while ours is there where as if I just leave her home their dog can ""run free"" so to speak. Now I can honnestly see their point in the sense of the two dogs playing and getting carried away and taking off twoard another cabin. But outside of that? I don't personally see a problem and I seriously doubt they would do it, but you never know... This is the first time I have gone camping in YEARS and its most certanally the first time since I've had my dog... I don't think its fair to just leave her home like my girl seems to think so.... We do live in an apartment where she doesn't get out as much as she should, but she DOES get out. We can't take her to the dog park because of her breed, despite the fact she is friendly. She gets to go for walks and about once a week to once every two weeks she gets to go and run free on a 2 acre property until lays down in a heap of happy tails and belly rubs. She does really well as far as listening goes when on this property, but thorw in another dog and she doesnkt listen as well as she should, to be honnest sometimes I have to call her multiple times. sometimes I don't. just depends. So please, I'm asking for your advice, should I bring her or should I leave her?  My Dog: Breed: Pitbull Boxer Mix Age: 3 Years. Sex: Female Personality: Loving, Sweet Adhd Hyper, protective will probably run circles around the cabin for at LEAST 30 minuets when we get there.  Their Dog: Breed: Brindle lab mix Age: 4 years? Sex: Male Personality: Loving, sweet, protective, at times adhd hyper and will probably run circles around the cabin with my dog once/if she gets there.  How many people total there: 4 adults. 3 kids (6, 7, and 9) and 1 dog for sure.  How many days: For my friends: a week For us: Two Nights and two and a quarter days.  EDIT: I would just like to add that if we leave the dog, the dog will NOT be neglected. I have a cat as well who needs to be fed and given attention to. We have someone who is going to be stopping by the house to spend time with the cat/make it seem like someone is home. The main reasons why my girl does not want to take the dog are because we recently have gotten knew neighbors within the last week, we're pretty sure the people beside us do drugs and we don't want to risk our things stolen and in her mind the dog would scare intruders away (yes i have pointed out that if they REALLY want in, they could kill or harm her) and the last reason, she doesn't want to have to worry about said dog doing something she's not supposed to. I'm confident in her, but my fiance is not with another dog around.  I need to know opinions soon, we're leaving tomorrow (8-26-14) evening. "

After some months, I advanced in the grades, but I started to fail in certain climbs because I slipped from the foot holes. During the time I realized the first time that I had bad footwork - so I started to train it.  The months passed, impossible climbs became easy and I thought: well, my footwork should be good now. In the next grade I struggled again, slipped away or could not hold my body at the overhanging wall. So, footwork training again... But maybe I overlook some mistakes or common flaws in this training again. "
1329,How many calories does hiking burn?,My girlfriend and I went for a walk on Sun. We climbed 3 peaks in Snowdonia. My girlfriend had one of them Nike tracking apps running on her phone all the while. In the end it gave us these stats:  Distance: 20Km (as the crow flies) Time: 8 hours Calories: 4000   The calories though were based on us walking on the flat. It didn't allow for the fact that we'd climbed over 1000m multiple times.   So how many calories did we realistically burn in the period of time we were walking? or is there a better way to work this out? 
1330,What to look for in an insole?,I was recently browsing around a well known outdoor shop when I noticed a confusing array of insole products.   They seemed to be a very confusing array of entirely different looking insoles all coming with various claims on their benefits.    What are the important factors that I should be looking for should I decide to buy some insoles? What benefit's do bought insoles bring as opposed to the insoles that come in a standard boot? Why would I want to spend (£50) on an insole when my boots come with one already?  
1331,Fine tuning the Warm-up routines at Higher altitude,"Warm-up routines are very important for most of the activities that involve rapid and/or vigorous body movements. Trekking too is not an exception to that.  I am planning for a trek which goes through a long distance path at altitudes ranging from 18K to 23K feet. The route goes through world's few of the highest passes. (Yes, I am trekking in Nepal). What I have observed is, the temperature there is usually far less than what I am habituated to. I live in subcontinental region where 25 to 30 Degree Celsius is a very pleasant weather.  Prima facie it appears that it would require a neatly planned warm-up routine up there rather than usual stuff that I do as warm-up routines. Is it a valid assumption that it takes more time and effort to warm-up at higher altitudes? It Yes, what are the routines meant for higher altitudes.  How much is enough and how much shall be too much?  P.S.: I am aware of the Acclimatization thing. And, I am aware of the concerned do's and dont's regarding the same. "
1332,How to safely mark a rope,I was reading this question and the first thing that popped into my head is what do you use to mark the middle of the rope?  I was taught not to use any kind of marker on the rope (because there's no sure way to know it wont be abrasive). Are there safe ways to mark a rope?    Related: Safe Way to Mark a Carabiner. 
1333,Measuring actual distance walked on a map (Allowing for changes in height),"Following on from this question: How many calories does hiking burn?  So in the same journey my girlfriends tracking app said we'd travelled 20km. Now this was based on us travelling on the flat, but we hadn't we'd also travelled upwards about 1Km too.   So how far had we actually walked? I had a thought that this would be something to do with Pythagoras's theorem but that seemed too far.   So if we'd walked, say 10Km as the ""crow flies"" and climbed 1Km how far had we actually walked (roughly)? "
1334,What are some effective ways to deal with sand when camping on or near the beach?,"I've done plenty of camping in my life, especially since it's part of my job, but one area where I've been particularly challenged is camping where sand is involved. It just gets everywhere and into everything and can become quite miserable quickly if not managed well. It almost seems impossible to keep it from getting into all my gear. (And sand coupled with saltwater and high humidity are quite the team of irritants.)  What are some fool-proof techniques, habits, or equipment for minimizing the invasion of sand when camping on or near the beach (or other sandy areas)? What are some good ways in the field to get rid of it once it has already gotten into your gear?  Theoretical ideas are good, but I'm really looking for answers that speak from experience. "
1335,"Using a rope ""Alpine Style""/Moving together","I've seen people using a ropes ""alpine style"" in the past but I'm not sure on the specifics.  By alpine style I mean where the rope is coiled around the body and attached to a second of third person. Anchors may or may not be used but typically the people move together. The idea being that all people in the party are ""roped"" up. You'd use it when moving together on unsure ground (not necessarily when climbing) I'm pretty sure you need to add a knot into the system somewhere, so if someone falls it doesn't just tighten.   Can someone demonstrate the specifics:   How do you set the rope up? What knot to use on the coil? How much slack should you use? Taking in and giving slack?   Possibly give me the correct name for this type of rope work? "
1336,How much is a major load?,"So the UIAA sets a major fall (fall after which to retire your gear) to be a fall factor of 1.77.  Now I was wondering what would count as a major load (load after which to retire your gear) ? 50 kN ? More? Less ?  In the petzl document ""tips for protecting your equipment"" they don't seem to make a distinction between metal gear and ropes. So is that the same for all ? "
1337,Knee pain when descending a mountain,It's been said by a specialist doctor that any form of mountain descent would affect your knee caps.   Do old mountaineers have knee problems? Is it related to the way you descend? 
1338,Is it safe to sleep for more than 16 hrs a day at altitudes above 6000m?,"I am planning for a trek at the Advance Base Camp or if possible up to Camp II of Saser Kangri. The region is so deserted of people and expeditionists/mountaineers that there are usually only two to three odd tents at the Base Camp of the mountain, and it's a known fact that once you are beyond the Base Camp, yours is the only team at campsites en-route the summit.  The weather is very harsh, and the mountain does not allow much area to take a walk on a day when you are not going up the mountain. All you have is a deserted campsite and solace to enjoy. And this goes on for days, worst case for a week. In such cases, you are stuck at higher camps with absolutely no way to roam around or move up the mountain. All you can do is to hope and wait for the weather to get suitable for further progress.  I don't like to read for hours or sit around idle. I usually tend to doze off when I am not doing anything.   In such a case if I sleep for more than 16 hours a day, does that put me in a trouble by any means? What are your tricks to stay up?  "
1339,Dozens of earthworms came on my terrace and died there,"We've had a harsh weather turnaround lately in central Europe. It went from a pretty warm late summer to a pretty cold autumn in nearly one single night. As this happened, earthworms started to come out of the garden on my terrace (I also found some in the garage and even in the basement). And we are not speaking about a handful. The whole terrace is full of worms of all sizes! I would say about 50 single death animals. They laid down and died (I assume that since I couldn't really observe the whole process).   Since I've never experienced something similar before, I wonder what causes this behavior? Why do they do that?        The garden/terrace border looks like this:   "
1340,Worm catching with electricity?,"I have heard about people using electricity to catch worms, mostly around catching worms for fishing.   How does this work?  Is it safe?  "
1341,Picking length for all-terrain touring XC skis,"I am preparing to make a purchase of all-terrain touring XC skis (sidecut 83-62-70 mm), with which I will use SNS XA boots and bindings.  I know that the rule of thumb for regular XC skis is to go to about 110% of your height for the length of the skis. However, these are more similar to what downhill skis used to look back in the 80s than the regular (competition) XC skis and are meant to be able to handle rougher terrain.  I used to alpine downhill ski similar skis before I started snowboarding about 20 years ago. I always preferred my skis to be slightly on the shorter side for more maneuverability.   I am about 6'2"" (185 cm) and I have an inkling towards 175 cm touring skis. Considering that I plan to do a little bit of all kinds of touring (trail and BC) with these skis, should I actually try to go with a little longer (185 or 195 cm)? "
1342,How can I build a board to mount climbing holds in my house?,"I want to screw a board in my house to mount indoor climbing holds, like an indoor wall. so a piece of board with evenly spaced screw holes in it that accept the standard screw mounts for climbing holds. something like this:    Problem is I don't know how to do this? Multiple questions:   What type of board? How do I get the screw holes in (what the holds screw into)? What size bolts/screws do I need?   I'm happy mounting the board, that's the easy bit. It's actually building the board itself I'm stuck on. "
1343,First skills to learn for mountaineering,"I have recently developed an interest in mountaineering.  There seems to be so many skills to learn (and master) for mountaineering.  Although I know it will take a few years to learn (although I'd probably never stop learning) I'm wondering from people who enjoy the sport - what are some skills that a hopeful mountaineer should learn first?  I do have quite a bit of backpacking experience (although, I need to delve more into winter camping), and I am training to be in better physical and mental shape.  But what about skills such as rock climbing, ice axe usage, and other technical skills?    For instance, as a beginner - is learning to be a strong rock climber a good skill to master to eventually learn ice climbing.  Or as a beginner is it better to take glacier routes (and learn glacier travel/crevasse rescue) and over time learn to master more technical climbing.  Note:  I have read through Mountaineering, The Freedom of the Hills.  This book is very in-depth and I can see why people highly recommend it.  They go over many skills though, which is why I come here seeking advice. "
1344,What precautions should we take in situations when hiking or walking through tall grass?,"In Western Ghats, India where I hike, the grass grows tall in the monsoon season. It very well exceeds human height (taller than 7 feet). Last month on a hike the trail suddenly went into such grass. I walked through it to the other side anyway. Only then I realised that there could have been snakes there.  Edit:  Snakes are what came to my mind, but the question is not limited to snakes. I want to know what precautions we can take to avoid any mishaps that could occur in tall grass, e.g. losing sense of direction, entangling legs and falling, etc.   What could endanger our safety in tall grass?  What precautions should we take in situations where we have to make our way through the grass?  "
1345,What's the difference between an oar and a paddle?,"I'm curious as to the difference between an oar and a paddle.   Does it have to do with shape, material, or size?   Is it solely related to the type of vessel for which it's used? In other words, can you use a paddle to propel a rowboat, or an oar to propel a kayak?  Is it just a matter of terminology, or something more specific?  "
1346,Do mountaineers use dynamic climbing when traversing rock/ice?,"I have recently taken up bouldering/rock climbing to learn some rock climbing techniques and learn rope skills.  In my research, I have come across two types of climbing: static and dynamic.  Although dynamic climbing seems to very fun, how often is it actually used by mountaineers (I realize that it is actually quite common for rock climbing)?  It seems like jumping from one hold to reach the next hold would have many disadvantages, especially when wearing a pack, in cold conditions, and when there is ice or snow.     I realize that dynamic movement can be very broad but I am specifically referring to jumping from hold to hold or swinging, etc.  Is this a skill a mountaineer should use? Or is static climbing more the way to go when in the mountains?  "
1347,Avoiding microbial contamination of diesel fuel,I have a diesel powered sailboat. What are effective ways to avoid microbial contamination of the diesel fuel? And what do you do if the fuel becomes contaminated?  [This question originally asked by Curd on the Sailing Yachting and Seamanship proposal] 
1348,"In a boat repair, what would cause Gelcoat not to harden?","Gelcoat is available in 2 formulas, one has wax (finishing), one does not (layering). Both need to be mixed with an agent to cause it to harden. Gelcoat that is exposed to the air stays tacky, this allows for a chemical bond to form between layers.  When using gelcoat for the finishing coat of a boat repair, the common method is to use the formula with wax. As the gelcoat sets, the wax floats to the surface and forms the barrier that allows it to fully harden.  While shopping for a product at a popular web seller, I found this review for a verified purchase of TotalBoat White Gelcoat.     Was happy at the time of application on how it was ..., October 20, 2016      I had called the company to make sure I understood how to apply product and mix contents. Got the boat ready and applied the gelcoat. Was happy at the time of application on how it was going to work, but when came back next day there were spots that had not hardened and still have not. I do not understand what went wrong and will be calling the company back on what possibly went wrong. I mixed hardener the same, the surface was all prepared the same. Will have to redo the boat and not going back with this product.Source.   According to the information on the product page, this gelcoat was made with wax. I searched the site where I found the review, but couldn't locate a wax-free product. I ended up going to another source to get a wax-free product for my first layer.    Obviously I don't know for sure, but the description of ""spots that had not hardened"" makes me wonder if maybe they used soap and water (acetone is recommended by some) to clean the boat prior to applying the gelcoat. If so, and some soap residue remained, it may have potentially risen through the gelcoat, repelling the wax in ""spots"".   Assuming the person mixed the gelcoat and hardener well, what could have caused some areas not to harden?  "
1349,Is amine blush only a concern with new/ongoing epoxy repairs?,"While researching my answer at In a boat repair, what would cause Gelcoat not to harden? I learned about amine blush.  Amine blush is a waxy layer that forms as most marine epoxies cure.  It can be clearly visible as a white layer, or nearly invisable.  It is water soluble, sanding and/or acetone wash without soap and water washing only spread the amine, creating problems with adhesion and curing with additional repairs.  Per the answer to How can I prevent a fiberglass crack in my sailboat from getting worse? there are two types of resin used in boat construction and repair 'polyester' &amp; 'epoxy'  I washed my boat with soap and water a couple of weeks before beginning repairs. I have identified that is about a 1972 model made with polyester resin.  It has had some older repairs (epoxy vs polyester not yet identified as old repair product) I have made patches with polyester resin and new fiberglass.  So far I have only used acetone and sandpaper in my preparations.   Do I need to be concerned about amine blush, or is that only related to new/current repairs with epoxy products in areas where humidity is not well controlled during curing?  "
1350,Do animals have varied taste in foods within their species?,"Humans differ in their food preferences. One person loves oysters, another can't stand them, etc.  What about animals? Are there any rabbits that don't like carrots? Lions that don't care for zebra? Brown Bears that won't eat fish? Panda bears that turn up their snouts at bamboo? Koalas that eschew eucalyptus leaves?  This question might seem flippant, but it's not. If there are such cases (robins that don't like worms, etc.) what do they eat instead? "
1351,How much gelcoat should I remove before redoing the entire hull?,"I have a 1972ish sunfish I am planning to re-gelcoat the entire bottom of the hull.  I made one fiber glass repair where there was a crack through the hull, I took that area down to bare fiberglass before repairing. In another area cracks in the gecoat turned out to be related to a thick layer (3/4 of an inch, 2 cm) of bondo over an old repair.  I sanded that area to the fiberglass, unsure if I am going to add more fiberglass, but not replacing the bondo that thickly.   Where there are scratches or spider crackes I sanded until they were gone, mostly there is still a layer of gelcoat, in few place there is a little fiberglass showing.  For the most part 95% of the hull has a layer of gelcoat sanded with 60 grit.    I have purchased two quarts of white exposy gelcoat, one laminating and one waxed for the final coat.  Some research I have done suggest the thick gelcoat is part of the reason for spider cracks (when the fiberglass flexes the gelcoat cracks).  My plan at the moment is, a coat of laminating gelcoat on bare fiberglass, a second coat of laminating on the entire hull, a third coat of waxed/final gelcoat on the entire hull, sand with 400-600 grit and put the trim back on. All gelcoat will be applied with a brush.   Should I sand the entire hull until the gelcoat is mostly gone? If I consider existing gelcoat as one layer, what the is the maximum number of coats that should be applied over any area of the hull?   "
1352,Does warming an enclosed area with an open flame provide help with drying wet fabric?,"Comments at a recent question How many tea light candles are needed to equal the heat output of a person? suggest that burning a candle can produce water vaper that masses twice as much as the candle     A typical tea light is around 10g so we'd produce nearly 20g of water from that. That's enough to take the humidity of a cubic metre of completely (and unrealistically) dry air up to 100% (i.e. condensing) at 15C   Realistically there are also ventilation issues (as mentioned in comments, question and answer).  Presumably there are similar results for other portable combustables like, propane, etc.   Does warming an enclosed area with an open flame provide help with drying wet fabric? "
1353,How to sharpen a peculiar looking knife,"Take a look at this knife:    Notice that the edge start very far away from the edge of the blade, if that makes sense.  The question I'm asking myself is whether, when sharpening this knife, do I need to keep this super long edge:    or do I need to sharpen the edge like this:    Basically, my question is how do I sharpen this?  Also, is 800 grit enough to make a practical, sharp edge? "
1354,Is it poor etiquette to ask fellow backpackers where they have been/where they are going?,"I got a comment here that said,     Please omit the ""Where have you been?"" part of your social interaction. That is going to set me more on edge, not put me at ease. It sounds ""stalker-ish"", which is especially bad in OP's case where you look ragged.   and before that Strongbad had suggested changing      Where are you headed? to Where have you been?   for basically the same reason.  However, this doesn't match my personal experience at all. In my experience if you are making someone else nervous, they are going to pass you quickly without talking.  On the other hand if you meet someone and are talking its seems very normal to discuss either of the questions especially for finding out what lies ahead if you are going opposite directions.  Is it actually poor etiquette to these questions? "
1355,Does a chewing gum really help in keeping mouth moist?,"First, its not a hypothetical situation, and secondly, with all due respect, I am aware of where the debates like 'Should you get into this trouble at first place?' end-up, so lets not get into that.  I was running low on water during a trek off late, I usually don't like chewing gums much. A friend offered me to have a chewing gum, he made the point that it can help preventing my mouth from feeling dry. Dried mouth does indeed worsen the feeling of thirst.  Though it did work that day, a couple years ago I had a different observation. I had tried the same thing back then, and I am quite certain that chewing gum due to its nature, added to my woes a bad headache.  I haven't really found out how worsen/better it feels if you chew a chewing gum, and when it looses its juices/taste you throw it away, and (have to) continue without water.  Any thoughts?  "
1356,"How do I know if I've made a ""first ascent""?",Last night I was walking the dog near area where I climb a lot. Above the quarry where most of the climbing happens there is a really nice natural short crag. Looking at this crag I thought there were a couple of really nice boulder problems on them. A lot of the stuff was junk (low grade scrambling) but there were definitely a few really nice overhanging prows:    (dog for scale)  I've had a look on the UKclimbing database and I can't see anything logged in this area:    This makes me think this could be an unknown crag! What's the etiquette on this? If I get a first ascent can I confirm this and how do I document it? Just stick it on ukclimbing? 
1357,"Is ""Short roping"" ""Death Roping""?","I had a ""discussion"" with someone on Facebook recently. It came about over a photo shared in a group I'm a member of (I can't share the photo as it's not my property).  The photo showed two people in winter conditions on Crib Goch in snowdonia. The two were attached via a rope. The rope was taut between them (about 2m long) and they were both standing on the ridge.  I made a comment along the lines of:     Ah, demonstrating the classic ""Scottish death rope.""   My understanding being that using a rope in this manner is dangerous. A fall by either party would result in the other party also falling (possibly with much worse consequences for the ""belayer""). To ""short rope"" in this scenario, I would always place some kind of runner. This was what I was told, always place runners on a short rope or don't short rope (i.e. untie)  There were several people who agreed with me and several who vehemently disagreed with me. Often the line was:     I'm a Mountain Leader and this is a perfectly valid technique   So is it appropriate to ""short rope"" without a runner? When and why?  Ideally I'd like some kind of best practice guidance from some authoritative sources. "
1358,How to repair top section of tent pole,"I own the REI Half Dome 2 Plus. The top section of the aluminum tent pole tore at the end (see blue area of picture), and in order to get it to fit in the plastic piece it was supposed to (the inside of the black plastic), it had to be re-bent. This eventually caused the end 1-2cm to rip off completely, leaving me with a shortened and slightly misshapen top tent pole section, which now barely fits into the black plastic piece and over the other tent pole piece inside of that.  Is there any way to repair this piece with off the shelf parts? (most repair kits are directed toward tube pieces which aren't in the middle of the tent--and thus hard to get to) Or to cheaply replace my entire frame? The tent itself is in great condition. Unfortunately, it just appears that the poles were cheaply made. I would love to upgrade to stronger poles that can fit the same tent if possible. I am aware of tentpoletechnologies, which I have contacted, but repairs and replacements through them cost more than half the price of the tent!   "
1359,Are statistics about the frequency of crime actually useful in determining how safe a trail is?,We have a question here about how common assaults/crime happen to people hiking the Appalachian Trail which I have answered with basically all of the statistics I could find.  However it doesn't seem to me that one can judge the safety of something by the numbers when the risk is going to vary considerably by the person and by the actions they take.  See this XKCD that illustrates quite well what I am talking about.    While the overall deaths are low being above treeline or in open fields greatly increases your risk (Roy Sullivan was struck by lightning 7 times).  The other thing is that for example just because there were 3 rappel failures out of 43631 climbers in a study(Source) that doesn't seem to mean that rappelling is safe (people die rappelling) but rather that most climbers take the appropriate precautions and do it safely.  Would the statistics of how frequent crime happens(if comprehensive and accurate) be an indicator of how safe a trail is? 
1360,Is a flare a good fire starting tool?,"We have a couple of questions showing that in dry times a flare can start forest fires.   Is there a safer way to use a flare in a wooded area? What is the risk of starting a forest or wildland fire with a flare gun?   Most flares will start easily when wet and even burn underwater.  So would seem a tempting fire starting tool.  I am wondering about in wet times, if a flare would be effective for starting fires.  Flares burn pretty hot 1,600 °C (2,900 °F) and I suspect that might actually make it more difficult to light a fire with wet wood/kindling.   We have some related questions, but they don't address flares.   Is it possible to use a flint and steel with wet tinder? Given limited space and weight what should I carry to get a fire going with damp wood? How to light a fire with wet firewood?   Edit  When I wrote this question I was thinking about road flares, that are mostly fuel and no launch system or propellant. It was not until some new activity that the possibility of using an airborne signal flare that I even considered the possibility.  It seems like each of the answers have existing have specific types of flares in mind.  Answers should probably includes specifics about the type of flare they discuss.  "
1361,Train climbing with additional weight?,"What is your opinion: Does it make sense to train rock climbing wearying a weight vest or a small backpack carrying a small amount of weight (let's say 1-3kg or 2-6.5lb) to mimic the actual weight you carry with you outdoors?  Why am I asking this question: Depending on what you are doing outdoors, you carry a substantial additional amount of weight, in particular for trad and alpine climbing, e.g.    10 quickdraws do weight ca. 1kg a set of cams with additional gates easily more than that additional layers of clothes etc...   In my experience, it makes a huge differences to carry an additional 2kg or 4.5lb of weight with me, in particular in overhanging terrain or if powerful moves are required. My prior therefore would be, yes it makes definitely sense to take this into account during your training.  But I wonder because I seldom see climbers actually practicing with additional weight.   I think I remember Adam Ondra saying that most people should not do weighted bouldering etc. because you will get used to climber slower (and there is a higher risk of injury). But does this this also apply to a small (realistic) amount of weight you will face while performing? "
1362,"Bird identification from feathers - brown-black feathers, medium size, West Sweden","While hiking in western Sweden in October this year, I came across a bunch of feathers on my trail:  To me it looked like the leftovers of a small to medium bird of prey, which was seemingly eaten by a different animal. Here is a closeup of some of the feathers:   The longest feather is about 18 cm long.   What bird could this be? Is there a possibility to guess/know what has happened to it? "
1363,"Do chipmunks hibernate in woodpiles, and, if so, how do I avoid disturbing them when taking wood from the pile?","We have a woodpile, protected from wind and precipitation, under the eaves of our house.  Earlier, perhaps a month earlier, I several times saw two chipmunks emerging from, and going back into the woodpile.  I also saw a chipmunk drink from a puddle very close to the woodpile.  I have not seen them for perhaps a month, nor have I seen any chipmunks at all for that time.  I assume they are hibernating.    But, how likely is it that they are hibernating in my woodpile?  And if so, where are they likely to be -- ground level or several log-heights off the ground? I have never seen chipmunk traffic into and out of the woodpile in other years.  We expect a lot of snow this winter, and if it does snow a lot, it is very likely that we will have a multi-day power outage. I don't want to dismantle their winter refuge from over their heads, but I don't want to freeze either.  We have another woodpile farther from the house, and I may just move some of it into the Mud Room inside the house.  But I'd rather not.  Advice on keeping both the chipmunks and us warm and happy during a power outage?  "
1364,What counts as climbing a mountain?,"Obviously by anyone's definition, you need to reach the top to successfully climb a mountain, but after hiking to the top of Guadalupe Peak, where the peak is at 8,751 ft, but with a prominence of only 3,029 ft, it seems like most of the 'work' was done by just getting into the parking lot.  Then through further reading about the 50-state high point challenge, I read that Britton Hill in Florida is only 345 ft, with the parking lot just 66 ft from the 'summit'. Does that mean that accomplishing the feat of reaching the peak of all 50 summits in a record time could drastically be reduced by merely moving the starting point (parking lot) closer to the summit? What is the actual definition of 'climbing' a mountain? "
1365,Why are Fjällräven sleeping bags so expensive?,"The Fjällräven POLAR -20 REG has the following specs:   850 EUR 1650g and 25cm x 40cm volume EN/ISO: -12°C comfort, -20°C limit, -42°C extreme 95/5 Down; 800 cuin   The MARMOT - Never Summer seems to be comparable:   297 EUR on Amazon 1450g and 22cm x 46cm volume EN/ISO: -12°C comfort, -20°C limit, -42°C extreme Down; 650+ cuin   MOUNTAIN EQUIPMENT - Kryos   485 EUR  2335g and 29 cm x 25 cm x 23 cm volume EN/ISO: -10°C comfort, -18°C limit, -39°C extreme 90/10 Down; 800+ cuin   They also look similar. The Fjällräven sleeping bag has a bit of fur on the top, but besides that and the difference in fill power and weight I don't note a difference. And as the EN/ISO rating is the same, I think the difference in fill power does not matter. (Right?)  Why is Fjällräven 285% of the price of Marmot? Is there any other quality difference I can't see? (Reading Is buying an expensive sleeping bag better?  didn't help) "

1367,How do you deal with blackberry bushes on the west coast when bushwhacking?,"I'm on holiday near Sechelt right now, and have been hiking the trails and powerline right of ways.  On several occasions I've come to the end of one trail, and can see the start again on the other side of a stream.  Wading the stream is a piece of cake.  The ravine on either side is often choked with blackberry canes.  The dogs and I are NOT impressed with this, and at times I've backtracked a mile to find another route as being faster than doing 50 yards of canes.    How do other people deal with these beasts?  Machete?  Weedeater?  High explosive air strike? "
1368,"Why is the ""alpine style"" of climbing not as popular in the Himalayas?","While there have been some accomplished climbers who have done this in the Himalayan peaks, alpine style remains relatively rare in the Himalayas. Most climbing is done in the expedition style with large groups.   Is there a fundamental reason this is so? Can a moderately experienced climber, who might summit solo or in 2-person teams in European/American peaks, attempt the same in the Himalayas?  "
1369,Using hiking boots for amateur rock-climbing,"What are the practical aspects of using good quality hiking boots (e.g. ones shown below) for climbing?     Arguably, an outdoor enthusiast might be involved in various sorts of activities from hiking and camping to climbing to mountaineering. Now suppose said enthusiast is not keen on having specialized gear for every single sub-activity. Can a solid pair of hiking boots serve all purposes? Especially on a backpacking/camping trip where one carries all one's gear on one's back.   I know that paired with crampons or snow-shoes, and the right pair of socks, they are fine for cold and higher altitudes. What about moderate outdoor rock-climbing?  "
1370,Any tips for landing fish on barbless hooks?,"I have started to debarb all my flies a while ago (it is much better for the fish if you are doing catch and release), but have been loosing some hooked fish that I was otherwise able to net when I had barbed hooks.   I have heard that it is most likely due to mistakes in fighting the fish, so I wonder if there are any good techniques for landing fish with these hooks. Are there any differences in the way you fight a fish when your hook has no barb? Any tips to improve my landing rates?   Please bear in mind that I fish barbless to avoid unnecessary damage to the fish, so tactics that incur more harm to the catch (e.g. beaching the fish) would defeat my purpose. "
1371,Dealing With Wind Direction Changes When Sleeping In A Tarp,"I've recently switched from using a tent to using a tarp, and on the whole I'm really enjoying it, however there is one thing I haven't solved.  How do people deal with situations where the wind switches ninety degrees in the night and suddenly starts howling through your tarp, making it a wind tunnel? Obviously being aware of dominant winds / likely localised-weather-effects helps in deciding which direction to pitch in, and finding a sheltered spot is a no brainer, but what about when pragmatism fails? Bear in mind I'm pitching using the classic A-frame setup.  This has happened to me on a number of occasions and my solutions have included moving my pack to block it (only viable in low wind), dropping the windward side of the tarp to the ground(cramped) and re-pitching in the middle of the night (naked, cold wind, unpleasant).  I've read Jardine's tarp book and he suggests tarp doors, but this starts to over-complicate what is a wonderfully simple bit of gear.  So what are my options for handing switches in wind?  Note: I'm not asking how to pitch in very high winds. I would take a tent if I was camping above the tree-line. I'm talking about general pitching where there is enough wind to strip the heat from you but not enough to blow you off a cliff. "
1372,"How to ""spot"" someone who is bouldering?",We have discussed a lot and at length about how to climb and other climbing techniques. I haven't come across a single post that talks about Spotting techniques.   What are the duties of a Spotter? What is the best a spotter can do to ensure that the fall of a climber results in minimum or no injury? 
1373,Climbing: fear/panic on boulder wall,"I am wondering if anyone else has experienced fear/panic that gets in the way of bouldering, and what their tips are for dealing with this. (There is a prior question on fear in lead climbing, but my issue is specific to bouldering. I climb indoors.)  Basically, I am a relatively new (1.5yrs) climber with a mental hang-up about bouldering. I am specifically scared of taking a fall off a boulder problem and hurting my foot. The essence of the problem is the fear of an uncontrolled fall. When a move at any height feels anything less than 100% sure to stick, I panic. The higher I am, the more certain I have to be the next move is completely safe. The top two moves or so of any problem are always really challenging because I panic even if they are straight up jugs. When this happens I get tunnel vision, rapid breathing, intense feelings of fear etc, and have to downclimb and/or take a controlled jump. The problem has just been getting worse and worse lately. Because of this issue, I have not just stopped advancing, I have actually regressed in bouldering ability. It has become bad enough that I just don't want to boulder anymore - I get anxiety just thinking about going on the wall, and would much rather spend all my time top roping (I don't lead climb yet).  I know where this originates: just a few months into climbing, I hurt my ankle when taking a fall off a simple boulder problem at an unfortunate angle. It didn't completely heal on its own, so after a few months I saw a physical therapist, with whom I worked for another few months. Now it has been over a year since the fall, and the ankle is finally getting up above 90% of what it used to be (though I still can't go running). I am completely mentally hung up on this happening again. I love going on top-rope walls, because even if I fall, I am not worried about landing wrong. I can top-rope 5.9s but the same moves feel impossible on a boulder wall. Lately, I have been unable to even top out v0 (on good days, when the panic doesn't visit, I can top v2). Even on good days, this issue prevents me from actually improving as a climber on the boulder wall. It's not clear to me why the fear is getting more intense as more time passes from the injury.  Things that don't work (for me): pushing through the panic (trying to defy it just seems like adding fuel to the fire). And taking more controlled falls has not been super helpful: the real issue is getting myself to take a risk at an uncontrolled fall, and it's like my body refuses to even attempt those moves.  Anyone had similar issues? What did you do?   Edit: Also, any general ideas on what I could try to overcome this? "
1374,"What is a ""sling belay?""","Rock climbing topos have various standardized symbols, such as xx for a bolt anchor, or a dashed line for face climbing. In keys of symbols, I've sometimes seen SB defined as a ""sling belay."" What does this mean? Does it mean that there is a natural feature that you can throw a cordelette around and use as an anchor? "
1375,Criterions in multi-pitch climbing to be considered a free ascent,"How free climbing compares to other styles of climbing is well explained in the question Bouldering vs aid climbing vs free climbing vs free solo climbing and more specifics are given in What does it mean to free a climbing route?. A recent answer to the question What is a “sling belay?” mentioned that such belays are considered ""aid"" in big-walling and makes an ascent non-free. First, I do not yet get the reasoning on how this is aid, for me it is just belaying which is fine. In general:  What specific rules like the one mentioned are there, that make an ascent non-free? As this is often not uniform in area and time, any elaboration on where and when certain rules apply are appreciated.  This is not really relevant to a casual climber (as long as I do not put any force on the belay chain, for me I am free), but records and first ascent play an important role in professional climbing. Especially nowadays with more and more sponsorship involved, ""regulation"" and comparability are needed and I would like to understand the current ""state of the art"" of free climbing. "
1376,What are other possible make-shift alternatives for chalk powder?,"Climber's life rely heavily on equipment. Having all the necessary equipment for simplest of climbs is a must. But, if at all I forget to bring the chalk powder along, what other alternatives I have for that?   I have used dry leaves by crushing them and rubbing them on fingers, that worked good enough.   What are other things that I can try? "
1377,Toprope webbing anchor with figure 8 knots,"I recently made a toprope anchor extending from a tree about 15' over the edge of the cliff using 1"" webbing. The webbing was looped around the tree using a figure 8 follow-through, with sufficient tail and a simple stopper knot as well. A figure-8 on a bight was tied at the master point (opp opposed lockers), where the anchor joined a sling from the single good bolt (the other was loose), the rest of the webbing simply coiled up at the top of the cliff. See the fantastic attached image.  My question is: People seem to think poorly of figure-eights with flat webbing, but in this setup they seemed perfectly fine and I don't see why one wouldn't use them (other than, perhaps, simplicity in using other knots). Is this anchor safe with the figure-8s? Should they be tied differently? "
1378,"Selection of toilet area, its distance from the trail, its size with respect to number of people in group, placement of holes","I have gone through the answers of question When is it not OK to leave feces behind? It did answer a part of my question ""I would really like to know how and where exactly do I select this area?"" It also put an insight on ""How far away from trail in wilderness should it be?""  I am new to hiking. So far I have been on about 15 different day hikes. I am planning to go on a multi-day hike soon. I would need to set up a toilet area in this case. I have read in posts and books that ""toilet area"" must be away from a water source, that ""toilet area"" must be lower than cooking area, etc.  I am not exactly able to picture it as I haven't done it before. Which raised more questions  I would really like to know how and where exactly do I select this area?  What its size should be with respect to number of people who are going to use it?  How far should two toilet holes should be from each other?  How approximately far away from trail and the campsite should it be? "
1379,What tent should I use for extended winter camping in the midwest US?,I would like to camp for the whole winter but mostly in a wooded area. Is it reasonable to assume that I will not encounter terribly heavy winds? I want to purchase a 1 man tent but can't decide if getting the 4-season extended tent upgrade is worth it. I want something cost effective but able to withstand winter weather minus the intense winds and conditions that an actual mountaineer would face. Could you guys make some suggestions? I'm hoping to not have to go to official mountaineering brands that cost 400+  Would something like the Ozark Trail Tent or the CampingMaxx pull it off?  Or should I start researching 4-season tents to be sure snow doesn't ruin my tent? 
1380,Can I reuse the soft fibres from hackle feathers in some other fly tying application?,"Every time I use something like a partridge feather for a hackle, I have to remove part of the feather fibres (the fluffy soft part) and that usually goes to waste. I wonder if that can be used for something like dubbing, for example.   I know that most materials are not that expensive, but I hate to waste stuff.  Are there uses for those soft fibres? In general, what by-products of tying a fly can be reused on other flies?  "
1381,Should I be more careful about postholing during winter hikes?,"This weekend I am going to do one of my favorite things: winter hiking in the Sierras. When I say ""hiking"", I mean that though we might be trodding up a mountain in the snow, it is not real mountaineering.  I won't wear plastic boots and probably won't use my ice axe.  I have always loved hiking in the snow. And I have always considered postholing while hiking to be a minor annoyance. But what are the real risks? Do people break their legs postholing through the snow? Should I always wear snowshoes if postholing is likely? Or is this just the minor annoyance I think of it as? "
1382,Repairing a North Face Tent rain cover,"I have bought a North Face RoadRunner 3 tent 10 years ago. It is a great tent, and it served me well during a 9-month trip to South America.    The problem is that the transparent part of the rain cover - the so-called ""window"" - has disintegrated, and now there is a nice hole instead of a window:      Other than that, the tent is perfect.  How do I patch the missing part? I don't it to be transparent, just water-proof. "
1383,Would it be acceptable to plant OC's mobile cache into GC's caches?,"I have currently no place of permanent perspective (from the geocache's point of view, I think it should be about 5 years, to be able to service cache in that time). So I'm thinking about creating the series of mobile caches. Of course, those caches can be created in OpenCaching only. And in Germany (the place I temporarily live in) it happens to be so, that GeoCaching is much more popular (not to say, dominant).   So I'm wondering if it is really a good idea to plant such mobile caches in the geocaches registered in GeoCaching.com.   I'm taking into account the following issues:   how would the finder react to mobile cache, let's say in form of U-Ei? Would he/she know what to do with that (log in and, preferably, move to new location)? Or it is the risk that the cache would be thrown away as thrash? how would the cache owner react to such planting? Could it be considered rude or offensive? are there any objections, in general, against OpenCaching that make that portal so unpopular in Germany?   The preferable answer should address all the issues above. "
1384,How do I mount a hangboard in an apartment?,"In the last few months I have come to the conclusion that I need to have a fingerboard at home if my climbing is to get to the next level. But the problem is that I live in an apartment. How can I mount a fingerboard in an apartment?  What options are there in an apartment to mount a fingerboard without definitely losing my security deposit? The goal will be to spend a lot of time hanging off of this thing, so it will need to be very reliable bearing my weight.  I have been assuming I NEED to mount this to the wall permanently. Is there another option? Is there an inexpensive way to build a free-standing structure for it? "
1385,What are the criteria that should be taken in consideration when buying a PLB?,"This question was already asked about personal locator beacons (PLB, Wikipedia page which is a great comprehensive article.) However it does not cover how to choose a PLB or the differences between the cheapest and most expensive models. When I am browsing the models on the net they all look the same, but prices start at [tex]500.   What are the criteria that should be taken in consideration ? (weight, supported temperatures, pressure, frequency used, etc..)  Is buying the most expensive a better deal on the long run ?  "
1386,What is the fastest style of sled?,"Winter is here and, like every year, I am still thrilled when the extended family rounds up all the little kids and we go sledding. This year we compared our sleds and found that some were significantly faster.  What is the fastest style of gravity/human-powered sled?    Are inner tubes faster than regular sleds? Are those little plastic discs the fastest? How about the old-fashioned wooden sleds with metal runners?  Before you ask: yes, I am an adult. Yes, I also like skiing. And yes, I know sledding is not a real sport.  No judgements! "
1387,Can I mix fuels when using the MSR whisperlite international stove?,"I have an MSR whisperlite international stove. Can I mix fuels when both require the same jet?  Background: When backpacking I often just carry one fuel bottle, filled with white gas. On my last trip I was running low on fuel and wanted to stock up. The only fuel I was able to get was unleaded gasoline. I didn't want to waste the white gas I had left, and wasn't sure if I could just fill up the bottle with the gasoline, mixing the fuels. Has anyone experienced or heard of adverse effects mixing fuels? "
1388,Is there a web application that can notify you ahead of time if a certain weather forecast is predicted for a certain location?,"In other words, it would be a site where you can ""subscribe"" to certain locations and then have the service email you if the weather forecast matches the kind of weather conditions you are looking for.  I believe a site like this would serve as a valuable tool for many types of outdoor activities and trips.  Sure, there is value in just being out there even if the weather is not ideal. Indeed, often we are forced to make do with the conditions we are given. With that said, however, wouldn't it be great if you could expect with reasonable certainty your ideal weather conditions, and have it be sent to your inbox?  Examples might include:   Get an email the next time a weekend following 3 days of snow is predicted at ski resort Get an email the next time there is a full moon and clear sky for a summer night hike (I'm sure there are many other examples: water sports, fishing, running, etc)   So does anyone know of anything like this?

1389,"Methods for taping hands, wrists, and fingers for climbing?","I've been climbing off and on since I was a teenager, but one thing I've never done much of is taping my hands. As I gained more experience, it's value is now apparent.   What are some good techniques for taping fingers, hands, and wrists for different types of climbing, and how does each tape job achieve it's purpose? What type of tape is recommended or not recommended?   For example: I'm having intermittent wrist pain. How can I supportively tape it, yet not restrict it too much, and also not completely cover the palm.  Answers may relate to injury prevention or support, or just general protection of the fingers, hands, or wrist. Please be as descriptive as possible and pictures and/or videos are preferred in any explanations. Personal experience on effectiveness and tips with these tape jobs is also welcome and preferred. "
1390,Difference between Franz Josef and Fox glaciers,"I have just arrived to Franz Josef town, South Island, New Zealand. The main attractions here are the Franz Josef and Fox glaciers.  Several local tour operators feature heli-hikes to both glaciers, combined with a few hours of guided glacier walking tour.  Is there any difference between the glaciers? Are there any landscape or geographical features that are unique to just one of them? Is any of them preferred in cloudy weather?  "
1391,Difference between a Fingerboard and a Hangboard,This is just a climbing terminology question:  What is the difference between a Fingerboard and a Hangboard?  Maybe there is no difference at all? Maybe it's subtle?  I have been Googling around and asking people and have gotten no consistent answer. 
1392,Safest months to hike in Colorado,"I've read that the summer months (June, July, and August) are the safest months to hike in Colorado because these are the least-likely times to run into ice patches that can't be crossed with normal hiking gear, and the least-likely times you will run into a sudden, unexpected snow storm.  My question is, what about the dangers of hiking in summer that you don't run into as often in winter? Don't these offset the dangers mentioned above? To me it seems like the threat of getting caught in a summer afternoon lightning storm and forced to get down the mountain quickly is about as dangerous as the threats a person runs into in the winter.  True, you need more gear in winter (crampons, ice axe, helmet), but wouldn't you say that the risk level is the same year round in Colorado? "
1393,What does it mean to free a climbing route?,"Sometimes I read articles about climbers having freed a route. For example: ""Lynn Hill freed the Nose"". What does this exactly mean in terms of how they climbed it?  Specifically:   Are they not allowed to fall at all during the climb? Are there ropes and partners involved (like a normal multi-pitch climb)?  What sort of protection is available? Bolts, trad gear? Is a route freed only once by the person who climbed it first (so a synonym of a first ascent)?  Is ""freeing a route"" ever used for single-pitch climbs, or is it mainly used for much longer climbs?   "
1394,How to cross a 25 feet wide Crevasse?,"How to cross a Crevasse when its absolutely unavoidable? What gear/equipment is/are required?

EDIT: I am referring to a crevasse that I may need to cross some point in time during a trek that I am planning around Saser kangri II and Saser Kangri IV. The said crevasses is roughly a 20-25 ft (6 to 7.5 m) wide. "

1397,Is there a dose guide for Dexamethasone?,"I am looking at the things that I should have with me when I am climbing higher altitudes. I came across this meds one should always have along: Dexamethasone.    Dexamethasone is used in the treatment of high-altitude cerebral edema, as well as pulmonary edema. It is commonly carried on mountain-climbing expeditions to help climbers deal with altitude sickness.    It is available in the form of Tablets and Injectable. As this may well be a solo expedition, I might have to take the dose on my own. Yes, if there is another team around who have a medic with them, then its obvious that I'll consult him/her for that matter.    Is it always advised to get injected only from a medical professional?  I know I can, but should this medicine be self-injected when needed? I have given insulin doses to my father, so I know I can inject, at least subcutaneously.  Is there a definite/solid set of instructions for doing that?   "
1398,Snake dangers while hunting in the desert?,"I plan to start doing some hunting in the greater southern Nevada Mojave desert (say within a 2 hour drive of Las Vegas).  I know that while hiking, there is some ""safety"" from snakes because you are alerting them to your presence with your steps and things like that. But what about when you are hunting and movement and silence are important? What are some of the precautions I should take from snakes while I'm sitting in a blind? I plan on hunting coyote from a turkey chair, so I will be pretty close to the ground. I've never seen one in the wild, but I've heard that the green mojave rattlesnake can be relatively aggressive. Any thoughts on this? "

1400,Why is it unsafe to handle metallic equipment with bare hand at higher altitude?,"I have seen a few documentaries where the high altitude mountaineers constantly keep the hand-gloves ON. Is it really because handling the metallic equipment with bare hands can cause a Frostbite? What else risk is there?  What temperature ranges are permissible at which I can afford to handle metallic equipment bare-handed? Its really difficult for someone like me who has never been very comfortable with any sort of gloves, handling life-banking metallic equipment there at the mountain will need a practice of course. "
1401,Fly casting in heavy cover/growth,"I recently began learning to fly fish.  However most of the streams I frequent are small creeks in the Southern Appalachians that have a lot of growth on the banks and overhead making casting rather difficult.

1404,Kayaking with a shotgun,"I like using small boats for duck hunting.  I was recently given a sit-in two-seater kayak that I have painted and I am ready to take out on the marshes.  Although I have used small canoes and the like before, this will be my first time in a kayak.  I specifically want to use this boat where the paddle is more difficult because of length, wind, or current, and I want to use the double-ended paddle, lower profile, and lower weight of my kayak to get to further places.  I am trying to figure out how to transport my shotgun.  My shotgun doesn't need to be at the ready because I will be kayaking to a location, setting up and hunting, then kayaking back.  I could bungee it in place on the deck or throw it on the floor of the kayak in the floating gun case I use, but I am concerned as it is a high-dollar item and I want to do all I can to make sure I don't loose it.  Getting it wet is inevitable so some water will be fine.  What are the options for transporting the gun in the way most likely to be retained in case of an accident?  My kayak is a two seater with no spray skirt.  My dog will be riding in the front seat and has been trained to do well on all manner of boats, so she will be fine but taking up the front seat.  This will be in fresh and salt water.  The temperatures will be about 35 degrees F to about 60 degrees F.  Any tips or tricks for transporting high-value cargo in a kayak like my shotgun? "
1405,Why would people descend to sleep while acclimatizing?,"I am watching a video about a climb of Annapurna.  To acclimate the climbers head up from base camp to another camp higher up, stay for a day or two, then return to base camp.  They repeat this process a few times, each time going a little higher.  Why the return to base camp?  Seems to me that would partially undo the acclimatization they are seeking.  "
1406,Correct way to wield a machete?,"I regularly use a machete to clear brush.  I must be using the wrong technique for the tool ... or the wrong tool given my technique.  In order to maximize the speed of the blade, I rotate my wrist forward before it strikes wood.  This causes the pommel to dig into the lunar pad (bottom face opposite the thumb) and quickly blister it.  Shown here is my starting grip:   And my grip at the end of a stroke:   Is there a better tool for cutting brush, or maybe just a better grip, given my hand size and strength?  Amendment: If I don't break my wrist it feels like I'm ""hacking"" with too light of a tool.  Blade speed is much lower, and so much less work is done with each stroke.  If I were to not break my wrist I could use a much heavier tool: A much longer blade, or a blade at the end of a long handle, which would give the same blade speed and power per stroke without having to break my wrist.  But what am I describing?  A pike?  (And then there's the question of what to do when I have to pack the tool into the wilderness....)  Second Amendment: I also realized that if I don't break my wrist I can't reach a lot of brush: If I keep the blade at a right angle to my arm then I have to bend to hit anything lower than 3 feet off the ground, and I have to wade further into the brush to reach more central branches, which is an often thorny proposition! "
1407,What is the difference between a cascade and a waterfall?,"I thought about asking this question on English Language and Usage, but decided not to because I want answers from people who are familiar with cascades and waterfalls in reality, not just in the abstract.  Moreover, the definitions aren't very helpful.  From The Oxford English Dictionary, a cascade is:     Usually, a small waterfall; esp. one of a series of small falls,   formed by water in its descent over rocks, or in the artificial works   of the kind introduced in landscape gardening.   And from the OED, a waterfall is:     A cascade of water falling from a height, formed when a river or   stream flows over a precipice or ledge; (also) a garden water feature   resembling this.   Much of my hiking has been done in the Sierra, especially Yosemite, where waterfalls and cascades of every size abound.  I have always thought of a waterfall as water that flows over a lip and then falls freely.  And a cascade as water that may flow quite steeply downhill but remains in contact with the underlying rock or streambed.  I would never describe Nevada Falls, for example as a cascade, nor would I describe the cascades that flow over the bare granite at roughly the 8,000 foot level of Yosemite Creek as waterfalls.  Is there a difference between the two in TGO in other parts of the world, or have I made up a distinction that is not commonly used in TGO?    "

Here’s how,"" It mostly discusses ""human fueling"" (calories) but later says:     That means starting out with a sled weighing 375 pounds (Worsley’s, in contrast, weighed 330 pounds). Unlike Worsley, he’s not bringing cigars or a bottle of Royal Brackla Scotch whiskey to toast his progress. In fact, he admitted, “I’m not bringing a second pair of underwear.” That ruthlessly pragmatic approach contrasts with the swashbuckling tradition of polar exploration pioneered by the British—but this particular challenge, O’Brady believes, simply doesn’t allow any margin for whimsy. The starting load of food was about 245 pounds, with another 55 pounds of fuel, which is needed to melt the necessary five liters of water daily, and 75 pounds of equipment and clothing.   The Antarctic hikers mentioned below looked at using photovoltaic cells to convert solar power to electricity and store it in batteries (or thermally) for melting water and charging electronic gear.  Question: How did O’Brady charge his electronic gear? Solar? Conversion of thermal power from burning fuel to electricity somehow?      above: ""Robert and Barney Swan towing sleds topped with solar panels across Antarctica."" From here.

1413,How relevant is distance between nock and fletching?,"I just recently fletched new arrows and I decided to put them a little more downward than usual. I thought (with my particular fletching rig) I would get more helical twist into it.  However, I ended up with an arrow having about 1,5 "" between the nock and the feathers. Is that okay? Or to generalise my question, how relevant is the distance between nock and fletching?  "
1414,What are the differences between a lighthouse and a light station in terms of the specific purpose?,"One summer evening we drove to Race Point, the farthest tip of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA. We were told there was a lighthouse at that spot, and wanted to see the light shine through the darkness, as it signaled to the boats out in the ocean.  Some people there were calling it a light station. Is that the same thing as a lighthouse? If not, what are the differences?   I'm looking for substantial and detailed information about the meaning of and purpose for each. I know lighthouses come in many different sizes and shapes. I'm talking about any structure that serves that purpose.   Some history would also be appreciated, if possible.  "
1415,What to do when one point in a climbing anchor breaks?,"Climbing anchors usually have 2-3 redundant protection points, which distribute weight. So if one point breaks, this will not be a catastrophic failure.  However, what should I do in practice if this happens? (this has never happened to me)  Hypothetical situation: I (let's call me A) have finished leading a pitch; I have built an anchor of 2 solid or 3 less-than-solid points, and I am belaying 2 persons (B and C) top-roping 10-20 m below me. Suddenly, one of the persons (B) loads the rope, and one of the anchor points is destroyed!  Assuming the anchor still works (1 or 2 points left):   What should I do? What should I instruct B and C to do? If we cannot communicate (e.g. too much environmental noise), what to do?  "
1416,How do you refill your alcohol stove while it's burning?,"I'm collecting ideas on this topic.  I'm using a DIY alcohol stove made of a soda can. I have seen a guy refilling the same stove using this, but he doesn't explain where he found it, or how he built it:      what metal does it use for the tip (it should resist oxidation)? how did he seal the metal tube with the plastic one (the sealing should be heat resistant)?   Optional: I use 500ml coca cola bottle to store the alcohol (small and super resistant). A cheap/light solution that would work with that would be perfect.  Don't hesitate to share your trick and ideas here!  EDIT: the question isn't ""is it dangerous?"", but ""how do you do it?"" "
1417,Is there proof that it's good for animals in captivity to do activities such as painting?,"Last spring, we went to the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut, United States.   We don't like places with captive animals, unless they're work is essential for the survival of life on the planet. We may visit some that are caring for rescued or injured animals until they can go back to the wild; and some that are providing life-long loving care for animals who can never be released. The facilities must be governed by organizations with strict rules. They must have a global conservation and education mission.    The Aquarium seemed to meet our criteria, until we came to an exhibit that disturbed us. They were selling ""paintings"" by animals, each with a profile of the ""artist."" The penguin made multiple colored footprints. A beluga whale made one with long brushstrokes. Apparently they hold the paintbrush in their mouth, but I'm not sure of the procedure.  We worry that the paint is toxic in the long run, even if doesn't seem to be at the moment. We worry that the whole activity is unnatural to the animal, might be frightening or otherwise disruptive, especially if they go back to the wild. Penguins do walk in their natural habitat, but they don't use paint and are not forced to walk on a piece of paper. I doubt whales do anything remotely related to putting a brush in their mouths and creating ""art"" in the ocean!  We had an uneasy feeling that the animals were just being used as entertainment without enough attention paid to their care. We expressed our concern about the the painting activity to an employee, who told us that creating this ""art"" is not only safe, but actually beneficial to the animals.   Is that a proven fact? If so, what are the benefits? Are there also dangers such as those I mentioned, or others?       "
1418,Rappelling with only one arm,"I'm working on a novel. The main character recently (six months ago) lost her arm above the elbow. She's attending a summer camp, and I'm wondering if, with proper planning (and probably a mountain of release forms), it would be possible for her to join in on rappelling? Is there a way to tie the ropes, or some special equipment that would let her control the rope, either with just one hand, or using what's left of her other arm?  She's fourteen, if that matters, and the bluff being used is one the camp's been using for years.  Edit: I've read Rappelling with an injured arm but felt it didn't answer my question for two reasons:  1) My main character, strictly speaking, is no longer injured. She's had time to recover from the car crash and is perfectly healthy, other than the fact that she's missing an arm.  2) More importantly, that scenario seems to be about what to do when you need to get down a rock cliff while injured. This being a planned activity, precautions can be made well ahead of time. "
1419,Need help identifying a vintage George Hine Production Co Rod,"My mother gave me an old rod that I think she just found and I need help identifying it. There are some pictures below. The whole group of pictures is  here.  Its only identifying marks is a sticker that seems to read  George Hine Production Co,  Santa Monica, California  The Harnell   It's a two piece rod, 9'2"" when assembled. It seems to be a baitcasting rod since the eyelets are close to the body unlike the eyelets on spinning reels. The handle measures 23"" from the the top where the handle meets the rod blank to the butt of the cork. The reel seat area is about 4"" and screws down, maximum open area for a reel to slide in there is about 2-3/4""  What type of rod is this? I only own a single rod (i'm only a casual fisherman) which is the Fenwick HMG with a Daiwa BG2500.  I'm hoping this rod would be good for Salmon fishing on the American River and maybe surf fishing (or is it too short for surf?)?  What reel should I get to go with this? I am thinking something with the round baitcaster form factor to match the vintage feel.  Also it needs a new tip, can I just use any tip from a tip repair kit? I measured the rod blank to be 7/64"" at the tip.  Lastly it seems there is at least one eye missing (the biggest one) and needs a new eyelet and winding. What can I use as a replacement eye and where do I learn to wind like this?        "
1420,What is the minimum amount of water per day to survive?,"I am disabled in the wildness, there are no natural water sources available.  I have 2 gallons (7.5 liters) of water.  The only practical solution is to sit and wait for rescue. I will be resting in the shade. How much water should I drink each day to survive as long as possible?  I have a memory from school that the kidney is obligated to produce 500ML of urine each day.  That would seem to be lowest possible consumption.  I found a variety of amounts during an internet search.       With the possibility of urine output dropping to 500 ml, the minimum could be just over 1 liter a day or for the sake of making it easy to understand, this would be just over 32 ounces a day for a 154 lb man   Source     A normally active person needs about three quarters of a gallon of fluid daily, from water and other beverages.    Source(ready.gov)     Absolute Minimum Requirements...for replacement purposes, for an ""average"" person, has been estimated to be approximately 3 liters (3.2 quarts) per day, given average temperate climate conditions.   Source     one gallon of water per person, per day    Source (FEMA)     a minimum of 7.5 litres per capita per day will meet the requirements of most people under most conditions. This water needs to be of a quality that represents a tolerable level of risk. However, in an emergency situation, a minimum of 15 litres is required    Source (WHO)   With daily consumption of 500ML (~ 1/2 quart) the water would last 2 weeks, but would I survive?  A 7.5 liters (~2 gallons) the water would last a single day and I would die in about 3 days.   How much water should I ration myself each day?  "
1421,Do self-inflating sleeping pads have to be kept dry during trips?,"Context: I'm planning to take my self-inflating sleeping pad on a bike trip this year. The bike doesn't have any mounting points for a rack, so space is somewhat limited. Currently, my plan is to simply strap the pad to the handlebars in the manufacturer-provided stuff sack.   Question: Do self-inflating pads need to be protected from rain? Will water from the outside do any damage? I'm wondering whether I should get a dry bag or whether the (not fully waterproof) stuff sack is enough. "
1422,Is freezer bag cooking safe?,"Freezer bag cooking refers to cooking by boiling water in a pot, add the boiling water to a zip-lock type freezer bag filled with the meal, placing the filled bag in an insulating cozy, and letting everything soak/heat/cook until edible. I have read varying views on the safety of the method concerning adding boiling water to the plastic bag and chemicals leeching into the food. Andrew Skurka says:     Do you think it’s safe to heat food in a freezer bag? Ziplok does, based on the standards set by the EPA for food-grade plastics. I’m not concerned with what they know, but what they don’t know yet (a la BPA), and I’d rather not chance it when there’s a reasonable alternative.   while TrailCooking.com says about the safety of freezer bag cooking:      Our personal opinion is yes, but you really should do the research yourself and make your own informed decision. We have provided some discussion points and links below to help you make that decision.   Has anyone done a proper chemical analysis or study to determine if it is safe? "
1423,Straps around Olympic Halfpipe Snowboarder Legs?,"While watching the Ladies' Olympic Snowboarding Halfpipe in Pyeongchang, I noticed what appeared to be straps around the lower leg of each competitor. For example, here's a couple pictures of American champion Chloe Kim with said straps indicated:      And Chinese Silver Medalist Liu Jiayu:    And France's Mirabelle Thovex:    All images from screencaps of the NBC Olympics stream, available at [website]I am having trouble determining what exactly these are. My thoughts are:   Doesn't seem to be part of the team uniform, as I noticed these ""straps"" around the leg of athletes from several different countries (perhaps even all?).  With there being a strap around each leg, it wouldn't seem to be a snowboard leash (from the video, I didn't see any competitors remove a leash when taking off their board).  My best guess is some sort of electronic transmitters. If so, to what end? Providing analytics to broadcasters for the ""Maximum / Average Amplitude"" graphics? Data for judges to confirm number of rotations? Data for the athletes/coaches to analyze later?   While currently watching the Men's Halfpipe Final, these straps can also be spotted on several competitors (but, perhaps notably, not America's Shaun White). As not every competitor seems to be wearing these, it wouldn't seem to be something mandated by the IOC and thus presumably useful to the snowboarding world in general. Of course, it could be that other competitors are wearing them under their snowboarding pants? "
1424,"What can I do if I have 24-hour warning of very strong wind gusts (45–50 m/s), but I cannot reach a fixed shelter within this period?","Suppose I get one of those text messages, like the Icelandic authorities send to travellers:     ...Wind gusts could reach speeds that are known for blowing cars off the road and even pulling up the tarmac! 45-50 m/s, 112 mph or 180 km/h can be expected in some areas!...   Suppose I've been out for a long time already, and this system was too far away when I left.  And suppose I'm here:   Svartakvísl, central Iceland.  Nowhere to hide.  No building within 24 hour walking.  No caves.  I might be able to reach a canyon, but I have no clue if that's a safe place to hide.  Perhaps it will funnel the wind, or perhaps the wind may be associated with flash floods or landslides.  What can I do to be OK?  Is this a moment to call for emergency helicopter rescue (obviously BEFORE the storm hits)?  NB: I have read What is a good tarp setup for very high winds above the tree line?, but that question talks about 25 m/s winds.  I might consider sheltering in a very good and very well-pitched tent in 25 m/s wind gusts.  Not so when wind gusts may be up to 50 m/s.  I am not confident the answers there are wise for winds such as presently occurring in Iceland. "
1425,How to counter bindings getting loose on MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes?,"This weekend I was out for the third time on my MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes. I'm pretty happy with them, particularly the traction on ice or heavy crust. However, the bindings are driving me crazy! The bindings are rubber straps with eyelets. They wrap over your foot, and around a hook with a post that catches in the eyelet. The straps are stretchy, and the tension from the stretch holds the strap in place on the post. The excess strap folds back over, and is tucked into a small clip attached loosely to the root end of the strap.  My complaint about the binding is two fold. First, I really have to torque on the straps to hook an eyelet with enough tension to hold it securely on the post. The problem is particularly bad with the heel straps. Second, the excess strap invariably pops out of the tidying clip, and they all end up waving in the air. I then invariably catch the loose strap on something, the strap pops off the post, and I have to stop and re-secure the strap.  Has anybody had a similar experience with these bindings, or am I doing something horribly wrong? What can I do to keep the straps fastened securely? "
1426,Interactive online map of long-distance / marked trails against best freely available topographic map background,"I've recently learned about the U.S. national trails system, apparently akin to the European long-distance paths. I found an (incomplete?) table of U.S. national trails and a rather poorly layed out map.  Is there any website where long- and short-distance marked hiking trails are shown against a selectable background (such as on Wikiloc or Topomapper? For a single country is interesting, but the best would be something integrated.  Wikiloc lists less than 5000 trails in the contiguous United States (compared to ca. 250000 in Europe), so that's not the best resource — and even if the long-distance trails would happen to be listed, they're drowned in all the other material available.  "
1427,Hiking popularity in North America vs. Europe,"From browsing this site, I have learned that US national parks and wilderness areas have restrictions and that campsites need reservations, sometimes months in advance. I've never seen anything like it in Europe; in popular areas, there are simply many campsites and one meets hundreds of people per day (in extreme cases hundreds per hour) on the hiking trails, whereas in remote regions, there are no campsites and one meets nobody (in fact, one usually meets less than 10 people/day once more than two hours from the parking place). It's supply and demand. I haven't seen a full camp-site since 1994, and I've been camping every year.  North America has a lot of sparsely populated areas, probably more than Europe. This makes me wonder — how crowded do those hiking trails get? For example, suppose that one has obtained a permit for hiking + camping in the wild in Yosemite National Park. Since this is subject to a quota (correct me if I'm wrong), the total number of people hiking at a given moment should be pretty easy to know. How many people should one expect to meet under such circumstances, order of magnitude? 1 per day? 10? 100? Are quota set so that every hiker can have the opportunity to feel alone in the world, or so that hikers won't completely overrun the national park and destroy it?  Where does the difference between Europe and North America come from? Is nature in North America more sensitive than in Europe, is the demand for hiking much higher, or do hikers in North America concentrate even more in a few small areas than in Europe?  "
1428,Primitive fire starting in northeastern Brazil,"I live on the coast of the northeastern part of Brazil (Rio Grande do Norte). As you go inland, the terrain becomes very arid. There are cactus and a lot of xerophilic plants that remind me a lot of those from southern California or Arizona. Since the sun is almost always shining here, starting a fire with a magnifying glass isn't very difficult, but if you had to do so with the bow or drill method, what Brazilian plants would work best? Fire-starting methods often involve a spindle and a hearth. What plants or woods would be most suitable for that in the interior regions of northeastern Brazil? "
1429,Where in Europe is wilderness meeting the U.S. wilderness definition?,"In this excellent answer, LBell quotes the U.S. definition of wilderness:     (1) generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable; (2) has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation; (3) has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition; and (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value.   Is there any place in Europe that meets these requirements?   The far north of Europe, e.g. Lapland or Nordkalotten, is quite sparsely populated and large. It certainly has solitude and in the land pictures below, one can hike for weeks without meeting humans. However, the Sami people have done reindeer husbandry for centuries, in the modern time using snowmobiles and helicopters. Most visitors won't notice the effects on vegetation (but biologists certainly do). Other effects are a lack of predators. The most visible and annoying effect are probably the tracks from the quads the Sami use in their reindeer herding:     Tundra with quad-tracks in the far north of Sweden, in Torneträsk-Soppero Fjällurskog Naturreservat   In Scotland, the forests have been cut centuries ago.  Same in most of the rest of Britain, most notably the uplands, where the National Trust in some cases actively combats reforestation. In many European countries, protected nature areas appear to be mainly where men has previously tried but failed to exploit the land. The Swedish Muddus national park is an example of that, as is the Dutch nature reserve Naardermeer. The Polish-Belarusian Białowieża Forest is a remnant of a previously vast primeval forest, but has an eventful history, and I'm not sure if it would fit the aforementioned definition.   I think, if there is wilderness anywhere in Europe (not counting Arctic islands such as Svalbard), it's likely to be in far north--eastern Europe, where there exist vast areas with very few people. For example, Komi is 415,900 km², roughly the size of California or Sweden, with less than a million people concentrated in a handful of cities. That's probably a wilderness area. Are there any others that are less peripheral? "
1430,What are some good gluten-free foods for backpacking?,"I have quite unfortunately found out several months ago that I'm gluten sensitive. Nearly all my meals I've planned and eaten on the trail have included wheat, and thus gluten, in some fashion. I'm still learning how to eat satisfyingly gluten-free at home, and on the trail this has proven to be even more of a challenge.  What are some good-tasting, calorie and nutrient-rich meals that I can pack on the trail that are gluten-free? For Breakfast, Lunch, and/or Dinner?  Answers can include full-prep from raw ingredients, freeze-dried type meals, or any other variation. "
1431,Rifugio (Mountain Hut) trek in Austria,"I'm interested in combining a three to five day ""rifugio"" based trek in southern Austria with a visit to Vienna.  In other words, I'd like to be able to fly in to somewhere nearby - Vienna, Salzburg, even Munich - and be able to conveniently drive/take public transport to the trail head. If I didn't fly in through Vienna I would want to fly out through it, thus combining a stay there with some hiking, in a place where cooking and a tent are not essential.  For an idea of the kind of place I'm looking for, I'll give two examples of places I've been to (that I liked). In Spain I flew to Barcelona, and took a bus to the Pyrenees and hiked in the St.Maurici region. In Italy I flew to Milan and drove to the Dolomites and hiked in the Rosengarten.  My prime ""candidate"" area is Gesäuse National Park, based on the answers below. Can anyone confirm that this is a good choice? Or offer a different suggestion?   (English) resources for finding/planning such a trip are of course also welcome. The German sites are difficult to use, even with the automatic translations.  Another thing that would be useful- in mid-July, is it necessary/advised to reserve your place in the rifugios in advance? There are some places where this is essential; in others there's no need even in high season. Obviously, if this is necessary it means a lot more planning is required; if not, I can just decide which way to go after I arrive in the park. "
1432,Sleeping in twos in one hammock,"My girlfriend and I both like sleeping in hammocks in the outdoors. We now sleep in two separate hammocks. However, I've seen many hammocks that are designed, or at least make it possible to sleep with two people in it. Most notably these two:   ENO DoubleNest Hammock ENO DoubleNest Deluxe Hammock   Possible advantages   Warmth: two people sleeping together is warmer (an advantage in colder environments) Weight: one hammock is lighter than two hammocks and two tarps Romantic: sleeping in two separate hammocks isn't really romantic, after all :)   Possible disadvantages   Warmth: two people sleeping together is warmer (a disadvantage in warmer environments) Space: it seems to me that you would just keep rolling into each other and won't actually be able to fall asleep; not necessarily from the lack of space, but rather from the natural effect of rolling to the middle of the hammock   My question is: has anyone tried sleeping (not just relaxing or sitting in it) with two in one of these hammocks? Is it doable? Would you recommend it?   To be honest, I'm fairly skeptical myself, but I wanted to ask this question anyway because of the potential advantages. We also can't try sleeping in it for ourselves, since we both have single hammocks and we don't know anyone who owns a double hammock (and I don't think any store is going to let us try for one night).   Please don't just say: that seems/doesn't seem to be a good idea. I'm looking for people who have actually tried it. I have heard a lot of opinions based on gut feelings already; that is not what I'm looking for. "
1433,Should I register caches when I know in longer perspective I will move?,"I've registered some caches in Poland. It strike me that reviewer from GeoCaching was asking how I'm supposed to service caches far from my home location. In the meantime I moved to Germany, which made caches registered near my 'home' location less serviceable than those register 'far from', but near my family location.  I'd like to register some caches here in Germany, but I know, that it is quite probable I will  change my location in a few years, and probably I will never have permanent 'home' location.  What should I do? I would like to register some caches, but I know I could service them no longer that a few years. Am I expected not to registered any caches at all, or I could create mountain caches, which are normally community-services? What proceeding will be accepted by geocaching community?  To be clear, I'm not asking for personal advice, but for general guidelines to obey in such cases. "
1434,Is a national forest always a forest?,"This question may seem obvious — but is a national forest always a forest? In Norway, statskog — which quite literally means national forest — is a state agency owning forest land, but also vast amounts of mountain tundra, marshlands, lakes, reindeer herding lands, mountain cliffs... in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if only a minority of statskog land is actually forested. Statskog owns 20% of Norwegian land area (with Finnmarkseiendommen, another public agency, owning another 15% of even emptier land).  How is the situation in the U.S.? Should I imagine a national forest as a large area of (possibly managed?) forested lands, or does forest like in Norway not literally mean forest? "
1435,End-of-season maintenance / storage tips for ski boots?,"After several trips with poor fitting hire ski boots, and having had no end of trouble finding suitable fitting hire boots at the current resort, I went and bought a fitting pair. The boots have been good, avoiding foot pain and apparently making the skiing easier. The only downside of buying them here is that I can't understand a word of the information leaflet that came with them...!  Rather than trying to type the whole thing into Google Translate, I thought it might be easier to ask here - what maintenance (if any) should I do on the boots at the end of the trip? And with that done, is there anything special about how I should store them until next year? "
1436,Is a type of walking trailer a good alternative to a heavy backpack in off-road conditions?,"Heavy backpacks can spoil the pleasures of being in the outdoors. There are two ways to resolve this:   Carry less Find an alternative to the backpack   While the first option is usually the best one, it's not always possible to carry less. If you head into a cold environment where you have few if any opportunities to resupply, you just have to take a lot of food, clothing, etc. and it will make your backpack heavier.   I've been looking into other options. I've stumbled upon the walking trailer. To give a specific example: the Radical Design Wheelie III (video demonstration).  A couple of questions:   Has anyone here tried one of these? How do they behave on off-road terrain? I'm obviously not going to climb a mountain with one of these, but they should be able to handle mild off-road conditions. Can they handle a bit of (ab)use? I don't want a wheel breaking off in the middle of nowhere. Is there a cheaper alternative? The Wheelie III costs €550 (about $735): that's quite a lot of money for a bag on wheels.  "
1437,For what it's worth: climbing-tape,"The other day I used some mysterious, ultra-sticky climbing-tape at my local gym, which got me thinking: How much should I be paying for my tape?  Prices for climbing-specific tape seem to be somewhat upward-sticky (econ-pun intended.) I have gloved up with Metolius tape for $4 a role and I have used generic athletic tape for almost half that. I did noticed a difference in their performance, which made me wonder:  Is some tape best used for specific situations? When is it best to go with the more expensive, climbing-specific tapes and when and what can I tape with the cheap stuff? What kind of tape is best for gloves that I am going to be using once, and should I spend more on reusable tape-gloves? Is one kind of tape better for fingers? What other tapes are out there that are either super sticky or super cheap? "

1441,What is the best way to give an injured bird water?,"There is this pigeon that I found the other day, it couldn't fly, had a chewing-gum attached to its wing, and probably a hurt neck, it would just sit and weep.  I fed the bird with water using a cotton ball. I dipped the cotton ball in water and press it gently near its beak to feed water, and the bird did actually drink the water.  I thought using a dropper tube would be a better choice? What would you do?  Info: I took the bird to a vet doctor and its absolutely fine.  "

1443,How often do I need to clean my rimfires?,"When is it necessary to clean a rimfire firearm?  Only after exposure to excessive moisture?  Only when it begins to malfunction (for autoloaders)?  With some frequency of shooting, or time, or before extended storage?  Update: Since I'm lazy, I want to know what the minimum reasonable cleaning frequency would be. "
1444,"Does keeping the crossbow cocked for long periods of time, (i.e. while hunting), harm the crossbow in any way?","I'm thinking about getting into bow hunting, and I'm wondering about the mechanics of crossbows.  I assume that I wouldn't cock the crossbow at the time I see a target, and I also assume that I wouldn't cock the crossbow and then leave it like that from one hunting season to the next.  So how long is it safe to keep a crossbow cocked?  Can it stay cocked for a full day in the woods?  I'm concerned both about my personal safety as well as keeping my equipment in good shape. "
1445,4x4 vs AWD off road,"Could my compact SUV/AWD handle a regular off road track that's suitable for 4x4? Is it a dumb/risky idea?  I understand it would depend on the type and condition of the SUV, the track and the weather. But some general information from someone who have tried an all wheel drive on a unpaved mountain 4wd track would be good. "
1446,Combine backpack and back protection when snowboarding?,"In the past I have mostly been snowboarding with a simple every-day backpack to hold some lunch and other small stuff. But since it's very loose, not waterproof and not spacious enough sometimes I'm now thinking about getting the right equipment, buying a proper backpack and maybe an emergency kit with a shovel etc.   But upon researching backpacks I started wondering: A lot of them already have at least some sort of a padded back to provide some protection - like this one    So do I then even need a dedicated back protection on top of that?  What I have found about this on the internet is this discussion on snowheads where the tone mostly seems to be in favor of dropping the extra protector (unless of course you ride without backpack on a given day) especially if you carry a shovel back there anyway.  This company seems to want to tackle this problem by selling a true protector that can unfold into a backpack, but it seems to me the major benefits of a backpack (separate compartments, structure, waterproof sections...) are then lost.   So my questions are:   Should you wear back protection under your backpack? Is it disturbing or even unsafe to combine the two? Might things start to slide out of position? Should I be looking for a backpack with no proper padding if I wear a protector?  "
1447,Tying up a tent to the sack,"How to tie up a tent to a sack in order to carry it over a long distance?  I recently bought this sack, and I carried it over this weekend with my 4-men tent, and it was damn bad a day to have it along. Its a large tent, so it doesn't fit into my pack, I have to pack it separate. And the bag/pack they have provided with tent doesn't really have anything that makes it easy to carry. The only way I see is to attach it to my backpack. The pack would definitely lean on the side the tent was attached. And I had to tighten up the same shoulder strap so the it doesn't swing my back around, that killed my shoulder.  How would you tie-up such a tent and managing the load distribution with that? "
1448,Legal permits required for trekking in Canada,"I will be travelling to Canada for a business trip, and I can spare a weekend in between my schedule. I'd be keen to trek/hike near Vancouver, and I have banked upon hiking The Stawamus Chief. As I'll be there as a technocrat, am I legally allowed to hike in Canada? Or do I have to comply to any legal procedures? "
1449,What makes certain mountains more dangerous than others?,"Why do mountains like K2, Nanga Parbat and Annapurna (36 successful attempts, 47 failed) have higher fatality rates than, say, Everest or Cho Oyu (79 successful attempts, 28 failed)? (source)  Can I use these statistics to determine what aspect of mountaineering is the most dangerous, between the summit ridge, sudden weather changes or shaky snow bridges? "
1450,Climbing Kilimanjaro for a newbie,"It looks like I'm going to be living in Nairobi for a few years. Along with all of the other amazing opportunities for adventure around here, there's this giant mountain just over the border. Since I'm so close, I've started thinking about whether I could/should attempt the climb, and what I would need to do to prepare.  Given that most of my hiking experience has been day hiking in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, how would I begin to prepare myself for a trek of this magnitude? I've never really done any backpacking or multi day hikes, so I'm mostly starting from scratch. Where do I begin?  Like I said, I'll be here for a few years, so I've got lots of time to prepare. I don't want to go rushing into it willy-nilly. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to get started with something like this. "
1451,Understanding/comparing via ferrata grades?,I have a bit of experience going on via ferratas. But never wondered about their grading.  I know that most countries have 1 to 5 grading systems. From that I have seen grade 1 would be doable by any body without any outdoor experience. Now how would higher grades correspond to fitness and experience?  Could it be compared with scrambling or rock climbing grades? 
1452,Black bears and torch lights,"I am hiking in black bear country (no other kinds of bears there). It's dark, I have a whistle hanging around my neck to scare away such a potential bear and I'm using my torch light to be able to see the path.  Now, for some reason, the light and noise I made till now were not enough to scare away a bear. It stands on the path, 10 meters away from me.  I'll blow that whistle soon, but what do I do with my torch light? Do I   shine it into the bear's eyes to blind and frighten it? activate the stroboscopic mode on the torch and / or wave it around wildly to create a lot of shadows and confusion? shine it on the path between me and the bear so that the bear is able to keep its night vision and run away? shine it at myself to appear brighter and more impressive?   I've been hiking like that recently, so I was wondering what the best reaction would have been in case of an encounter. "
1453,Lodging while hiking the European E-paths,"I am researching the E-paths and trying to figure out what people do for lodging during their hike.  It's Europe, so could I just pitch a tent wherever?  Are there marked campsites?  Do I need to stay at an inn? "
1454,How to go about a long traverse with just Undercut holds?,"I just recently got information about an easy climbing route. I am not sure about the grade though. The only part the worries me is a traverse, which is exposed. And long traverses have always been my weak point. I have a couple months to prepare and practice. I plan to give it a try as soon as winter hits.  The traverse is full of all the Undercut-type holds. How can I practice specifically for traverses? How should I go about a traverse with Undercut holds specifically? "
1455,What to do if a team member falls sick?,"Recently I fell ill whilst car camping and it made me consider the situations when not around amenities. In addition to this I recently was part of a four man, one dog team climbing Snowdon and one of us fell ill with a severe migraine, and we carried on despite the migraine as the team member wished to do so, which also got me thinking.   Obviously there is only so far the common sense and opinion of someone who is unwell can be taken before someone has to step in for the sake of their safety, and I understand obviously some sicknesses are more serious than others but I would assume it is better to stop in the location you are in, or slow your trek down with plenty of rests. If you are in a large group, meals and toilet areas would I assume also become a problem if you are in an area for a while.  If a member of your team falls sick mid-trek, and you are rather far from the closest amenity, what is the best cause of action to ensure the safety of the individual as well as the team?   Are there any essential practises that the team leader / first aider should consider? "
1456,Acquiring a Camp Site at the Everest Base Camp,"I was just going through the details about processes and dependencies, and associated tough-nuts with planning and executing a trek to Everest Base Camp from Nepal side. In the same context, I had previously asked a question about travelling and itinerary to reach Namache Bazzaar.  Whilst, I have most of the necessary information about the route and day-viz plan along with the accommodation en-route, I was recently informed by a fellow (who spends a quite a lot of time in and around Himalayas) that with the kind of a season I am looking forward to, I'm most likely gonna find the trek pretty much crowded. As per my current plan, I can somehow put extra efforts and make a way-back trip to EBC instead of staying there, but I'd certainly like to have a stay for a day or two at the EBC and have a look at the level of preparation the summit aspirants have.  Having said this, I also heard a people mentioning that the base camp settlers often mark their sites with spray paints for their clients and all sorts of things, that sounds weird. And as we all know you don't wanna have to bivouac there with extreme weather and amount of littering the expeditions cause. The area around EBC is painted yellow with human waste. Marking a site to acquire it is not a new trend as I see, since Rob Hall had a huge area marked as his campsite by spray paints on and around  boulders saying ""NZ"" which meant ""New Zealand"". With all due respect, that is quite annoyingly stupid. Though it doesn't seem like his direct order, it was his settlers who might have done that.  If I be stubborn and insist to have a stay, is it necessary to have a campsite booked or reserved if that is the right word to use? How much this stupid booking thing may cost considering a busy season?  I can still make it a way-back day schedule, but asking just in case I want to or I may have to camp there at EBC.  Note: The base camp I am referring to is from Nepal side. "
1457,Do flashlights (torches) with multi-color capabilities have any applications for usage in the great outdoors at night?,"Do flashlights (torches) with multi-color capabilities (white, red, blue and green) have any outdoor applications for usage in the forest or while hiking at night?  I have several flashlight that have multi-color capabilities and would like to know how these various colors of light may be used in the great outdoors?  This question is similar to two other questions that can be found on this site, yet are somewhat different:     What are the pros and cons of using a red colored light source for hiking at night?      My head torch/lamp has a red mode, why?    Could someone explain how these four colored lights could be useful to us in our adventures (hiking, hunting and so on) in the wild? "
1458,What is pelt sealing and why is it required for certain species?,"According to the NYS DEC's website, if you hunt &amp; kill certain species (bobcats, martens, etc.) you must get its pelt 'sealed'.  If you Google pelt sealing you'll get a strange list of articles, some of which mention the use of plastic tags applied to the pelt, but none (that I could find) that really explain what pelt sealing actually is.  More importantly, why seal a pelt? Why only for certain species?  I feel like this little tidbit of knowledge is an example of something that is well known by the hardcore hunting community, but hasn't really be made public knowledge to the unwashed masses. Any ideas? "
1459,When should I carry both a wind jacket and hard shell?,"I warm up very quick and sweat a lot, that's why I am usually looking for the most breathable equipment. My chose is regular fleece plus a breathable wind breaker on top if there is wind. (Please refer to this article: Fleece or Soft Shell?). But for the rain I also carry a waterproof hard shell.  When would one carry both a wind jacket and waterproof hard shell?  When would one carry just one of each? "
1460,What can I do about a rock climbing ban?,"Authorities have recently banned climbing in my favorite site ""for safety reasons"". This is, in my opinion, unfair, and was done for unknown political reasons.  What can I do to hopefully change their minds so that climbers can continue to access the site?   Also, what proactive/ preemptive things can I do as a climber so that this doesn't happen in other climbing areas?  "
1461,Correct and incorrect slip-slap-slide belay technique,"This blog has a discussion of the slip-slap-slide and PBUS techniques for taking in rope when belaying. Here is a video demonstrating PBUS. Slip-slap-slide is illustrated on p. 161 of Freedom of the Hills, 8th ed. I use PBUS, and as the blog discusses, it's becoming almost universal now to teach beginners PBUS. 95% of the people I climb with use it.  This can create some issues if I'm climbing with someone who uses slip-slap-slide, because I have a hard time telling if they're doing it properly. If they're experienced, that's fine, but sometimes I'm climbing with people who seem like beginners, and I want to be able to detect whether they're doing slip-slap-slide wrong.  (1) Can anyone point us to an online video that shows a correct slip-slap-slide belay? Searching on those keywords on youtube didn't quickly turn up anything for me.  (2) Can anyone describe any common mistakes that beginners make with slip-slap-slide? One thing I'm not clear on from the diagram in FotH (which is an overhead view) is during which parts of the cycle the brake hand is up in the air rather than down by the leg. "
1462,Why are there separate seasons for archery and firearm hunting for deer?,"I was reading up on Pennsylvania's hunting regulations and noticed there are different seasons for the hunting of deer with bow-and-arrow and firearms. Why is this?  I can understand hunting seasons in general, because you don't want to disrupt the mating and birthing cycles, but why does the method affect this? One kill is one kill... "
1463,How to learn route setting?,"I started setting routes in the small bouldering gym of our climbing club. I'm basically learning by doing this, so my approach is basically to try to think of some interesting moves, put up the holds and then tweak the route. Pretty often, this includes finding out that the move I intended doesn't work, or that there is a shortcut that completely takes away the challenge.  So my question is: How do I  get from trial-and-error route setting to something more systematic? Are there any important points to consider when starting route setting? Even though my context is bouldering, I'm also happy about any hints that apply to route climbing. "
1464,Why would archery season be either before or after rifle season?,"Are there any reasons, other than tradition, to have archery season either before or after rifle season?  I was chatting with a couple of Stack Exchangers when one of them remarked that in Pennsylvania, it was rifle season, to which the other replied that in Oregon, rifle season had ended and they were in archery season. Apparently, archery season in Pennsylvania had already ended.  This discussion has already led to the question  Why are there separate seasons for archery and firearm hunting for deer?  But what I'd like to know is what the reasons are to have one go first. Why have the archery season either before or after rifle season? Or is that a matter of tradition?    Clarification: I'm not asking why there are separate seasons, as that has already been asked in the linked question. I would like to know the reasons for having one of them be the first, especially seeing that Oregon and Pennsylvania have them in opposite order. "
1465,Lead climb weight ratios,"I'm about 150ish lbs and my partner is 100ish lbs.  I've read somewhere that a 2/3 weight ratio between belayer and climber is ok for lead climb, but I don't remember exactly where.  Can someone confirm this?  Looking around the net, I'm getting conflicting and not very authoritative answers.  I was thinking of getting a weight vest of around 10 or so lbs to increase the weight ratio, but I'm also thinking that this may be problematic as the belayer's center of gravity is then raised.  Could that be an issue?  I was also considering ankle weights of 5 lbs a piece (total 10 lbs).  Could this cause an increase chance of knee injury?  Any other ideas that I may not be thinking of? "
1466,What to do with a yacht when a stronger blast come?,"When you're sailing upwind (in close reach) and there comes a stronger blast of wind, how should skipper behave? Should they turn away from the wind (because modern yachts are constructed so that weather helm occurs in stronger wind and th skipper wants to prevent the boat from going into the wind and because the true wind accelerates, so the angle of apparent wind changes and moves more to the back, making the yacht sail more downwind tah before) or turn towards the source of wind (because the closer they get to the no-go zone, the slower will the yacht sail and on the edge of no-go zone yacht sail almost upwards, without the lean)? "
1467,How much heel is optimal on a small katamaran in low wind?,"I am a novice sailor (at best) and natively German-speaking, so the question might contain incorrect use of sailing terms and further misconceptions - thanks for any pointers in comments.  In high wind it's clear: You lean out over the side of the boat to help keep it upright. In lower wind, there seems to be two counteracting effects regarding speed:   More heel (not/less leaning out): Second hull has no/less water contact -> less friction. Less heel (more leaning out): More effective sail area towards the wind (better angle).   Are these statements even correct? And if they are, which is more important? And/Or are there other (more important) effects I didn't think of? "
1468,How real is the danger of suffocation in an Igloo?,"Last weekend I spent a night in an igloo. The event was organised by professionals (it was a company retreat) and during the night there was always one of the guides awake making rounds and checking on the people in the igloos. They also made sure that the entrances stayed clear (there was some heavy snowfall).  For oxygen, the method the guides used was to put a small candle inside every igloo: their reasoning being that should the candle go out, the people in the igloo would have to be evacuated because the oxygen was getting low (so that was what they were checking on regularly).  I was wondering:   How real is the danger of suffocating in an igloo with an open entrance, but without air holes in the cupola? How real is the danger of suffocating should the entrance (and any potential air holes) be covered by heavy snow fall in the night?   I'd be interested in an estimate of how much time can pass before you should start to be worried...  And maybe as a follow up:   How often would one have to check for clear entrance / air holes in case where there is no person staying up all night?   Let's assume an igloo for 3 people (maybe 2m diameter), built with a 'siphon' style entrance of maybe 50cm diameter (i.e. the entrance makes a bend that is the lowest point of the igloo, thus trapping the warm air inside).  Edit: This is a safety-critical topic, please back up your answers. At the very least reports of experienced mountaineers / guides, even better actual research data or accident reports. "
1469,"Can you ""kick and glide"" and climb without skins in Alpine Touring ski gear?","I am wondering about the ""cross country like"" aspects of Alpine Touring gear.   I am in Ontario Canada, where hills as small as 75 meters can be referred to as ""mountains"". I'm a relatively experienced cross country skier, but I like the idea of being able to clip in and use alpine turns on steep downhills (even short ones). In addition, any touring I do locally is going to be on ungroomed trails, and snow that is only 20 to 40cm deep, and covering relatively short distances (2 to 3 hour day trips).  How does Alpine Touring gear perform in situations where you are traversing long flats, and climbing and descending short hills of varying steepness.    Specifically:  Can you achieve good glide using a ""kick and glide"" technique, is it reasonably conformable?  Are skins absolutely required for climbs or can one get away with the herringbone technique?  Any other reasons I might be missing that would make me regret Alpine Touring skis for this application? "
1470,With what unit are river flow speeds indicated on the Genshtab Soviet military maps?,"On the Genshtab (Генштаб) Soviet military maps, I can read that this ford through the stream Вертный has a stony bottom, a depth of at most 4 dm, and a width of 29 m (under typical circumstances)¹.  That is indeed fordable.  It also indicates that the flow velocity is 0.6, but I can't find anywhere what unit the velocity is in.  I've found an English language legend as well as a more detailed Russian language legend — screenshot below — but neither appears to describe the units.  I would expect it to be km/h, but it might be m/s, which is a factor 3.6 different.  What unit is it in?  I'm starting to learn Russian but I don't understand enough yet to find this information.    I'm sure the quantity is speed and not total flow, because this small mountain stream (15 metre wide, 0.5 metre deep) has 2.5 speed units, whereas this river downstream (1310 metre wide, 10 metre deep) has 0.4 speed units.    ¹These maps are awesome… where else in the world can you find such detail on topographic maps? Sorry, that's not my question here but I just wanted to say that :) "
1471,Are liner mittens significantly warmer than liner gloves?,"Under a windproof shell mitten, is an insulating liner mitten significantly warmer than an insulating liner glove made of the same material and thickness?  This is a different question from ""Are mittens warmer than gloves?"" because that question is about mittens vs. gloves that aren't inside a windproof shell mitten.  Some facts (I think):   When exposed to the atmosphere, mittens are warmer than gloves because a mitten has less surface area to conduct heat or release water vapor. Wind strips away the layer of warm moist air from next to the skin, speeding up conduction and evaporative cooling. Insulation works by trapping air (a very slow conductor) close to the skin and slowing down convection within that layer of air -- that's why the walls of buildings are lined with fiberglass batts instead of left empty. Wind makes insulation less effective by forcing air through the gaps, causing convection.   Speculation based on that:  Liner mittens and gloves equally do the job of trapping air next to the skin and limiting convection. Inside the windproof shell mitten, either one works at maximal effectiveness. Because there's no material between the liner and the shell to prevent convection, and because the shell doesn't prevent conduction, we can assume the air inside the shell is about the same temperature as the air outside. But the shell does minimize evaporative cooling by minimizing the surface area that's exposed to the wind.  It seems the only difference between the liner mitten and the liner glove is that the glove has more surface area for conduction with the air inside the shell mitten. But is that conduction even significant? It's a confined environment inside the mitten, and the fingers of the liner glove are usually in contact. "
1472,Bird seed for Robins and Tits,Do Robins like the mixed seed bird food I can buy from the garden centre? What bird feeder should I use for Robins and Tits? 
1473,What is the best way to cross a wide river in winter?,"Conditions:   I live near a wide (~1000ft or 300m) and fairly deep river across from the area where I work. This area is slightly earthquake prone -- near a fault line that has had multiple magnitude 7+ earthquakes. While there is a bridge nearby, if that bridge were to collapse, the next bridge is another 14 miles (23 km) away... the one after that is another 30 miles (48 km). The area is a major city region, often with clogged highways even in good weather, and no disasters. There are probably close to 100,000 people who commute over this river.   If a large earthquake were to hit again, it could take out my local bridge.  Assuming that I am escaping on foot, reaching the next bridge is a significant trek.  I live less than 2 miles from this river, so it's the shortest way home (by far).  There are no ferries in this area, either.  In the scenario where I have to rush home to my family after a disaster, what is the best way to cross the river in winter (note: the river rarely freezes, but it is often around 32 F / 0 C in the winter)?  Is the risk too great to try to cross the river (i.e. risk hypothermia from full submersion)?  A related topic is here:  River crossing in winter?  In this related topic, it mentions about how to handle your feet, but not your clothes.  Do I strip down and bag the clothes?  Do I invest in a lightweight blow-up raft and telescoping paddle?  Do I get a cold water wetsuit?  Something I considered is that if I travelled far enough outside of the city, I could probably hitch a ride, but the traffic might be terrible, or the bridges (if still standing) might be closed due to damage or rubble, thus rerouting traffic very far around (and ultimately away from my home and family).  A helpful table (source):   Update:  The river flows at an average surface rate of 2.5 mph (4 kph) -- a little slower than walking speed.  The gage height varies greatly.  As low as 7 ft (2.2 m) and as high as over 30 ft (9.2 m) during heavy periods of rain. The yearly average appears to be around 17 ft (5.2 m).  Temperature data puts it between 10 C and 1 C during the winter months (occasionally with surface freezing).  I don't need to enter the river.  I need to overcome the river in a very rare emergency situation, ONLY.  How do I reduce my risk and minimize the time to get to the other side of the river?  I assume that nearly all solutions will require ""hours"", but I want to avoid ""days"" (i.e. waiting for the national guard to setup travel routes and clear the roads). "
1474,Is it a good idea to do ski binding settings yourself?,"My bindings are already adjusted to my shoes, what is not adjusted yet is the release setting.  From what I can tell, the optimal release setting is fairly simple and depends on height, weight, age and skill.  It also seems, that this setting is adjusted by twisting a single screw on the binding.  Is there a valid reason (besides insurance) to not do this myself? Is there actually more to it, than following tables online?  My binding looks like this:    "
1475,Escaping tree well,"Last week, while exploring tree snowboarding at Big Sky, MT, I ended up in a tree well. I was up to my waist and was able to crawl out. But it felt awkward and I see how I could sink deeper.  My question is, should this happen again and to a greater depth, what are some techniques to get out, especially, if my head gets submerged in snow? While taking the snowboard off for moveability seems like a no brainer, will it actually cause me to sink deeper in the snow? "
1476,Are there tents with better space-to-weight ratio than tunnel tents?,"Sadly after many years my trusted Helsport tunnel tent1 took some damage in a storm that I'm not sure will be repairable. I'm therefore looking into the possibility of getting a new tent.  When I looked into tent trade-offs last, tunnel tents where the ones who provided the best ratio in terms of internal space2 for low weight.3  That was a long time ago though, I have have seen many new (and sometimes rather exotic) tent constructions here and there...   So are there tent constructions that provides more space than tunnel tents do for the same weight?  Some details on what I'm looking for and what not:   I'm looking for 3-season double-wall tent constructions. Size that I'm targeting: 2-3 person tent I'm not currently interested in ultralight-solutions. I do self-sustained treks of 1-2 weeks in northern Scandinavia - and quite frankly, I don't trust ultralight solutions enough to bring them with me on such a trip. As I hope my new tent will last me an other 10-15 years, I'm ok with spending some money. While an answer such as ""more expensive tunnel tents will be lighter than cheap ones"" isn't exactly what I'm looking for, if it boils down to it I'll go that way...     1 : My tent is probably the ancestor model to the Fjellheimen Pro Camp. Only like 20 years older. :) 2 : I don't need standing height. I'm mostly looking for space in the inner tent and a roomy vestibule for keeping packs etc. 3 : In comparison, dome tents tend to (tended to?) provide you the best stability/robustness in high winds and adverse conditions. "
1477,At what wind speed is hiking considered unsafe,"I have enough experience with mountain hiking, but in the area where I live (the Alps), the wind rarelly gets extremelly strong, so I have no idea about judging when it is actually unsafe to hike because of high wind speeds.   This winter I was in Tenerife, where I have attempted to climb Mount Teide. Due to public transport limitations I have decided to divide my climb into two days, and spend the night in the hut. On the first day, the wind was already very strong, but being sheltered by the side of the mountain, I had no problems reaching the hut. The people coming back from the peak, however, were all talking about how much trouble they had on the more exposed parts of the mountain.   I was hoping the conditions would get better on the following day. But in the morning the wind picked up even more. It was constantly between 90 and 100 km/h. Since there also was a thick fog, and I would have seen absolutelly nothing from the top of the mountain, I have decided to give up, and head down instead.   Ever since I have been wondering: had I decided to push on to the top, would it have been dangerous? What wind speed is too high for mountain hiking?  Edit as an answer to comments:  There was no snow or ice, so avalanche or slipping dangers were not an issue. The path itself was not technically challenging on its own (in good weather conditions tourists do the last bit after taking a gondola). The climb was super exposed though: no vegetation or shelter at that altitude, and Tenerife being an island, the winds come directly from the ocean. As I haven't been to the top, I am not able to tell how risky a potential fall would have been, but let's assume that like in most places in the mountains, there were at least some spots where the path was passing close to cliffs.   Actually, I do not want to make the question too tailored to this specific situation, because I prefer the answer to be usable in future situations I (or somebody else) will have in the mountains. All I want to know, if there is a specific estimate, how strong should a wind be, to be able to blow an average adult person off a cliff. I do understand that in specific situations where balancing is important (ridge crossing, scrambling or other technical climbing, etc) the safe wind speeds are surelly much lower.  "
1478,How to mitigate injury when falling into a crevasse?,"I've imagined this scenario many times: you break through a snow bridge and fall into a hidden crevasse, how should you react? The fear is, if you're wearing crampons, your foot may snag the ice during the fall, in which case you're likely to break your ankle and get flipped upside down (upside down in a crevasse is pretty much certain death). Or you end up deep in the crevasse seriously injured which leaves you helpless and unable to help yourself out.   I've heard of skiers and snowboarders having success in minimizing injury by putting their feet across against the opposite wall and slowing their descent.  There's lots of info about crevasse rescue, but not much about how to react in the moment of the fall.  What can you do when you suddenly feel yourself starting to break through the snow and know you're going into a crevasse? "
1479,What is the purpose of being close-hauled when sailing upwind?,"When referring to a sailing boats course relative to the wind there are some clearly defined terms like ""beam-reach"", which is exactly perpendicular to the wind. A broader range like ""close-reach"" is defined as between ""beam-reach"" and ""close-hauled"". The latter is what I am not so sure about. Wikipedia defines it as     the craft's course is as close to the wind as allows the sail(s) to generate maximum lift.   That seems to make sense in terms of optimizing speed: If you go more leeward the boat with the tightly trimmed sails will capsize and if you go farther windward you'll get slower. All texts I read mention ""close-hauled"" as the ""normal"" direction when sailing upwind (not explicitly, it's just always the term used). However if your final goal is directly upwind, speed when sailing ""close-hauled"" competes with a direction closer to your final goal when pointing more windward.  What I would like to know is what exactly is the significance of sailing ""close-hauled""? Is it always (well mostly) the ideal course when sailing upwind? "
1480,How do you determine the optimum time to tack?,"In one of the Hornblower novels, he is being pursued by a French frigate on the first day of war.   During the chase, both the British and French ships are sailing upwind, and it is mentioned that the theoretically correct moment to tack is passing.     Once settled on the new tack the Loire’s natural advantages asserted themselves once more. She showed her extra speed and extra weatherliness; she drew up again from Hotspur’s quarter to her beam; then she could luff up briefly and gain a little more to windward on the Hotspur. The minutes passed like seconds, an hour like a minute, as the Hotspur plunged along, with every man braced on the heeling deck and the wind shrieking.      “Time to go about again, sir?” asked Bush, tentatively and greatly daring, but the theoretically correct moment was passing.      ...      The French captain was no fool, evidently. He had observed the Hotspur delaying past the best moment for tacking, he had seen the squall engulfing her, and had anticipated her action. He must have tacked at the very same moment. In consequence he had lost little while tacking, and that little had been regained by the time the two ships were in sight of each other once more.   Hornblower and the Hotspur  How exactly does one determine the best time to tack when optimizing for speed? "
1481,How dangerous is swimming fully dressed in cotton/denim clothes?,"There is a recent question What material is a good alternative to neoprene? one of the comments to an answer says:      whole suit filled up with water   I might be taking it out of context, but as I read the comment it seems to imply something I have heard previously that wet clothes in water are somehow significantly heavier than dry clothes on land.   Personally I have been fully dressed in the water several times. When I was in the Army we marched fully clothed in to deep water and expected to stay alive in the water (not cold) for an hour as part of ""Drown Proofing"". More recently I have found myself fully dressed and treading water (with a life jacket)   There is no doubt that once you get out wet clothes are heavy on land, but in water, they are just full of water, which weighs the same as water, hence it not any heavier. Often the clothes will also trap air and may add to your buoyancy.  I find that clothing also tends to keep me warmer.    How dangerous is swimming fully dressed in cotton/denim clothes? "
1482,What ever happened to the proposals for no-rescue zones for backpackers?,"Decades ago, there was a proposal that there should be no-rescue zones for backpackers, in which backpackers would be entirely on their own, and rescue by government agencies would not be permitted. (Private rescue operations would be permitted.)    See, for example, this 1984 article in Backpacker You're Losing Your Right to be Alone.   As I recall, the principal objection was, to put it crudely and sexistly, no agency could resist the pleas of a tearful mother whose son was lost and possibly seriously injured.  Public outcry would force government SAR.   Did this proposal just fade away?  Or was it never really taken seriously?    "
1483,What percentage of bacteria in water dies if it is boiled? How clean is it after boiling?,"When you boil dirty water, how clean would it be? Is it drinkable? "
1484,Efficient technique for handling trad gear?,"I have been practicing trad climbing and I've run into some difficulty managing and handling the gear. Specifically, I'm awkwardly taking cams off my gear loops, fiddling with them, and finally placing them in the crack. To summarize my basic technique:   Grab the carabiner of the cam with my hand and unclip from my harness. Bite the stem of the cam. Slide my hand to the cam trigger. Place cam and clip rope.   The #2 and #3 bullets seems awkward to me. I've found plenty of articles online about cam placement and harness configurations but can't find any about handling/managing techniques.  What technique am I missing here? Would a gear sling help? I referenced cams but I'm also having similar issues with nuts, so any and all advice is appreciated. "
1485,Best method of carrying fruits over a period of 3 days while on a trek,"While trekking, I prefer having fruits in the real form, not dried ones and no pulp or juices.  When carried without being squished fruits like apple, litchi and strawberries don't rot in a couple of days. But thats not the case for say citrus fruits like Orange, Sweet Lemon, Lemon or others like Grapes, Sapodilla, etc.   How would you carry these fruits that can rot over a period of two days?   One can ask a question why carry them? I do understand that you don't want to carry something that can rot. I am more keen about specifically Citrus fruits if not all of them are suitable, since the region I trek in, Oranges and Sweet Lemon are best suited fruits.  This question would typically limit to weather which isn't too extreme. (I agree, extremity differ heavily as we speak about various parts of the world, so I've simply added an ambient temperature range)  Temperature ranges: Maximum of 35 oC (95 oF) during the daylight, Minimum of 20 oC (68 oF) during early hours of the day and an hour before sunset. 7 to 10 oC (45 to 50 oF) during the night. "
1486,Are there any contaminates that become more toxic when boiled?,"The answers at How long does water need to be boiled for to kill all bacteria / viruses? indicates that boiling water kills bacteria &amp; viruses.  But boiling does not remove any chemical contaminates that might be present. Neurotoxins are not ""alive"" so they can't be killed, though some like botulinum toxin are denatured by heat.  Historically the practice of boiling vinegared wine in lead pans to sweeten it was problematic.  This was not due to a change, but rather leaching from the container (lead pan) to the fluid.   Are their any contaminates that might be present in water, that would become more toxic when boiled in modern containers? "
1487,Terminology and cues for reading river water when fly fishing,"When reading or watching videos on about reading water for fishing in English, I often come across terms like riffle, run, pool, seam, among others. However, when I get o the river ready to float that dry dropper over the riffle, I'm not so sure if I'm targeting the right area. I'm not even sure I perfectly understand what these terms mean.  Can someone help me to make sense of these terms and of which cues should I look for when reading the water.  Specifically:    I often read that seams are where two currents meet each other, but what should I look for? Pictures from the internet don't always look like what I see at the river. I can see that there are different currents when I have my line across more than one, but is that the only way to find seams? What are the general visual cues? Pool and run (also beat) are somewhat confusing for me. They seem to refer to the same thing: a stretch of fishable river water. Yet, how do I know where the pool/run/beat starts or ends? I know that this should be at the head/tail of the pool, but what should I look for to find these? I learn that riffles are faster shallow parts of the river, and I usually look for white foamy water. What is the difference between that and a rapid? Is it just a matter of semantics?  "
1488,How does one rewaterproof a rain jacket?,Let’s make this a two-part question:   What is the best way to rewaterproof a rain jacket? What is the best way to rewaterproof a rain jacket using only products available in a small town in remote Colombia?   While I'd guess the answer to #1 is “buy such-and-such product and use it” I’m currently living in Colombia and will not have access to any special treating products.  I have a rain jacket with an Event® membrane. 
1489,How much sea water can I safely drink?,"Anyone who has played in the ocean knows getting a little sea water in your mouth and swallowing it will not kill you.       Seawater contains salt. When humans drink seawater, their cells are thus taking in water and salt. While humans can safely ingest small amounts of salt, the salt content in seawater is much higher than what can be processed by the human body. Additionally, when we consume salt as part of our daily diets, we also drink liquids, which help to dilute the salt and keep it at a healthy level. Living cells do depend on sodium chloride (salt) to maintain the body’s chemical balances and reactions; however, too much sodium can be deadly.      Human kidneys can only make urine that is less salty than salt water. Therefore, to get rid of all the excess salt taken in by drinking seawater, you have to urinate more water than you drank. Eventually, you die of dehydration even as you become thirstier.   Source NOAA  If I am thirsty and I drink sea water, it will make things worse. During normal activities if you have taken in some sea water, you will naturally consume enough fresh water (or fluids) to flush excessive salt out.  Maybe the real question is; if you drink sea water, how much fresh water do you need to drink to off set the sea water you drank?  For every 1 unit of sea water, how many units of fresh water do I need to act as an antidote?   As pointed out in answers to the question How safe is drinking distilled water? it takes a lot of energy to make fresh water from sea water. Assume you are in a survival situation, with only sea water available, one of your companions has consumed a quantity (1 unit) of sea water. "
1490,Is a field tip as effective as a hunting tip for small game,"Note: This question is asked in an absolutely theoretical manner. NEVER hunt without proper equipment!  I often ask myself what probably would happen if I shoot small game with a field tip attached. I often feel like it would kill it just like a hunting tip (not talking about blunts etc.) would do, wouldn't it?  And if yes, which would be the size too big to kill with a field tip?  "
1491,What does a dark colored fur mean regarding a jaguar,"Long time ago I saw a jaguar (I believe it was one). The strange thing was, that it was extremely dark. I wouldn't refer to it as ""black"" but actually pretty dark.   What does such a color signal? Was it sick, young or just an optical illusion?  "
1492,Any disadvantages if I reuse fletches?,"I've had a lot of broken arrows a week ago. I decided to salvage them and carefully removed the fletches along with the other reusable things.   However, now that I have the fletches, I asked myself if it's even a good idea to reuse them!? Are there any disadvantages regarding the arrow behavior (like the second twisting may have influences)?  "
1493,"Went fishing on the river for full day, caught one fish; normal?","My dad, brothers and I grew up fishing. However, the vast majority of our fishing has been set it and forget it fishing for catfish, mostly at night.  My dad and father-in-law are in town for Thanksgiving, and so today I decided to take them on a fishing trip. We rented a pontoon, and drove up and down a nearby river fishing for the better part of 7 hours.   We caught one fish. We had maybe three bites total.  Is this normal? Here are the specifics of what we tried:   We're located in central Florida Mostly trying to not just ""set it and forget it"" but rather attempt to catch something more active (e.g., bass) We used live minnows, night crawlers, synthetic grubs, and a couple spinner lures. The majority of the fishing was with live minnows (my dad) and a spinner lure (me) We would drift along the bank, which would transition from trees to lillypads, and back. Large sections of lillys at a time. My dad would cast near as he could to the bank, and start a slow draw I would cast my spinner about 20 ft. into the lillys, and ""hop"" it over them We would try each spot for about 30-60 minutes before moving on   I'm not sure how to fish with a spinner lure. Maybe that was my problem? I would ""hop"" it over the lillys, and then I guess just maintain a steady 'not slow but slow enough' draw until it was back to the boat.  We caught one fish all day. On a rod that we'd cast and set aside while working on something else. A catfish.  Keep doing what you're good at I guess?  :)  Any advice? Any more details I can provide to help with giving me advice?  Main thing I guess is, we did have fun. And we plan on doing it again, soon. But, I'd rather actually catch some fish next time, if possible. "
1494,Does a tracer influence the arrow in any way,"I'm in doubt if I should attach tracers to my arrows. Of course, they make them better visible but I've heard rumors that they do influence the arrow (other than stated by the manufacturer).   Do they influence the arrow? And if yes, in which way?  Tracer:        Arrow tracers are meant to give you increased downrange visibility.   They also double as an effective wind check! (We include this added   benefit free of charge) With today's high speed bows and faster arrows   seeing where your arrows go is an advantage. These bright colors will   help you track your arrows in flight and if you ever miss your target   will aid you in finding your lost arrow.      By Merlin Archery  "
1495,Managing the garbage over a lengthy trek at higher altitudes,"Following the thread about Everest Base Camp related questions, its almost a globally known fact that the Everest Base Camp is very much crowded and consequently very much into garbage disposal problems. Various sources talk about the issue:    (Source 1) (Source 2)    I guess the kind of people visit the place are not entirely responsible to the garbage, or are they? These expeditions are lengthy and exhaustive, and they consume a lot of your energy and funds. Most of the visitors prefer to have porters. With such people you can't expect them to pack their own non-biodegradable waste to be brought along to the civilized areas where the waste can be disposed in a proper way. They should do the very best effort to do so, but its practically not possible for everyone to follow the protocol.  This garbage dump at the Everest Base Camp is really a potential threat to hygiene and can jeopardize an expedition for such a stupid cause.   Is it the crowd, (or should I say mob) sole reason for it getting that bad with Garbage issue? I always believe managing own garbage is the way to go in nature, and should be made mandatory by means of well-drafted rules and regulations. But considering the geography, How one should really go about managing own garbage at higher altitudes and camps set at higher altitudes?   Is there a solid solution to prevent this problem? This would really sound like a very broad issue, and I do not expect an answer here at the forum, this is organizational stuff, but this question has to be raised and talked about.  Narrowing the scope, I'd like to say that as I am planning to go there in near future, not for a summit but for a Base Camp trek, I'd like to receive any suggestions and ideas using which I wouldn't add more to the issue, and can manage my own trash. I always do, but this is going to be a trek of nearly 2 weeks, from Kathmandu, to Kathmandu and that make it a challenge to carry own stuff that too including the garbage. I am not sure about the garbage disposal infrastructure at Lukla, if there is any.  "
1496,What formation to best survive a flood?,"I just heard of an incident where a group of people were caught unprepared by a flood. It is known as the ""Bulacan State University Field Trip"", Looking at the images online, I couldn't help but ponder as to whether their formation stance was a facilitator to their death and if a better formation could have saved their lives ? A similar incident also known as the ""Tragic Patalpani Accident"" had people standing in a horizontal formation. So my question is, assuming a group of 5 or more people are being stuck in a river with the stream approaching them, what formation could best save their lives calculating the water pressure and impact on their formation ? could standing using the line formation as drawn in the picture be better ?   "
1497,How to repair the broken stitching and seams in my leather boots?,"After several years of abuse and poor care my boots have completely gone at the seams around the inner ankle (see photos)     What can I do to repair my boots? My current plan is to just get some thick thread and just resow them, but I am concerned about whether they will be at all waterproof afterwards. Is there anything else I should do/consider?  My boots are leather and made by Meindl if it makes any difference  P.S yes, I should definitely look after my boots better so they don't get in this state, but ts a bit late now... "
1498,"How durable is cuben fiber in real, practical use?","For years I've seen high-tech cuben fiber gear and drooled over how incredibly lightweight it is, and longed to buy or make some of my own equipment with it. (Then upon seeing the price tag, well, my mouth then closes.) It's made of Dyneema so it's theoretically quite a strong fabric for outdoor gear as well. It's become almost a staple material among the super-ultralight gear crowd, but I don't personally know that many people (well, none) who have any equipment utilizing this wonder-material. It's also not common among mainstream manufacturers, being primarily used by cottage gear-makers or DIY outdoors enthusiasts.  What research I've done online is also not very convincing because it is generally based on what the material is supposed to do, and not what it actually does in real-world scenarios.  What I'm interested in knowing is:   How durable is cuben fiber? How does it stand up to abrasion, punctures, tearing, repeated folding/packing... How does it's durability compare to sil-nylon (silicone impregnated nylon) which is quite the mainstream lightweight fabric today. (Also much cheaper.) And once it's damaged, how difficult is it to repair? Does it have ""self-healing"" properties like sil-nylon?  "
1499,What lighting equipment do I need for playing ultimate frisbee at night?,"Suppose I want to play a 10-people outdoor ultimate frisbee game at night, with no power outlets available at the field. I expect it to last no more than 2 hours.   What kind of portable power supply should I buy? What kind of lighting should I be looking for? How do I know the light and power supply are compatible and how long it will last?  "
1500,During high-altitude lengthy expedition: To shave or not shave?,"""Should one be shaving on a lengthy high altitude trek?"" shall be the question that I'd like to ask to great mountaineers with wisdom in high-altitude mountaineering. If you have observed, there are so many mountaineers who do not prefer (or should I say bother?) to shave during an expedition.    Has it got any scientific or significant reason for they being aberrant, beyond the lethargic approach of being socially good? (Culture is different up there at the mountains)  Of course, a shaving trimmer is a handy instrument to take along, what are the pros and cons of shaving against not shaving, and vice versa?  For example, having a face covered with beard can really keep your jaws from freezing? But, then do we jeopardize the hygiene, as we may not face wash everyday?  P.S.: I am restricting the scope of the question to Facial Hair only. "
1501,How do to a safety knot when abseiling with 2 ropes?,If I'm abseiling with a double rope what's the common way to add a safety knot? Is it a prusik knot around the 2 ropes instead of 1 or something like 2 prusiks? 
1502,How should I choose between setting up a Cordelette or an Equalette climbing anchor?,I was going through anchoring techniques and I came across this well-received question: Anchor without cordelette?   How should one decide when to go for a Cordelette or an Equalette? 
1503,How to take care of climbing hands?,Being a climber one aim is to toughen up your hands (related: How to toughen up hands?). Building up callused skin is important but how do you keep it? Having dry hands especially from the climbing itself I suffer from skinning.  What's the best method to take care of your hands/skin?   Just use moisturiser or is it better to use those waxes they are selling for climbers pretty expensive? What are the differences and what are general suggestions? 
1504,Belay checklist?,"I've learned several points in rock climbing where one must perform checks, but none that come with a checklist. And there is a serious difference.  I passed an indoor belay test roughly as follows: when asked to check everything, I said something like: ""check that the rope has 2 sets of 5... tighten the knot to make sure...  no more than 6"" of loose rope... [several others]""  And these are all intelligent things to check. The problem is: how do I know I didn't miss any? On live climbs I remember one time I definitely forgot to check my partner, for instance.  The answer is not ""make your own checklist."" A checklist needs to be standard and perfect to assuage the temptation to play with it and mess it all up. But so far I haven't learned a standard one used for belaying. Is there one I should know, or has anyone in the community taken care to develop a personal one that works well? "
1505,What good factual books have you read on an outdoors topic?,"What books have you read that have given you a better understanding of an outdoors activity?    Ideally I would like to compile a list for all activities.  e.g.:    Climbing Canoeing Backpacking Backcountry cooking Bike touring   For instance:   Mountain Biking - Mastering Mountain Bike Skills by Brian Lopes and Lee McCormack is one of the best books I have ever read.  I bike every day and mountain bike a couple times month.  This book has drastically improved my technique and answered many questions I had on riding.     Note: I know that this question is subjective and there is no definitive answer.  If someone can think of a way to change the question to make it have a definite answer please feel free to edit.  Otherwise, can someone change this question to 'community wiki'?  Thanks. "
1506,Rappelling in the Rain,"Last night I had a nightmare that I was 5 pitches off the ground and it started to pour rain. When I woke up I realized I have no idea how to deal with this.  Asking around, everyone says two things:   Don't get caught in this situation. Plan better than that. Rappel down.   In reality, I do plan better than this. But I believe in being prepared. How do you rappel in the rain?  What are the challenges? I assume the problem is that the rope is mad slippery. Is that the only problem? How do you deal with that? "
1507,What is the main purpose of the foam inside a self-inflating mat?,"All self-inflating mats I have seen are self-inflating in the sense that you’re supposed to inflate them yourself. [That is, the mat self-inflates a bit, but mostly you have to breathe the air in.]  Given this, what purpose does the foam inside the mat serve? If there was none, wouldn’t the mat be lighter?  My hypothesis is that the foam prevents the air from moving inside the mat, thus greatly increasing the heat resistance. Is that the case? (Do you have some dependable sources?) "
1508,Minimizing ecological impact of winter-sports in the backcountry,"I have heard that skiers and snowboarders can do a lot of damage to an ecosystem. I am interested in the following backcountry wintersport activities and would like to do them responsibly.   cross-country skiing snowshoeing ascending with snowshoes and descending by snowboard   I have the following questions:   At what snow-cover depth are little saplings, bushes and mountain-tundra vegetation protected from those activities? Is it best to go to wilderness areas that are already being impacted by backcountry winter sports, or does this increase the damage done to those habitats, making it a better choice to go to places that have not been impacted? What do I need to know about minimizing my impact on the local fauna? Are there types of ecosystems that I should not enter at all for these activities, since any kind of disturbance could cause long-lasting damage?  "
1509,Is freeze-dried food healthy?,"I've recently heard an opinion (from a sailor that attempted to beat a 122 day, westward route, around the world sailing record) that freeze-dried food is actually very healthy, as it contains less fat that normal meals and helps the metabolism.  Could you validate this opinion (only in terms of longer, i.e. lasting 30 days or more, tips)? Are there any (possible) health-related negative effects of freeze-dried food one should be aware of?  "
1510,How to create campfire which will burn overnight?,"I watched a documentary ""Man vs Wild"" which showed the TV presenter Bear Grylls collecting wood and starting a fire. He somehow always manages to keep his campfire burning until dawn. How does one know how much wood to collect such that it is adequate to last throughout the night? Is there a certain method of arranging the wood pile consisting of broken branches and twigs to maximize the period of combustion? "
1511,May hiking in Eastern California,"In May this year (6–8 May) I will have a workshop in Mammoth Lakes, California. I would like to do some hiking in addition to this workshop (roughly one week). I have never been to the United States, but I have considerably experience with trekking in the solitude of the tundra of northern Fennoscandinavia. I'm aiming for a solo wilderness hike with camping in the wild. At the end I should have some way of getting back to the beginning, as I will need to store away luggage somewhere.  There appear to be many scenic areas near Mammoth Lakes. From sources such as topoquest, National Forest Locator Map, and wilderness.net I find a number of areas in the vicinity: John Muir Wilderness, Inyo National Forest, Sierra National Forest, Ansel Adams Wilderness, Kings Canyon National Park, Yosemite National Park, Hoover Wilderness, and others. More than enough choice. The main limiting factor: it's only May and I expect that the high mountain passes will be completely blocked by snow.  Trails such as the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail appear to reach rather high elevations. Up to what elevation should I normally expect passable terrain in May? Is it feasable to hike in the area I described above, or should I search for a more low-lying region? I will subsequently travel overland to the Mid-West, so it could also be in Nevada, Utah or Colorado. I realise this is a huge area, and I don't have a strong preference to a particular place. I can either hike or well-established trails, on little-known trails, or sections with no trail at all.   Owens Valley and Sierra Nevada, 2 June 2006, still shows considerably snow. Source: Wikimedia Commons, G. Thomas.  Perhaps the Inyo Mountains or the White Mountains are more suitable?  I found a quite nice map overlaying snow conditions and trails on the same map. With an account, it also provides access to historical data, so one can obtain a map for 10 May 2012 (login required), like this:    So it looks like that in 2010, there were indeed some sections with considerable snowpack, althoug lower foothills were snowfree. If this information can be trusted, that is; it does look like the resolution is rather poor. The map above has snow in valleys but not on glaciers, so I guess it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.  Therefore my question is: What are suitable areas for hiking in Eastern California around 10–20 May, if any? "
1512,SkyDive Equipment,"In 2009 I successfully completed the AFF course, after a stop due to the birth of my son I'm going to resume regular activity.  I currently have 31 jumps, all carried out by renting the equipment, and now I want to buy my own equipment (parachute).  What equipment would be considered adequate to last two years, expected about 200 jumps? What specifications should I keep in mind while reviewing parachutes?  I would like to hear an opinion different from that given by the school that recommended, among other things, used equipment. "
1513,What kinds of stores sell multi-mode (adjustable-brightness) flashlights?,"Which types of vendors sell multi-mode (adjustable-brightness) flashlights? Both online and offline vendors. Both sellers of new flashlights and used ones.  I know that outdoors stores sell them, but I'm looking for other options; I want to find a vendor closer to home than the nearest outdoors store.  Related:   ""What characteristics should I look for in a good torch/flashlight?"" ""What makes a good head lamp?""  "
1514,Safe way to mark a carabiner gate?,"At the crag this weekend I noticed that my climbing partner's carabiner had a great feature: a red line painted such that you know the carabiner isn't locked until the red is hidden.    I love this feature. Unfortunately, I already own dozens of carabiners without this wonderful red line.  How can I safely paint a red line onto my carabiners? Red nailpolish? Metal markers? What is permanent? Is there a community standard?  (I would also like to be able to write a date on all my carabiners, so I know how old they are. So this would be doubly useful information.) "
1515,Advantages to hammock camping on multi-night trips,"This question asks what the downsides are to hammock camping, but doesn't really address the reasons why you would want to sleep in a hammock to camp.  Let's say I'm backpacker new to the idea of sleeping in a hammock. What are the advantages of a hammock or reasons to choose it over the traditional tent and why? In other words, in light of all the problems with hammock camping, why do it in the first place?  Please be descriptive and pictures, where relevant, are worth a thousand words as they say. "

1517,How to clean rock-climbing shoes?,"I have never found a good answer to this one:  How do you clean rock-climbing shoes, without ruining them?    Let me be more specific.  I have a pair of modern leather-and-fancy-rubber climbing shoes made by a major brand. They fit exactly the way I want and the rubber is still sound. But they reek like I exercise in them (with no socks) six days a week. How do I make these expensive slippers smell less horrifying without ruining the rubber or the leather? "
1518,Do folding cross country skis exist?,"Do folding (or telescoping) cross-country skis exist and if so are they useable?  Update: Or are there small cross-country skis that are short enough for easy transport, yet still capable of providing support for uphill movement? "
1519,A technical question on spikes,"I possess the spikes ""Snowline Chainsen Trail"" of two sizes: a small one and a large one. The small one (EU sizes ≤40) sits extremely tight on my hiking shoes ""Nevada MFS 6½"" (size 40 EU), the large one (EU sizes ≥40) sits ok, but if you pull the rubber with your fingers, you feel that the spike chains could be moved a very tiny bit, but not too much. I never hiked with spikes; do you have an opinion on whether any of them is any good for me?  Do you have any suggestion for a better spikes model for snow trails for EU size 40 hiking shoes, perhaps? "
1520,"What is the correct technique for self arrest, with an ice axe, on a snow or ice slope?","When on an icy/snow slope if I loose my footing, what is the correct technique to self arrest and control my slide?    To re-iterate, this question:  What is the proper technique for self-arrest when wearing crampons?  Is asking specifically what do they need to do with their crampons in this situtation:     Should the crampons be used for stopping or held high in the air, to   avoid tumbling over them?   I'm trying to be more general. How do you self arrest? "
1521,Long term autonomous winter expedition northern Quebec/Labrador: Advices/questions,"I'm pondering a longer-term hike in Northern Quebec/Labrador. Autonomous style, sky or snowshoe (TBD) with a sled etc. Right now, considering going Fermont, going south to Sept-Iles (possibly following the Rivière Moisie for some of the way). About 400k give or take, though I might downsize that and leave from somewhere else (south of Fermont, along the road) if that seems to be too ambitious.  I have tons of experience in winter outdoors and winter camping, so that aspect of things I am not worried. I would like to know what would it look like in terms of navigation in that region/environment for a thru-hiker in winter, more precisely for River/lack crossing. I have read this post (How to be safe on lake and river ice and what should I do when I fall through?) on the topic. However I'd be interested to know what to look for (from a topographic perspective) as to where should I expect better odds of finding a good crossing.   1 - When looking at a topographic map, what clues (variations in widths, winding or not, upstream or downstream, etc) may help find a route that is likely to provide better crossings?  2 - In a typical winter, with average temparature for the region (or a comparable region), what are my odds of finding solidly frozen lakes (I am not too worried about those) and finding decently frozen rivers crossings? The Moisie river would be a good example to start from (because it's well-known and a large river) "
1522,How dangerous are kangaroos?,"After watching this video of a man punching a kangaroo to rescue his dog, I am wondering how dangerous a kangaroo is to a human on foot? I am sure that there are a lot of other things in Australia that are dangerous as well, but are kangaroos something that a person would need to worry about? "
1523,Trailrunners for hiking,"I've read a couple of sites that say that trailrunners are great for hiking, as they have good traction and are lighter than boots. Would they also work well if you're clambering down or up steep rocky trails? Overall what are their advantages and disadvantages? "
1524,Are there artificial climbing holds that feel like granite?,"I have experience in climbing limestone and sandstone. These rocks feel rough - you get much traction (especially with sandstone) and can use it to your advantage when climbing.  I think the feeling of artificial holds is the same - they are roughened on purpose to match natural rock.  However, I heard that granite is different (I have no experience in technical granite climbing) - the holds feel slippery and require adjustment in technique.  Are there dedicated climbing holds for simulating the feeling of granite?  Do climbing gyms (bouldering/roped) use holds whose texture matches local rocks? "
1525,How to keep contact lenses from freezing during backpacking in cold temps?,"My fiance and I are planning our first backpacking trip together. I am an experienced backpacker, so I can handle most questions he has and I already have most of the gear that we'll need. However, he wears contacts and is worried about losing contacts and keeping his contacts from freezing. He is very near sighted and has astigmatism. I have never worn contacts or glasses so I'm not sure how to deal with this.   Issues:   +Our backpacking trip must occur in spring or fall due to his job, and will probably occur in places where snow and cold temps are possible if not likely. I read that contact solution freezes at 28 °F (-2°C).  I have been out spring backpacking in single-digit temps °F (-18–-12°C).  +His glasses no longer fit his prescription.   +We're a little broke, so buying new glasses ($400! per pair!) or a different type of contact lens is not really doable for us.   +Leaving contacts in overnight is something he will not do.   To handle the losing contacts issue, I am planning on having him bring at least 2 spare pairs of contact lenses (and if he loses 2 contacts, we'll bail). To handle cleanliness issues, I have ordered hand wipes and we'll bring at least two travel bottles of contact solution. So my question is how to keep contacts in the contact case from freezing in cold temps? (Also, any contact-wearing backpackers have any additional tips for backpacking with contacts?) "
1526,What do the UIAA markings on rock climbing gear mean?,"I buy my rock climbing hardware in America and it all comes labeled with UIAA ratings.    These ratings make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. My gear has met mythological engineering standards. They have been blessed by Officials Who Know Things. A real, live person tested this carabiner, and it passed.  Great.    But is any of that actually true? Is each cam, stopper, and carabiner individually tested? Or is it more of an ""engineering standard"" applied to the design of the gear? What do the UIAA markings on my climbing hardware really mean? "
1527,What are anti-sweat technologies in winter jackets called?,"Once I saw a winter jacket of my roommate with some lining under it. This lining absorbed almost all his sweat, besides logo on his shirt. I searched for it, but cannot find any.  How this linings called? What technologies/cloth used in it. Can I buy some without jacket?   I'm wondering, because I also have a little bit sweating problem. I walk fast and because of it I sweat a lot.  "
1528,"Trustworthyness of a claim that a ""not hung"" doe can't be completely processed","I've field dressed a doe at 3 PM in Illinois. Due to bad storm and light, I had to leave it in  the back of a pickup over night (it was about 30-40 degrees outside).    I finally had it at processors around 10 AM. Later on they told me that they could only process half the deer because it wasn't hung. Can this be true? And if yes, why? "
1529,Special equipment for Nitrox Dive?,"Is there any special equipment needed for diving with Nitrox(more than 21% O2)? In Germany there are regulations and laws that say that you can only dive using Nitrox if you have this special equipment. I did my SSI Nitrox diver in Indonesia, where we used the regular equipment. Also, I've nowhere before heard of this special equipment. Does anyone have experience with this special equipment? And if so, what is it exactly and what does it cost? "
1530,How to choose shoes for long-distance urban walking for durability first then comfort?,"I'm an international hitchhiker and I've never been sure what kind of shoes to buy.  I do the vast majority of walking on roads, carrying 15kg or so. Sometimes I'll be off-road in the same shoes. I've walked up to 30km in one day though 10km or so is more typical.  I generally look for hiking shoes from any name brand that are on clearance, but I find they never last a full year. I've read that paves surfaces wear out hiking shoe soles faster.  But is that going to happen also with walking shoes or any other kinds of shoes anyway? Or do other types of shoes have soles that last a lot longer on concrete and asphalt?  Comfort is pretty important, but for me durability is more important. The longer I travel the less money I have left to replace worn-out shoes, so I want something that will last.  I know you get what you pay for but after a point it's hard to know whether you're paying for quality or marketing.  I'm currently in Taiwan where there's more budget options than back in Australia but I'm still not sure about the quality. Brands such as Lotto, Goodyear, and Quechua.  So what should I look for? Walking vs hiking vs other? Specific sole types/designs/materials? Something else? "
1531,"Why is traditional marine advice to stay still, rather than swim vigorously, if fallen in cold water?","Traditional marine advice says that, if one falls into cold water, it is better to stay still rather than try to swim (unless the shore is so close that you are absolutely able to make it) to extend the survival time because heat loss is greater when swimming than staying still.  However, I have also heard that, in cold water, people need to swim FAST in order to keep warm and prevent hypothermia by generating more body heat, and slowing down means trouble.   These two are contradictory sayings. Is there any scientific research confirming which is true? Does it make a difference if one is a marathon swimmer who is trained to swim 6 hours or more in 15 - 16°C, compared to a swimmer who only swims in warm (>24°C) pools or sea? "
1532,"What does the Garmin GPSMAP 66 ""SOS beacon"" function do?","According to the Garmin website, the Garmin GPSmap 66 includes an SOS beacon:     These devices include an LED flashlight and SOS beacon that can be used to signal for help.   They are thin on details, and Google Search just turns up the exact same formulation on different websites.  What does this SOS beacon actually do?  Is it anything like a PLB, is it an audible/visible alarm, or something different from either? "
1533,Driving in Alaska - Antispray device,"While researching a driving trip to Alaska, I came across an Alaskan motor law,      13 AAC 04.265. Antispray device    (a) No person may drive a motor   vehicle unless it has a device which effectively reduces the wheel   spray or splash of water or other substance to the rear of the   vehicle.    (b) The device required in (a) of this section must be   installed and maintained so that the device placed behind a wheel   extends downward to a distance of 14 inches from the surface of the   ground when the vehicle is standing on level ground.   The description in b) make it appear that it applies only to large vehicles.  A regular passenger car or SUV usually does not have a ground clearance of 14 inches from the surface.  My question is: Does this law apply to passenger cars/SUVs or large trucks?  And if it applies to passenger cars, do built in ""mud flaps"" such as those on Subaru Outbacks (see pic) qualify?    "
1534,Flat bottom boat trolling motor power,"I am wondering how to estimate the needed motor power for boating upstream on big rivers like, for example, Danube. (mean the bottom to middle part, i.e. where the Danube is wide and ""slow""?).  To be more exact, let say having an 12' (3.6m) long jon boat, fully loaded with lets say 800lb - how much thrust is needed for going upstream (even with slow speed - but upstream) i.e. having enough power to ""beat"" the river's current).  The practical merit of the question is: will it be enough to use some electric (12V) trolling motor e.g. with 30lb or 55lb thrust?  Do not need some rocket-science based calculations, enough some rule-of-thumb based estimates.  EDIT  Because of the comments trying be more precise:   I haven't any motor and I haven't any boat (yet)   So, I can't try it. (What, of course, would be the obvious solution if I had any boat.) :)  Moreover, I haven't defined any exact river. This question is in the idea-gathering phase - when trying to do first and rough estimates of the needed gears and or possible solutions.  Everything what I currently know (more or less precise) is:   I need to move against the current of some rivers (more different rivers, not only specific one). Mostly only for straight river-crossing, but not limited. I will never use the boat on high-velocity rivers - only on slow &amp; calm waters. e.g. let say, the max. velocity of the current where I will use the boat is 4 km/hour (aka approx: 1.11m/s or 2.16 knots) also, if the wind against will be too strong - will not use the boat. (I'm not sure about this, how to define it more precisely as calm wind). My (custom made, riveted) boat dimensions will be: max. 3.0 up to 3.6m long and the beam will be approx. max. 0.8 to 1m wide (it is not defined exactly yet). It will be (sure) flat bottom &amp; straight nose boat - aka like an common jon boat The total weight of the boat+motor+batteries+persons+other will be approx. 250 (max.300) kg only. The above 800lb was only for safety. :) For some reasons (smallest as possible, lightweight motor) I must to use electric motor. (trolling motor) I will have enough batteries (and also 2Kw electric generator) already onboard...   So, is possible to have a jon boat with electric motor under the above conditions? How to estimate the needed motor size (type, power, thrust, etc..) :D.  "
1535,Fishing beads T - holes,Which is the best knot to use as a stopper in the upper &amp; lower part of a beads T - Holes? Also which knot is preferable for the horizontal line?   
1536,"What foods attract mosquitoes to your body, and what can you eat that will repel them?",I know that eating bananas is one way to turn yourself in to a mosquito magnet. The potassium in the bananas apparently attracts them to whomever eats them. Whenever I meet someone who says they always get eaten alive by mosquitoes I ask them if they eat a lot of bananas. The answer is usually yes.  What other foods attract mosquitoes to you? And what foods can you eat that will repel them instead? 
1537,how shelf stable is pocket (portable) soup?,"This video for Portable Soup (aka Pocket Soup) from James Townsend popped up in my feed.  If you don't know (like I hadn't until I saw the video) Pocket Soup is basically a shelf-stable ultra-reduced stock.  It pretty much looks like leather, stores in a tin, but dissolves into boiling water in minutes.  In this video on spring soup, James cooks all of his dry goods and foraged greens and only adds the Pocket Soup at the very end.  I'm intrigued enough that I'm now halfway through the process; if it works half-way as well as Townsend suggests in the soup video, I think this will be a really nice addition to camping menus.  Using an electric crock-pot, it's dead easy to make.  Mostly, I've been letting it cook or steam while I've done nothing.  (I haven't started the drying process yet, so I may yet change my mind on exactly how easy it is.)  Sadly, I didn't get the right cut of meat, so I cheated and added gelatin packets.  I don't think that will affect things for the worse.  (In fact, maybe purified gelatin will make it more shelf stable?)  According to my not-so-rigorous research (i.e. the wikipedia article), it seems to have been stable even in fairly hot climates.  But, given that the wiki article seems to be based on historical documents (and I have no idea how faithful to the original recipe James's version is), and it doesn't sound like there is any contemporary examinations of shelf-life of the gelled stock / leather, I am curious about how shelf stable the Pocket Soup will be.  In particular, I wonder about temperature and melting the leather chunks into a blob.  The wiki article mentioned that one cook rolled the pieces in flour; I'll probably try corn flour.  I imagine this will help with any sticking, but not any melting.  One of the things that has me worried is that there is no salt added.  When I think of long-term, shelf-stable foods, I usually assume that they have been cured or salted.  James's recipe uses no salt in making the leather.   If you have experience with making / using Pocket or Portable Soup, have you noticed any shelf-life problems or temperature problems?    P.S. For anyone who is interested, I'll report back in a few days after my gel has leathered and I've had a chance to try the reconstituted soup.  P.P.S. I'm about to start making the Mushroom Ketchup, mostly so I can get the mushroom powder James uses in the spring soup video.  I'll report back with any insights I have on that, too. "
1538,How to find natural salt licks?,"There are a number of places where salt can easily be found at or near the surface.  Notably Salt Lake Utah, but there are also other Salt lick places of note.    How would I recognize a natural salt lick if I saw one?    Would I need to just stumble across one, or are there signs that will lead to one?  "
1539,How can I identify wild edible plants of southern and eastern China?,What wild edible plants can be found in southern and eastern China?  I have combed through various search queries but keep finding information on North American flora.  Are there any good resources available that would aid my research or is it a matter of (rather dangerous) experimentation? 
1540,What basic body position should I be in during a downhill ski run?,"I'm doing downhill (alpine) skiing on the piste. The slopes I'm on range from blue (easiest) to black (hardest).  I have been taught something called ""the basic position""? (described below)  How do I know if I am doing it correctly?    Are there any training exercises I can do to improve it?    I've been taught that ""the basic position"" is:     Bend knees and hips, keep your poles into your field of view and press down on your downhill ski.      When turning you stand up but also push forward. And then press on the new downhill ski.    I'm assuming I'm missing a few aspects to this definition.   We have also done a couple of exercises, the only one I remember is:     Point downhill with your uphill hand and put your other hand on your hip   Most others involved holding both your poles.  "
1541,"Should I do exercises for finger strength as an intermediate, heavy climber?","I am climbing for quite a while now and would consider myself a beginning-intermediate climber. I feel my technique has significantly improved over the last year. I am very heavy (1,80m and ~100kg) and have large hands for my size, which makes me struggle very often on smaller holds. Even in the level I climb at the moment there are many holds I cannot use which my peers climbing at a similar level utilize without any problems. While I am aware that technique is much more important than strength I feel like my lack in finger strength (in proportion to my weigth) is one of the most important limiting factors to my climbing at the moment.  I would usually agree with this answer stating that ""The best training for climbing, is climbing."" However, I feel like lastly I made very little progress on my finger strength. I tried to use a hangboard once since these seems to have very little injury risk even for beginners, but was not even able to hold the widest part - I ended up hanging from a big section of the top.  Should I just keep on climbing, or does it make sense to train my finger and grip strength in addition?  Which of the methods mentioned in What hand and finger exercises help with climbing? are especially suitable for beginner / intermediate climbers? "
1542,"What types of wild foods are protected from foraging in the Swedish Lapland forests, and how is the status decided?","There's a question on the site seeking information about foraging food in Sweden. One of the answers says any wild food in the forests of Swedish Lapland can be foraged and removed except ""protected"" food.   What types of edible wild things in that region are protected? Which governing bodies or organizations decide the criteria necessary to receive protected status?  "
1543,What do I need to do to a tent that's been stored for a long time?,"I have a rather nice 1-2 person hiking tent from over 20 years ago. It's still made, with very few changes, and is a double wall design that pitches in one go. I thought it was nylon but the current model is polyester; it's certainly synthetic.   It was put away clean and dry some years ago, tightly wrapped in plastic and stored in an unheated loft. I expected to use it again soon but never did. Now I need a light tent again, I want to see if this one is still useful. I can pitch it in the garden, but what should I do to make sure it's OK?  "
1544,Do I still need to hang my food if I have two large dogs?,I have two large dogs - a German Shepherd and a Presa Canario. I hike alone with my dogs in black (not grizzly) bear country.   Do I still need to hang my food? Or will the three of us be able to convince a bear that um... maybe next camp has better food? 
1545,Do Eastern grey squirrels pretend to bury nuts in the ground?,"I recently heard that Eastern grey squirrels sometimes dig holes, pretend to bury nuts, or other food, and then cover the empty holes. I was told that they use all the same motions and effort as they would if actually burying a nut for future consumption. Sometimes they even have a nut in their mouth, and at some point during the process, they store it deep into their cheek, so squirrels watching them assume their mouth is empty.   The purpose is to deceive those onlooking squirrels, or to lead squirrels who arrive later on a wild goose chase, searching for stashed food to steal where there isn't any.    This sounds like either sophisticated behavior, or a fun story.   Do squirrels actually pretend to bury food?   If so, is there any scientific evidence that it works?  "
1546,What are the steps you would go through to teach someone how to split logs?,"A recent power failure made firewood one of the four most important things in our lives for nearly three days.  We had enough in our pile of cut up fallen branches and small logs to keep our cat warm and happy, and ourselves not too unhappy.  We've never split logs (and certainly never bought split logs at the supermarket), but I've often wondered just how difficult it would be to learn how to split logs.  Assume you, an expert log-splitter, have an utter neophyte in front of you, in reasonable, but far from spectacular, condition.   What are the steps you would take to safely turn her into an adept log-splitter?  And, very roughly, how long would it take -- i.e., one half hour session;  ten half-hour sessions; more than ten?  What would be the youngest student you would train?          "
1547,Is it feasible that a black bear could kill a man with a single swat?,A recent post said:     a black bear can kill a man (or a dog) with a single swat of its paw.    I suppose anything is possible. But is it realistic? Has it ever happened?  Googling 'man killed by single punch' finds several instance where a person killed a person with one punch.  I also find a lion killed a person with a single swipe. But not finding anything about a black bear doing this.  Are there any records of this happening? 
1548,Protecting climbing skins without a protective mesh,"During my recent ski touring trip I have forgotten the protective mesh of my climbing skins in the car. I have noticed my mistake when on the top of the mountain, but by then it was way too late. Not having a better idea, I have stuck the two skins together, and hoped for the best. This was not a good idea. Once at home, I had big problems taking the two skins apart. I am afraid I might have even damaged the skins somewhat. And the edges of the skins that were not alighned properly got some fluff on the glue anyway.   Was there any way to protect my skins better? I thought about just rolling them up, but then I would have gotten fluff from the back of the skins all over the glue? Maybe I should have stuck them on my backpack? But it was not exactly clean.. Should I have tried to get some garbage bags or some paper? But that could have gotten stuck and break when taking it off? The best idea I came up with, albeit too late, was to stick as much snow as possible on the skins, and then put them together. Would that have worked? "
1549,First time snow hiking,"I will be going to a ski resort in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. It’s also very popular for winter hiking and has a lot of routes set out. Because I can’t go skiing this year I’d like to do some hiking around the lake and possibly down the mountain.  I bought some good boots and I have a good jacket and thermos clothes from skiing but I have a few questions:    Can I wear a thermos legging only? My ski pants do not allow a lot of freedom of movement. How does getting off a chairlift work? I won’t be as fast as the skiiers and I might even slip and fall. I’m a little nervous about this. Will the operators spot me/help me? is it generally safe for a young woman to go hike in the mountains alone?  "
1550,What is an effective technique for plogging?,"See this article on plogging, from the Washington Post Swedish Fitness Craze Coming to the US (March 06, 2018):     Have you recently spotted people toting trash bags while jogging? Or   their hands filled with old plastic bottles? You might soon.      Sweden’s latest fitness craze — plogging — is making its way to U.S.   shores. The term is a mash-up of jogging and the Swedish “plocka upp,”   meaning pick up. In this case, litter.   Further on in the article, it says:     Think squats while jogging.   Several times a year, I walk and pick up trash, using a grabber which means I don't squat much and don't have to touch the stuff I pick up.  I am trying to envision what, exactly, I would do if I were jogging instead of walking.   Let's dispose of the safety concerns.  Assume a straight road with little traffic, wide shoulders and wide verges (the unpaved strip adjacent to the shoulders), and no poison ivy in the verges, none of which apply to my road.  I have to be on full alert while .... plalking (?).  Does one squat and pick up on the fly, without slowing down?  That seems difficult.  Does one jog one way and concentrate on picking up on the return trip?    How does one avoid getting imbalanced after picking up a lot of stuff, or does one carry two bags, one in each hand?  A U.S. plogger who plogs along the Alexandria, VA waterfront says:     There are an alarming number of full diapers...They turn my stomach   the most.   Has some enterprising company  marketed a wide-apertured plogging bag that one carries on one's back?  Here is a new outdoor sport, with great benefits to the individual practicing it and to the great outdoors.  What is the most efficient and effective way to plog?   Addendum in response to a comment:  People pick up other people's litter on hiking trails, in the backcountry, and on beaches too, and good for them, but this question is about the mechanics of doing this while jogging, as opposed to walking.  "
1551,Are pounds of propane actual pounds of weight?,"I'm looking at an 11lb-capacity propane canister (2 1/2 gallons). The canister itself ostensibly weighs 13 pounds. If filled to the max (which you're not supposed to do anyway), is the maximum this filled canister going to weigh be 24 lbs (propane and tank together)?  This is the one I was looking at.  I lifted the propane tank in-store yesterday, and it felt heavier than 13 lbs, but was empty. I didn't weigh it, so I could be mistaken, but it felt much heavier. Would the air inside it make all that much difference? "
1552,Should I use a double or triple broadhead for boars?,"A triple broadhead has three edges equally attached around the shaft while a double broadhead has only two blades.   Triple broadhead:   So, which one should one use to hunt boars? A double- or triple-edged arrowhead?   Note: I want to shoot a 60#@29"" (draw weight of 60 pounds at a draw length of 29 inches) recurve bow.      Draw weight:      The force required to hold the string stationary at full draw is often   used to express the power of a bow, and is known as its draw weight,   or weight.      Draw length:      The maximum distance the string could be displaced and thus the   longest arrow that could be loosed from it, a bow’s draw length, is   determined by the size of the archer.

1553,How to prevent frost / ice damage camping equipment?,"When camping in summer rain overnight or dew in the morning is fine as it'll likely all evaporate off in the day.  When camping in winter dew, rain, or sleet could lead to frost and ice on the tent overnight. Ice tends to make things brittle. My line of thought is along the lines of having to pack up the tent on a frosty / icy morning.  How would you prevent frost or ice from damaging camping equipment, like guy ropes for example? Hot on cold generally causes things to shatter as well (I've done this with a hot meal on a cold plate before) so what is the best way to help the melting process along? Is this necessary, or will ice not cause gear to become brittle?  To clarify: I'm not talking necessarily talking about going up mountains and being in the snow here, snow in that sense can be warm, and easy to brush off. I'm talking about camping out in the open, it's wet from rain or sleet or dew and that water has then turned to frost or ice overnight. "
1554,Slotted bead head on non-jig hook,"I'm ordering beadheads for fly tying, and am thinking about getting slotted beadheads to use on jig hooks. The main application will be nymphs to be used as the point fly in a two or three nymph setup.   Since the producer I'm buying from offers those wholesale, I wonder if I can just buy a big pack of each size and colour that I need, and use them on other hook types as well. Has anyone tried it? Would it work? "
1555,How to react to an aggressive boar,"As far as I know, boars are pretty aggressive when they have piglets. In the appropriate season, one might happen to hike into the path of an overprotective mother and get attacked.   How do I react to an aggressive boar? Are there any warnings or do they just instantly rush towards you?   Loosely related: What are the odds that I stand a chance against Wild Boars? "

1559,"In real life, could the best possible archer pull off the shots that Katniss Everdeen routinely performs?","This is not an opinion-based question.  For example, if someone were shown doing a quintuple axel on figure skates, anyone who knew anything about skating would point out that a ""mere"" quadruple axel has never been done, at least not in competition.  (The ""quad"" is a quadruple toe loop.)  The link provided by Zack L in his comment, below, has a lot of pertinent information.  But I still want to know:  could an archer shoot down a low-flying jet plane, even with an arrow with an advanced high-explosive tip?  Or is this an HE question?    "

1562,How to determine the thickness of ice?,"Thinking about going ice fishing this winter but I am worried about falling through thin ice.  I know that ice should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) if clear and 8 inches (20 cm) if cloudy, but how can I actually tell the thickness of the ice?    I realize that I can use my auger to drill through it and see the thickness that way, but that requires me to get on the ice to drill, which is exactly what I don't want to do unless I already know the thickness.  So is there any other way to measure the thickness of ice? "
1563,"Is ""dynamically soaring"" suitable as a bird identification feature?","I've never heard of a bird besides the Albatross which is able to use ""Dynamic Soaring"". Am I able to draw any conclusions out of this behavior? Like, can I say ""it's definitely an Albatross"" or ""it's definitely a sea-bird"" if I watch a bird dynamically soaring?   Dynamic Soaring:     Dynamic soaring is a flying technique used to gain energy by   repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of significantly   different velocity.   Albatross:     These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in   flight; the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern   aircraft. The albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order   to perform dynamic soaring.  "
1564,Any reasons to prefer braces over belts?,"It accompanies me for quite a while. I see a lot of outdoor-people wearing braces (""suspenders"" in USA/Canada) instead of belts. Also, a lot of outdoor brands have braces in their range, such as these examples:    From LD Mountain Centre:      From FjällRäven     Is there any reason to prefer braces over belts? Or is it just a ""fashion"" thing? "
1565,Why's the plastic/paper cup training so popular?,"The plastic cup training is quite popular among different archers. It's a training where you pin a cup on your target and try to insert three arrows into it. You do this repeatedly from different, unknown distances.    However, why do we need this plastic cup? Why can't we just say: ""Okay, I have this point at my target and try to group three arrows around it.""  "
1566,Keeping safe distance while scrambling,"On an easy but long scramble, 30 to 45o incline, un-anchored, what should be the safe distance between two people?  Should the better person be ahead, or be behind supporting the other just in case? "
1567,Drift fishing vs anchor fishing?,"When bay/inshore fishing from a boat, one can drift fish (where you let the tide carry your boat) and anchor fish (where you anchor your boat to one spot). Besides the obvious, what are the differences between the two? Or put differently, when would you choose one method over the other? "
1568,How do I neutralise the smell of a human on a fawn/roe deer?,"Let's say you are out for a walk with your little daughter. Strolling around you suddenly hear sounds of joy from her. As you turn around she's happily petting a (roe deer) fawn laying in the grass.   What to do (not from the pedagogy point of view ;) )?   Is it possible to neutralize the ""human smell"" somehow? If not, who would be the right person to contact?     This question is really not about why one shouldn't touch a fawn. Let's just agree that we shouldn't do it for whatever reason. The question is about the actions to take to revoke such a possible ""accident"".   Just a few references to prove that you really shouldn't touch a fawn:  From Wildlife in Crisis:     Do not touch the fawn! This could cause the mother to reject it.   From Native Animal Rescue:     Fawns are born scent-free and have white camouflage spots which   protect them from predators. The doe continues to keep her babies   scent free by consuming her fawns urine and droppings. This is yet   another reason why humans should never touch a fawn. Leaving human   scent on their body will attract predators to the fawn.   Here's a German reference which I want to share:      Typisch für junge Kitze ist ein Geruch nach saurer Milch und Harn. Die   Milch gelangt auf das Fell der Kitze, wenn sie sich nach dem Saugen   belecken, da sie meist im Liegen harnen, ist ihr Fell außerdem mit   Harn benetzt.[134] Zwischen der dritten und fünften Woche endet die   Prägungsphase zwischen Kitz und Muttertier, die nicht mehr rückgängig   zu machen ist.   From Wikipedia  Freely interpreted it says:   Typical for a young fawn is a smell of sour milk and urine. The milk get onto fawns' fur when they lick themselves after sucking. As they usually urinate while lying down, their fur is also wetted. Between the third and fifth week, the embossing phase (imprint phase/conditioning phase) between fawn and mother ends and cannot be undone. "
1569,Why do some archers wear two gloves?,I've recently noticed that some archers wear two gloves and some only one. Latter always have them on the hand which pulls the string.   Two gloves:   One glove:   What's the difference? Is it up to their personal preferences?  
1570,Is killing fish with iced water really humane?,Someone told me that one can kill a fish by putting it in iced water. He stated that it'll kill the animal extremely fast and without any pain.   I've my doubts... Can anyone explain why this should work? Or is it nonsense?  
1571,How much should my toes hurt in climbing shoes?,"5.10s are known to be more comfortable, softer shoes, but I've also heard they tire your feet out faster. Edging, in particular, is harder in these shoes because it's your toes' responsibility instead of the shoes' responsibility.  My shoes are nearly broken in by now. I've had them for about 3 weeks and have been climbing about 3 times a week. They slip on easily. Obviously, they were more painful during break-in.  My toes can hurt due to some nerve damage but indoor climbing through V3s has generally not been a problem at all. But advancing to outdoor climbing, particularly edging when my shoes aren't great for edging, is more trying.  How do I make sure I'm building strength in my toes and mitigating injury? What amount of discomfort would tell me I'm doing something wrong or need to back off? "
1572,"Leader injured during multipitch trad climb, what to do?","I've been working on improving my self-rescue skills, but the skills I've learned so far seem to pertain mostly to single-pitch climbing. For example, a lot of people emphasize knowing how to escape a belay, which is fine, but that seems to be mostly applicable to the situation where you're giving someone a belay from below on a single-pitch climb, you can't just lower them (maybe because they'd end up on a ledge), and you need to run and get help.  If you're in the middle of a multi-pitch climb, it seems like it escaping the belay may not be relevant, or may at best be only part of the solution.  I'm sure there are many different possible self-rescue situations that could come up in multipitch trad. But one likely-seeming situation I can come up with is that I'm giving someone a lead belay, he gets injured too badly to be able to up- or downclimb, and we have more than half the rope out, so I can't just lower him all the way.  What do you do in this situation? My best guess would be to lower him down to the lowest piece of protection I can get him to, escape the belay, ascend the rope, improve that piece of pro to a solid anchor, secure him to the anchor, and free the rope from the gear higher up (either by climbing and cleaning, or by untying and pulling the rope through). Then maybe clip him in to the rope with a locking biner, lower him to the belay station, have him unclip, and then rap down to the belay station myself (possibly leaving a lot of gear). Wow, this seems complicated and difficult, especially if I can't see the situation clearly from the belay station.  I think a solution to this problem would also pretty much apply to single-pitch climbing in an area where it's not possible to run and get help, e.g., because you're in a remote area.  Question: what would be some general strategies for dealing with this type of situation? "
1573,Do mountains regularly (for a mountain) change height?,a little related to this question:  How many &quot;Munro&quot; revisions has there been?  Leads me to wonder do mountains change height? or is this because the equipment is more precise these days?  I understand that erosion will (very gradually) lower a mountain. I suppose I mean geologically and I suppose specifically in relatively un-active areas such as the Cairngorms/Scotland.  If they do change height by how much? (roughly) 
1574,How to belay on top of a pitch,When doing a multi-pitch and you reach a belay station (the top of a pitch) you can choose between belaying the lead climber from the body (like you do e.g. indoors where you aren't doing multi-pitches) or from the belay station (anchor) itself.  Can someone experienced please compare those types of belaying? What are pros and cons? What should be preferred in which situation?  I know for example that you have to care if you are using a Tube (e.g. BD ATC Guide or Petzl Reverso) and you are going to belay from the body because the device will fail if the pull of the rope isn't coming from above. 
1575,What fictitious wilderness animals are there as tourist attractions?,"Having read this question on drop bears. I have been wondering what other fictitious animals are there in other parts of the world that have been invented to amuse/confuse tourists.   Has anyone compiled a list?  Do these animals share any common features?  In particular I'm interested in the more ""modern"" fictitious animals such as drop bears or haggis rather than more traditional mythical beasts like dragons or the minotaur. "
1576,Is it unsafe to ride the chair lift with a backpack?,"I like the convenience of having a backpack when I ski.    Last winter one of the lifties at the local ski hill gave me guff about my backpack, claiming that it was unsafe.  I wore the same backpack to different slopes around the Northeast US all winter, and he was the only person to ever say anything about my backpack being unsafe.   Is it unsafe to ski or ride the chair lift with a backpack?  If so, what are the associated risks? "
1577,How much will the ceiling of a snow cave drop by during the night?,"Every time I have slept in a snow cave, I have woken up to a ceiling that was noticeably lower than when I went to sleep. Is there a good rule of thumb for estimating how much lower it will get?    Apparently, its not just me that has noticed this phenomenon. There are stories from boy scouts who estimate the shrink at 10 inches, skiers in Alaska, people in Antartica, people in California, and climbers on the Grand Teton. "
1578,Are there plants (for instance berries) which lead to dehydration if eaten?,"Believe me or not but I'm currently playing a video game :) It's called ""Ark: Survival Evolved"". You've to survive in the wilderness and for example pick up berries to do so. There is a specific species of such which leads to dehydration if eaten (still, it fills up your hunger indicator).   This made me wonder if there are any plants in real life with such characteristics? Would it be worth to eat them if you have enough drinkable water? "
1579,"How can I effectively clean the ""bite valve"" for my water bladder?","The bite valve on my Osprey water bladder is covered in a black mould.     It's not very old and this is the second valve I've had on this. It seems to be impossible to remove and seems to grow no matter what I do. Couple of questions:   Is this likely to be a health issue?    I have used valves like this for long periods of time before so I guess not but would be interested to hear other options  Does anybody have a good way to remove this?   Good old fashioned elbow grease doesn't seem to shift it (doesn't help that it's very inaccessible), nor does soaking in boiling water or disinfectant  Can anyone advise how to prevent this from happening?    it seems to grow no matter what I do, though I admit I'm not very good at drying it out after every use...    "
1580,How to get the best results when applying gelcoat with a brush?,"I just finished applying gelcoat to my boat. Results were less than wonderful.  I have some experience, with bondo, fiberglass and painting, so it did not seem like it should be to difficult to get reasonably good results.  Still I did a lot of research online before choosing a product and beginning the operation.  I choose 'TotalBoat White Gelcoat' as the most promising product, I found the most negative review of the product and researched what the best methods for not repeating their experience (see: In a boat repair, what would cause Gelcoat not to harden?)  I prepped the boat, sanding, patching cracks (fiberglass), filling (bondao), sanding and finishing up with a acetone wash, before starting to apply the gelcoat in a heated, vented, humidity controlled garage.    Doing the math it came out that one quart of gelcoat would be a bit more then one coat on my 14 foot sunfish hull. Experience with rolling paint and quick setup time once harder is added, drove me to choose a brush.  I was worried about the amount of product the roller would absorb combined with curing quicker then I could full apply one coat.  I choose to use a brush mixing and applying gelcoat in 4 ounce batches. While the product did not give directions for mixing less then quart size batches, multiple online reference indicated 7 to 12 drops per ounce at 70 degrees F gave good results.   I purchased two quarts of TotalBoat White Gelcoat, one without wax for the first coat(s) and one with wax for the top coat. I mixed and applied a first coat just to the areas where I had sanded to bare fiberglass, I used paint strokes fore to aft.  Because I had purchased relatively cheap brushes, there was some issue with loosing bristles in the gelcoat and having to pluck them out (Next time buy better brushes!) About 8 hours later it had dried nicely with a light tack as unwaxed gelcoat should.  I mixed and applied a second coat to the entire hull (6 small batches), using port to starboard strokes. I let it cure overnight and the next morning it was perfect.    First thing in the morning, I began mixing and applying the waxed gelcoat as the final coat, fore to aft stokes. At 7 drops to the ounce I had only used about half of the catalyst from the first quart, so I continued using the same catalyst with the second quart. Really Really need to spend more then a dollar per brush next time! You throw them away at the end, but all those loose bristles are a major pain.   4 hours after fishing the final coat about 50% of the bottom (upside) hull was shinning over as the wax helped the final coat set completely, the gelcoat on the sides did not appear to have cured at all, it was still wet to the touch. 8 hours after finishing the final coat and there was not much change. Having done my research, I knew part of the solution was waxed paper so I covered the entire hull of the boat with waxed paper.    A new box of wax paper with 75 square feet is almost enough, had to run to the store for a second box.  I left the wax paper in place until the following evening (30ish hours after final coat) when I removed it, the gelcoat was mostly cured.  It was difficult to apply smoothly, some areas had wrinkles, if there was air in the wrinkle it was still tacky.  The sides were still kind of wet (sticks to your finger when you touch it, as opposed to a clean finger tacky feel with the first two coats).  I pulled off the wax paper, mostly it removed nicely.  In the places where the gelcoat was still wet it was messy.  I used the same wax paper just turned it over and reapplied to the areas that were not completely cured. Another 24 hours later the gelcoat had completely set. But is is not smooth.  I had anticipated some sanding because I used a brush, but this is far from just some brush marks.  Applying the wax paper to such a larger area (with a liberal application of profanity) resulted in a very uneven final surface.    While the bottom is poor, the edges and sides are really bad, It looks like a first attempt to apply mud on drywall.     It is winter now, and the boat is going outside, so the car can come in, it will be spring before I begin sanding the hull and considering the application of another layer of gelcoat to make up what I am going to have to remove to make it smooth.  What can I do next time to get a better cure, and smoother final coat in this DIY project?  P.S. This is all polyester so it rules out amine blush as potential cause of issues.  "
1581,Could you use Silnet to seal a drinking water bladder?,I'm considering a MYOG gravity filter project but I'm not sure where to find out if Sil Net™ can hold up under long term submersion and won't leak toxins into the water.   Is it safe?  Do you have a reference?  Got any tips on the DIY filter project? 
1582,"Is there an easy way to tell if a bee in my yard is being raised in a hive (domestic), or if it's wild (feral)?","I live in Massachusetts, in the Northeastern region of the United States.   As a lover of bees, I'd like to learn how to identify some varieties, including their behavior, and how they're raised. Major types of bee habitats include domestic, meaning hand-raised in hives by beekeepers, frequently in someone's yard; and wild (also called feral), being raised without human intervention, in the woods and other natural areas.   When I have bees eating in my yard, I'd like to know how to tell if they're being raised in a local hive, or if they live in the wild but are stopping by on their way someplace else? One reason I ask is, if they're being raised locally, I'd like to try to find the beekeeper!   This question was inspired by a different question about the possible effect of bees on hummingbirds at the hummingbird feeders in my yard.    These are the bees to which I was referring.      A former beekeeper, 243DRob, posted a comment, in part:     Those are domesticated honey bees. They came from a local hive within 3 miles of your home. The bees will use your ""nectar"" to make honey. If their hive is owned by a beekeeper (most likely), then your ""nectar"" will end up in the honey they sell.   I was fascinated to learn that. Obviously, as a beekeeper, a quick look at a picture was all he needed to make the identification. As a layperson, can I learn to do it without much difficulty?   What obvious things should I look for? What about size; shape; color; how they interact with each other or birds; which flowers they like; which type of hummingbird nectar or feeder; the time of the day; the month or season; the presence or absence of other pollinators; or some other variable I haven't mentioned?   I know there are scientific ways to study bees, including Melittology, Apiology, and others.   I'm hoping that depth of knowledge isn't necessary for this question. "
1583,What are the correct techniques for rescuing someone who has fallen through the ice?,"If someone where to fall through the ice on a lake or a pond, what would be some correct ways of rescuing them?  This question is inspired mostly by this video, where one person gets too close to the melted part and falls through and some one comes to attempt a rescue and falls in, and so on, until 12 people end up in the water (Don't worry, nobody dies or is seriously injured).  Barring the fact that no one should have been on that ice in the first place, how would you pull them out? "
1584,How do I gut a fish?,"I've caught a fish and want to gut it (remove it's insides ready to eat/keep). How do I do this?  Where do I cut? What needs to be removed, etc? "
1585,What to do when finding huge pieces of trash?,"When I'm out in the woods I often find huge pieces, like for example a car tire or even something bigger, or huge piles of trash. Of course I can't take that with me on my hike to bring it out.   What should I do then? I feel like this question can't be answered generally so let's narrow it down to Germany or other EU countries. Am I supposed to call the police?  "
1586,Why does the 528 thickness lines only appear on weather maps in the future?,"I've been learning about snow forecasting in the UK. I've learned an important feature is the atmosphere thickness, specifically the 528 line:     Pressure decreases with altitude, and thickness measures the   difference in height between two standard pressure levels in the   atmosphere. It is proportional to the mean temperature of this layer   of air, so is a useful way of describing the temperature of an   airmass.      Weather charts commonly show contour lines of 1,000-500 hPa thickness,   which represent the depth (in decametres, where 1 dam = 10 m) of the   layer between the 1,000 hPa and 500 hPa pressure levels. Cold, polar   air has low thickness, and values of 528 dam or less frequently bring   snow to the UK. Conversely, warm, tropical air has high thickness, and   values in excess of 564 dam across the UK often indicate a heatwave.   Taken from the UK met office  Looking at the detailled pressure forcast I can see this line isn't there today or tomorrow morning:    But if I scroll the bar to tomorrow afternoon, it appears:   (see the red dotted lines)  Am I missing something here? This seems to be consistent when I've been checking this though the week. Why does this forecast only appear in advance?  I'm defineatly not imagining this, the line that appeared 22nd Dec in the above images is now not there until 23rd Dec.... I don't get what's going on here? "
1587,Booking Alpine huts,"I'm planning to head to the Alps this summer to walk the Haute Route from Chamonix to Zermatt. Does anyhow know how far in advance I need to book the huts? Months, weeks or just a few days?  Also there's a good chance our plans might well change en-route, due to weather conditions, am I likley to find that means I can't get into the next hut on the route? "
1588,What to do about slippery plastic soles of cross country ski boots,"I have a relatively new pair of NNN cross-country ski boots and noticed the plastic sole is much more slippery than previous boots I've owned (older SNS and SNS Profil). A quick look at the selection in a store showed me most models have this feature/drawback. I occasionally have to walk not ski wearing these boots, so I'm looking for a creative solution to deal with this--and I'm guessing others have dealt with and hopefully solved the problem already.   I assume sanding the soles wouldn't help, as the plastic is already relatively rough. Or perhaps I could slip something over the boot when I need to walk with it, like a rubber? Or perhaps there are new models of boots that don't have slippery soles. Back-country NNN/SNS boots look quite sturdy, maybe they have better soles (I know that would require new bindings, but I'm open to that too)? Or will the soles get less slippery with time?  I did find one skier's solution here, which involves rubbers with spikes. But this wouldn't work in my case, I want to use them in places like public buses (which I know from experience are slippery when wearing x-country boots, especially when the driver is in a hurry and you haven't sat down yet). "
1589,NIS mounting plate for x-country skis: why only for NNN bindings?,"I see a lot of higher-end cross country skis now have an NIS mounting plate to enable the mounting of bindings without drilling any holes (and easy adjustment).  But why are the only NIS compatible bindings that I can find just for the regular NNN norm? What about SNS Profil and Pilot, and also NNN BC? Is there a technical issue here, or do is have to do with patents?  (I know you can just drill any binding onto a NIS-equipped ski.)  "
1590,Best type of rope for glacier travel?,"What sort of rope would be ideal for glacier travel? I have a 10mm 60m rope, but this is quite heavy. Would a 9mm 50m rope be suitable for a team of three, crossing glaciers in the Swiss Alps? "
1591,Safe to use Old Water Filter?,"I have a PUR Hiker Microfilter and a Katadyn Water Microfilter sitting in my closet that I only use once in a great while (I don't go on overnight backpacking trips very often).  Whenever I do plan on a trip, I'm always hesitant to trust these filters are still in good condition to use. Don't they develop mold or other contaminants when left idle for years? I'm talking like 5 or so years without use...  Is there a way to clean these so I can be sure they are safe to use, or does the microfilter cartridge have a certain shelf-life and is then no longer safe to use? "
1592,How to find a secluded cabin to rent,"How can I find a nice, secluded cabin to rent, somewhere in the U.S. wilderness? This almost seems like a word of mouth kind of endeavor, asking friends and friends of friends if they own or know of such cabins but I'm hoping there's a way to search online, for places that I would never hear about otherwise. That's what I'd like to find out from this community.  Some places I've looked:   Wikitravel occasionally references cabins. Vacation Rentals by Owners (VRBO) is has a good interface to narrow down by characteristic. Some trail clubs have cabin listings. For example the Potomac Area Trail Club. Many State web sites, like Virginia's State Parks site, list their cabins. Searching TripAdvisor and FlipKey for cabin helps too, though I haven't found secluded wilderness cabins there yet.   Each of these is helpful in their own right.   Are there other options? The more searchable (like VRBO and TripAdvisor) the better. The more secluded options listed (walk-in rather than drive-in, for example) the better. The more the resource describes the surrounding trails and scenery the better. "
1593,Do cross-country skis need to be broken-in?,"I recently bought a new pair of cross-country skis that matched my weight (with or without a backpack), but when I tried them out for the first time (over a two-day period), I didn't have as much grip as I had with my previous pair (which I got as a hand-me-down and didn't know if they matched my weight, but they worked well enough), even with a backpack on. Too much glide and not enough grip going uphill or even on level paths. Did I somehow get the wrong size, or do I need to use the skis for a while before they start to work for me?   One more thing: these are NIS skis with the NNN binding all the way forward--meaning I should have maximum grip.  I should also note that I put a bit of wax on the fish scales on the first day (I assume mistakenly), but that shouldn't make that much of a difference? "
1594,How far is a reasonable distance for someone to hike on their first trip?,"How far is a reasonable distance for someone to hike on their first trip?  I understand this depends on a lot of variables, such as the person's fitness, the route they are planning to do, etc, but some approximate numbers would be helpful.  In my specific case, we're both very active. We've been weight training in the gym for the last 6 and 11 years respectively - and it shows.  Our plan is to hike during June this year, so we have time to train. Is it realistic to think we could do Cumbria Way in The Lake District, or West Highland Way in Scotland? "
1595,Do bag liners add the same warmth value to all sleeping bags?,"I have a bag liner that claims to add 15 degrees to the ""range"" of a sleeping bag.  Is it reasonable to assume that it would work the same for all bags?  For instance, would it extend a 40 degree bag to 25, and a 0 degree bag to -15? "
1596,What would be the coolest summertime baselayer?,Sometimes I hike with people for whom bare chest or even bare legs would be uncomfortable.  But I get overheated MUCH more easily than most people; anything about 70 degrees is too to wear clothes while hiking.  I'm thinking that it might work to wear some super-skin-tight fabric that is so porous that it doesn't add any noticeable insulation or moisture.  What fabric would that be?  Rayon?  I wasn't able to find any rayon-based baselayers in a google search. 
1597,Experiences hiking with a baby: backpacks,"I'm a keen hiker, in South Africa. Or, I was... But then our delightful darling daughter was born 7 months ago, and my hiking hobby got replaced with a new hobby. Anyway, my wife and I are very keen to get hiking again, but we would also like to consider taking our daughter with us (instead of always leaving her with the grandparents for the weekend). I'm aware of those backpacks that have a shaded seat on top for small children, so my question is: are those any good? What should I look for? "
1598,Experiences hiking with a baby: diapers,"So, I recently posted a question on hiking with a baby - my wife and I used to hike a fair amount, and we would like to get cracking again soon, but with our 7-month daughter. I'm currently trying to get as much info and as many do's and don'ts as possible, so today's topic: we use disposable diapers currently, and it suddenly occurred to me that our little bundle of joy is a regular production line of soiled diapers, and we would obviously need to carry them out with us. But they can get quite heavy (by the way, I'm a small guy, so I care about weight. A lot.)  Many trails have proper waste bins at each hut, but we often hike trails without huts, by preference. So, any experience with this? Any suggestions? (I'm also very aware of the ecological impact of using the things at all, but that's a debate for another day...) "
1599,Bear spray vs. rifles against polar bears?,"In Svalbard, the arctic archipelago administrated by Norway, anyone leaving Longyearbyen is required to carry a rifle for their own safey. For grizzly bears, Wikivoyage recommends that Bear repellent spray (a very strong pepper spray/mace) is considerably safer than carrying a rifle. This answers says the same thing.   From Wikimedia commons  I'm no hunter and I would hate killing any large mammal (or even small non-mammals). Is the statement about the safety of sprays vs. rifles accurate for all kind of bears? Don't bears run so fast that by the time they're within the range of sprays, they're already so close that it's more or less too late to defend oneself?   (Note: I've only hiked in Europe, and nowhere I've been are any dangerous animals apart from humans) "
1600,What to do with old hydration bladders?,"I have two old hydration bladders, both of which are no longer usable (in one the cap is broken, in the other the internal bag is ripped). Spare parts appear to be unavailable. Is there anything good that can be done with them, some way to use their insulating properties? Or is this the end of the road for them?   "
1601,What is the proper technique for self-arrest when wearing crampons?,"What is the proper technique to self-arrest and brake a fall, given steep icy (frozen snow) slope, when wearing crampons and wielding an ice axe? Should the crampons be used for stopping or held high in the air, to avoid tumbling over them? "
1602,How to maintain climbing strength while training for a marathon,"Over the next 6 months I will be training for my first marathon. This means I will be running 4 times a week, with at least one long (10-20 mile) run each weekend.  I have run several half-marathons before, but each time I lost a lot of my power and strength climbing. I don't want to start from scratch again as a climber. I have worked hard to get what little strength I have and I want to keep it.  But how can I keep my climbing strength while training for a marathon?  I imagine people are going answer:   Just keep climbing.   I will try. But last time I lagged behind because I just can't climb hard on a day I've run >10 miles. Will at-home strength-training be the key? How hard will I have to work to just maintain? "
1603,Can I use a garbage bag to approximate pack size,"I am planning my first multi-day hike. I haven't selected a pack yet. I do not know which size pack I need. I see that packs are rated in liters. That got me thinking since some white garbage bags are rated in liters.   Can I simply use different size garbage bags and try to fit all my gear to approximate my required pack size? Say if it fits in a 40L bag, I need a pack around 40L, or are there other considerations in play? "
1604,Trekking Pole vs Nordic Walking Pole,"I am taking up hiking again on weekends, and also trying to do more walking to get out of the house of an evening.  I regularly see people doing Nordic Walking in my neighbourhood, and I also see the benefit of trekking poles when on varied terrain (Bruce Trail and the Niagara Escarpement in Ontario, Canada).  REI has an interesting article on Trekking Poles, and in the article it states:     Nordic walking poles are a modified version of trekking poles. REI does not currently carry poles designed for Nordic walking.   But it gives no actual details what the modifications are.  So: how is a nordic pole different than a trekking pole?  Can I at all realistically use one for both purposes, and what will I be trading off if I do? "
1605,Can body-to-body rewarming be used as a last resort treatment of hypothermia?,"All of the arguments I've heard against using this method assume that you have adequate supplies for alternate rewarming methods. If you literally didn't, and it appeared they were going to freeze to death anyway, would you have a whole lot to lose? Of course, if you felt yourself starting to get hypothermic as well, then I'd guess you should stop and reassess the situation, but should you at least try this method first? "
1606,no weapons Fighting large cat with bare hands,"Recently there was a news article about a Colorado jogger who was attacked by a mountain lion and killed the mountain lion with their hands (ie, no weapon).  What are the effective ways, with no weapons, to defend against a large cat?  Are there anatomical differences which create vulnerabilities for large cats?  Additional notes:   The solo backpacking question does not address the specific questions I listed. I talked with a friend who is a surgical vet, and he thought going for thumbs in eyes, and  then thumbs on the trachea would be a good first line strategy. This strategy will result in bites but if administered early in an attack, risk is somewhat mitigated. Another friend, who was a special forces member, killed several dogs, but had weapons (in one case just a stick which was used to smash the skull).  He is intrigued and researching the matter.   I was able to find an article which talked about the anatomical vulnerabilities of dogs, as well as their instincts.  But that didn't address cats.   I am not looking for hiking advice, I am asking about killing predatory cats with bare hands.  In the instance mentioned, it has been released that the victim was able to suffocate the cat. There is no mention of blinding her.  I will probably edit this out later, but on my property I have had large cats, and seen them. One paced a neighbor out for his morning jog.  I have also had feral dogs, which I and others encountered, and I eliminated.  "
1607,Why would a polar bear give away his kill?,"I am reading Three Among the Wolves by Helen Thayer, who is best known for walking and skiing to the North Magnetic Pole accompanied only by her husky, Charlie.   In a subsequent trip, she and her husband spent nearly a year observing the behavior of three wolf packs in three different parts of Canada.  This question is about the pack observed on the ice of the Beaufort Sea, to the northwest of Tuktoyaktuk, in winter.  (In spring, the wolves move back to land.)  This pack of wolves scavenged off the kills of polar bears.  As Thayer says:     Polar bears, the primary hunters, killed the prey [the seals] and then   ate mostly the fat. Wolves and foxes then shared the meat.   According to the National Geographic Society's article Scavenger, scavengers are the janitorial staff of the ecosystem:     Scavengers play an important role the food web. They keep an ecosystem   free of the bodies of dead animals, or carrion. Scavengers break down   this organic material and recycle it into the ecosystem as nutrients.   But even more startling than wolves as scavengers, was the incident Thayer describes -- wolves as recipients of the largesse of a polar bear:     ...The bear thrust his head into the seal hole...He hauled out a   thrashing seal, crushed its head, and without stopping to eat, walked   to the edge of the ice and stared into the water.  The three   wolves....[rushed] to the body.   The bear ate none of this kill.  On reading the first quote, I postulated that the bear ate only the blubber because it was more efficient to capture another seal, rich in blubber, than to pick at the meat; the wolves were simply filling a niche by scavenging the bear's leftovers, as were the arctic foxes who also followed the bears on the ice.   But it is harder to explain the bear's behavior in the second quote.  This seems like pure altruism on the part of the bear (which seems unlikely), or an isolated incident.  So, my question:  Has this ""altruistic"" behavior been reported in other sources for polar bears -- or for any large predator with respect to scavengers -- and if so, what benefit does the polar bear (or other large predator) gain from it?  Addendum:  Possibly pertinent fact prompted by comment by @Chris H: The pack of wolves on the sea ice numbered eleven, one of whom had an injured paw.  There were at least six polar bears nearby.  The wolves waited respectfully for the bears to leave their kills before darting in.   "
1608,Should I take my weight into account when buying and retiring climbing equipment?,"In this excellent answer to Ideal and Minimal Rope Diameter for Lead Climbing it is shown how the falling weight affects the drops a rope is expected to survive.   This led me to the following questions:   Should I take my weight into account when I buy climbing equipment, especially if I am heavier than 80kg?  Should I retire my equipment at a different point according to my weight?  Are these answers different for different part of equipment (e.g. rope, harness, belay device, biners, quickdraws, protection...) "
1609,What is the snow level going to be in the Atlassian mountains(Toubkal) in the end of April?,The question is should we prepare to snow hiking in the end of April going to Toubkal?

1611,Planning where to stop and camp in advance,"I'm planning what will realistically be my first backpacking trip. It'll be in Yosemite this summer.  I've already been going through checklists of things we need, the trails we'll take, what we'll eat and different options if we decide we can't make the full 24 miles in 5 days.  However, the one thing I can't figure out how to plan is where we'll stop and call it a night.  I've already pulled 7.5' quadrangle maps of our trail, but even on them, I can't tell where a good place to pitch the tents would be. Ideally--in my mind--I'd have 2 or 3 different stopping places and around noon we could decide on which we think we're going to make.  Am I over-planning here? Is it as simple as ""we're getting tired, let's head off the trail and find a clearing?"" Or are there some better maps to help me plan this kind of thing? "
1612,How much experience is needed for crossing the Mendenhall Glacier?,"I'm planning a backpacking trip to Juneau with some friends next summer and was interested in taking the North Ridge route to Bullard Mountain (see: [website]I've been interested in learning mountaineering skills, so I've read enough on the subject to know that you shouldn't just go out without any experience or preparation. But, most of what I find is about the dangers of wet glaciers. When I read Glacier Mountaineering by Andy Tyson, he mentions that travel below the firn line is normally done unroped because you can see the dangers and can't do much to arrest a fall.  So is it smart to travel cautiously across a dry glacier, with the proper equipment, but without much practical experience? (Assuming one thoroughly studies features and danger signs beforehand) Or is this just as dangerous as crossing a wet glacier?  Or, is the Mendenhall glacier in particular a bad idea for someone like me to even think about approaching? Thanks! "
1613,Portable power generator ballpark fuel consumption,"tl;dr What is a likely value for fuel consumption for a small portable 4-stroke gasoline-powered inverter power generator in, say, litre / ( kilowatt * hour )?  At times I attend music festivals where you camp outside for a few days and go see bands perform in the afternoon and evenings. Some of them permit the use of power generators, and I got myself one as described above rated for max. 1000 watts continuous power draw. My group won't use that much, but that's what I got when I aimed for the smallest 4-stroke inverter model.  Among my questions is now how to estimate the amount of fuel to bring with me to a given event, and unfortunately the spec sheet and other resources shipped with the unit do not feature any fuel consumption figures/curves/tables.  I do have a rough estimate of the power draw and duration.  Typically the power generator will be run from the morning into the afternoon, let's say 08:00..14:00, which is when people hang out at the camp site killing time until the bands start. From afternoon on it's seeing the bands until late into the night, after which people come back exhausted and in various stages of inebriation and usually just drop into their tents – running a generator at that kind of time is a jerk move that is guaranteed to bring the rightful wrath of your camp neighbors upon you.  While the generator is being used you will run a fridge for the drinks, some music setup for nice tunes, and a bunch of small power supplies charging various devices such as smartphones and power banks. If you're fancy you might have a table fan for when it's really hot. So let's add these up:   80 W - (small) fridge 50 W - music 5 * 10 W - smartphones etc. being charged 40 W - table fan   That's 220 W of continuous power draw (the fridge will be running its compressor continuously because it starts out warm and is made extensive use of). Multiply that with the 6 hours of daily use and we get about 1300 Wh, and if the festival lasts for 4 days we're at about 5300 Wh, or 5.3 kWh, drawn at roughly a quarter of the generator's rated output.  So … how much gas does that roughly equate to? I have been searching around for some ballpark figures, but I only seem to find various tables that are too specific and not readily applicable to my problem. "
1614,Can or should you season titanium cookware?,"I have a set of titanium cookware that I use for backpacking.  It's a small set for one to two people and consists of two little pots and one cover/frying pan.  Mostly, this set gets used for boiling water, but I do occasionally actually cook in it.    Is there any (good) reason to try to season this set (maybe just the frying pan?) like I do for my cast iron cookware?  Would the seasoning take to the surfaces?  Would it have any non-stick properties?  ---Edit--- Here's a link to a similar cookware set by the same company as mine.  This new model (mine is 10+ years old) doesn't show the lid as useable as a frying pan, but mine has a lid that looks very much like the one in this model. "
1615,How to measure combined clothing and sunscreen?,"As I understand it, you can't combine multiple suncreens to combine their SPF values.  This makes sense as they all work on the same concepts and your skin can't simply ""hold more"" because it's two different brands.  But how do you measure combined sunscreen and clothing? Or for that matter, combined layers of clothing?  My instinct is that you would multiply them:  Clothing:   UPF 3, passes 33% of UV.  C=0.33 Sunscreen:  SPF 5, passes 20% of UV.  S=0.20 Total = C * S = 0.066, or SPF 15   Can anyone confirm this?  Bonus question:  What about tan + sunscreen?  Would they add, multiply, or just be the maximum of the two?  I'm guessing it's not the last because black skin with a natural SPF of around 13 still benefits significantly from an SPF 15 sunscreen. "
1616,How do squirrels find buried nuts?,"Squirrels bury nuts for future consumption, sometimes many months away. I recently learned that tree squirrels, including Eastern grey squirrels, sometimes dig empty holes, pretend to drop nuts in them, then cover them back up. It's a behavior which is generally called either ""tactical deception"" or ""deceptive caching."" It takes place in all squirrel habitats, including backyards, forests, and anyplace where food is available.   Squirrels do this so that other squirrels, or nut-loving animals, will spend time digging in a recognizable hole, only to find it empty. If squirrels can be deceived in this way, then how do they know where nuts really are? There has to be something to it other than random digging, which seems especially hard to believe in large forests.   How do squirrels actually find nuts, either buried by themselves or by others?   "
1617,How can I prepare my body for a relatively hard hike?,"I'm from Munich, Germany. There is a German highest mountain Zugspitze (2.962m) close to the city (2 hours with a train), and I want to climb it in spring. Base camp is 700m high.  There are a couple of possible ways to hike there. Each takes from 8 to 10 hours and has from 8 to 21 km. I prefer the 21km road, because its the easiest one and starts from train station in the city under the mountain.  About me: 20 years old, fit, BMI 22-23, have done swimming for 2 years, now do gym 3 times a week. I also can run, 5 km with 5-6 pace, larger distances are boring for me. Now I quit running to gain some weight. I'm also a skier, have been skiing in Tirol, Austria, pretty high 2200-3400m altitude, so I can imagine what it's like.  Since I'm not much into hiking, have done it a couple of times as I was a kid, how can I prepare my body for such a hike? I suppose I need some kind of endurance training and do more leg days in a gym.  To mention, I have suitable gear, such as hiking boots (Haix P9), and baselayers and backpack.  I'll appreciate any helpful advice or strategy.  Suggested below answer What are some proven methods of training for week long backpacking trips at high altitude? has more information about acclimatisation and long trips. But was useful in general.  I also found the information about altitude sickness in this one: Altitude sickness when going from sea level to 14,000 ft (4,200m) in a single day. "
1618,How can you regain your feet when you lose an edge snowboarding on steep terrain?,"Last year I was snowboarding in Tignes (France). I was coming down a steep red run into La Daille (Orange on the map below) when I lost my edge (heel side). I'm not a great snowboarder...    So I ended up falling forwards (not seriously) with my feet facing down the slope. I landed on my backside and started sliding down the steep icy slope. I was in a sitting position and wanted to simply get back onto my board.  Nothing I did seems to either    a) stop my slide or b) allow me to get enough traction on my edge to get back up onto my board.   I ended up sliding down the whole slope on my bum, complete with plumes of snow shooting into the air from my board. It was quite spectacular (to the point where people on the overhead chair lift whooped and cheered me much to my embarrassment). I do have a video off my go-pro somewhere, I'll have to see if I can dig it out...  While sliding, I tried to lever myself back on top of the board but I couldn't gain enough traction to actually lift myself off the snow and I couldn't get my edge to dig into the snow enough to slow/stop me.  What should I have done here? I know the real solution was to not lose my edge in the first place, but presuming I have, how do I arrest my slide and/or regain my edge and stand back onto the board? "
1619,Why are backpacks sized in liters?,Backpacks that we use are typically categorized in litres (Or liters if you are an American English follower).  Whats is the point?  Why don't we have backpacks that are categorized as for example 70 kg instead of 70 L? 
1620,What factors should be considered when helping to feed crows/ravens in the yard?,"We've had at least one discussion about what to feed birds in the crow and raven families in our yards. This question is about the most effective way to do so.   When setting up the feeding areas of our yard, we often keep the small birds in mind. However, we've seen the small and medium sized birds chase the larger ones, including crows/ravens, off the feeders, away from birdbaths, and around the yard, so we know size is not necessarily an indicator of dominance. I'd like to know what conditions and accommodations might be the most conducive to keeping those big birds here.    For example:  Is there an optimal time of day to feed these birds?  For the foods they eat from feeders, are certain types of feeders better than others?   Does placement of food (either in feeders or on the ground) matter in terms of proximity to things in the yard, such as    other bird feeders birdbaths trees, bushes, plants houses, sheds or other structures   What other factors should be considered to make sure ravens and crows get the right amount of healthy food? Since they tend to eat most of the same types of foods, I'm assuming the factors would be the same or similar. If that's not the case, would you kindly answer for whichever one you know, and specify it. "
1621,"Titanic survival, ice cold water?","When the RMS Titanic sank, there were not enough life boats, many hundreds of people went into the cold water and many died from hypothermia.

1622,Hiking in Lappland in August - what about animals?,"I'm planning to hike/wildcamp in finnish Lappland in August, in Viipustunturit and maybe also in Muotkatunturit.  Is there anything special that I should do about the local animals? E.g. in the context of US people advise to cook and eat away from the camp, and hang food on trees to avoid attracting bears (and prevent them from associating humans with food).  According to this answer this should not be necessary in Scandinavia. According to another wolfs are not a problem either. Are there any other animals (apart from mosquitoes and midges) that I should take into account? If yes, how? "

1624,What skills should one learn before attempting paragliding?,"   Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of   flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider   aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a   harness suspended below a fabric wing.  Source.   Impetus for the Question:  Some years ago, a young and colorful colleague of mine described a paragliding adventure in Colorado in which he went too high, passed out, and inadvertently  landed in a tall tree.  He was stuck in the tree for 18 hours before he extricated himself, unscathed.  Why 18 hours, and exactly how he got down, I don't remember.  It is also possible that he enhanced his story a bit.  The Question:  What skills should one learn and practice on the ground or close to the ground before taking off?  Tree down-climbing?  Navigation?  Recognizing when one has exceeded safe altitude?  Other?  What does one do to prepare the right muscles for the physical exertion peculiar to this sport?  Are there courses which teach all this, and, if so, how long does this preparation take? And, PS, does the story of my colleague sound plausible? "
1625,Crossing small corners of a glacier when hiking in summer,"I am planning to do a 3-day hike combined with multiple via ferratas this summer in the Brenta Dolomites in Italy. I haven't done the big research yet, but from looking at the (hiking) map I can see that I will need to cross a couple of (what looks like) very small corners of a glacier. I estimate the crossings to be no longer than a few hundred meters. How serious those glacier crossings could possibly be? Is it likely that there would be cracks big enough to fall in at the edge of a glacier? Can there be snow covered cracks in July/August at around 3000 meters? Is it likely that the ice would be steep at the very corner of a glacier?   I do not have any glacier crossing experience beyond stepping onto some in touristy galcier watching spots (in Canada, Island). And I do not want to bring too much unnecessary equipment. But I could get crampons, I will have a harness, hiking sticks, at least one other person with me, and I can bring a 20-meter-long rope. I would absolutelly not want to carry an ice axe though.   I will of course do more research before I go, and I have sufficient experience with hiking and via ferratas. So what I would like to know, is really just an estimate on how challenging such a short galcier crossing could possibly be.  "

1627,Meeting an unknown snake on the trail; what is the best thing to do?,"The newsletter from the Virginia Wildlife Rescue League reported the following incident.  A man, his partner and her 4 year old daughter were walking in Farquier County (a rural county), when they saw a snake, about three feet long, thin and striped, on the trail.  The man told his partner and her daughter to go back to the cabin -- and this seemed (not clear) to involve passing the snake.  So the man picked up the snake close to its head to get it out of the way.  The snake bit the man twice on the hand, and, it turned out, that it was a rattlesnake.  The man lost consciousness within a very few minutes.  He survived, but was in very bad shape for several days, with a great deal of internal bleeding.   It is clear that he did the worst thing he could have done, but, what would have been the best thing to do?    Also, does this sound like a case of an adolescent rattlesnake not being able to control its venom output?  There was a question about this point a few months earlier.  See At what point is a rattlesnake mature enough to control its venom?    This particular snake was in Virginia, USA.  From The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries  (Rattlesnakes in Virginia), it was probably a timber rattlesnake, which grows to 36 to 60 inches (90 to 152 cm).  Also known as the velvet tail or banded rattler.  "
1628,Differences between two spine declarations?,"I shoot Easton arrows. These arrows are normally labeled with ""500"" or ""300"" etc. to tell you the spine of them.   However, I've recognized a few brands which label their arrows like ""3545"" (or something). Note: I can't really tell if this is an accurate number but the formatting is always like this (4 digits which seem to be completely random in my eyes :) ).   So, what does the second annotation mean? What's the difference to the ""common"" declaration of the spine value? (And why on earth do we need both of them?)  "
1629,Arrows in full length measured without the nock?,"Normally you measure the arrow from the nock (so, where the string is placed) to the end of the shaft. If you want to have a 29"" arrow, the shaft itself has only about 28,5"" cause the distance between the shaft and the nock has to be added.     But what if you order a bare shaft (which comes without a nock) at full length. If they say 31"" does it mean that this shaft would be ca. 30,5"" or do they actually have 31"", so that my arrow would be 31"" + ~0,5""?   What happens if a shaft has a nock attached from scratch? Are they measured from the bottom of the groove to the end of the shaft?  "
1630,Avoid swimming into climbing plants/creepers,"As far as I know there is a danger of swimming into ""climbing plants/creebers"" in lakes. This can bring you in an extremely dangerous situation where you tangle up more and more cause you panic.   Am I able to avoid swimming into these? How should I react if I get stuck?  Edit:  It's quite tough for me to give an exact reference to a particular plant. They mostly grow on the ground of lakes and have kind of tentacles. They might tangle around your knuckles and if you react jerkily you'll be tangled up more an more.   This is a picture like a locale newspaper (a report where a 26 year old man was ""tangled to death"") has illustrated it:   [website]Sadly I don't know if they're accurate or random stock-photos.  "

I'm planning on hiking Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire later this month and I'm not planning on seeking out snakes, spiders or scorpions, but I would like to be able to identify them just in case.  I did take a look at As an experienced backpacker in the Eastern US, what should I know before hiking in the Western US?   as well as Dealing with wildlife in the desert of California/Nevada in general and in the White Mountains in particular, but I couldn't find what I was looking for.

It makes me wonder if it's really worth to eat human bodies if you are in such a situation? Is it better to stay hungry as long as possible?     I feel like this needs a little more input. I really don't want to discuss any moral questions here. I just want to know if the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. The answer just might be: ""Yes, it's (from an absolutely scientific point of view) recommended to eat human flesh.""

They have a wildlife museum with an exhibit called 'most dangerous creature on the mountain.' It's a mirror!...""    (2) Erik: ""You left out the most dangerous animal of them all.... People""   I've thought about how to get a handle, quantitatively, on how dangerous people are in the Great Outdoors.  My first idea was to use the U.S. National Park System as a proxy for the great outdoors -- to paraphrase Willie Sutton, it's where the data is.  But that leaves out Canada, Great Britain and the rest of the world. Also, I think before I go much further, I should ask for answers on frequencies of various crimes in the outdoors, ideally from whatever data sets people are familiar with.  Correction:  Oops! @Sue informs me that: ""The Blue Hills museum exhibit was about the most dangerous predators to the animals in the area, not the most dangerous to humans.""   "

1638,How to carry a bicycle in a canoe?,"I am contemplating a river journey from Pittsburgh to the Gulf of Mexico. 981 miles on the Ohio river and 2340 miles on the Mississippi River.  The current plan calls for completing the journey in 1 or 2 week trips over several outings.  Put the boat in the water at the mouth of the Ohio in Pittsburgh and drift/paddle down river, when it is time to get out, rent a truck one way and drive home with the boat.  Next trip rent a truck one way to where I got out last time and get back in (repeat as needed).  At this early point in the planning (dreaming) I envision the need to travel some distance on land occasionally, probably with the canoe in tow, and prior to the return truck rental. Any number of reasons to portage exist, from an occasional motel/ shower/shopping to going around locks.    There are lots of pictures on the internet of bicycles towing canoes, but if there are any pictures of bicycles in canoes I have not come across them.

In my experience that sometimes is true: I easily get a hold, she has to jump. However, Lynn Hill proved that a small climber can achieve wonderful, unthinkable things.   When looking at mixed gender bouldering competitions in Germany (like described in the Art and Science of Bouldering by Udo Neumann) girls easily manage the guys' problems, but with different techniques.   What are the advantages of short climbers? How should short climbers train to compensate for their shorter reach?  "
1640,Is a Canoe Bike a viable mode of human powered amphibious transportation?,"I came across several shots of the 'Canoe Bike' which seems to be a custom build by Jay Broemmel.  There are several action shots of this vehicle on the internet.  There are a couple of similar ones also, but this one looks like it might be functional.    Image1  Image2  There are even images of it in the water.  Image3  It seems to be based on the commercially available Autocanoe design.   Jay's version seems to be bike additions to a used aluminum canoe, while the Autocanoe appears (from the video) to be a bike with a flat bottom boat built around it.  For my planned trip from Pittsburgh to the Gulf of Mexico, would a design along these lines be viable? My trip is planned as a pleasure trip going down stream, with short land trips. I am not overly worried about efficiency, but it needs to be able to pedal up some hills (slow is ok), be able to brake going down, and have enough energy in the water to stay/get out of danger on major waterways.    The primary concerns are longevity and safety. Can one of these survive a 3300 mile water/land trip?  Will it leak un-manageably or in some other way be unsafe?  "
1641,What are the things I need to know when fashioning a sling?,"I was trying to make a sling the other day to entertain my kids (yes this is a terrible idea) and although the finished product worked (sort of) it occurred to me that this, like all ancient handi-craft, is probably deceptively complicated and has some crisply defined right and wrong materials and methods associated with it. Case in point, our sling is made of para-chord and a leather pouch. It works okay but the release is unpredictable and sometimes fails altogether.    My questions are:    what are the traditional/proper ways to stitch the elements together, what are the right materials? where if any are some resources on how to implement said sling safely and accurately?

1642,Preventing hand blisters while paddling,"I went kayaking for the first time this weekend, and it was a blast! Unfortunately, I also ended up with some abraded skin on my hands, where the paddle shaft had chaffed the skin. I've done other paddle sports before, and while my hands would often develop callouses over time in specific areas, I never experienced discomfort/blisters like this.   What are some good ways to avoid this? Just get over it and wait for callouses to form if I kayak more often? Are there gloves that help reduce the friction? Maybe some kind of wrap on the shaft, similar to bar type on bike handlebars? "

1645,When should you use gear to climb a tree?,"After a long night of geocaching with some friends, one of them had a car full of climbing gear which he said he used for tree climbing - if the cache is up a tree.  A couple of times now myself or my other half (Dynadin) have climbed 3-6ft up a tree to get a cache, usually these are pretty big oaks that are leaning. In the future however we might come across caches that are much higher up. Sometimes people even slingshot the cache back up into the tree, to save them re-climbing it.  My question is: is there a recommended height to which you definitely should wear gear for climbing a tree, bearing in mind a fair level of common sense, and a low mid level of risk-taking - how can you recognise a tree that actually is more likely to need gear than others?

1647,"How to prepare for a long rocky alpine route, which is unusual for me?","I would like to prepare for a long route (700 m altitude gain, 12-16 hours, including descent, with alpine start), one like which I have never [successfully] climbed before. It involves many sections of roped climbing, mixed with longer sections of what should be unroped exposed scrambling. I have done longer easy routes (ones not requiring a rope), and shorter trad routes (roped climbing all the way up).  The problem for me there is the change from roped to unroped climbing and back. When I decide where I need to change, it's usually too late, and every such mistake costs time. For example, if we climb without a rope and get to a more technical place, it's usually very inconvenient (=wasting time) to unpack the rope. And the other way around: if we climb with rope and protection, and come to a section that doesn't require it, I have to realize that early (which I usually fail), so we can pack the rope and move more quickly.  So it's the mixture of ""roped"" and ""unroped"" that makes me waste a lot of time and abort the route (2 unsuccessful attempts so far on similar routes). I would like to do some training in that regard; however, here is my problem:  I don't have proper mountains where I live; ones that come close are 200-300 metres high and easier than needed; we also have 1-pitch routes of any difficulty but I guess this doesn't help at all.  So how can I prepare as good as I can for such a route? Should I climb the short sections I have access to, repeatedly (it gets boring, really fast)? In bad weather? With an oversized backpack?  P.S. I have inflated the expected time for the route; it's 8-12 hours officially but experience shows that I have to apply some factor to it. "

1652,What are ways to reduce swinging momentum when climbing?,"I'm working on a problem in bouldering where the swinging of my feet take the grip away from my fingers and throw me off.  Specifically, I am in a bat-hang, and need to reach an edge hold about 3.5 ft. away from my hand's current hold. I cannot reach this edge without my feet slipping off. But of course, when my feet do slip, even when I manage to grab the next edge, the swing of my legs inevitably throws me off from the other side.  I can include a photo to show what I'm doing, but I mean to ask a general question:  What are some things I can do to minimize that swing?  I saw several others doing the same problem, release one foot from the bat-hang and bring their knee to their chest, as if to compact. I see that this reduces mass at the outer radius of my body being accelerated by gravity.  Is there anything else I can do? I tried slowly slipping my last foot off the bat-hang, but that's only reducing the foot's fall by a few inches (while destroying the top of my shoes).    Edit  Here are some photos of the specific problem I'm working on. But I've had the same question in other problems, anywhere where the feet come off while reaching for a hold.  Here's the starting position of a bat-hang, then how my legs swing after release and finally how I swing off the edge holds due to the swing:      :  "

1654,Are nuts and cams less safe if the rock is wet?,"In (probably) most of northern Europe, it is somewhat cold and wet outside. Despite this fact, I'm trying to get as much outdoor climbing done as I can.   A backup plan for somewhat cold weather (i.e. around/slightly above 0°C) would be to try aid climbing, but we're wondering if this is a safe idea. My question is, as the title says:   Is mobile protection (i.e. nuts, cams, hexes etc.) less safe if the rock is (slightly) wet? Does this change if the temperature is around the freezing point? (Bonus points for references from official sources, e.g. manufacturers or climbing associations.)  This is not about heavy rain with water pouring down the rocks, but more about rock that hasn't completely dried from rainfall a few days past (or at most a light drizzle while climbing) where there might remain some really wet spots on the inside of some cracks or flakes. The temperature would be mostly above 0°C, but where one can't see beforehand with 100% certainty that there aren't any frozen spots in some of the cracks.  "
1655,Reacting to a bee attack,"We were attacked by Giant Honey Bees (Apis dorsata).  A friend and I were ensuring the safety of others and got away with 30 odd stings.   We had proper hiking attire, and buffs to cover our faces. Few of us had sunglasses. Almost all of us had a cap or a hat.  Following was the exact thing we did once we were under attack:   When we were attacked, I asked the group to sit down with head dug between thighs, avoid any kind of movement. Half of the group was with me, while others were waiting some place away and safe. I asked them to sit together and immediately put blanket on them to keep the bees from biting them, during the process I had to move, so I got multiple stings. We had to remain that way for a couple of hours, later when we observed that the noise of bees had gone low, we thought we could move. I descended with the group, while I knew I had to return to assist the remaining half of the group. I guided the first bunch of folks to a safer level where there were no bees, when I started ascending towards the other group I knew I was going to be attacked. Repeating the same, I again got stung like 20 times or so.   Note: That was the only possible way down the mountain, and with almost scramble-like a place with a 50+ m exposure, running wasn't an option. We moved as fast we could.  Was that the right approach?

1659,What alternative topographic maps exist in the USA?,"This answer recommends topographic maps as downloadable from the USGS.  A comment holds that those are definitely the best thing for the US.  An except for the San Joaquin river near Mammoth Lakes looks like this:    When I look at the same place with the interactive map at postholer.com, it looks quite different:    The latter map appears to be from mytopo.com. I see a number of differences:   The USGS map has more rivers The USGS map shows elevation in feet, whereas the mytopo map shows elevation in meters (I personally prefer metric) The mytopo map contain what I suppose is a hiking trail (I didn't check the legend), this is not shown at the USGS map The mytopo map uses shading and draws some contours with a thicker line   Mytopo writes that their maps are made from the original US Geological Survey topographic maps, yet the two excerpts printed here do not show the exact same information.

1664,Should I re-wax downhill skis after using skins?,"I was skinning into a yurt last weekend with my regular downhill (telemark) skis. On the way back out, I noticed a lot more snow sticking to my skis...

1665,Different kinds of Down: comparing insulation,"There's many different kinds of ""down"" filling: ""100% down"" must legally be only down, while ""down"" can be any mixture containing down.  Then there's ""fill power"" ranging from about 400 to 1200, which basically measures how resistent the feathers are to crushing by weight.  Higher ""fill power"" provides more insulation and is significantly more expensive.  Is there any quantitative data about just how much the thermal insulation ability VARIES from the ""worst"" down to the ""best"" down?  In other words, is it possible that spending 10X as much [tex] on high-end down can make a significant difference in insulation, or is it negligible?  "
1666,Covering up ears at higher altitudes,"Recently I went on a trek to a placed named ""Har ki Doon"". The trek took us around an altitude of 3500 meters(15000 ft). When we were there, our guide advised us not to cover up our ears. According to him, covering up the ears would increase the time required to acclimatize. At the same time, covering up one's ears keeps the body warm. So is there any validity in not covering up the ears at higher altitudes?  Also, by not covering up the ears, is there a risk of exposing oneself to harmful cold weather? "
1667,"What kinds of things are the ""defensive driving"" equivalent to handling campfires?","In What do you do if the fire does get &quot;out of control&quot;?, someone asked a legitimate question, and @berry120 wrote detailed response, and ended with a ""tl;dr"" saying, "" but if the proper precautions are taken, you should very rarely or never need to resort to them. Prevention is 100x better than cure in this case.""  I would think a comparison with defensive driving would suggest the right mindset for preventing out-of-control fires. Defensive driving does not assume that every other driver will follow the laws; it is meant to give you best chances when someone is driving like an idiot and deals you a card off the side of the deck. And my impression is that defensive driving is now expected.  In terms of defensive driving, I expect an attorney could say a lot about, for instance, ""A missed turn is much less painful to recover from than an accident.""  But I wanted to ask: What are the basic approaches, actions, and measures taken to see that what starts in the fire pit, stays in the fire pit? "

1669,GPS topo map downloads,I know the USGS and many others offer free downloadable raster topo maps for almost anywhere.   But what if I want vector maps using GPS coords?  I'm new to GIS but I would assume there is a de facto free file format that works well for trail and topo maps for backpacking. What are some places I can download such files for free or for pay? I basically want a file that I can easily print or load into a GPS handheld device. Do libraries of such files exist that are as comprehensive as for example the USGS topo map download library or is there just not that much trail data that has been converted to these formats yet? I know there are many sites and apps that show trails but I want a general solution (like a standard file format) that doesn't rely on proprietary services and their particularities.

1671,How would you evaluate sailing lessons for adults?,"I am lucky enough to live within an hour of several cities (or large towns) on Lake Ontario, and near ""cottage country"" which is full of lakes. I'm considering a learn-to-sail program this summer. A quick search reveals a large array of possibilities, all requiring about an hour's drive each way. Some of the distinguishing features among them are:   the size of the boat you're learning on. I think I would prefer dinghies (14 foot) to the 20+ and even 40+ foot options at some places. How different is the experience? Can you learn more easily on a big stable boat, then apply that to a dinghy, or vice versa? the size of the lake - Lake Ontario behaves very differently than a small cottage lake, I'm sure, but I don't know precisely how they would differ the likelihood that I would want to join the club or association that offers the lessons, and use their facilities after the lessons are over the schedule. Once a week all summer, 6 consecutive evenings, 3 full days, and so on.   I am not looking for recommendations of specific clubs. I am looking for the relative importance of these factors to the overall experience of taking the lessons. I am reasonably hard to train - if I can't follow what's going on I get angry and stop wanting to participate, but if I feel I'm being patronized or the level is too introductory I tune out. Spending hundreds of dollars on a training course that I bail on partway through, or that is not fun at all, is something I want to avoid. Feeling stupid because I can't follow instructions everybody else can follow, or do something that a mere child can do, or that I should know how to do because I knew it when I was 12 (and could sail a dinghy alone) is the major reason I would resist doing this. The typical summer camp experience where the counselor talks for 5 minutes, then sticks everyone in boats and some of them are great at it and one person is stuck up against the bushes and can't seem to get turned around and is just melting down and has to be rescued but doesn't end up actually being able to work the boat - that's the situation I desparately want to avoid. If a particular size of boat or lake, or pace of training, or qualification of the offering organization, can contribute to the success of this project, I would like to know.  I have some experience as a child with very small boats and a little with a 26 footer. I don't like engines. I believe I might enjoy using a boat that is small enough to actually land somewhere, and there are plenty of lakes in Ontario, whether a small cottage lake that you can see across, or something bigger like Georgian Bay or the Thousand Islands, that we could sail on if we wanted to. We could also try renting a small sailboat (again, small enough that you don't anchor and row ashore in a dinghy, but you pull up on the beach or to a dock) in more far flung places like the South Pacific as part of a larger trip. A picnic on a deserted isle or a tootle around a lagoon would be lovely. "
1672,Is there really no way to rescue a climber from the death zone?,"I have watched many documentaries about accidents on Everest and what I learned is, that it is impossible to rescue anybody from the death zone. It is simply too hard for the sherpas, or anybody else to carry somebody. So, when a climber is unable to stand on his own feet, he is left there, basically to die. If other groups on the way up or down encounter the individual, they leave them there and continue upwards or downwards.  Now, I realize, that it is hard and dangerous enough to carry your own body weight up and down and attempting to carry someone would result in critical danger for the rescuer.   But are there, or have there been discussions of developing a method to somehow rescue people in these situations?  What I have in mind are the following, probably stupid ideas, sorted from least to most preposterous:  1) Abort ascents, organize a rescue group and bring the person more supplies: oxygen bottles and blankets, maybe even a tent or other way of keeping them warm, until they get better. Maybe even put them in a portable compression chamber. This should be theoretically doable.  2) Put the person on a sleigh or ski and let them take their chances riding down some of the way at least or have multiple people pull them, which should be less impossible, than carrying them.  3) Have the person paraglide down in tandem with a sherpa or alone (after a short instruction). Let's assume, the person is well enough to wait for someone to carry the chute up to them.  4) Put the person on a rebreather with full face mask on. This should be able to eliminate the oxygen starvation or at least give them more time.  5) If the groups is 10 people strong, attach the climber to a hammock or some rope contraption and divide the weight among the group.  6) Have a rope installed on one of the steeper, longer walls or slopes and let the person down, until he reaches a lower point, even if that lower point is not very easily accessible, just to kill some altitude.  What ideas so far have been explored by the community in order to solve this problem? What discussions are there or have there been?  I know that most of these are probably stupid, but somehow I can't believe, that the only option there can ever be is to leave people for dead there. There have been well-known climbers, who criticize the practice of leaving people for dead. However, as far as I know, those well-known climbers haven't provided practical solutions to the problem. "
1673,"How can I tell if there's a camouflaged octopus in a coral reef, so I can keep from disturbing it?","This question is based on my desire to avoid disturbing, injuring, or scaring away an octopus which is camouflaged to look like a coral reef. Since it's so difficult to see, I'd like to know how to tell where it is! Corals are sensitive animals and easily killed, so purposely touching them is not an option.   Octopus behaviors are similar across the species, so the question isn't just about the one I'm describing, and all answers are welcome!   One species of Caribbean reef octopus is mainly bright blue with a bit of brown on the head. (The blue glows in the dark!) Like other octopus they completely camouflage themselves to blend in with the coral in the reef. It's so vital to their survival that if they move to a different colored location, they change their colors to match.      The Caribbean reef octopus is an absolute master of disguise and one of the most intelligent known invertebrates. Individuals of this species can completely change their color from one moment to the next using specialized color cells called chromatophores. In doing so, they often perfectly blend with their surroundings, even when settled on a surface with multiple colors. They also have such amazing control of their skin and muscles that they can match the texture of their surroundings as well. A camouflaged Caribbean reef octopus can be nearly impossible to see.  (Emphasis mine.)   Source     The life of a Caribbean reef ends with reproduction. The male dies shortly after mating. The camouflaged female burrows in and incubates up to 1,000 eggs without leaving them or eating. After they hatch and thrive on their own, she dies.    I'm always concerned about protecting the octopus from people, but especially during incubation. Scaring the mom away risks eliminating the next generation. Scientists agree we can cause an octopus (either gender) to leave its burrow.      These animals present little danger to humans, and they will generally flee from a location if a human diver gets too close.   Source    If I were to scuba dive responsibly near a coral reef, as a spectator or scientist, how would I tell if an octopus is in there? As I said, purposely touching the coral isn't an option.   Do they perhaps emit a smell? Can you tell by which fish are nearby, potentially for food? What about the depth or temperature of the water? Is it something else?  To illustrate the process of a camouflaged Caribbean reef octopus emerging from its hiding place in the coral, I've taken still pictures from this 25 seconds long YouTube video.   Beginning of video, no obvious evidence of octopus:   End of .04 seconds, just beginning to see it:   End of .06 seconds, head almost out:   End of .12 seconds, body farther out:   End of.24 seconds, octopus fully out:  "
1674,Skis versus snow shoes - when to choose which for travelling the backcountry?,"When travelling the backcountry in high snow, do snow shoes or skis perform better? By ""perform better"" I mean how tiring and fast travel is.  Is there a general answer, or does it depend on the conditions like kind of snow and depth, temperature, slope etc.?  Under which conditions would snow shoes perform better, under which skis?  I am asking about multi-day trekking on unprepared ground. "
1675,"What woods have been used to build primitive shelters in northern climates, especially around the Adirondacks Mountains?","I'm exploring primitive shelter building in northern cool temperate climates. I mean primitive as a compliment: the prime, first, original, indigenous, low-tech/base-tech. Things like the Haudenosaunee or Viking Longhouse seem to be the most 'standard' approach to cold climate primitive shelter building: half-cylindrical structures with steep roofs and gable venting.  One (tall!) example:   I'd like to build a small-scale (~12'x10'x10') version of this type of structure using locally available materials that are common to the Adirondack foothills. What types of woods have been used in northern climates historically? What trees did Haudenosaunee people build their longhouses with?  In this region there's an abundance of red spruce, balsam fir, sugar maple, red maple, and diseased (thus small diameter) American beech; some eastern hemlock, red pine, and white pine; and small patches of northern white cedar. I'm not sure any of these are suitable for ""long-term"" shelter builds (relative for primitive shelters, not a short-term debris hut).  "
1676,"What are uses of red spruce (picea rubens) by humans in a wilderness, primitive, or frontier setting?","What are uses for red spruce (picea rubens) by humans in wilderness settings (e.g. in primitive technologies, bushcraft, wilderness survival, low-tech rural livelihoods, frontier homesteading)? While this could fall under other StackExchange categories (e.g. DIY, chemistry), I'm interested in uses that obviously apply to The Great Outdoors. Some examples I'm aware of:   Thread and rope: ""Native Americans in North America use the thin, pliable roots of some species for weaving baskets and for sewing together pieces of birch bark for canoes."" via [website]Pitch: useful for sealing/waterproofing surfaces like buckets, barrels, and boats. via [website]Spruce gum: a natural chewing gum; doesn't seem particularly useful but used to be used! Medicinal tea: young needles nearer to the tip of the branch can be boiled for 3 hours then cooled and served as a vitamin C supplement healing scurvy.    Are there other uses of red spruce in this context? Have they been used for wilderness construction, either of shelters or palisades? In modern times this wood is used for construction of objects not exposed to weather: crates, instruments, interior construction. "

1678,Wet vs dry glacier,"What exactly is meant by the terms ""wet"" or ""dry"" glacier?  This link here seems to point to the existence or absence of a film of melt-water below the glacier. This has an impact on how the glacier moves, but it is rarely of direct concern for mountaineers.  However, the question and at least one of the answers here seem to suggest that wet and dry are somehow related to the glacier being snow covered. This would make the terms very directly a concern for mountaineers trying to cross a glacier.  Which is true? "
1679,At what temperature should one switch from gloves to mittens?,"Given comparable contstuction and insulation betwwen a pair of gloves and pair of mittens that are designed for winter / below 0C conditions, at what temperature range would mittens be preferable to gloves for the same level of activity.   For example both Hestra and FreeThePowder make both gloves and mittens with removable insulated liners, leather forehand and breathable fabric backhands. In other words the same amount of insulation goes into the construction of both the glove and the mitten models.  At what approximate temperature would a glove become too cold for standing around in, compelling one to switch to a mitten??  At what approximate temperature would a glove become too cold while doing aerobic excersize such as snow-show walking or cross-country skiing, compelling one to switch to a mitten?? "
1680,What does it take to become a wilderness skills guide as a business?,"I see lots of schools around different states and countries that teach wilderness skills and they seem to vary a lot in their basis (that is, what qualifies them to do what they do). Some are led by an organization with a handful or more paid staff, some are volunteer individuals, and everything in between. Some are qualified based on certifications, some are qualified based on 'I can do this well' and the latter often goes with X amount of time doing it as a qualification.   Looking at certifications, there are dozens of relevant courses that vary in time requirements, intensity, and geography. Some are just courses to certify you've learned certain skills, whereas others are geared toward pedagogy and not just learning skills but also teaching them. There are also separate certifications which make sense but aren't part of other 'wilderness skill instructor certifications', from wilderness first responder to forest therapy guiding. As a customer of a wilderness skills center, it wouldn't hurt for teachers to have those kinds of certifications, but certainly they aren't necessary.  Is there a standard or commonly accepted expectation in the wilderness skills community of what it takes to be an instructor? For example is it taboo to offer guided trips and courses on wilderness skills, having nothing but one's own experience as credentials? Is there a certain amount of years or specific skills that one is expected to have before teaching others in an organized and even for-money capacity? Or is it purely case by case, up to the opinion of customers whether an instructor is qualified enough or not? Mainly asking in the context of USA and Canadian wilderness skills schools and culture, trying to get a sense of how the wilderness skills community views qualification for people trying to lead a new thread in the community.

1681,"What in the forest is suitable as a foundation to primitive structures such as log cabins, in northeast USA?","Cedar is a great example of a log that makes a good log cabin foundation. Solid and naturally rot resistant. Are there other species' logs suitable as foundations in northeast USA? Rocks can also be stacked though that is a much more permanent build than many primitive structures. What other logs or natural materials work well for primitive log cabin foundations?  By foundation I mean whatever connects the main structure with the ground and is contact with the ground surface. There's all kinds of different primitive structures, so maybe a rot resistant log is not always needed. For example, vertical log cabins might not need logs laying flat on the ground if I understand it correctly, and instead are supported with pillars (charred logs) buried in the ground with other logs nailed, lashed, or somehow joined to serve as the horizontal frame above the ground.  As an example, this video shows a structure being build with both horizontal logs on the ground and standing posts to support the rest of the building. In this video it's mostly built with cedar, but could something like that be done with other logs common in areas like the Adirondacks? Red spruce, eastern hemlock, white pine, red pine, balsam fir, birches, maples, and more. "
1682,Can't find friction slider adjustment on Tyrolia PR10 bindings?,"I just purchased some Motion skis from Costco with Tyrolia PowerRail PR 10 bindings. Watching YouTube videos, I adjusted the bindings to the boot length and DIN but there's no screw on the front of the toe to adjust the friction slider? I put a flashlight to the bottom front, but there's no screw there. There's just the one screw in the mid-front that adjusts the DIN. There are two screws on the top left and right, but they seem structural?  I googled but cannot find vids or manuals for this binding. Is there somewhere else I should be looking or maybe it auto adjusts?  EDIT: attached pics as requested    "
1683,What conditions would lead to lake ice being extremely clear?,"There is a video where a couple of people are walking on extremely clear lake ice.    Usually, lake ice is far less clear, what conditions on this lake would lead to the unusual clarity? "
1684,Do ultrasonic dog repellers actually work against strays and other loose dogs?,"In answers to a recent question, ultrasonic dog repellers were suggested as a means of self defence against stray dogs rather than weapons. I'm also concerned with loose farm dogs, and live somewhere with very strict weapons laws (so bear spray is out of the question). A trekking pole I or kayak paddle may have some value in fending off a dog but are rather unwieldy if you're on a bike (for example). The omnidirectional sort are what I have in mind, as they could be clipped to gear/taped to handlebars and used immediately.   Most of what I can find online is arguments for and against using them to train or discipline your own dog or a noisy nuisance dog. So do they work for stopping (feral) dogs from approaching? Do they make dogs back off?  "
1685,How to test the sharpness of a knife?,"In order for knives to be useful, they need to be sharp. If I am sharpening one myself, how do I know when I am done?  What would be a simple easy test of whether a knife is sharp enough? "
1686,What temperature do different parts of a wood fire produce?,"I was reading the answers at Can I place a Dutch oven directly into/next to a camp fire? and recalling a recent TV episode about forging iron (coal fire) where they said the coals were hotter then the flame.      I looked around the web, but am not finding anything that clearly shows what ranges of temperature I might expect to find in a normal campfire.   What temperature do different parts of a wood fire produce? "
1687,Is it warmer to sleep in a car or in a tent?,"Is it warmer to sleep in a car or in a tent?  Suppose that our old internal-combustion-engine car breaks down in a remote place at -30°C, -40°C, or -50°C, and the engine won't run at all.  Suppose we're travelling with a single car, but we did bring full camping gear, including winter sleeping bags and a good double walled dome tent that we can squeeze into together with all passengers.  We also have some candles to make heat.  It's getting dark and we will spend the night hoping for a passer-by tomorrow.  Faced with the choice is sleeping in our broken-down Toyota or in a tent, what would be warmer?  We may be able to bury the tent partly below the snow.  Assume no wind.  See also: My car broke down in Siberia. What do I do now? "
1688,"Tips for using a ""wag bag"" to pack out human waste","I've been an avid lover of the outdoors for all of my life, camping in quite varied terrain, but so far in all these locations I've been able to use the usual LNT cat-hole methods to take care of human waste. This year however I'm planning to make several trips where I'll need to use a ""wag bag"" to pack out my waste.  I have some basic knowledge from reading, but never actually have used wag bags, so I'd love to hear some first-hand wisdom from those who have used them. I'm at the ""I don't know what I don't know"" stage.  What are some useful things to know about how to best use wag bags or similar waste pack-out solutions?  A few potential issues I can think of:   Not making a mess (getting all of ""it"" in the bag...maybe not actually a problem?) Keeping the bag from getting ripped/punctured once used Controlling odors Any way to minimize the weight? Any problems with animals bothering the used bags? Other helpful tips...  "
1689,Does the two sticks and a star method of finding north work the same way in both hemispheres?,"There is a method of finding north by aiming two sticks at a star and then tracking the star's movement to find which way is north. You can read the full description here.  However, there is the a debate in the comments (with 6 upvotes) about whether or not it works the exact same way in both hemispheres specifically in reference to this  to this image which demonstrates the relationship between the movement of the star and the direction one is facing.     Note that in the southern hemisphere, North and South will be reversed. – dotancohen Sep 19 '16 at 5:48   Source  Obviously, stars are going to rise in the east and set in the west but what about the movement left to right? Does that stay the same in both hemispheres? "
1690,Finnish maps: bogs easy vs hard to traverse,Bogs on my Lemmenjoki and Hammastunturi map are marked as either easy or hard to traverse. What conditions should I expect from both terrain types in summer (mid August)? Does easy mean one can walk more or less like on dry (albeit springy and wet) land or is some special gear (bogshoes?) needed? 
1691,Should one deliberately eat more and put on weight before going on long treks?,"Recently I saw a podcast of Alex Honnold with Rich Roll where Alex speaks about deliberately eating up and gaining weight before going on an Antarctic expedition (I'm assuming this is because of the climate as well as his lack of body fat as a climber). Made me wonder if this is a tactic used by trekkers as well.   In case I'm going on long hikes (10 days or more), is it advisable to eat up and deliberately put on more weight before the treks? I'm a fit male who has very less fat percentage. Eating more to put on might be a way to offset the loss of weight that'll happen over longer treks.   Note: This is not a hypothetical question. I'll be hiking for around 2 months in the Himalayas and it'll be a long strenuous two months. I am expecting to lose some weight for sure. I'm wondering if I can offset this with some weight gain before I head off. "
1692,Should one buy a higher shoe size while buying hiking shoes?,"I've heard this multiple times from different people that while buying a hiking shoe, always go for one size larger than what fits you perfectly. The most recent one being a local store where I went to check out some shoes. The logic seems to be as follows:   Hiking shoes might be worn with multiple layers of socks in cold environment (personally have never tried this). While walking on downhill trails, one's feet will slide a bit inside the shoe and there're chances of the toes touching the end of the shoes and thereby causing discomfort/injury (can attest to this).   I have personally faced the second issue where the shoe fits perfectly and has great comfort on level/uphill trails but on a downhill trail, my toes would end up painful due to the slight shift of my feet inside the shoes (this is despite the shoe being tied properly and securely).   Is this a trend followed by all the hikers? Or is this a pure comfort based choice? Also, please add in any additional reason why one would go for a larger shoe size when it comes to hiking shoes.  Additional (interesting?) info:  Last time I bought my hiking shoes, the person there made me stand on an inclined plane and jump up a couple of times (so as to allow my feet to shift). The logic being, while on a trail you would often come across inclines and the backpack would force your weight down and shift your feet a bit inside your shoes. And after this small experiment, if my toes hit the front of the shoes, I had to go for the next size. That was the criteria the person used to judge the size of the shoes I had to buy. (The laces were tight all the time and there was absolutely no way you could just slide your feet inside the shoes unless you did the jumps) "
1693,Higher weight carrying using forehead?,"I don't know how to actually put a title to this one here. But, the question is,   Why do those high altitude porters haul heavy stuff (pretty heavy) on their back and with support by means of a strap on forehead? Doesn't that hurt the neck? "
1694,Can you sit on the comfy trike saddle while the canoe is in the water?,"My answer to How to carry a bicycle in a canoe? includes the image below.      The following question was asked in a comment, and to give it a decent answer, I am posting it as a new question.      Serious question - can you sit on the comfy trike saddle while in the water or is it too high and top-heavy?   "
1695,Is there a reason for seeing a lot of roadkill badgers in the spring?,"I spent much of today cycling around quiet country lanes in South Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire, and saw at least 6 dead badgers on the road. I saw a few others earlier in the week on different lanes (similarly quiet).  One or two wouldn't have surprised me, but I ride this area a lot, and have never seen so many (even taking into account that this was a longer ride).  So is there some reason for badgers to be getting hit by cars at the moment?  Do last year's young disperse in spring, or something like that, allowing not-exactly-natural selection to take its course? Or are they looking for mates? "
1696,Is amsteel blue appropriate for a use as a runner?,Would amsteel blue rope be appropriate for use in anchor building for climbing or mountaineering? I expect it's not very abrasion resistant so it wouldn't be good up against some rock or an edge. But could it be used in something like a T-slot or as a runner in space? 
1697,How to react to someone measuring distances?,"I've had an archer in my group who used a laser-tool to measure the distance between the stake and the target in my last 3D-archery tournament.  He used it at the first target but understood the group's ""body reaction"" that it was an absolutely outrageous and unruly behavior.  Therefore he didn't do it again.   The tournament of course had covered the rule:      The tournament consist of 29 regular targets with unknown distances   and 3 ""special targets"" also with unknown distances.      Not allowed equipment: (...), distance measurement tools, (...)   However, I wonder how to deal which such a person if he wouldn't have stopped? What should I do?    Note: One of the key facts that make 3D archery unique is that you don't know the distances which you shoot. This is an absolute core rule to establish an ""hunt like"" environment.   Read more at Wikipedia:     It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal   is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition.  "
1698,How to start foraging in the UK?,"For someone who has never done it before, what is the best way to start learning how to forage in the UK?  Do you require anything specific to start doing this? "
1699,How should we protect ourselves from a lightning strike?,"We are in the great outdoors and a massive thunderstorm will be over us soon. What steps should we take to be safe from a lightning strike?   This question is not ""am I safe in my tent"" etc. You are in a situation where it's you and your backpack and the great outdoors. You don't have a base camp or something.   It's even not about ""is it safe/dangerous to be there while a thunderstorm is present"". It's absolutely about how to react (what to do).   How should one react to a thunderstorm then?  "
1700,Are Hawthorn berries edible?,"Being a bright red berry the old saying about avoiding red berries sticks to mind but I do remember reading that Hawthorn berries, or Haws, are edible...  Is this true? Is there a seed to watch out for in the Haw, or are they like a raspberry / blackberry? "
1701,Why / when to limit how much you gather?,"I've often read and been told that with foraging less is often more. Whilst you may need X kilograms of a berry or flowers (like elderflowers) you should never pick a bush clean.   How can you estimate when to move on to the next bush, or not pick at all, would it be like leave at least half?  What's the reason to leave an amount on the bush? "
1702,Municipal invasive species committee experiences?,"Our town (Groton Massachusetts) formed a town committee a few months ago to concentrate on invasive species issues.  Since we are new, we are trying to find our way and decide what exactly we should be doing.  Obvious activities include public education, monitoring infestations, cataloging problem areas, and actually doing control operations in some cases.  I'd like to hear what other similar committees are doing, especially other formal municipal committees.  It's different when you're part of town government as apposed to a private group.  We have several of those already, but being part of the town makes some things possible, others more difficult.  For example, we're considering proposing that the town pay for the processes of one or two of us getting pesticide applicator licenses.  In return, we'd do any pesticide applications as volunteers, with only the materials needing to be paid for.  But what about insurance?  Any experiences/advice out there about trying to get covered by the municiple insurance plan?  Any other advice from those that have been at this longer than we have? What worked?  What didn't?  What other municipalities have invasive species committees or similar that you know of?  (I tried, but haven't found any) "
1703,Is camping at Zion National Park in mid-December feasible?,A group of four family and friends including two senior adults is contemplating about camping at Zion National Park in mid-December.   I wonder:    How cold (in terms of real feel -- sometimes past average temperature range is not sufficient as a reference for this sort of planning) it would be? Is camping really a good idea for that time? What additional items should I prepare or be prepared for compared to times at milder temperature?   I do a dozen camping trips during later spring through early fall in midwest most years and are familiar with that type of camping. 
1704,What are some heavy-duty alternatives to a long line for walking a dog on rugged terrain?,"Ok so we've a Shetland Sheepdog, roughly 6kg for his max weight, and he has a pretty decent harness (as in you can pick him up from it and it doesn't hurt him, choke him etc) but he only has a decent short lead. It's thick, ropey like climbing rope, and has a massive clasp that can support his weight easily... but it's about 1m long.   His long line is a thin extender lead, like 5mm diameter max, but 5m in length and out in more adventurous areas, walking along cliff edges etc (which we do rather often) it just looks feeble... It's not uncommon for the fenced off paths to collapse underfoot whilst walking in Weymouth for example... We once saw the 'stay left of this sign' sign 6ft below the current path... I'm wondering if it would be possible make him a thicker long line with a decent clasp?  If I were to want to attach a clasp to a climbing rope for example what knot would work? Or would something like a lunge line work, could a lunge line withstand friction against rocks like a climbing rope (to some degree)? "
1705,Hydration for pets,"We all know when we get dehydrated. And hence we make sure it doesn't get worst.  I was on a trek this weekend. A strong stray dog from a village chose to accompany me and being alone, I was happy with it. I couldn't take a detour off the trail to find water for it, so I made him drink water when I took regular breaks during the climb. It would drink a lot of water every-time I offered. (I just poured water into my palm and it would drink) Since I knew I have a water source where I was planning to camp, I could let him drink as much as it wanted to.  How can I know that the dog is perfectly hydrated? How much water is enough? How can I know that it needs water? "
1706,Which ski binding for alpine touring?,"Being a ski-novice I want to start doing alpine ski tours, that means mountaineering with ski. I don't want the ski to be mainly used in 'downhill powdering'. Because of long uphill sections, weight matters. But comfort/safety is important too because I don't wanna crush my knees on the way down hill. I also want to use the ski to approach climbs.  That being said, which type of bindings are available? What are pros/cons?  Would be nice to have some examples too. I am not looking for buying recommendations but being new to ski some examples would help a lot. For example, is the ""Dynafit TLT Speed Turn"" a good way to go? "
1707,Possible to transform (at least two) smartphones into walkie-talkie like devices?,"Of course we agree on the fact, that cellphones aren't that good in the great outdoors cause they just don't work if you are too far from civilization. That's why we use devices like Walkie-Talkies etc.  So, since everyone of us has a smartphone already, is there any hard- or software to transform these into outdoor-prove devices? So that I can stay in contact with my group even if there isn't any connection to the mobile network (and wifi of course)?!    Aravona added a good point. It's eventually even cheaper to buy a common walkie-talkie than a phone-addon (especially if it's something like iWlkieTalkie ;P). However, just share your thoughts nevertheless if it would be more expensive.     Edit:  This question is about connecting smartphones together not about interconnecting walkie-talkies and smartphones.   The situation is like this: me and my buddy do any kind of outdoor activity where we neither have wifi nor mobile network. Nevertheless we want to stay connected. Since we both already have a smartphone I wondered if we can connect these two smartphones, so that we can use them to speak/text to each other.  "
1708,How to behave when there is a wild boar in your way,I ask this question because I met them often in the forest. In the most cases they only run away but in one case the boar blocked our way through a valley. It only looked at us. It did not attack but we could not chase it away with yelling.  Perhaps yelling was the wrong idea? But how should you behave? And how can you prevent to be attacked? 
1709,How to Shoo away a stubborn Stray Dog/Dogs who decides to tag along with you on a hike?,"This happened on one of my hikes.  It was a hike with two villages en route. Somehow a dog from the first village decided to stick with us. We were OK with it. Then he was followed by a small Puppy. Now we tried to shoo them away but they still decided to tag along. When we reached the second village, the dogs from that village joined us too. So now there were 5 dogs with us. They were with us for the whole hike.   It was raining so water wasn't an issue for them, but we couldn't feed them, this was a few hours of hike so that wasn't an issue either.  What are the implications (If there are any) when a few dogs/puppies decide to stick with you on a hike?  How do you shoo away a stubborn dog/dogs/pup/puppies, for their own safety? (I think it't not safe say for a stray pup to join you on a hike, considering that it might get displaced/lost/hunted). "
1710,What are suitable strength exercise for archers?,"If one doesn't have much opportunity to go shoot over the winter, how can they maintain their muscles? Which exercises are suitable? What equipment might be handy?  "
1711,"How are textile properties, such as elasticity, wind and water resistance, drying time, measured?","Is there a standard measure for textile properties such as windproof, waterproof, breathability, elasticity, drying time, comfort?  Is there a website that has a list of different textiles in the industry with these measures? "
1712,What can be done to eliminate heel lift?,"The obvious answer is find a proper fitting boot, but what about those of us that are unfortunate enough to have improper fitting feet? I feel like a mutant sometimes because I have wide feet, huge heel spurs, really long toes, and skinny ankles. They almost resemble hands more than feet. I've been experimenting with insoles, socks and different ways of lacing an tightening my boots, but I still get heel lift, especially when toed in with crampons.   I have a feeling part of my problem is just having weak toes, but are there some tricks or products out there that help eliminate heel lift?  "
1713,Will using kick-wax on my alpine touring skis ruin the bases?,"My favourite backcountry ski area has a really long approach along a groomed trail. I started putting a bit of kick wax on the base of my skis so I could make better time on the flat instead of skinning in to the base of the mountain. It works great, and I don't notice any loss of speed on the downhill (not that I go very fast in tight trees). I thought I was pretty brilliant until a guide told me that it ruins the base of my skis. Is this true? I would imagine that the solvent used to remove the wax would ruin my bases, but I don't use that much wax and usually just ski it off instead of using the solvent. Am I going to ruin my bases? "
1714,What are the real dangers of climbing at high altitude?,"I had a campfire discussion not long ago with a man that got pulmonary edema while attempting the summit of Aconcagua, and we got into the discussion of the effects of high elevation. I had always assumed that after you adapted to the thin air, the risk to your body was how thick your blood got with the production of extra red blood cells to compensate for the lack of oxygen. The thicker blood making frostbite and edema more likely because of poor blood flow, and heart attacks and strokes more likely because of increased chances of forming blood clots. But my friend said it had less to do with thick blood and more to do with the lack of air pressure...  What does low pressure do to you? What exactly happens to your body at high altitude? "
1715,How to clean bones found outside?,"On a recent walk my girlfriend and I discovered a decomposed horse carcass, nothing but bones left. We took some photos and moved on. She's now decided that the bones would make great ornaments and we should go back and pick some up...?!  How is the best way to obtain and clean bones found in the wild? Preferably without obtaining some kind of skin eating disease in the process?!   "
1716,Climbing all the Munros as a continous round,I think it would be fun to climb all the Munros as a single long distance type route.  The wikipedia page indicates that several people have climbed all the Munros as a continuous round.  Where can I find more information about completing such a challenge?  In particular is there a standard route and how long should I expect to take? 
1717,How resistant to water is Tyvek in practice,"Tyvek is labeled as ""water resistant"" and not ""water proof"", but I'd really love to know how much is the fabric resistant to water in practice.  Some people built tarps or even tents out of it, but I was not able to find any tests result of the actual water resistance of the fabric - or better, of the fabrics, since there's more than one version of it.  Is there any information about how much rain could a tyvek sheet actually take before starting to leak? Did anybody made any tests? Thank you so much.  EDIT. Thank you so much for those values, I missed them. But still, can you please describe how do those numbers relate to actual outdoors (that means, rain) practice? For instance, is ""15"" a light rain for about one hour? Is ""1016"" comparable to heavy rain for several hours non stop? I'd love to get an idea in simple terms of rain if that's somewhat possible and if anybody has an experience with it. "
1718,How much would a base camp shower cost in the Himalayas?,"It's about -30°C this morning, and a couple random thoughts popped into my head while enjoying a nice hot shower. The first was how terrible would it be to get out of a shower at -30°C in a tent. The second was, how much does it cost to enjoy a shower in a tent at 17,000ft? There are no liquid water sources at that elevation, so you have to make water by melting snow or ice, which uses fuel, which also doesn't exist at 17,000ft (no wood above the treeline), so anything you burn has to be carried in. That means that by having a shower you are forfeiting precious, and expensively produced hot water that could have been used for cooking and drinking.   In order you have a shower at that high of an elevation you probably need at least the following carried in by a sherpa (for this question I'm making the assumption that you don't help doing any of the work):   Fuel to melt snow or ice (kerosene, white gas, diesel)   Snow and ice, likely carried from a clean area at the edge of basecamp/border of the glacial debris you're camping on.  A shower tent - which includes:  A tent you can stand up in Something to stand on (mat, pallet, maybe a tub) A large basin that holds all of the water you're going to be using to shower with An apparatus to hang said basin, or pump the water out of the basin Plumbing (hose, shower head)  Towels - You've got to get dry after you shower, which requires dry towels, and to have dry towels you need a heated tent where they can dry before they freeze.   I'm not even sure people take showers at such high elevations, or if people take baths in some nasty shared-bathwater tub, but supposing you wanted to have a shower at Everest Base Camp, about how much would one cost? I don't imagine that people would go a 1-2 month long expedition in the Himalayas and not bathe at some point.    This question is more of a curiosity, something that could potentially go into a list of interesting facts about Everest or something like that (see Everest: Sixty fascinating facts). "
1719,Where can I expect to find naturally occurring flint in the wild?,"Where would I look if I was in a survival situation and wanted to find some rocks for fire starting? Where does flint occur naturally? What environments could you expect to find some in? I've created sparks by accident by throwing big rocks around here in the Canadian Rockies, like when making a fire ring, but if I were to go out looking for rocks that make spark I'd be lost as to what to look for and where. Where do you have good odds of finding stones that spark? How do you identify them besides the striking them to see if they'll make a spark?    Related: Is there a way to light a fire in the wild using rocks? "
1720,Why some sleeping bags have four temperature ratings while others have only one?,"Most sleeping bags have a rating with several temperatures, one for the upper temperature limit, one for the average woman to sleep in a comfortable position (""Comfort""), one third for an average man in a curled position (""Lower limit""), the last (""Eemphasized"") for bare survival, as defined in the EN 13537 Standard  Here's two examples:   Valandre Freja Carinthia ECC Line 600   Others bags, though, report one single value. Here's two of them:   Feathered Friends Ibis Ex North Face Inferno   I guess those are using a different standard.  How do those ratings compare? I think it's critical to have a mean to compare the two kinds of rating to get an objective idea. "
1721,"Groups: What are proper occasions for a large, shared hole for waste?","So of course the common standard for proper burying of solid human waste is burial in a cat-hole, and generally this means one hole per instance per person. This is what I practice and teach on personal and group trips, per LNT guidelines.   But in what instance is using one large, group hole (latrine style), an appropriate and practical option? In other words, what situations make a latrine hole a preferable option to the standard cat-hole practice?  Of course it would be covered up, but only after moving on from that campsite. This sounds pretty gross to be honest, but I've known of some people who practice this in some locations.  "
1722,Tips and tricks for backpacking with a guitar,"There are numerous compact and travel guitars that exist, some of which are designed specifically for outdoor pursuits like backpacking. This is one I've been considering.   Being a musician, music is one of the things I miss most while in the wilderness, and I'm hoping to remedy that soon with a guitar that can be taken outdoors, at least on some of my trips. I have zero experience with taking a guitar on backpacking trips and don't know anyone that has. So...   What are some good ways to ensure the guitar stays in good shape while out on trips? What is the best way to pack the guitar in a pack? What other functions, if any, could it serve other than being an instrument? How to deal with rain, other moisture? Any considerations for wildlife being repelled/drawn by the sound? Or issues I haven't thought of...?   Note: Just to clarify, I'm not necessarily looking for recommendations on a travel guitar, but rather the issues associated with taking one (of any type) into the wilderness. However, if certain types lend themselves to better transport than others, then I would think it's worthwhile to mention them in your answer. "
1723,What animal could strip all the bark off the lower 7 feet of this tree?,"I was out in the woods the other day and I came across a tree. It had all of the bark around the bottom removed, and a good layer of wood removed as well. I estimated the damage was a good 7-8 feet from roots to where the bark had not been removed.     The wood shavings were littered around the tree on top of the leaf litter, which tells me it was recent, and happened fairly quickly, as it seems to have happened all after the leaves had fallen.   I know deer will destroy trees in a similar fashion, but given the damage was so tall, I know it could not have been a deer. So my prime suspect is a black bear. This was out in the blue Ridge of Virginia.  Is this something a bear would do? If so, is there anyway to guesstimate the size of the bear?  I have another image closer up to the tree to see the damage. In it, you can see banding, as well as a bit of bark separation, and what looks to be a few holes that may have been cause by boring insects? (brown area of the under bark, near center top of picture).    The tree is located near a spring, near a crest overlooking a valley, next to thick brush in hardwood timber stand consisting of mostly oak and poplar.  No scat immediately around the tree, though there was scat on the trails around the area - dog like with seeds in them. "
1724,Sneaker Sole Replacement,"For the last 4 years or so, my day to day walking/hiking shoes have been a pair of Tevas that I picked up from REI (Riva Event Model: 4103). I'm on my second pair now and they've both lasted about 2 years and both have failed in the same way: the sole gets worn out that the water resistant aspects have become a distant memories.  I've enjoyed these shoes and will replace if necessary, but if possible I'd like to defray the monetary and environmental costs by just repairing them. Is it practical to replace the sole of these shoes and if so, will I need to get a cobbler involved or can it be done at home? "
1725,"What is a ""top cap"" on a climber's haul bag?","What is a ""top cap"" on a climber's haul bag and how does it work? In Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills (and also at neilhopkins.us/mountaineering-guide-2/aid-climbing-equipment) is      A top cap to the haul bag is a good idea to protect the knot connecting the sack to the haul line and help reduce snagging problems while hauling.   but there is no diagram. I can imagine what it looks like because of      An effective top cap can be readily fashioned from an empty 2-liter plastic bottle.   Is the sequence like this, from bottom going up: haul sac, strap, carabiner, knot, (upright) ""top cap"", then haul rope, with the rope going through the small opening of the bottle? "
1726,"If you hear a mountain lion screaming, how close is it?","Female mountain lions will scream to attract a mate, and males will do it as well.  This YouTube video and this one both have audio of what it sounds like.  Given how loud it sounds, would there be any way of estimating how far away the mountain lion is? "
1727,What is the most efficient strategy to melt snow using a stove?,"When melting snow to obtain drinking water, what is the most efficient strategy if one needs more water than results from one pan of snow? Most efficient for me is using a minimum of fuel, not necessary the fastest way.  I can think of multiple strategies:   Squeeze snow in pan, melt fully, pour water in container and repeat. Squeeze snow in pan, melt fully, pour partly and leave some water in pan, add new snow and repeat. Squeeze snow in pan, start melting, pour water out and add new snow as snow melts.   Or am I overthinking this and doesn't it really matter?  Assume that the water is not intended for immediate cooking, as in that case it looks obvious to continue heating until it boils. "
1728,How much stronger is a vertical v-thread than a horizontal one?,I was out ice climbing with a group today and they were using three-point anchors using two vertical v-threads (abalakovs) with one backup ice-bolt. They said the vertical v-threads (one hole over top of the other) were superior and stronger than the horizontal ones (holes side-by-side).   How much stronger are vertical v-threads compared to horizontal ones?  V-Thread:  Source 
1729,How to pick a good camping airbed?,"I'll start with two examples of what I don't want.  Two years ago, we bought a double Kathmandu airbed in some camping shop in New Zealand. It wasn't cheap, and it was really good for a month of camping. But then ... this year, while camping, we were unpleasantly surprised with a big bulge in the middle of the bed (inside seams broke?). The bulge then expanded through pretty much whole bed.  We have another Intex airbed at home for a spare bed, which is slowly leaking air.  None of these issues are apparent when you're buying, and reviews seem to be good for pretty much any airbed. Recommendations that I find online are very generic (e.g. heavy and comfortable when close to home, light when travelling).  Is there a sane way to pick good airbed? "
1730,Are there any techniques for starting and maintaining a fire in snow?,What are the techniques for starting and maintaining a fire in a survival situation when snow is present?  I would like to know if there are any known techniques for starting and maintaining a fire in the wild for survival reasons when there is snow on the ground.  Does the amount of snow alter the technique that is required? 
1731,Can sunlight be used to purify water?,"I have an ultraviolet water purifier. It uses ultraviolet light to kill 99.9% of all viruses and bacteria in one litre of water in 90 seconds.   I was wondering: if UV light can purify water, then if you were to leave a clear bottle of water in direct sunlight would the natural UV rays from the sun kill all the bacteria and viruses in the water?  On that same thought, if UV rays kill bacteria and viruses, can clear water taken from streams exposed to direct sunlight be considered safe to drink? "
1732,What are the risks when encounter a wild animal when camping?,"I'm new in Camping, and recently I have camped in France, in the Vosges region, in the locality called ""Le bonhomme"".  Well it's not the pure wilderness but it was very unusual for me, as it was nobody around and I was in the forest.  So I set up the camp, it was just for the night so I didn't make any fire pit, but just a tent.  When I was trying to sleep, I have eared some grunting, and some scratch on the ground. In this situation I was really stressed but well, I didn't close my eyes because there was those sounds during the whole night, and just near my tent. Sometimes something was scratching the tent canvas. I was very unconfortable with this. I took care to have nothing to eat for not drawing attention of any animals. But there was there anyway.  After this, I searched what was the wildlife in this region, and there was grey wolves, wild boars and some boreal lynx in this region.  I'm pretty sure that there was at one moment some wild boars (Loud noise, big branch cracking) and at another moment some stealthy animals like the grey wolves, maybe curious about the tent ? (Soft noise, something was sniffing the tent but really discreet).  All the forest was frozed (it was -5°C)  So now I have two related questions:   Is there some risks in those kinds of situation? Can I leave the tent in the middle of the night for seeing what's around without getting harmed?  "
1733,Choosing socks for frequent switching cold-warm,"I'm looking for socks for the following conditions and to complement the following footwear.  My wife frequently spends several hours driving a car (setting car temperature to stay around +20°C) , then switches for 30 min to 2 hours for moderate outdoor walking in weather like -5..-10°C (eg waiting for a child which rides alpine ski). Her current socks (cotton) get wet while in the car because of sweating, so her feet quickly starts freezing once she gets outdoors.  It looks like she needs a socks with (a) strong moisture-eliminating properties (think Coolmax or similar fibers?) that will be also (b) comfortable in car conditions and (c) warm enough in outdoor conditions. Is such approach correct?  Given her current shoes, what are optimal socks to keep feets warm during a day?   What mix of fibers/materials to look for (olefin: Coolmax/Drymax etc; modal; viscose; bamboo fiber etc); What % composition of each fiber is most suitable for the problem in hand? Thin or thick socks?   Her current shoes are: Salomon Rodeo WP W (art. number 308922). Photo "

1735,Are there any techniques to cooking food when camping in the wild by harnessing the energy of the sun?,"Are there any techniques to cooking food camping in the wild by harnessing the sun's energy (rays)?  We have all heard of solar panels being used to generate electricity, but are there any techniques that we can use to cook food while camping and thus avoiding the use of a fire to cook with? "
1736,Dealing with wildlife in the desert of California/Nevada in general and in the White Mountains in particular,"I'm planning a hike in the White Mountains of California; see also this related question.  So far, all my hiking have either been day hikes in the densely populated hikes, or treks for up to three weeks in the mountains of Sápmi (where the only significant risks are river crossings and getting lost).  Hiking in desert mountains in spring will certainly be a different experience, requiring additional considerations.  The question As an experienced backpacker in the Eastern US, what should I know before hiking in the Western US? inquires what an eastern US backpacker should know in the western US, and probably all those points apply to me as well (although coming from Europe, there may be points an eastern-US backpacker would be aware of, but not me...).  An answer raises three points: Altitude, Wildlife, and Weather.  The altitude and wildlife points clearly apply directly to me.  My question is specifically about wildlife.  Quoting from the answer:     Be aware of what [wildlife] each region has and how to identify and deal with them   Wilderness.net describes the White Mountains, including one sentence about wildlife:     The variety of steep terrain, rolling plateaus, and deep canyons makes for excellent habitat for desert bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope and mule deer   Considering backpacking practices, do I need to take any specific consideration of those animals?  Are there other animals that I need to take into consideration, such as bears or pumas?  Do they live in the desert at all?   I may be naive not to expect any dangers from these pronghorn antelopes.

1737,"Does skiing over things like sticks, leaves, roots and tree needles damage the skis?","Obviously cross/back-country skis can be damaged by skiing over things like rocks, stones, gravel and asphalt. What about other, softer objects exposed when the snow starts to melt, like sticks, roots, leaves, fir tree needles, soil, etc? How damaging to the skis can these be to slide over? "
1738,What's the problem with electrolyte imbalance and how do I mitigate it?,"In the past week I've seen two answers mentioning electrolytes; one about the grand canyon and one in an answer on a question that was actually about wildlife, but where other desert dangers were described as well.  In the context of outdoor sports, what are electrolytes, why do I need them and where do I get them from?  The Wikipedia article describes that this includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases.  So is it simply a matter of eating salted food to compensate for the salt lost by sweat (for example, eating salted nuts), or are the problem and solution more subtle than that?  This answer mentions Gatorade, which appears to be a brand for commercial sports-themed beverages.  The sport drinks I've tried in the past I found very distasteful, moreso the ones in powdered form.  Do I need those, really, or will other food do, too? "
1739,Tips for travelling through Europe with just a tent,Myself and my girlfriend are hoping to start off in the Netherlands and hitchhike our way down to the south of Spain through various French towns / cities.  We are planning on just bringing sleeping bags and a tent. I have a couple of questions for somebody who might have knowledge in this area.  Does anybody have any tips on where / how to find a suitable location to set up a discrete camp for the night? This one has been bugging me since I know virtually all the land is owned by somebody.   Is there any general hitchhiking etiquette found in Europe? I have been doing a lot of reading on hitchwiki but would like to hear from somebody with first hand experience (also safety / difficulties). 
1740,What are the advantages of a double sleeping bag?,"In the context of a long hike (AT, PCT, CDT, LT, etc.):  What are the advantages and disadvantages of double sleeping bags over two individual sleeping bags? How do they compare to single sleeping bags that can mate?  Which solution can keep you warmer? How much warmer? Which solution yields a lower packed weight?  Essentially, what are the main differences and criteria that should be taken into consideration when choosing a two person sleep system? "
1741,What are the most recommended guide/maps to bring on a PCT thru-hike?,"Among the amalgam of guidebooks and maps for the Pacific Crest Trail, which guidebooks and/or maps are be the best contenders to bring on the trail?  Guthook 2010 review is no longer available. It recommended Halfmile maps, which is still available in March, 2018, combined with PocketPCT, which is not available.  However, postholer maps are not considered in his review.  Guthook provided an excellent answer to this question. Since it's no longer available, there's no way to know if it still holds true.  "
1742,What is water resistant down and how is it made?,"Water resistant down has interesting properties which make it appealing for outdoor applications. However, it is not widely available and seems to be only offered in certain fill powers.  How is the water resistant treatment applied? Are gear manufacturers responsible for waterproofing the down, or do they purchase it that way from the down vendors? Is there any way to apply this new water resistant treatment to down at home or on a small scale? "
1743,Should food be in a bear bag/canister even when I'm hiking?,"I've read that in the western US, backpackers need bear canisters or bear bags, for bears or for other animals.  For example, a post comparing different methods is here.  I must admit I'm a bit daunted, because on my European trips I've never given the slightest worry to animals (food lying around right outside my tent, along with my stove).  The Forest Service states that the food should be in the container whenever you are not actively preparing, eating or unpacking.  Do I really need to keep my food in one of those while hiking?  Are bears or other animals so agressive?   Bear canister, Wikimedia Commons  My hope was that perhaps there are foldable canisters, and while I might struggle to pack my food volume-wise, this is not a problem during the night. "
1744,Can I get away with less advanced food storing methods if backpacking in areas where meeting bears is unlikely?,"A page like this one, as well as a number of questions on this site, discuss how to pack food safely from bears. What about other animals?   This post advises a pretty sophisticated way to protect food against rodents. Is that really needed? This counterbalancing method appears pretty complicated, but a bear canister for the occasional rodent appears overkill.  Are there other ways in areas where meeting a bear is unlikely? The easiest way would be to just risk it and keep food deeply packed away in my backpack. Would that be very unwise?  It seems quite difficult to me to keep food at least 15 feet above the ground and 10 feet horizontally from a tree trunk.  That's almost 5 metres!  Are the warnings exaggerated? "
1745,"What is considered a water source, and why is it recommended to camp so far from them?","I've read one one of the US national forest or wilderness websites that when camping in the wild, one should camp at a certain distance from a water source.  Should I understand a water source to mean a spring/well, or any place where hikers may collect water (streams, lakes, etc.)?  Why is this — I understand that where I leave wastewater etc. is relevant, but how does camping at 10 metre instead of 100 metre from a lake or river make a difference for protection of said lake or river?  I like camping at the lakeshore or at the sound of flowing water, and lakeshores often make excellent camping places. "

1748,Can you tell if a waterfall is slippery based on how it looks?,"Take for example the picture below, taken in the Erawan National Park. The surface of the waterfall is a shade of white, maybe from calcium(?) and it actually very coarse. Even though it's somewhat steep, you could (I'm not advising to) walk right up there.  I've also seen waterfalls that look like stone without anything on them but they were very slippery, possibly because they had some biofilm on them.   Short of touching the rocks, are there any tricks to determine if a waterfall's surface is slippery or not?    "
1749,Is there clay soil in the Adirondacks suitable for earthen primitive building?,"An example of the earthen material I have in mind, this video shows some daub prepared for a wattle-and-daub house at timestamp 7:45: [website]  Cob, cobb or clom (in Wales) is a natural building material made from subsoil, water, fibrous organic material (typically straw), and sometimes lime.1 The contents of subsoil naturally vary, and if it does not contain the right mixture it can be modified with sand or clay.       via [website]     Daub is usually created from a mixture of ingredients from three categories: binders, aggregates and reinforcement. Binders hold the mix together and can include clay, lime, chalk dust and limestone dust. Aggregates give the mix its bulk and dimensional stability through materials such as mud, sand, crushed chalk and crushed stone. Reinforcement is provided by straw, hair, hay or other fibrous materials, and helps to hold the mix together as well as to control shrinkage and provide flexibility.      via [website]Are the materials necessary to make cob or wattle and daub available in the Adirondacks? I think wattle could be made use a variety of trees in the region and I am sure cob can be made nearby too, but what about in the Adirondacks specifically?  What soil or quality does one need to check/test for to know if material is suitable as one of the necessary daub ingredients - binders, aggregates, and reinforcement? Is there a particular soil or property to look for on a service like the USDA Web Soil Survey? "
1750,What is wrong with this belay setup?,"This is a follow on from my answer here. I took this photo of my belay and shared it on Facebook, where I friend of mine (A qualified climbing instructor)  pulled me up on it as I'd made one or two minor mistakes. There is nothing ""dangerous"" here. It's just not 100% optimal from a safety point of view.   Probably worth noting this is UK trad ethics, I know other countries will often do this kind of set up differently. Hopefully the ""issue"" is global but I'm not an expert on non-uk belays so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Question  So the question is, can anyone pull me up on this belay stance? What (if anything) is wrong with this set up?  Additional information  The white arrows indicate the gear placements position (Trad placements in rock). the Black arrow is the load from the climber. The bottom carabiner is passed though both rope loops and attached to the second using a belay plate. I will stand to one side when belaying lining up the load between the gear and the second. Gear is placed above me and there is space to sit away from the rope so I'm not under any loaded ropes should a fall happen.   The bottom biner is not cross loaded, it's just not loaded at the moment so when the second starts climbing it will all pull straight. The HMS carbiner can take two knots easily.   "
1751,Are wattle and daub primitive shelters suitable for the Adirondacks?,"Sometimes natural building techniques just aren't suited for a certain environment. For example, an exposed cob oven in vermont vs. a stone oven would turn out very differently, the cob falling apart in VT's heavy rain.   With that in mind, is wattle and daub suited for the Adirondacks? Similar to in this video though I envision it a little thicker in the ADKs: [website]I've also seen European primitive structures crafted with wattle and daub in some cases, but usually only in certain parts or for relatively open structures. Part of it may depend on my question about soil suitability, but other factors could be due to weather, precipitation, temperatures, wind. "

1755,Understanding the transition in USCG Personal Flotation Device (PFD) Labeling,"In this question a couple years ago: What do life jacket ratings mean (Type I, Type II, etc)?, we see the traditional types many of us learned about in Boating Safety courses, or in Scout/ Youth camp, or from the America Canoe Association or American Sailing Association.  A couple answers there (including one of my own) discuss the definitions and features of the old roman-numeral-typed PFD (i.e. Type I through Type V).  However, it was hinted there regarding the fact that the U.S. Coast Guard had determined the boating public had a poor understanding of the meaning of these types, and was going to eliminate them.  This became official with a ruling issued September 22, 2014 (it's a little dry legalese, but you can read it here.)  Along with this announcement, the Coast Guard also stated they anticipated a several year transition period to allow for, among other things, the states to update their boating laws for the new labeling rules, and for PFD manufactures to begin developing the new label system.  Well, here we are at the start of 2019, and the new labels are beginning to appear on store shelves and in training materials.  What are the new types, how do they compare to the old types, and how have the rules changed for what I need to carry on my boat? "
1756,When/Where do foxes attack humans?,"There is an area that I would like to explore at daytime and at night time.  I have seen only two foxes in that area during the day time. One of the locals told me not to go out at night because foxes hunt as pack and they might attack even a human.  It almost sounds to me like the foxes live close to the area.  Do foxes care day/night when they decide to attack human?   What triggers them to attack a human?  Update 1: To everyone who took time to write answers &amp; comments, I'm really sorry. I somehow thought it was foxes..I should have asked ""When/Where do coyotes attack human?"". However, I think it's nice to know..foxes do not attack human.. "

1758,Why do you not aim for the head while archery hunting?,"In 3D archery and while hunting we're aiming for the lungs and the heart most of the time. At least this is true for bobcats, lynxes, deer and other similar animals.   See this target for example:    According to films and stuff, the best way to kill a human is to shoot in the head.   Is this true? An if yes, why doesn't this also apply to animals?  "
1759,Does newspaper (in shoes) kill Gore-Tex (breathability)?,"While reading this question, another one came to my mind:  Last summer on a mountain hut some guy told my packing newspaper in Gore-Tex (or any similar) shoes wouldn't be good for their breathability.  The explanation seemed to be plausible: Because Gore-Tex is working like a funnel (cone) letting steam out, but no water in, there is a 'working direction'.  If you put newspaper in your shoes, the newspaper would suck the moisture. BUT from outside to inside. So obviously the opposite direction of the Gore-Tex 'working direction'. This guy said it's like pressing water from the wrong side through a funnel and this could (or would) harm the effect of the Gore-Tex.  But everywhere you go, people plug newspaper in there shoes to dry them faster.  So was this guy right or wrong? Does plugging boots with newspaper kill their Gore-Tex effect?  My first thougt was, maybe the newspaper is only sucking the moisture from inside the Gore-Tex layer? "

1762,Skis or Snowshoes for Colorado,"I'm relatively new to Colorado, but would love to get into winter sports more. My question is, I enjoy hiking both flat and relatively steep trails in the snow. Which option would be a better fit: cross country skis or snowshoes?  I am willing to take the time to learn what I need to, so I don't want to go with the ""easier to use at first"" option.  Note: I often hike trails with little snow at first (0-3 inches) but then end up in places that can be 3-4 ft deep in some areas. Right now I am just walking through it as much as possible. But obviously I would like a better  faster way to trivial even with a 10-12 lbs pack.   What would you all recommend? (I have had no experience with either)  Thank you! "

1764,I never adjust for true north. Is this bad practice?,"This question (Calculate true north with a compass and map) got me thinking. I rarely bother adjusting compass bearings for magnetic north. Is this bad? I understand the theory but I just rarely bother. It's never seemed to have caused me any problems.   I mostly navigate in mountainous areas, I wonder if this is more relevant in flat featureless areas? Typically the terrain is just as big a navigational aid as the compass (even in low visibility) and the compass points me at the correct ridge, etc. "
1765,"Are ""skateshoes"" really necessary?","Skaters commonly wearing special kind of shoes. However, from my point of view they just look like a pair of sneakers.

A comment at I never adjust for true north. Is this bad practice? suggesting that:     True north and magnetic north are basically the same thing   started me on a search for a quality answer I could use in a response. I believe the distance between them is larger than size of many small countries, so not sure I would call them basically the same thing.   How much distance (miles/kilometers) is there between True North(Geographic) and Magnetic North Poles? "
1767,Descending a dry grass slope with serious inclination and exposure,"This post here mainly talks about Ice slopes I reckon.  The region where I live, we don't have Ice slopes, but we have lots of grass slopes.  Usual threat is a slope, probably a good 100 m, no bolt to an anchor on, no trees, no hurdles. 'A slip and you are rolling' sort of slopes with 60o incline. I can post pics once I get them on my computer from the card.  What should be the strategy for descending one such slope under unavoidable circumstances? Can glissading be an option?  Assumption: Have a rope along. "
1768,Can you tell the gender of a chipmunk from a distance?,"We have a large number of chipmunks, probably mostly Eastern Chipmunk, Tamias striatus, in our yard in Massachusetts. There are different sizes and a large variation in markings. The behavior appears similar, so the gender isn't obvious.   They all have names, including Long-tail Chip; Short-tail Chip; Chubby Chip; Skinny Chip; Dark-striped Chip; Light-striped Chip; Pointy-head Chip; Speedy Chip; Lazy Chip; Silly Chip; Brave Chip; Shy Chip. They're all Smart Chip, because they're brilliantly adept at getting into bird feeders and tall pots. They can also reach, and eat their way though, plastic bags of food and nuts which are 6 feet up on shelves in the garage.  Without picking them up, is there a way to tell a male from a female?     Update as of April, 2017: Four weeks ago a very pregnant chipmunk popped up out of a hole in the snow. We memorized her markings to the best of our ability. We saw her again a few days later. Since then, we've been feeding her near that hole every day. She dutifully gathers up the seeds and corn and pops back down. Since the babies stay in the nesting burrow for six to eight weeks, she'll probably keep feeding them until then. In the meantime, many other chipmunks are now very active in the yard. There's a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors, and there are holes everywhere. The only way we know about the female is that we saw her when she was pregnant.  "
1769,Circumstances to prefer mittens over common snowboarding gloves?,"I know that if      all things being equal (fabrics, thickness, and insulation), mittens   are warmer than gloves.   from this question.   However, I feel like there's was a trend to ""mittens"" the last years. It's unlikely that this only comes from the fact that ""mittens are warmer"" cause it's not that of a problem (in common) while snowboarding.     In which circumstances are they preferable over common gloves?    Or is it just a matter of personal style preference?     I ask from a snowboarding point of view:   Park/Freestyle   Backcountry/Powder      ???    "
1770,How to deal with a tooth infection?,"Caries and other similar disease can be a painful threat. It even can be a danger to life if not threatened over several months.      An abscess may result from a trapped piece of food, uncontrolled   periodontal (gum) disease, or even an infection deep inside a tooth   that has spread to adjacent periodontal tissues. In any case, the   condition can cause intense pain due to the pressure that builds up in   the pus-filled sac. Prompt treatment is required to relieve the pain,   keep the infection from spreading to other areas of the face (or even   elsewhere in the body), and prevent tooth loss.   From Tom Hanks Abscessed Tooth Gets Cast Away  If one is somewhere in the wild (in a survival situation over a long period of time) far away from medical help and gets an infection, how should he react? For example in the movie ""Cast away"" the stranded person (Robinson Crusoe like situation) uses a skid to pull his tooth out:     Note: Only watch the scene on Youtube if you've the stomach for it!   Is it even a good idea to remove an infected tooth?  If yes, what is the recommended way to do this? Would be awesome to use natural material only but common camping equipment is also okay. So, an ice skate as mentioned above isn't acceptable :)   If no, what else should one do (treatment with herbs etc.)? "
1771,How to concentrate on a minimal point on a solid surface?,"The ""aim small, miss small"" principal for instinctive archery states that you should aim for the smallest possible point.   An example:     In this picture you can see that there are a lot of ""bullet holes"" (more like arrow holes =) ) in the kill. You can choose one and absolutely concentrate on it.   However, what to do if you've a pretty new target? One with no bullet holes? Also, you are too far away to see differences in the fur etc.   How do you concentrate on the smallest possible point on a solid surface?   For example imagine this target:     Let's say we are about 40 meters away. You'll only see a solid brown surface from the shooting point.  "
1772,Get the bad smell out of sheep wool,"Note: This question might be a little offtopic. Kill it if necessary.   I've always had ""THC"" outdoor jackets which are knitted sheep wool jackets. However, they stink like a stable. Normally I put them outside for a week and the smell is gone.   This time the smell refuses to leave the jacket. It's been outside for two weeks now and still stinks a little bit.   Is there something to speed up the process of removing the smell? Or something to get rid of the smell immediately?  "
1773,"How to walk on wet, slightly rotten wood?","I've had serious problems walking on such wet, slightly rotten(*) wood this weekend. It was extremely slippery even though I was wearing my hiking boots.    As soon I applied pressure onto the food standing on these battens, it slipped away.   Is there something one can do about it? Maybe a special tread on the shoes or walking technique?     *) As Aravona pointed out in the comments, this surface might not be rotten but ""have a mildew, moss, type organism growing on top of it (common on decking in your garden too, it comes off with a pressure wash)."" "
1774,Is there a benefit for animals who return to the area of a deadly forest fire after the fire is out?,"In September of 2017, for nearly two weeks, the Kenow Wildfire raged through a swath of Canada. Its largest impact was on the Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta. More than 38,000 hectares, (94,000 acres), of land, including 70% of the forested area in the Park, were completely destroyed by what was called ""extreme fire behavior."" According to CBC News, the full total, including the park and its surrounding regions in British Columbia, was approximately 42,000 hectares, (103,784 acres).  We have a few questions about the Kenow Wildfire here on the site. This one was seeking information as to how many animals had been found deceased in the area of the fire.   There was a comment under that question which mentioned eventual benefits to animals after this type of fire.     I just finished reading on the Parks Canada website that the animals that return to the park after a fire really benefit from the blaze. It's almost like a reset button. The long term effects of forest fires are really healthy for both the plant and wildlife. – ShemSeger Sep 30, 17 at 5:21    That comment made me curious about a few things.    Are there studies and other sources which corroborate what the Parks Canada website said?   If so, where are some and what types of things do they say? What is meant by ""really benefit from the blaze?""   What has to happen for such a severely damaged area to be considered ""reset?""  What constitutes enough ""long term effects"" to make it ""really healthy for both the plant and wildlife?"" Obviously, every forest fire is different, but if there really is a benefit to the returning animals, is there an approximate time when this area will be recovered enough to provide this benefit?  "
1775,Is it easier for shorter people to walk the slopes of a mountain due to a lower center of gravity?,"Apart from the obvious advantages of longer strides and reach, does a higher center of gravity make it more difficult for taller people to walk the slopes of a mountain? Or in other terms, do shorter people find it easier due to a lower center of gravity?  From what I can imagine, a shorter person will have a lower center of gravity and thereby lesser issue with balancing. I'm not good at physics but it seems that a lower center of gravity would allow for a better time on the slopes of a mountain.  "
1776,Are rolling snow pieces a sign of increased avalanche danger?,"In spring conditions it often happens that the upper layer of snow warms up and small pieces of it roll down leaving traces behind them.   Like in this picture I have found in the Internet:     Given that there is a solid base layer of snow below, is it a sign of increased avalanche danger? E.g. if you compare two similar mountain slopes (same altitude, same exposure, same inclination) in the exact same conditions (same season, temperature, time of the day), does the slope with rolled down snow pieces has a higher avalanche danger? "
1777,How dangerous are alligators to people canoeing?,"Inspired by this question, how dangerous are alligators to people out canoeing in say the Everglades in Florida?  I am sure there is some danger because from time time you here about people winning Darwin awards by going swimming with alligators  What precautions should one take if canoeing in places with alligators? "
1778,What is the risk of getting lost while canoeing in a cypress swamp?,"Based on the answer here I would be exploring a cypress swamp in the Mississippi valey north of the 35th Parrell.   If I canoe in a lake or on a river, I always have a pretty good idea where I am, and my entrance and exit points are pretty easy to identify.  I have no idea about what it is like inside a cypress swamp.  What is the risk of getting lost? If there is a significant risk, are there any locations or attributes that make it less likely I will get lost?  "
1779,Can skunk spray be fatal to geese or other animals?,"This question comes from a circle of thought processes, so bear with me a moment...  The skunks are waking up from hibernation, and after smelling so many sprays, one can't help but wonder (theoretically) what would happen if skunks were to suddenly go extinct? While discussing this with an animal control officer, and the potential negative impacts of skunks being removed from the ecology, he mentioned that one thing skunks do is help control bird populations by eating eggs.   Skunks coming out of hibernation also happens to be the same season geese are returning from the south, and there are quite a few mating pairs looking for nesting spaces. I know of an island in a lake not far from here where geese lay tonnes of eggs every year, right on the ground. Such an island would be a feast for a loose skunk, but anyone who's crossed paths with a mad goose knows that they aren't a bird to be trifled with. I wondered: Would a goose be deterred by a slow, lumbering skunk? Or would it go full angry goose mode and try to attack it to save it's nest? If it did it would probably get sprayed. In which case, how would the goose come out of that situation? Could the spray from a skunk be enough to kill a goose or other animals? "
1780,How can I get a GPS location for this tree on a distant hillside?,"I want to hike to the base of this tree (circled in red in the photo). That's a hillside full of full grown trees beneath it, and it looks like over a full tree's height sticking up above the other trees. It's got to be enormous.    So how do I get a GPS location of this thing on a hillside far away from me? I could probably hike to the tree, but as soon as I enter the forest, I'll lose all visibility of this specific tree. Are there apps that could help me with getting a GPS location for a distant object? Maybe some kind of surveyor app?  Any other ideas on how to get there, other than using a GPS location?  Edit: Other information that helps to frame the problem   This tree is near the edge of a rain forest reserve of approximately 500km² in Costa Rica. So getting to this spot through the forest will necessarily be winding and steep, if not altogether physically impossible (for me, at least). The only available views of the object are from kilometers away with a residential area between.   Noting the two factors above, moving in a straight line towards the tree along a bearing is not an option. "
1781,What is a back bearing when navigating with map and compass?,"Sometimes when navigating with map and compass one will take a back bearing, i.e. a bearing taken directly opposite to the direction one is travelling?  When and why would one want to do this? "
1782,"Origin of the ""bell curve"" for rock climbing route setting","When learning how to set climbing routes on artificial walls, setters are often told to set route difficulties according to a ""bell curve"".  An example of this is mentioned on this page.    What is the origin of this ""bell curve""?  Is there any science behind it, or is it just a dogma?    EDIT: Since there seems to be some confusion, let me rephrase my question:      Has anyone compiled statistics about the distribution of climbers' grades?  If so, can I find these statistics somewhere?  "
1783,Storing hunting firearms and ammo in a safe not designed for them?,"I just got my first handgun and had previously bought a safe that we had used for other things. The safe is a made by first alert, and is the 2087F. It says in the manual, which I've thankfully kept, that the safe is not designed to store medication, firearms, ammo, etc. My question is, what does this warning actually mean? I know that fireproof and water proof safes don't actually stand up to major fires; everything in it will only last for about an hour before the internal temperature rises. This seems like even gun safes would have the same problem, and any ammo would eventually go off anyway.  So assuming that I did store my Glock in this safe, with a couple of hundred rounds of ammo, what is the worst that could actually happen? Would I wake up up at 3am to a few hundred rounds going off simply because of the airtight seal? Is that even possible?  Sorry if that's a lot of questions. I'm genuinely curious though, if there is any real danger at all. "
1784,Does it really matter which snow shoe goes on which foot?,"Hiring from a normally good company, I realised as I was putting them on that I have been given two left snow shoes. Other than the strapping direction and the 'L' on each they seem very nearly symmetrical so... Does it actually matter?  I was already where I wanted to use them so I did, without any obvious problems... Is it even worth going back to get one swapped for the rest of the hire? "
1785,Compromised Ropes in Retail Stores,"Reposting this from a Facebook discussion. It's a picture taken from a retail store where they have attached a pin-tag through the rope to prevent theft; a common practice at this location.  My gut reaction is to avoid it like the plague, but I have a tendency to treat the rope like it's sacred. Has anyone seen this elsewhere? Would you climb on it?   "
1786,Should I expect to need snowshoes in the Serra da Estrela in April?,"I have a work trip to Portugal later this month and I intend to attach a short trekking/backpacking trip in the Serra da Estrela.  I have around 62 hours.  Will I need snowshoes for my hike?  The Serra da Estrela is a mountain range up to 2000 metres high.  Nearby Guarda is Continental Portugal's highest city (1000 metres high) and has an average April temperature range of 4.6–12.4°C, which would mean 1000 metre higher up should be around -2–6°C, but that doesn't tell me about the microclimate of areas such as Covão da Amatade (1440 m), the Covão dos Conchos (1640 m), or the area in-between (trail passes over 1800 m).  These things are very local and depend on many factors.  Is anyone familiar with the area in different seasons and could tell me if I should expect to need snowshoes? "
1787,Backpack for both ice tools and snow shoes,"Are there backpack types/systems that would allow to both conveniently carry snowshoes and ice tools?   I always find that packs with good ice tool attachment system simply have no place for snowshoes. In the scenario when you walk in crampons or micro-spikes, the only place for the snowshoes is on top of the pack blocking the access and also making your profile wide. When the rope is thrown into the mix, this makes for a logistics disaster.  This is not an uncommon scenario though and there must be a solution. Nevertheless ski-mountaineering packs for example have good attachment for skis/snowboard, but are usually too small, climbing packs have no room for snowshoes etc.. Perhaps there is a category of packs for the application or there are features that help to identify possible candidates?  More details about the pack requirements:    Day-trips, not extended expeditions. Current pack Millet Axpel 42, a couple of Petzl ice tools + ice axe, MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes, 50m Petzl rope, crampon bag, ice screws. Lots of things to be kept outside the pack. Winter conditions can be very cold and windy, so have to carry a serious down jacket.  A PROPOSED ANSWER, LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK   I believe that in a climbing specific pack, the single most important extra feature that helps carrying snowshoes, ice tools, rope etc. as described above, is long compression straps with reversed buckles; see for example or some photos I made for this purpose. When configured this way, the compression straps can be lengthened and wrapped around the pack to attach snowshoes, pickets and what not. To my knowledge at least two companies (Gregory and Mountain Hardwear) make packs with reversed buckles and many other do not. Not sure why and what the downside of reversed buckles is.  Other such features are having a side access to the pack (because the top is blocked by the rope) and two lid straps so that the lid buckle doesn't get blocked when the snowshoes are attached. "
1788,How can I view a route from a .kml file overlayed on an Ordnance Survey map?,"I am taking part in a 100K event later this year, and the organizers have made available a .kml file of the route downloadable from here. This is great, but I want to view this route on a UK 1:25000 Ordnance Survey (OS) map, the kind that Bing Maps presents, when you choose Ordnance Survey as your display option. As is, I can only view the route in Google Maps which lacks much of the information than an OS map provides.   I can compare Google Maps displaying the .kml route side-by-side with Bing Maps displaying the OS map, but is there a way of pulling the .kml file into Bing Maps? Or is this functionality available elsewhere? "
1789,How to use a static rope as a tether at the anchor of a top rope climb?,"I just recently returned from a course where we utilized a static rope to construct a top-rope anchor from a top-accessed ledge: the system was like that described in this answer - the resulting configuration of the rope being a ""V"" with an additional line running from one of the apexes turning the static configuration into an ""N"".   The actual anchor legs are accomplishable via a number of means; however, when establishing the instructor tether, I am unsure of what knot is acceptable when going over the ledge and transferring to the pre-setup rappel.  Typically, one leg is wrapped around a tree (I climb in the Southeast) and is secured with a Bowline (not enough for a tail). The length of the rope is run down to ledge and back to another anchor point (in this case a tree), creating the ""V"".   What I've typically done is used doubled cordellete around the tree (redundancy) with an Overhand on a Bight. A locking carabiner is put through that Bight and the final leg is tied to that using a clove hitch.     Image source  Is it appropriate to use the tail (on the right; as an example) of the adjustable hitch for my instructor tether? If not, how would you configure your use of the natural anchors to provide you with a tether for managing the site? "
1790,How can I avoid an encounter with a tiger?,"I'm backpacking through a national park in India, which also happens to be a tiger reserve. I understand that chances of even spotting a Bengal tiger are slim, but still, what precautionary measures can I take to avoid an encounter with the largest non-aquatic mammalian predator on Earth? And if I still find myself facing the beast, what actions can I take to keep me (and others if it's a group) safe? "

1792,Slings for anchoring and lanyard in rock climbing,"Probably common question, but: What slings do you use to build anchors for belaying the 2nd in rock climbing? Dyneema or nylon?  I had discussed this problem with my friend and he said that Dyneema is better as it has greater strength ratio and other characteristics (but it's not important).  As I know and had remain DMM's tests (HOW TO BREAK NYLON &amp; DYNEEMA® SLINGS and SLINGS AT ANCHORS [VID]), nylon has better fall absorption, so, I would use these slings on anchors and lanyard when belaying.

It should use    distance (longer is harder? e.g. 1 to 10 miles x 1 effort, over 10 x 1.5 effort),  height gain and height loss (a mountain at the end of the walk is harder?), gradient (exponential effect? i.e. you may not notice walking up a 10% incline (zero effort), 20% might be ok (x1.5 effort), but 40% might very hard (x10 effort)    Thanks, Andrew "
1798,Snake on chest while sleeping?,"Now, this is not very common, however I have heard it enough times from people to know that it actually does happen.  When sleeping in the open or in an open tent (yes, i know you shouldn't), snakes can 'crawl' up on you due to the heat that you emit. I know of a few cases from friends of mine in which the snake was on top of the sleeping bag on the chest/stomach area. I don't know if that is usual practice or just accident. And both stories they got rid of it by either notifying other members of group, which took care of it, or by removing it by hand.  Is there a safer, more intelligent way to remove the snake from your chest?

1801,Avoiding building a belay anchor too low down,"Sometimes when I'm trad climbing it seems really tough to avoid an awkward belay, and a common type of awkwardness is when the belay device ends up too low. Below is a drawing of a situation I was in recently.    The tree was small, and I didn't want to depend on it all by itself. To back it up, the only other placements I could find were in the crack.

1807,Should I be using Dyneema slings for lead climbing anchors?,"I've seen a few of these comparisons around but I've always struggled to make sense of them.   At the moment I do quite a lot of Alpine style routes (lowish grade (HS), long multi pitch routes, typically up arete's etc) in Snowdonia. These routes typically have lot's and lot's of spikes. So I tend to use these spikes as lead anchors as I move up. At the moment most of my slings are Dyneema slings. It occurred to me the other day that maybe this wasn't a great combination?  Given the low stretch properties of Dyneema. Should I be using these as lead anchors over flakes or should I switch to nylon?  Presume the flake will take a the impact.  "
1808,Have mainstream knife steels improved in the last generation?,"I have a lot of knives that are 20-30 years old, and I've never spent more than $100 on any knife.  Have there been appreciable advances in the steels or treatments applied to mainstream knives over this period?  I.e., are there knives available today under $100 that would perform noticeably better than anything I might have bought for that price a generation ago?  I know that a lot of differences in blades amount to tradeoffs between durability, flexibility, corrosion resistance, etc.  So an ""advance"" would be something like, ""significantly better in at least one measure without sacrificing performance in any other measure.""

1814,How to select a good GPS receiver?,"What should one look for in the specifications to determine whether a handheld purpose-built GPS receiver provides good navigational consistency under reasonably normal, low-speed conditions? Highly preferably both in open areas as well as potentially dense woodland.  I am looking primarily for something that will work well for walking and bicycling (hence low-speed; good accuracy while travelling by car is less of a concern because then even a 15 meters error may translate to about half a second of travelling time).  Are marine units as a general rule better in this regard than (for want of a better word) ""personal"" GPS receivers, in the absence of an external antenna? Or are they simply more rugged, and certified for marine use, while providing little potential benefit to non-maritime users?  My current (admittedly somewhat dated) GPS receiver, even after having had plenty of time to download a full GPS almanac, with a clear view of the sky and half a dozen satellites to work with, often reports navigational accuracy to be in the range 10-20 meters. What's more, that number tends to vary quite wildly. That certainly is good enough to e.g. find one's way back to a known location such as getting back to the car or campsite, but as soon as you need more accuracy than that, it falls way short.  I will be using the receiver primarily within Scandinavia, and Sweden in particular, generally outside of cities and often in forested areas.  To clarify, it doesn't have to provide pin-point position accuracy (for that, 10-20 meters is very often quite sufficient), but consistency in readings in the same area is much more useful. As an example, if I lay down a track and then have the dog follow that track, I am very interested in how closely the dog actually follows the track but I am not particularly interested in the exact location of the track. So, if the readings are off by some reasonable distance that isn't a major concern (as has been pointed out, it's not like being 20 meters off means you are hopelessly lost; if it is, it's not like a GPS receiver is likely to help much); as long as that within a reasonably short time frame (more than minutes, less than hours) two readings taken in the same physical location match well in terms of the reported location, that's good enough for me.

1815,What is the correct way to attach an autoblock to your harness for rappelling?,When rappelling and using an autoblock consisting of a french prusik knot it seems there may be some options on how and where to attach the autoblock to my harness.    Is there a correct placement on the leg loop to attach the autoblock?    Is there a correct orientation for the carabiner? 
1816,"5-hour loop hike near Boulder, Colorado","I'll have the good part of a Saturday to enjoy in Boulder, Colorado on 18 May.  What is a suitable area for a day, loop hike close to the city?  My criterion for ""close"" is that the start of the trail can be reached with at most 30 minutes cycling or a short bus ride.  By a ""day hike"" I mean around 5–6 hours not counting breaks.  By ""loop"" I mean that it ends where it starts, not necessarily that no part of the trail is walked twice.  I've found a handful of hikes at Wikiloc and quite many at OSMP, but most hikes appear quite short, less than 6–7 km.  Via wikiloc I find one hike between 5 and 10 mi in length, but this is not a loop so poses logistic issues.  Is there any other place where I can filter hikes near Boulder by length and 'loop vs line'? "
1817,How much warmth dead leaves add if placed under your tent/pad?,"During the fall season, fallen leaves from deciduous trees such as maple, oak, etc. can be found in abundance. Dead leaves can be gathered and placed under your sleeping system in order to sleep more comfortably and presumably warmer.  How much R-value does a pile of leaves provide? This is of course dependent on the type of leaves (or composition), quantity, dampness and other factors.  Considering the possible variation, what level of R-value could you expect by gathering dead leaves? "
1818,Washing dishes with seawater or freshwater?,"When backpacking in a coastal region, you sometimes have access to both fresh water (e.g. a stream) and salt water (sea, bay, etc.).  If you do not treat the water used for washing dishes, what are the pros and cons of using saltwater vs. freshwater? Is there one source that is less prone to contamination?  The choice is easy if the shoreline is polluted or the stream is next to a privy (established or... improvised). However, when there are no obvious differences in water quality, which one would be more recommended and why? "
1819,Toproping with two ropes joined by a double fisherman's,"The other day we were waiting in line for a popular 200 foot single pitch climb in the valley and the party in front of us was using two 70 meter ropes they had joined together with a double fisherman's as a top-rope. I had never seen or heard of this being done before and I can think of a couple of reasons why I wouldn't be comfortable doing this myself:    Amount of rope stretch in 140 meters of dynamic rope Amount of rope drag on less-than-vertical routs when using 140 meters of rope The knot getting caught in a constriction or on a ledge Increased rope-abrasion where the knot is tied, since the rope rubbs on the rock when the rope is weighed with a climber during lowering Not being able to belay a climber all the way to the anchor, since the knot is going to interfere with the ATC if the climb is not exactly the length of the rope tied to the climber, potentially rendering the retrieval of the anchor dangerous, or endangering a novice climber who doesn't notice that the rope is not advancing any more as they make forward progress. ...   I can also think of a couple of reasons why there are certain situations where this minght be the smaller of two evils:   An unexperienced climber does not have to rappel In a situation where the weather is fickle, no-one has to belay from the top, expediting the process of getting everyone off the rock faster, at the expense fo leaving the anchor at the top When climbing with several novice climbers, the most knowledgable climber can stay at the ground to help with tying in and crowd control at the base of the climb. Reducing the wait on popular routes (This is more of a convenience...)   Does anyone know if using two ropes as a top-rope is condoned or discouraged by professional guides? Also, has anyone heard of any accidents or close calls that have happened when using two ropes in this manner? Does anyone know of any testing that has been done on this technique?   Feel free to add benefits or disadvantages that I have missed. "
1820,"What does ""expedition-weight"" mean with regard to clothing?","I'm going on a trip to Alaska in September, including a guided camping/trekking trip in Denali. In the packing list I received from the company, they recommend having an ""expedition-weight"" top and pants as ""extra layers"". What, exactly, does this mean?   I've seen ""expedition-weight"" as a descriptor for fleece tops, but I've never been clear on whether there's a standard definition of the term. Does it only apply to polar fleece, or to other materials as well? Does it refer to a certain thickness/density of fibers, or just to a degree rating?   For what it's worth, this is what the list says under the ""extra layers"" category (separate from the regular layers of t-shirts, mid-weight synthetic tops and bottoms, synthetic hiking pants, and rain gear):   Expedition-weight synthetic top Expedition-weight or fleece synthetic bottoms Fleece or synthetic/down fill jacket  "
1821,How tight should the line be kept for toproping?,"I was climbing with someone recently and they complained that there was too much slack any time the line wasn't completely taut.  By the same token when they were belaying me it was almost hard to climb because it felt like the rope was pulling me off the wall the whole time.    How much tension/slack should there be?  Is there a good safe ""zone"" or is it just purely personal preference?  Edit:  Generally I am not climbing more than 30' and I'm climbing indoors.  I apologize for the vagueness.  I'm just very new to climbing. "
1822,How is hygiene possible with ocean water only?,"Is it possible to clean yourself and clothes with ocean water only, without polluting the water and almost without budget ? If so, how ?  I've read that it's possible to:   brush your teeth with sand, take 1h sun baths, let the clothes take 2h sun baths,   But that would be in the desert, maybe there are better possibilities with ocean water ? "
1823,Are sleeping bags needed in southern Spain in summer?,"My girlfriend and I are going camping in Europe this summer and are starting off in Spain. We have this tent, and are looking into sleeping bags. We have also been keeping an eye on the weather in Spain at night time and are wondering whether a sleeping bag is actually needed? We don't really want to spend a load of money on a sleeping bag if we're just going to melt in them.   Maybe we just don't know enough about the right sleeping bags?  We were thinking maybe just getting sleeping mats and a small blanket.   Has anyone got any experience that could help us decide what to do? "
1824,How can I conserve water over long treks?,"Is there any way I can balance out drinking water when taking a trek, or simply taking a hike to one of the local peaks around here? Even if I come stocked, I tend to end up run out of water close to the peak, or halfway through a trek, which leaves another half to deal with.  Are there any ways I can effectively conserve water? Is there any way to balance water consumption? "
1825,Sighting in a Rifle without firing a shot,I was wondering if there is a way to sight in a rifle scope without firing a shot.   There are some reasons why I think it would useful to be able to do this. One depending on the scope you may have to sight it in often especially if you are carrying it around daily. 2 To conserve ammo and 3 To do it silently  I have a scope that has the traditional bullseye crosshair and then has triangle markings for every 100 yards below the crosshair. I have a laser bore sight.   So my thought was I have a piece of paper with markings on it or some kind of pre marked target and put it a certain reasonable distance away say 10-25 yards.  I'm sure there is some kind of math that would allow you to extrapolate the bullet drop to match the crosshair and the 100 yard triangles and be able to put those marking on the target.   Basically you use the laser bore sight to sight in the rifle at 25 yards directly on the bullseye and then adjust it to where the 100 yard triangles and match the bullet drop marking on the target.   Does something like this exist? I know it wouldn't be perfect but maybe it would be good enough.   Maybe the above is a stupid question.   Does sighting it in at 25 yards with a laser bore sight automatically line up the 100 yard triangles? 
1826,"What is this sharp, curved notch on my knife for?","I recently bought a knife that near the handle end of the blade has a sharp, curved part:    I don’t think it’s a choil because it’s sharp. What is its use? I thought something to do with stripping sinew from bones maybe?  It is a PBK Brute Lock Knife MH-689.  "
1827,How to sharpen the line cutter/gut hook on a knife?,"Some knives have gut hooks,    and some have line cutters,    Source  It basically the same notch just optimized for different purposes.  How exactly would one sharpen the gut hook/line cutter? Its not as easy as sharpening the blade. "
1828,Alpinism without short roping?,"I am looking for a way into alpinism. The most common route I've found is signing up for a multi-day guided group course in a place like Chamonix, culminating in a small summit like Petite Aiguille Verte etc.  My main concern around such courses is the seemingly ubiquitous us of 'short roping' multiple clients to one guide. Being somewhat of a hyper aware chap, the idea of having my fate dependent on the concentration/shore-footedness of a fellow novice whom I've known for 3 days makes me anxious to say the least.  Whilst I'm aware that mountains entail uncertainty and risk, avoiding short roping seems like an easy win in terms of minimising avoidable risks.  Does anyone have any examples of ways into alpinism without/with minimal short roping? Am I being completely irrational?  "
1829,What to do with chalk when deepwater soloing?,"I have been climbing for a short while and loving it. Now that I've gotten a fair bit of practice with indoor climbing I'm thinking about where this new love of mine can take me. The obvious answers are bouldering and leading outdoors but I've also seen some videos on deepwater soloing.  When I saw these videos I always wondered, what happens to your chalk if you take a chalkbag with you and fall? Do you need to throw whatever chalk remains out after a fall deepwater soloing? "
1830,Help me interface these two nautical devices,"I'm crew on a boat (wooden 8.5m from 1973) which has a GPS and a tiller pilot that seem to work fine separately, but don't seem to want to talk to one-another. My captain is adamant this combination ""used to work, but is not working now""; I myself have never attempted to use the autopilot, nor seen it in use.  The GPS is a Garmin GPSMap 182C which talks NMEA 0183 v3.0; According to its documentation, it sends ""GPRMC, GPGGA, GPGSA, GPGSV, GPGLL, GPBOD, GPRTE, and GPWPL (as well as PGRME, PGRMZ, and PSLIB)"".  The pilot is a Tillerpilot TP32 which also talks NMEA 0183. According to its documentation, it accepts ""APA, APB, RMA, RMB, RMC, BWR, BWC, VHW, XTE (as well as VWR and MWV)"".  As you'll notice, these abbreviations are helpfully incomparable, and I haven't become wiser by studying references.  The wiring connections I have all quadruple-checked; the only thing I cannot check is the actual data content of the NMEA signal data. I have also triple-checked that the NMEA settings are sane (GPS Port 1 out: NMEA v3, 4800 baud; GPS Port 2 out: None; and yes it's port 1 that's connected through to the tiller pilot's socket). I have been unable to determine the baud rate of the Tillerpilot, and the parity settings of both devices, but I must assume they are set to a common standard.  So my questions are:   Are these two devices, in fact, compatible? If they are, what more can I check?   If necessary please advice in comments for the following:   Should I post this else instead, and if so - where?? (There seems to be no good fit for questions of an nautical-electrical nature. I posted to Meta, which suggested either Outdoors or Electrical; the latter just closed my 1st try as off topic so I'm also trying here.) Are there any better tags for this question here?  "
1831,How to find ticks in your hair?,"This TGO answer recommends putting possibly tick-infested clothing into a dedicated dryer, where they will be killed by desiccation.  The source used in the answer, the Appalachian Mountain Club, should know.  But what about finding/removing/killing ticks in one's hair?  Every source says to examine one's body carefully to find and remove ticks.  Easy to say, but I have often wondered how to examine the portion of my head, or someone else's head, covered by hair.  What is the best way to search for ticks that may have taken up residence in the forest of one's hair, particularly the ticks that carry Lyme's Disease?  This year will probably be a banner year for ticks in the Northeast of the US, so this question is a real concern.   Eventually, the tick will dig in, and then itch, and it will be easier to find, but still not easy to zero in on it and tweeze it out.  The dryer answer suggests that one might be able to eliminate the search and use a hair dryer.  Is there any information on the best way to find a tick on one's head, and/or the efficacy of a hair dryer to desiccate the tick to death?  (Please, no answers about covering up or using DEET or other repellants or avoiding long grass or foliage :)  Assume a tick.)  "
1832,"Who to contact for a bird with broken wing in Portugal, Algarve?","I saw a bird with an injured wing among the rocks on a beach in Portugal (Algarve). The bird has been on the beach since Friday evening, and her wing feathers have completely dropped off by now.  It's quite big (a seagull?) and I'm not at all confident to capture it myself. I also have no idea how to capture it or give it first aid :(  I tried calling GNR, the regular Police, the Maritime Police, and some conservation SOS lines, but they all say they can't pick it up. The GNR advised me they don't pick up injured animals any more (the rep said ""new rules"") :(  I feel really bad about leaving the bird to die in such a way (not sure if it can even recover at this point).   Is there anybody I can contact?   (There is one more organisation ICNF that works only on workdays that I plan to call tomorrow.)  Thanks in advance for any advice or help!  Update Monday, 3 days later: called like 10 more different numbers and they just keep giving me new numbers to call which don't pick up or give me new numbers... :(  The numbers I've called on the slim chance they are helpful for someone else in the future even though they did not work for me sadly:   1) SOS Environment Line (SEPNA / GNR) 808 200 520  2) The nearest GNR station to allow referrals to the SEPNA team  GNR Portimão 282 420 750 3) Nearest ICNF Headquarters (on weekdays from 9am to 5pm), ICNF Lagos 282 402 320  4) RIAS Phone 927 659 313   5) Rescue centre Olhao 289 700 210  6) Maritime police  282 767 983  7) regular police  282 780 240  8) local city hall Environment &amp; urban services  "
1833,As a tall female should I be looking at male or female backpacks?,"When buying stuff I have never cared whether a specific thing is a female or a male model. All I care about is the fit. Since I am tall, a lot of female oriented equipment, e.g. skis, wouldn't even come in my size. The clothes, on the other hand, I would usually choose from the female section, because despite them sometimes being too short, they would better fit my body shape.   What about the backpacks though? I believe that till now I have always had unisex/male bags. But when recently searching for a new backpack, I have noticed that the backpack section in the shop suddenly became very gendered.   I believe there could be some useful differences in female oriented backpacks, such as the location of the chest strap. Are there any other advantages?   I have also noticed that those bags seem somewhat small. Is it possible that female oriented backpacks would be too small for me, a 178cm-tall person? (5'10""). Should I even be considering those backpacks? "
1834,Is it possible to acclimatize to a cold weather in a short time?,"On some of my Himalayan treks I've seen people who wear shorts or wear single layer of clothing and shiver due to the cold weather (most of these people live in a tropical climate). When I've asked what they've been up to, the answer I've always received is that they are getting their bodies used to the cold weather. While I personally have felt this is foolishness (and I always end up wearing multiple layers), are these people really onto something? Does it help to help to expose yourself to the elements thereby help your body to get used to the cold weather in a short period of time?  If not, is there a way one can prepare beforehand to get used to the cold weather? (based on  a comment, maybe take cold showers everyday?) "
1835,How should you find out about local shooting ranges in a new area?,"Sometimes people move to a new area or go hunting far from home. What standard methods and techniques should a person use to find out where they can shoot or sight in firearms?

Answers involving specific web resources are acceptable, but I'm looking for more than lmgtfy.com style answers.  "
1836,Do birds eat chillies? Do they feel the chilli heat?,"We had a few white browed bulbuls visit us recently.   One of them seemed to have a peculiar interest in the chillies that grew in one of our pots (I believe these are bird's eye chillies [no pun intended]. They are really hot). I wasn't able to see if it was actually eating up the chillies, but for sure it was tearing them down from the plant. Do birds eat chillies? Do they feel the same heat as we do? (obviously there's no direct way of knowing, but any scientific study done on this?)    "
1837,Beach fishing - Should I get waders or long rod to cast further into the sea?,"Many beaches where I want to do surf fishing (from shore) are almost flat for many feet into the sea. Some of the beaches have a steep slope into the sea. I hope to catch striped bass, perch or anything else other than sharks and stingrays.  So, I thought of getting waders to increase my casting range. With waders, I could walk a few feet into the shallow water and cast further into the sea at low or high tide.  Is it a good idea to use waders to increase casting range ? Instead of that, should I get a very long ( say 14 feet +) rod to cast further ? Should I get both long rod and waders ? "

1840,What is the minimum grade of the routes set in the IFSC world cups?,"I was recently watching the IFSC world cup held in Meiringen. One of the interesting observations that came across (made by the commentators) in the semis was that the routes were much easier for a shorter climber than the taller ones. And in the finals, the routes for the women turned out to be much easier than the ones set for men.   So, is there a standard followed when it comes to international sports competitions regarding the routes set? Are there minimum difficulty levels that need to be matched by the route setters? "

1843,Is it actually useful to ration food?,"Is it actually useful to ration food?  What is the difference between eating a little bit of food at an interval and eating enough to be full at once?   I'm getting the same amount of calories/nutrition** regardless of when I consume it, so who cares? Why not just eat whenever you're hungry to the point of satiety?  Is that an overly-simplistic view?  ** I suppose there could be a difference in the percentage of nutrients absorbed. If I get too much of a nutrient, perhaps my body will excrete it, so, in that case, it's better to consume it periodically when your body needs it.  The scenario is being stranded somewhere not knowing when rescue will come - so generally no activity. "
1844,Is it ok to use rolled aluminum descending rings in permanent anchors?,"Rolled aluminum descending rings like the SMC Descending ring are light (11g) and cheap ($3) which makes them great for carrying and leaving behind on long descents, but in my mind they are disposable pro, you use them once for retrieving your rope after a rappel and then then leave them to rot.   More than once I've seen these rings used with mallions on bolted anchors at high-traffic rappels, but I never use them, some I've replaced with strong 50kN steel rings. They're rated for 14kN, which is more than enough for body weight on a nice controlled rappel, but are they suitable for multiple uses?  What's the rule of thumb for this style of descender ring?

1846,"Which is better, a single fisherman's knot or a double?","I ask this question based on the fact that tensile strength tests show that putting a double fisherman's knot in kernmantle rope makes it more likely for the rope to snap than a rope tied with a single fisherman's.  Knots weaken kernmantle rope, a lot in fact. Polymeric fibres are extremely strong along their longitudinal axis, however they have low flexural strength, meaning they are not strong along their horizontal axis, which is why ropes lose significant amounts of strength when tied[1]. Knots create a stress concentration on a rope's horizontal axis, crushing the rope's core and causing it to fail under less force or weight than an unknotted rope. The tying of a double fisherman's knot will cause a measurable reduction (20-35%) in the tensile strength of a rope[2]. Moreso than a single fisherman's knot (15-20%)[3]. The only real advantage that a double fisherman's has over a single is that it is less likely to slip, especially on newer synthetic fibre ropes, which is why it has mostly replaced the single in mountaineering.      Single Fisherman's         PROS: Lower reduction in tensile breaking strength of Kernmantle rope (15-20%), easier to tie, easier to untie.CONS: More likely to   slip.      Double Fisherman's         PROS: Less likely to slip.CONS: Greater reduction in tensile breaking strength of Kernmantle rope (20-35%), more   complicated to tie, hard to untie.   It's fair to note that a double fisherman's knot still reduces the tensile strength less than most other knots, and that a knot isn't really useful if it slips, but with certain types of rope it's unlikely that even a single fisherman's will slip, whereas on fancy lightweight ropes–like aramid ropes–a triple fisherman's is necessary to prevent your rope from slipping.  If the rope or accessory cord that you are using will hold a single fisherman's knot without slipping, would it be better to use a single fisherman's knot (leaving really long tails) and take advantage of the higher tensile strength the knot provides over a double?    1 Sterling Rope.

1847,What's the most remote place in the contiguous US?,"The United States is a very developed place. Sometimes this can prove to be challenging when trying to find a place to get away from everything, especially east of the Mississippi where I reside. I am pretty sure the answer is likely somewhere western (Montana maybe), but what is the most remote place in the contiguous US?  So let's define remote:   Furthest distance from civilization or any signs of it including anything man-made like roads, forest service facilities, huts/shelters... Furthest distance from medical care or rescue if something goes wrong; difficult terrain could trump the distance. Number of visitors recorded? Or other USFS data... Essentially, no visible traces of humans, or ""untouched"" if that's even possible these days.   Now, I know this could seem like an opinionated question to some folks, but I'm really looking for places that can be backed up and grounded with as much factual data as possible.  Edit: I previously said ""continental"" US, when the correct term is ""contiguous."" Oops. Please bear that in mind regarding my comments below. "
1848,Dropping gear: Where did the hairline/micro fracture urban legend come from?,"In an answer given to this question: Micro-Fractures in Climbing Equipments, it's stated that dropping gear causing micro fractures is a persistent myth, quoting Black Diamond's statement:     Q. Is it okay to use carabiners that have been dropped? A.   Unfortunately, the only way to know if “dropped” carabiners are fit   for use is to test them to their breaking point. This doesn’t do you   much good, now does it? It's best to inspect dropped gear for dings   and significant trauma. If only light scratching is visible and gate   action is still good, there is a good chance it is fit for usage.   Remember, only you know what your gear has been through and if there   is any doubt, it's best to retire the gear rather than take a risk.   This myth is certainly something you hear climbers talking about all the time, and there's a constant paranoia about gear that people have dropped onto rock or concrete floors at gyms.    When did this myth start? Has there ever been a case where a piece of protection has failed because of micro-fractures? "
1849,"What are some good guides to the U.S. national forests, specifically those in California?","I was thinking of heading to some of the northern California national forests, but I wasn't sure which to pick. I've read all the relevant links in each fs.udsa.gov website, including attractions, scenic drives, and the front page which a short blurb and description. But this doesn't really tell me enough of what I want to know, which is:   What is each national forest most known for?  Which national forest can offer me specific and diverse landscapes? I'd like to see meadows, vast wide open valleys, and mountains, but most of all I'd like to see vast wide open valleys (like the battle plains in the Lord of the Rings!) &lt;-- this would be really amazing to me  "

1852,Online website to track A.T. section hikes and overall progress?,"It's always been a dream to thru-hike the A.T. but life is looking like I will not be able to tackle that until retirement. The doesn't mean that I cannot do sections of it as a day/weekend/week here or there becomes available.  Are there any online tools or websites that will keep track of the overall progress that one has made on the trail?   Lets say I do a section of the trail from Harper's Ferry (I'm located in MD) to South Mountain State Park early in 2015. Then do a Maine section later that summer. And then lets say I do more day trips here and there depending on where I'm going to be for that weekend. If I'm looking to do another larger piece of the trail in early 2016, it'd be nice to have one central location available to keep everything in place and organized.  Besides doing it yourself manually (which isn't that hard), are there any available tools to make tracking pieces of the trail easier?  I've seen CalTopo or HillMap from this question but they are not specific to hiking trails and are more generic (which will still be useful but not what I'm thinking of).    EDIT: I do not own a GPS (besides the one in my smartphone) and am not looking for immediate tracking of my hike.   I'm looking for an ability to track the different sections of a hike (I say where I started and ended for a specific hike on the AT) and keep them available in a simple way.  If you take a look at pickatrail, they list 212 sections of the trail at roughly ~10 mile pieces. If i wanted to start at a specific point on the trail, I'd probably start at one of these pieces but wouldn't be able to guarantee that I'd finish the whole piece in one day hike.

1854,Winter Slackline solutions,We recently purchased a slackline to take on family camping trips.  Does anyone have a good do it yourself indoor solution for the winter?  How can I tell if the poles in my basement can support a slackline? 
1855,"Is Tyvek 44grs/m2 (Tyvek® Soft Structure Style 1443R) waterproof enough to be used as a groundsheet/footprint or tent bottom, any experience?","Has anyone practical experience with the light, soft version of Tyvek used as footprint / groundsheet or tent bottom?  I like the material, used it once so far as a ground sheet (footpint) on grass and had no troubles with moisture migrating through it.   Is this material waterproof? And if so, how waterproof? What conditions should I expect it to remain waterproof?  "
1856,Foxes in the living room - what causes this behavior?,"There was another report recently about a fox sneaking in a house and resting in its living room. Due to the news report it was caused by the extreme cold weather. The fox didn't even bother the man sitting besides it. This happened in Germany but I know a few other similar reports (googled =)).   I've a hard time understanding what causes this extreme behavior. Why would a common fox sneak into a house full of humans just to get warm? Is this generally true? Or are these foxes either sick, habituated or tame to some degree? "
1857,What is a lumen nock used for?,"There are several different manufacturers producing so called ""lumen nocks"". They provide a small light at the end of the arrow. But why? Why would I need a tiny light on my nock?  "
1858,Relation of ski edge sharpening to skiing ability and snow conditions,What is the effect of sharpening ski edges at different angles (85-90) and with different grit diamond stones (150-1200+) or regular files?  How does this relate to the level of the skier and the type of snow? 
1859,Is roadkill processed in the EU?,"A friend of mine had a car accident where he hit a whitetail. Sadly it died instantly. This made me wonder if someone is going to check if the roadkill can still be eaten. Maybe not for humans but dog food etc. So, if roadkill is found to be safe to eat, is it further processed in the EU? Or the other way around, is roadkill always dumped?   Edit: I'm not asking for specific cases where people just don't bother eating roadkill. Like for example in Germany you always have to call the appropriated hunter. He kills the animal or makes sure that it is dead. If that guy kills it and thinks: ""Seems pretty intact to me. Who cares, I'm taking it with me."", it is not instance of this question! I'm asking whether there is an official process by law or other rule-set. A process similar to this (just an analogy):    Driver calls police Driver calls hunter Police makes insurance stuff etc. Hunter takes care of the animal  Hunter calls the check-roadkill-authority Check-roadkill-authority adjudged the meat as process-able Check-roadkill-authority calls the process-roadkill-authority Process-roadkill-authority brings meat to dog-food-factory  "
1860,Terms for different parts of a mountain,"Is there a graphic representation of the terms used in mountaineering literature which narrates different aspects/parts of a mountain?  While reading any expedition report, climbing detail we come across following terms:   Summit Ridge Ledge Gorge Chimney Col Pass Face Cliff Saddle Pinnacle Dike   Can we have a combined representation of (most, if possible all of) these in a single graphic? "
1861,Relation of ski characteristics to skiing ability and snow conditions,"How do different ski characteristics relate to the skiing ability and snow conditions? Also how do these relate with ski durability in time?  Ski characteristics:   Front tip width Middle width Back tip width Radius Height Weight Camber / Rocker Metal tip Nucleus material: composite, wood Stiffness   I know that this could mean a really long answer, but I guess it will help a lot of us in choosing a ski. "
1862,"How do I judge what fabrics used to make ear warmers mean, in terms of their function?","My husband recently lost a pair of ear warmers he got at North Face 15 years ago. North Face no longer sells them, so I'm looking for a high-quality replacement. I'm confused by the types of materials used in construction, what they mean, and how they should factor into my purchasing decision.    He had 180's®, and that's what he wants again. I'm not sure if 180's® is a brand, or just a registered style name, but since the question's about materials used, it isn't meant to be a brand request.  After much online research, I've narrowed it down to three pairs that are comparably priced, and look similar to what he had. Each has these same important features:   Patented behind-the-head design  Fits comfortably over the ears Can be worn with other headwear, glasses and head protection Adjustable click-to-fit frames guarantee an easy, comfortable fit Collapsible for easy storage    I've included some descriptions in my choices, but have left out the above features, as I didn't see a need to repeat them.   Each potential choice has pictures on the linked pages. They are:  Urban Ear Warmer:     Durable and warm, the 180's® Urban Ear Warmers are guaranteed to keep you dry and comfortable all season long. Soft shell body and fleece lining provide warmth and wind and water resistance.       Fabric: 97% polyester, 3% spandex   Tec Fleece Ear Warmers:     Cold winter days call for the warm and cozy Tec Fleece Ear Warmers from 180's®. A soft fleece outer shell provides warmth and durability, while an inner liner helps to keep you insulated on even the most bitter days on the mountain or in the city. Gear up for cold weather in the 180's® Tec Fleece Ear Warmers.       Fabrics:      100% polyester insulation and lining      Polyester/nylon/spandex shell   Chesterfield Ear Warmers:     This stylish ear warmer provides three layers of protection to keep you warm, dry and comfortable on the coldest of winter days. Woven wool outer shell provides style and warmth. Features 100% Primaloft Insulation.       Fabrics:      Lining – 100% Polyester      Binding – 90% Nylon, 10% Spandex      Shell – 50% Wool, 50% Viscose      Insulation – 100% Polyester   Interestingly, none of them state a temperature range, which is one of the most important considerations.  We live in the Northeast United States, and he needs them for temperatures down to -10°F during the coldest winter months, usually January and February, and up to about 45°F on either side of those coldest months.  He uses them for outdoor activities like backyard bird-feeding, snow shoveling, sledding, skiing, snow-shoeing, hiking in the woods, walking to the parking lot and driving home from work at 2:30 am, among other things. He doesn't climb mountains or do extreme winter sports which keep him outside for long periods of time.   It might be a good idea to try on each and see how they feel, but I'm going to order them online so that's not an option. I imagine they're all comfortable enough, but even if they feel great, there's no way to tell if they'd be what he needs to get through the season. Even returnable pairs can't be worn for months first!  If my criteria include such things as: appropriate level of warmth; comfort; ease of cleaning; durability; shape and size retention; and expected length of life; can the materials used help me make an informed purchasing decision? If so, which fabrics should I choose? "
1863,How to learn ski touring,"I love the idea of ski touring. However, I wonder what would be the best way to learn it. Should I focus on learning alpine and cross-country skiing and then combine the two, or should I rather just start with easy routes? Should I take lessons?  I am an intermediate alpine skier, but lack any experience in cross-country and off-piste skiing.  To clarify on what terrain I am aimed at: Currently a single mountain daytour seems most appealing to me. So ski up in the morning, and then down afterwards. This would probably take place in the Alps. "
1864,"Self rescue procedure when falling through ice, but the ice keeps breaking","There are a lot of videos and instructions out there on what to do when you fall through ice: You turn the direction you came from, pull and kick until you get out and roll yourself to safety.  But what is the procedure, if you are in the middle of the lake, you break through, but the ice all around you is too thin and keeps breaking, when you try to pull yourself out of it.  What do you do in this situation? Just keep moving, trying to basically swim through the ice, while breaking it hoping to reach thicker ice or the shore? How long would you be able to keep that up?  Note: This question is about the specific situation, in which you can not climb back on to the ice, as it keeps breaking and you are far away from shore. "
1865,What are the measurable prerequisites of strength and/or flexiblity for starting to climb in a climbing gym?,"If I were a couple of decades younger, I would seriously consider trying climbing in a climbing gym, but I doubt I have enough flexibility, and I would feel horribly out of place.  The thing that attracts me is the total concentration required; there are things I want to put right out of my mind at least temporarily.    But I am curious:  is there a measurable criterion for what level of upper body strength a person should have before even beginning?  Are there any other measures of strength or flexibility that are pre-requisites for starting this sport?      "
1866,What should I look for in a used wet suit?,"I am considering getting a used wet suit for sailing and canoeing in the early spring and next fall.  What should I look for?  Based on the related Q&amp;A below, it looks like I will want 6-7mm (1/4 inch) thick with neck, wrist and ankle seals.  What else should I look for in a used wet suit?  Related:   What wetsuit thickness is recommended in which temperatures for diving?  What kind of underwear inside union suit in winter?  "
1867,How effective are mosquito repellents for people who are mosquito magnets?,"This question asks ""What type of mosquito repellent is the most effective?"".  It's a great question.  Now that we may have an idea about what is best to use, I want to know how effective are even the best repellents?  I am a mosquito magnet.  I don't know what it is, but I know it goes back generations.  If I go outdoors without repellent or full coverage where there are mosquitoes, I will literally (no exaggeration) get 30-60 bites per hour.  It's dangerous.  As a result, I tend to cover as much as my body as possible when mosquitoes are present.  I'm trying to make some plans that involve areas that are known to be inhabited by many of our needle-nosed friends.  Due to interesting (but off-topic) reasons, I will not be able to cover much of my body.  I'll be relying solely on repellents and dietary choices to keep the mosquitoes from doing their thing.  Given that something about me attracts mosquitoes, how effective can I expect modern mosquito repellents to be?  I want to stay away from opinion-based answers, and instead hear from people with relevant experiences.  Specifically, other people who are mosquito magnets who have relied solely on repellents (and optionally dietary measures). "
1868,Staying safe from hunters while hiking in France,"This question is specific to France, as different countries have different hunting cultures and regulations.  There have been a number of highly publicized accidents in France this year (1, 2, 3).  While recognizing that the number of accidents is actually fairly low, it makes me wonder what I should do to minimize risk while out bird-watching in France.  (I am not French and not yet familiar with the local situation.)  I like to take photos of wildlife (mostly birds), sometimes while hiding in the bush, but I am not an experienced outdoorsman; I believe this puts me at higher risk than usual.  So what should I do to stay safe from hunters while out in nature in France?  When and where am I most likely to encounter hunters?  When are the hunting seasons and what type of hunting has the highest risk of accident (I naively assume that I might be safer from bird hunters than deer hunters).  There are of course obvious common sense approaches, but the things I am most interested in deal with: 1. what is specific to France; 2. what someone completely unfamiliar with hunting might not find obvious. "
1869,Monkeys and Rock Climbing,"Monkeys are funny, as well as dangerous.  I have already asked a question about how one should go about camping where there are monkeys around: Camping and Monkeys.  The best advice would be to avoid them if you are unsure about your own safety.  A number of Rock Climbing places in India are habitats for these monkeys, living in the natural caves, playing all day on the edges and cliffs. As a climber, I have always seen that when I am at the base of one such climb, as I approach they panic.   Have other people in the rest of the world had a similar issue? What would you do if you have climbed up a good way and then you find a gang of monkeys up over the wall? Is it wiser to call it a day and retreat? "
1870,Camping 3000 miles from home: how best to get our gear to the campsite?,"I'm trying to plan a five-day camping trip in Joshua Tree NP. We already have a campsite booked, so that's taken care of. The catch is that we're coming from the East Coast. What makes the most sense in terms of effort, cost, etc?   Box up our own camping gear and ship it ahead of time, to be picked up at a Mail Boxes USA location or something Box up our own camping gear and check it on the plane with us Rent the stuff we need (tent, sleeping bags, camp stove, etc., etc.   (Tangentially, is that last option even possible? I assume so since you can rent every other thing on earth, but maybe I'm wrong.) "
1871,How can I ascertain the proper harvesting/extraction period for birch syrup for a particular region?,"My friends and I plan to go on a road trip, to tap and harvest some birch Tree sap/syrup, from a property up in Quesnel, BC. How do I know when is the right time to harvest?  Also; does the time to harvest birch syrup in Quesnel correspond to the time to harvest maple syrup? "
1872,Is a portable jump starter dangerous?,"Like many campers, I bought a portable jump starter, which contains liquids and gases. In what situation does it get dangerous?   Can I simply carry this portable charger along with all my camping gear such as butane gases and stove?   Can it be stored under hot/cold weather? "
1873,Under what circumstances would you not use a recently planted ice screw?,"I've done a lot of bouldering, sport climbing and some aiding.  Awhile back I went ice climbing with some guys for about a week.  I didn't participate much simply because I didn't feel the confidence I normally do in the equipment.  Particularly ice screws.  I asked the question, ""Under what circumstances would you abandon a screw you just placed?""  I did not get total consensus on the circumstances that would need to be present in order for a screw to be abandoned for use.  The discussion became so heated I abandoned it completely.  Answered I received:   When there is a long vertical crack that is formed when placing it. When a short horizontal crack is formed during placement. When a star crack created when placing it.   I will say that a star fracture did receive some consensus among the crew.  A few of these guys have been climbing for a long time and their practices seemed safe but none of them had any physics degrees either, not that I do.  My question, as above is, under what circumstances would you abandon a recently placed ice screw?  As well, how far away from the crack would you have to go to place the next one safely? "
1874,Blisters on small of back,"I went hiking with a friend a few years ago who had adjusted his new 90 liter pack to sit pretty high up on him.  As a result he managed to create two very large blisters right above his buttocks.  They popped and looked extra-ordinarily painful.  He really suffered that weekend.  My question is, what can I do to ensure I never have that happen to me?  AND  If it did happen to me, what would my treatment plan be?  Abandonment of the trip would not be an option...I just like saying that.  I can't really think of anything I could do to create a situation where I continued to push forward but if there was something, especially with zombies chasing you, that could be done, I'd like to here thoughts on it. "
1875,In kayaking how would you escape an underwater whirlpool current if you were trapped in one?,In kayaking I've heard a term called the 'washing machine'.  Apparently as a river is flowing over terrain it can create whirlpools and currents that swirl in all manner.  Occasionally a condition can arise where you can drop into one and get trapped in revolving current that's difficult to escape from.   Apparently people have been killed when they have become caught in one these anomalies of current.    Is there some sort of strategy that can be employed to escape the current when you are being spun about and become more and more disoriented?  What are your first actions when you realize this has happened?  Does anyone take precautions and carry something with them that would assist in such an event? 
1876,How many lumens for a diving torch?,"Title says it all really. I am looking to buy a diving torch as I am taking up diving next year.   What am I looking for? They seem to range from 100lm to 2500lm. Realistically how many lumens are actually needed to effectively see in murky water? (I live in the UK so the water will be equivalent to soup.)   As an additional, what is a required battery life for a diving torch? Some only last 30 minutes which, to me, seems too low. "
1877,Stop insects from flying into my cooldrink?,"Often when I go camping, insects like flies fly into my glass. Are there any good ways to stop this?  Also, recently someone told me that I could put a pencil on the glass to stop insects. Does it really work? "
1878,"Why do Sandpipers and Plovers ""hang out"" together?","I walk on Del Monte beach in Monterey, California quite often.  I see LOTS of Sandpipers there; and always with them are Plovers (which remind me of little frenetic Killdeer).  The Sandpipers dig into the sand when the tide rolls back, seeking, I am told, sandfleas and perhaps tiny crustaceans. The Plovers are there ""picking up the slack"" or ""eating the crumbs that fall from the tables"" of the Sandpipers, it would seem.  Am I right - are they simply after the same sort of food? If so, why do the Sandpipers (larger and more numerous) tolerate the Plovers? Or is there some sort of symbiotic interchange occurring here? "
1879,Winter backpacking pants,"I find that little attention is paid to lower body backpacking clothing. What type of pants would be a appropriate for a multi day excursion with 6'' to 1' (15 to 30 cm) of snowfall and 10 to 32 °F (-12 to 0 °C) weather?  I understand the basic layering scheme applied to upper body apparel, does the same apply to the lower body?  Could I get away with a base layer and water resistant soft shell pants, or would a third waterproof layer be a must? Likewise, could I do a base layer with my summer rain pants, or will this option be too cold? Am I over thinking this? Should I just wear my ski pants? "
1880,How much does body fat actually insulate you against the cold?,"I'm not a big guy, but I can sit in a cold pool of still water for a long time if I stay still and control my breathing, my skin gets cold, but after you get past the cold shock I can sit there rather comfortably without any signs of my core temperature dropping (shivering, etc.). One of my favourite things to do is sit up to my neck in the cold spring pool (4°C) at Ainsworth Hot Springs for about a half hour at a time and watch the shocked expressions on peoples faces as they dip their toes in the water, or try to take a quick dip, then look at me in bewilderment as I sit there seemingly unfazed by the temperature.   When we were kids we used to tube down the Elk River in BC, which is fed by a glacier lake. I have one sibling who was quite a bit thicker than the rest, and while the rest of us tried our best to stay on top of our tubes and out of the cold water, they would just float in a life jacket with the current, without any signs of really getting cold aside from hands and feet.  I've been pondering this lately, wondering how much having a good layer of fat on you can help insulate against the cold. There are a plethora of animals in nature who rely on a thick layer of blubber for insulation; narwhals, beluga whales, walruses and many others for example who don't also have fur. Fat obviously won't protect you from frostbite, your skin can still freeze, but I wonder if it might help prevent advanced stages of frostbite (freezing down to the deep tissues like muscles, tendons and bone). Or how about hypothermia? Are obese people less likely to become hypothermic? One thing I was considering was in the case of severe exposure, where frostbite and freezing are a serious danger. Would a large person have better chances of survival if they were to submerge themselves in water? Liquid fresh water is typically always warmer than than zero in nature, if it was 20 or 30 degrees below zero, could a person with a thick adipose layer survive the cold and protect themselves against frostbite by sitting up to their neck in a pool of still water? Would their fatty layer help insulate their core like a layer of blubber?  "
1881,How to find a trekking buddy,"Unfortunately none of my friends seem to be very interested in trekking through Sweden. However, you can't just pick a random person and say: ""Let's go!"", can you? I mean it's the only contact person for a week or so.   Is there a website or something where people may get in touch?  "
1882,Legal situation for Parkour in the EU,"I often wonder if it's even legal to practice Parkour in the cities of the EU? The runner is kind of trespassing the plots, isn't he?  "
1883,Is it feasible to use Zakopane as a base to climb the Tatra mountains?,"I'm planning a trip climbing in the Tatras this summer. I was planning on basing myself at Zakopane (seem's the be a good availability of accommodation, etc.). I mentioned this on a climbing forum I participate on and I was told:     There are lot's of good climbing huts in the area   Which got me thinking. Do I need to use a climbing hut (near the mountains) as a base to access these mountains? Is it feasible to get out of Zakopane to the base of a mountain, climb it and get back in a day or will I be asking too much? Or should we be looking to use the mountain hut's?  I'm pretty fit and used to long days (12 hours, etc) though the highest peak I've climbed is about 3500 feet (1000m). I'm hoping to do a peak in the region of Rysy though I've not worked out my goals yet. "
1884,What's the best way to remove layers of bottom paint from a sailboat hull?,"What is the best / easiest method for removing multiple layers of ablative bottom paint from a sailboat hull?  I have acquired a sailboat which has 3-5 layers of different bottom paints. I want to get back down to the base layer and put a fresh coat of paint on the hull. I have used a pressure washer to knock off loose chips, used an angle grinder for some, but it's really too labor intense and it cuts into the original gelcoat (which isn't too big of a deal), and it creates more dust then I really want.  Is there a tool or stripper that makes removing this material faster?  The hull is fiber glass, and based on the age of the hull, I'm forced to assume it is setup with polyester resin. "
1885,Hypothermia Prevention - Post Ice Water Fall,"I've read many of the posts that are related to this and believe it to be a be a snowflake of a question on the site.  If you have fallen into icy water and the temperature is very challenging, what are the immediate steps to take to assist the victim?  I've read this post and it's more driven by how to rescue someone who has fallen in icy waters.  The obvious statements are made.  Get the person warm, etc.  This post seems to address the situation once the victim/patient is hypothermic.  My question is more driven by prevention.    The general framework is get the wet off, get them warm...but how?   A fire in short order seems like a good idea.  If you have a group, a person can be assigned the task.  RIGHT NOW. As in other posts, discarding wet clothes immediately doesn't seem to be a bad idea at all.   When I have been in the situation of assisting I stripped the person, pulled my sleeping bag, opened my jacket, pulled up my clothes and went skin on skin with the victim and had someone assist with getting us both into a sleeping bag ASAP.  I've been chided for this, not for the skin on skin, just the whole process.  Honestly, I had never considered an action plan before the moment it happened and I simply reacted.  I'd like to have a better action plan, especially if it were colder.     Is there something light that can be added to the plethora of gear we all might be lugging around out there? Is there a better methodology than the example provided? What is the most immediate/primary concern?   I've been told to focus on torso and head.  Get ANYTHING on the head to retain heat.  A baseball cap?  Use dirt, if available, to rub into hair and quickly dry the head?  Strip the victim naked and focus on torso due to capillaries constricting to force blood in the torso the torso should be the focus.  Any medical references and/or response frameworks are what I'm really looking for.  The victim is wet, it's very cold.  Now what?  As a side note, what if there's a base camp, everyone goes on a day hike with limited gear in smaller hydro packs and the incident occurs.  That would be an interesting problem to solve.  Apologies in advance for the rant.  TIA "
1886,Suggestions for a winter lifestyle,"This is my first winter in a really cold place. By cold I mean temperatures varying from -10 to -30 Celcius (yes, all temperatures I mention in this post are in metric). I come from a place which never usually goes below zero, so this is a significantly new and challenging experience for me. I have read and heard about getting accustomed to the cold rather than protecting from it, which has been argued as a better choice to beat the cold. That is the reason I normally decide to walk about a mile to my workplace even though the temperature is -13. However, there are a few things that I would like to ask / reconfirm / seek suggestion to have a better winter lifestyle.   Mittens are argued as more heat preserving than gloves. I felt my fingers were very cold today while walking, and I was wearing gloves - I had to keep my hand out of my pocket since I was carrying a thing. I reached my destination quickly and then heated the fingers, but it will not be possible to walk that way longer. Any suggestions? Should I look for something specific while getting a new pair of gloves / mittens? The weather here is very dry. So dry that even after using a thick moisturizer my skin looks chapped often. I have a humidifier at home, and I switch it on during sleep, but still the dryness reappears. It's more prominent while walking in the cold. Any remedies? Reducing the heating, taking a cold(er) shower, eating more carbs / calories are certain things that has been suggested, and I'll be trying out soon. Are they really effective methods to beat the cold? Finally, a little funny and amusing thing for me, and don't laugh - I see people on the street wearing much less winterwear and no cover for the head and seem to be absolutely fine even at temperatures 10 deg below zero and windy! How do they manage to do that?   UPDATE: after a week (and a couple of medium to heavy snow showers) of following and improvising over the ideas suggested:   Putting my thinner woollen gloves within a larger, waterproof glove really kept my hand warm. Now I completely realize the layering idea :-) I tried all sorts of moisturizers and finally coconut oil as well. Coconut oil is good for half the day, since near the end of the day my skin becomes dry again. Then I improvised on it using a more viscous oil - and this is mustard oil - just before the shower applying on the skin and then take the shower - it was amazing till the end of the day. You can try and let me know how it went - don't put it too much since it may stick to clothes, and not after shower, you may put a light film of moisturizer if needed afterwards. It works! Colder shower and trying to adjust to the cold helped me a lot. Now I feel much more comfortable walking in the -20 C (-4 F) than I was a week back.  "
1887,New to fishing in Virginia,"I just moved to Virginia (Fairfax County) a few months ago. I've done some hiking around the area, mostly by the Potomac. With Spring starting I want to get in to some fishing. Can anyone give me some information on the fishing rules around here. I know I have to get a license, but is fishing permitted anywhere on the Potomac? Are the different rules for state vs. county water, or between lakes and rivers?  Also what are some good fishing spots in Fairfax County? "
1888,What are the dangers of swimming in natural waters?,"What are the dangers of swimming in natural bodies of water? In essence I would like to know about all types of waters, but I am mostly interested in sea because it is most relevant to me. Like many people I enjoy taking a swim when at the sea side, and like many people I find that the stronger and bigger the waves the better. But then all the bad sea stories you've heard come back and it's really annoying, because what you constantly hear (at least when you're younger) is not how the sea works, but instead you hear threats and shallow warnings like 'if you swim too far off, the sea might pull you in'. The problem is I (and many other people I know) simply don't know anything about how the sea behaves.  Maybe you're aware of some bodies of work for lifeguards or something similar that might shine some light on the matter?  Note: The sea side I visit most often is Baltic Sea's south-eastern shore (Lithuania). "
1889,How to deal with little flies flying into the eyes?,"There's one thing which can spoil my day outdoors. Those are the little flies which happen to fly directly into my eyes.  I work on a computer and my eyes are dry and over-sensitive. If such an insect falls into my eye, it results in intensive stinging, something making me unable to open my eyes. It is intensive even long after the insect is gone. I don't know if it is an allergic reaction or some fragments of insect body are left and the eye has not enough tears to quickly remove them.   Why do those flies fall into my eyes in the first place? They should have self-preservation instinct preventing them from that. Are they attracted to eye for some particular reason or it is just an accident? What is more important - how to distract those little insects? Can I do anything to do that? Maybe should I do something so that my eyelashes are thicker and longer? "
1890,How can I keep my backpack safe?,"I went on a hike with my wife the other day in Norcal. This place had a creek that led into a cave that you can swim in. We both left our backpacks at the cave entrance and then swam through it to the other side to explore, trusting that no one would steal our stuff. All the while though we were worrying some about our back packs which had our money, keys and phone. But our stuff was ok and all there when we got back.  What can we do to keep our backpack safe the next time and so we don't worry as much when we have to leave it for a while?   I did a search online but wasn't completely satisfied. I was hoping there was some type of deterrent device you can set inside your backpack so when its moved a loud alarm goes off. Is there such a thing? The other thought was taking money keys and phone with us but in this particular situation even if we carry a waterproof fanny pack there is still the danger of it falling and/or getting lost, especially in a partly dark cave. Any suggestions?  We are newbies to Outdoor activities like these. "
1891,Sweating in sleeping bag,"I sweat a great deal when I sleep. When it's really warm outside at night I just keep my bag unzipped and there's no problem. However, when it starts to get cold and I have to zip my bag up, I soon become dowsed in sweat and even though my bag is rated well below the outside temperature I am freezing and have a horrible night.  I just ordered some drirelease shorts and tshirt in hopes that the wicking will help with this problem but haven't received them yet. Will that do the trick?   Does anyone else have this problem and what worked for you? "
1892,Is it possible to do the whole turn of the Mont Blanc (TMB) by bike?,"I was planning on making the famous TMB, ""Tour du Mont Blanc"" by bike ? Is it possible ? Is it authorized ? What are your recommandations ? "
1893,Where to keep valuables when separated from them,I just had a thought after buying a couple of money belts for my girlfriend and I.. Where should we keep them when we are swimming for example?  I know this seems like a simple problem but is there any other solutions other than taking turns swimming? i.e Burying them?  
1894,Light-weight emergency overnight-gear,"What is a good emergency-overnight-sleeping-setup when every ounce counts, like on long technical routes (grade V or VI) where the goal is to do it in one day (without hauling), but one wants to prepare for the unexpected? Building a fire is not an option.  I am interested in answers for all seasons, elevations, and most likely weather conditions.  I want to prepare for this situation, so I won't have to use the advice given in this question. "
1895,What are the odds that I stand a chance against Wild Boars?,"I have been trekking and camping since last 6 yrs. I have over 600 hikes and about 30 technical rock climbs under my belt. We often tend to camp up in forests, and at our sides, wild boars are pretty normal. Though I have never been under an attack by a wild boar, I just want to know that instead of running away (never in a straight line though), do I stand a chance to pretend to be aggressive if they out-number me? Few of the civilians suggested that it works most of the times if they out-number you. They loose their formation and run away. I just want to know if such a thing happened and/or (deliberately) done by anyone? How safe is it?  "
1896,Precautions needed to be taken regarding bee hives (honey) during Climbs,"I am a regular climber and a hiker. Having an experience of more than 600 hikes and around 30 technical climbs, I have realized that during rock-climbing, the climbers are bound to face Honeybees where I climb. Range of Sahyadris in India offer few of the good challenges in rock-climbing. This is where we climb. I have a news to share here. Follow the link to detailed news about the mishap.  Now, this guy, I know him very well. Tough, Strong and a Never-Give-Up sort of a Navy guy, who has been sailing for half a decade all over the world. The news was that he died in a bee attack during a technical rock climb.  I want to raise a question that what can be done to prevent such an attack? What as a climber I should never do in order to avoid such an attack? If it happens somehow, what am I supposed to do in order to limit the damage being done? "
1897,Where can I find current information on shelters in the Swedish mountains?,"This weekend, on a 3-night hiking trip, we decided to head for the Pieggaluoppal wind shelter for the final night.  When we arrived (at 23:15 and after 13½ hours of hiking) we were a bit disappointed to see that it looked like this¹:   (Photo from before it burnt down)  We came home yesterday and googling Pieggaluopal does result in a Swedish language forum-post from 2010 describing how someones father was told that it had burnt down, and that no decision had been takes as to whether or not it would be rebuilt.  Now, this wind shelter is in a relatively frequented area (probably dozens of people per year pass by), but some are in quite remote regions.  How can hikers prepare and get up-to-date information as to the state of wind shelters along the way?  In Norway, sections of Den Norske Turistforeningen (DNT) such as Narvik og Omegn Turistforening (NOT) have information online such as for Baugebua or Oallavagge, but is there any central resource for Swedish shelters?  ¹ We had a tent, so it was not a big problem, but we'd have appreciated a roof after a long and rainy day.    "
1898,Overview of free and open huts in Norway outside the system of the official tourist association DNT,"On my hiking trips, I mostly sleep in my tent, but occasionally I appreciate to have a roof.  Mostly by chance, I've found on my trips a number of free and open huts in Norway that are not owned by Den Norske Turistforening (DNT) (the Norwegian Tourist Association).  They tend to be far away from where most people hike.  I've never seen one occupied and browsing through guestbooks usually reveals an occupation of less than 20 nights per year.  They're marked on the map, but from the map it's not possible to tell the difference between private and locked cabins (hunting and fishing associations have quite a few of these), available to the public at a fee (usually by fetching the key in the nearest village in advance), or unlocked and free to use.  Some free-to-use ones that I've discovered, all by chance, are:   Havgahytta, owned by Reindriftsforvaltninga, i.e. the reindeer herding organisation (this hut appears to have no web presence of any kind, but I've passed by there). Ragohytta, very high up in Rago Nasjonalpark [PDF], owned (or at least operated/maintained) by Statskog, the national forest agency Heggedalshytta, owned by Statskog. Tarhalshytta, owned — I believe — by Hammerfest kommun.  Picture below.    Tarhalshytta on Sørøya, with the Barents Sea  For Statskog I have found an overview of open huts here [PDF], but that's only one of the agencies.  Is there any resource on the web that collects — perhaps by users contributing — an overview of such freely available huts? "
1899,"For fording cold rivers, is there any special clothing (as opposed to makeshift bags or tightly connected raintrousers) to stay dry and warm?","On my treks, I often need to ford rivers — on my last trek (3½ day) I forded five, including four on a single day (not counting >100 smaller streams).  My current practice is to take off my boots and put sandals instead, but this is a dangerous practice that several books and agencies strongly recommend against.  Many rivers are glacier-fed and some are quite wide, so the risk for hypothermia is real.    Njoammeljåhkå, Padjelanta National Park, Laponia, Sweden, August 2011.  To ford two dangerous steps (flow and depth were worse than they might look), or to make a 40 km detour — that is the question!  The Swedish mountain associations recommend to tie raintrousers tightly at the boots, warning explicitly that crossing on sandals carries a real risk for hypothermia.  Although my boots and raintrousers are reasonably watertight and good enough to keep me dry when it rains (at least when it rains with a Swedish intensity), they won't hold standing in a (quickly) flowing river for a long time.  As an alternative, the Swedish language book På fjälltur: Sarek by Claes Grundsten recommends, and I quote (translation follows):     Alternativt kan du använda vadarpåsar som träs over skodonen.   meaning     Alternatively, you can use fording bags that are drawn over the shoes.   The book goes on to state that they are for sale on the open market.  I can't find information about those vadarpåsar, though.  What is a vadarpåse / fording bag and where can I buy one? This forum post recommends to leave yer boots on, bring two heavy duty contractor trash bags with you, one for each leg, procede with caution, but that sounds a bit scary as well (bad maneauvability).  Are there any more suitable garments, preferably at least up to the waist¹, for fording rivers?  Preferably lightweight that can be packed in a small volume.    Some issues are addressed at ""If I have to cross an icy, flowing river, what are some ways I can cross safely?"", but the answers there do not really address the issue at hand.  ¹I'm aware that one normally should not ford rivers that are deeper than knee-high, but I think one could make an exception if there is almost no flow at all. "
1900,Inner tent - Vango F10 Xenon UL 2,"Some time ago I bought Vango F10 Xenon UL 2 tent. Had no chance to use it yet as I had to cancel the trip I was planning on using it on. Now I'm planning something new, but as it's going to be in some warmer areas with no rain I was thinking about using just the inner tent and pitch it without flysheet.    Is it possible to pitch just the inner part of this tent?  Does it makes sense? I guess it would protect me from insects, etc, but what would be other advantages of using just the inner tent?  "
1901,What is the proper way to use a sauna?,"I thought that, according to what I've read from the web, people alternate between sauna and swimming. I tried to do that but people thought that I was in trouble. I posted the whole experience to a Facebook group ([website]Actually what is the proper way to use a Finnish sauna? Does it really mix with swimming? "
1902,Will a coyote attack my dog on a leash while I'm on a hiking trail?,"Is a coyote or pack of coyotes likely to attack my small dog if she is with me on a trail on a leash?  I heard of someone's dog being eaten while the woman was walking her pet on a leash. She was allegedly walking in an area known to have wildlife but was on the trail frequented by humans.  Is this likely?    The trail is fairly busy with people. There is a no dog policy, but I have a service animal and hiking the trail is really good for me.  My dog is small though and a coyote could legitimately see her as a little white rabbit on a leash. I'm not even sure the claim is true but rather safe than sorry with my baby!! "
1903,How should regular Appalachian Trail hikers interpret this weekend's attack?,"This past weekend, there was a fatal attack on the Appalachian Trail   My girlfriend and I are planning a section hike of the AT through the White Mountains of NH and partly through the Maine section this summer. We have hiked the AT trail on several occasions before and consider ourselves somewhat experienced. We are local to New England.   For regular experienced hikers, how should a person interpret an attack such as the one reported? Other than standard precautions on the trail, what other safety measures can / should be taken to mitigate the risk of such an incident?  "
1904,Are trades routes and/or mountain routes still used?,"Some background:  I live in the western part of state of Maharashtra, India. The city of Pune is located on the Deccan Plateau. Deccan plateau itself is huge. The western section of the plateau has a vertical drops of ranging from about 900 to 1800 ft. for about 1600 km. This section is what known to world as The Western Ghats  So, there are trails from villages located on Deccan plateau to the lower  places, popularly called Kokan.  In Maharashtra there are 250+ such routes that are documented, and about 100+ which aren't documented. Before the development age, some of these were used for trade and commute.  My observation: What I have observed is due to lack of development in economy almost 75% of villagers still frequent these routes down the mountain, be it for trade, or be it for travelling. The road transport is there, but these foot-trails are still the shorter (and free, of course) way of commute.   The point is, these routes are not limited to trekking/hiking only!  Question: Are there such routes in the part of the world where you live? I agree that those route may not be used for trade these days, but do people use these routes for commuting by foot? I don't want to consider such paths that are converted into motor-able highways/freeways/roads.  "
1905,What is the use of the saw blade on a swiss knife?,"I've been using the Victorinox Swiss knife for a long time now. One thing that has baffled me is the saw blade on most of their multi-tools. The saw is around 2-3 inches long (depending on the model). I've tried multiple times to saw a piece of wood (or even a thick piece of stick), and I've failed to use this for any meaningful sawing.    I can understand the other tools - the small knife (for cutting an apple), the big knife (for cutting another apple?), the reamer (for punching holes), the scissors, the bottle openers et al. However, the saw seems an overkill which is not even usable in the outdoors.   Has anyone used the saw on the swiss knife for anything? Or is it for some other use altogether? "
1906,What kind of bird is outside my window?,"I live in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Recently, there has been a bird sitting in the mesquite tree outside my window, singing. This bird comes in the middle of the damn night. Once 3am, once 5am, and now around midnight.   What is peculiar about this bird is that it makes so many different sounds.  I recorded a video of its calls coming from my window: [website]What is this bird? "
1907,Looking for a simple gps tracker with long battery life,"I like to track the path when I cycling or hiking (e.g. this). Now I use my phone for this purpose which is totally inconvenient because of the battery.  So, I looking for something which can track my path   Ideally, without any display. With a big enough battery. Ideally, with an ability to put some marks on the track.   I tried to google, but it looks like Garmin watches have too many options. And spot 3 requires some annual plan which probably an overkill for me. Also, I don't need heart rate tracker/cadence/whatever sensors.  Are there any types of gps devices that fulfill these criteria? "
1908,Would worms work well in this pond for trout or bass?,So this is my local pond that I like to bring my kayak down to and fish off of.   If I get some worms:   What hook setup should I put them on? Where should I look to fish with the worms in this pond?   Please note that my fishing time is a weekend morning from 8-11am. 
1909,What extra gear to take up a multipitch climb?,"When climbing single pitch routes, it makes sense to carry as little as possible while actually on the route, as almost every eventuality can be easily dealt with by simply lowering back to the ground and your pack. At the opposite end of the spectrum, alpine and mountaineering objectives almost mandate climbing with (or hauling) a backpack due to the extended nature of such routes and the vagaries of alpine environments.   In between these two extremes, we have multipitch rock (or ice) climbs, say 2-6 pitches in length, like many of those at Tahquitz, Devil's Tower, Red Rocks, Eldorado Canyon, and Yosemite. Such routes are short enough that taking everything up the route seems excessive, but long enough that having additional equipment along can be beneficial (e.g., food, water, extra layers, etc).   How do you decide what to bring along on such a route? What factors go into your decision? Once you've decided what to bring along, what are good strategies for carrying it? "
1910,How are canvas tents made to be fire retardant?,"While reading through this question about adding a stove jack to a canvas tent originally lacking one, I wondered about the feasibility of making an existing canvas tent fire retardant. Is it simply a matter of adding an additional material or chemical layer to the canvas, or is the process of making the canvas fire-retardant a component of the canvas-making process itself?  For example, is it possible to send a non-fire-retardant canvas tent back to the manufacturer to be made fire retardant, or is it going to be that the customer would need to purchase another tent that is fire-retardant from the start?   In general, how are canvas tents made to be fire retardant? "
1911,Is there a recommended safety standard for crampons?,"I follow an outdoor group on facebook and one of the guys on it asked about these crampons on ebay    They look very suspicious, they're a little too cheap and don't seem to fit very well, etc. They seem to be some kind of Grivel copies to me.  Made me think though, what kind of saftety standards/acreditions should crampons come with? "
1912,What are safe/effective leaves from around the world for use in tidying up your backside after answering the call of nature?,"This partially answered in this question about toilet paper alternatives but it only says be careful what plants you use.   I'd like to know specifically what plants are the best in your part of the world and why? Also, where is that part of the world? If you could comment on availability, durability, potential for collection and carrying, and other relevant info that would be a big help. "
1913,What is an effective way to join a map that is printed on several sheets?,"Whenever I had the chance to print a map on A3-sized sheets (11.69 x 16.53 inches) I usually just needed two sheets of that size for my whole planned trip, and most of the time it was fine enough to keep them apart and to swap them according to where I am and where I am heading to.  By printing on smaller A4 size sheets though (that's half the above size) any single sheet is rarely enough to hold sufficient information to be useful. Four sheets are necessary to represent the same area printable on two A3-sized ones and keeping to swap between each other and holding them next each other when I need to really feels clumsy and impractical.  So. I'd really love to join those sheets togeter to get a decent map out of them.  What is the proper way to print such a map, as the first step? I guess I should leave some margins so to be able to overlap the sheets.  And, how to actually join those sheets in the best possible way, so that the result is strong and stable and - ideally - gives the feel of a single map rather than a crappy bunch of sheets held somewhat together? "
1914,"Is this ""dry suit cutting wrists"" story realistic?","I'm reading a very good novel, called ""Smilla's sense of snow"". A minor figure tells this story from the time he was a frogman with the marines:      Going down, I glide through a cold belt [...] I panic. I lose my safety rope. [...] They told me later that Føjl saw it. And took a lead belt in the hand and jumped into the water without bottles. Only a rope in the hand. Because he couldn't waste any time. He dives to me. He catches me at a depth of twelve meters. But he's diving in a dry suit. It means that the water pressure presses the rubber against the skin. Every ten meters, the pressure rises by one atmosphere. At ten meters, the rubber edge cuts at the joints and knuckles through the skin. All I remember are clouds of blood.    I have never dived, but I've worn a dry suit, and can't imagine this happening. Even if the construction used to be different - the story must be happening sometime in the 1970s - what would the use be of a suit which hurts you at 10 meters? Why would people dive in them? So the story sounds like an implausible melodramatic plot device. On the other hand, the book seems to be correct at its other plot devices (I hadn't heard of Guinea worms before, but they are as shocking as described in it), so maybe this story is possible after all.   It would be too subjective to speculate about the likelihood of somebody trying this heroic saving and succeeding. But the ""your suit cuts your wrists"" part should be easier to judge. So, is (or was) this a real danger? If yes, how do divers avoid it when diving under more controlled circumstances?  "
1915,River crossing in winter?,"So we were out looking for some new ice to climb today and discovered this short pitch of ice:    There's only one problem:    The ice is on the wrong side of a rather wide creek. The nearest crossings are pretty far away, and the approach from either direction would not be easy (steep cut banks, cliffs and thick trees). The easiest route to the ice is across the creek.  I found one spot to cross that looks only about knee deep, and the water is flowing probably a little bit faster than walking speed. Now I'm just trying to decide what would be best way to get across with all our gear. I'm thinking an extra pair of boots and pants combined with some warm blankets/towels and a thermos of hot chocolate at the other side. Pants off would hurt, this water is painfully cold in the summer time, I can only imagine what it's like now... What's the best way to wade through a creek in winter? Anyone know of any painless winter water wading techniques? "
1916,"Why are death percentages of death from trauma in an avalanche so different between USA, Europe, and Canada?","I am reading this highly-rated book about avalanches and I was impressed by this sentence, in its beginning.     Over 25 percent of avalanche victims in the U.S. die from trauma from hitting trees and rocks on the way down (about 6 percent of avalanche victims in Europe and as many as 50 percent in Canada)   How can there be such a massive difference? 6 percent of people dying from trauma from hitting trees and rocks in Europe and 50 percent in Canada... with the US being about in the middle of that statistic.  The very first - quite rough - idea that comes to my mind is, there may be much more trees and rocks in the average Canadian ski route compared to European ones.  But, it sounds quite superficial. Still, those numbers differs too much; there must be some reason behind this spread. Does anyone knows what this reason is (or are)? "
1917,Installing a hand line for scrambling?,"I've been reading this book about mountain scrambling in Washington State, U.S., and at some points it mentions the idea of using a hand line on some more exposed routes to give something to hold on to, as well as mental reassurance to less experienced climbers. This whole book is supposed to be about ""non-technical climbs"" so I was wondering how one would go about setting up a hand line like this.  Presumably, the most able climber in the group would go forward and anchor a rope along the route for other climbers in the party to use? How would you do this safely (is this even possible to do safely)?  My personal (relatively inexperienced) opinion is that if you're at the point where you're considering using a rope for safety, the route is either beyond your skill level, or you should be doing proper technical climbing.  Thanks! "
1918,Gear storage: what gear that can be safely stocked outside?,"I have plenty of gear and I live in a small apartment.  I am planning to buy an outdoor closet to put on the balcony to get some extra space. Here's a sample to show you how it would be like.    I would like to know if I can stock some of my gear out there so that it won't get ruined not even in the long run. Just to give you an idea I left my skis in a similar circumstance (it was out on the balcony, not in a closed but in their own case) and they rusted a lot, in only one winter.  So, I would of course everything indoor if leaving them out would reduce their ""life expectations"".   But perhaps something (carabiner? backpacks?) can be left out without any damage.  Here's what I own.   Backpacks Skis accessories: skins, bindings, ski crampons Ski boots Mountaineering boots Carabiners Ropes Nuts Cams Quickdraws Rock climbing shoes Chalk Plenty of other climbing gear (gri-gri, silent partner, ascenders, and other gimmicks) Tents Tarps Ice screws Ice axe Crampons   For instance. Will a silnylon tarp lose any of its features (elasticity, water resistance) if exposed for a very long time to high humidity? And the like.  Thanks so much. "
1919,"What are the navigation considerations on the Youghiogheny, Casselman & Potomac Rivers between Ohiopyle (PA) and Cumberland, MD","I want to travel by canoe from Ohiopyle State Park to Cumberland, MD on the Youghiogheny, Casselman and Potomac Rivers  What are the navigation considerations?  Also I will have a bike and trailer for the canoe, will be interested in bike trails paralleling or intersecting the river.   Locks and Dams Camping/accommodations Launches  River side services (away from large cities)    Hypothetically the trip would be completed, with only muscle power, rowing or pedaling.  In either a single trip or by pedaling upstream and rowing down stream, in one or more outings.   Related (West) What are the navigation considerations on the Monongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers between Ohiopyle State Park (PA) and Pittsburgh PA? "
1920,For how long afterwards do we benefit from acclimatization?,"Consider we are trying to pre-acclimate for an expedition in Himalaya to shorten the actual timespan on site.  As an example, I am expecting a benefit if I go in the Alps for several days above 4000m and sleep over 3000m. If my trip to the big mountains like the Himalayas starts a week (or two) after that pre-tour am I still acclimated to some extent? If so are there approximations (maybe scientific studies) for how long the acclimatization benefit holds on and to what degree?    Edit to further explain the matter:  I am not asking the question because of a specific planned tour in Himalaya. I am interested in general, first to understand better how acclimatization really works and second to possibly shorten the (sometimes very expensive) acclimatization time. Of course it would be the best preparation to stay in Himalaya for a long time and acclimate slowly. But it should make a considerable difference if I am acclimated to my home-town at 500m or to 3500m. The question is how big this difference will be. "
1921,What are the rules to grade sport climbing single pitch routes?,"What do you think is the correct way to grade a single pitch route (about 10 to 30 meters)?  I know climbing grade are affected by subjectivity. However is there a list of objective elements to take in account which have been agreed in the climbing community?  For example, here follows some ""disputable"" objective elements:   size of holds overhanging relative distance between holds how the route is bolted   Another disputable objective element in grading is the common rule that the actual grade of the route reflects the hardest passage in it. This means we can have a 30m route with a lot of 6a passages, and a 10m route with a single 6a passage, both graded 6a: in this case the first route I think would be much more difficult to send, even if it is graded the same as the second route. "
1922,Thru-hiking the Long Trail (Vermont) in late January,"I'm preparing for a (solo if I can't find anyone to go with me) hike on the Long Trail in Vermont. I thru hiked the Appalachian Trail (AT) starting in February, but Georgia is very warm compared to Vermont. The average temperature high in January is below 0F for much of the state. I'm hoping to hear from someone who has experience doing extended hiking and camping in temperatures that don't get above 0F and dip as low as -40F for weeks on end. I want to know how to be sure I can stay warm without taking way too much stuff, and some guidance on issues to watch out for. Here's my basic setup:  Staying Warm   0F Feathered Friends bag  A merino blend sleeping bag liner  A merino wool base layer  Several synthetic base layers  Primaloft light jacket Couple layers of gloves  Heavy wool pants -40F Sorrel boots  Heavy wool socks  Aether shell  Silk scarf Balaklava  Vaseline or fat to insulate any exposed skin  Wool cap  Fire paste Vaseline soaked cotton balls Multiple lighters and matches   Dealing with the snow and ice   22"" Snow shoes with teeth for climbing Crampons for boots  Ski goggles Ski poles   Communication   Lightweight dumb phone with long lasting battery and extra battery pack Garmin etrek-20 GPS PLB Recco fitted gear   Food   Lots of fatty meats and cheeses Carbs Sugars   Do you think I am reasonably well prepared? What can I do to lessen my chances of dying? "
1923,Can a compass reverse polarity?,"Can a compass have its polarity reversed so that the end marked ""north"" points south and vice versa?  If so, what could one do to prevent and fix this problem? "
1924,Is it dangerous to rope together on an ascent of hard packed ice?,  This image has recently come under considerable criticism on social media for dangerous mountaineering practices.  The location is unknown as the qualified mountain guide observer wanted to maintain the climbers' anonymity.   The terrain was described as    Hard packed solid ice The slope quickened into a narrows with another slope leading to a boulder field The observer described a slip as unsurvivable  The technique was also described as 'misguided Alpine thinking' There are four individuals in the image They are connected via rope   What specifically is wrong with the technique being applied in this image and what risks does it pose?  What should the group have been doing to ascend more safely? 
1925,"""Unsinkable"" sit-on-top kayaks","Several plastic sit-on-top kayaks are being marketed as ""unsinkable"" and ""sea-worthy"". However, I read that few people had to beach when the did not close the front hatch properly.  My question is: how difficult it is to close the front hatch ""properly"" and how safe are those ""unsinkable"" kayaks anyway? Does it help if a kayak has water-sealed bulkhead separating the front hatch and the rest of inside of the boat? "
1926,Techniques for handling pumped arms?,"I love rock climbing and I try to go to my local gym and boulder as often as possible (usually 2-3 times a week). But it's really hard for me to climb for any extended period of time because my arms get pumped very quickly. Sometimes my arms will start getting pumped after just 3-4 easy routes while I'm warming up.  So really I have a couple different questions:   What should I do before climbing to increase the amount of time I can climb before my forearms start hurting? What should I do when my arms get pumped and I want to continue climbing? Usually I'll take a short break and bend my hands forwards/backwards like in this picture:    and it definitely helps. I'll also shake my arms which seems to help too. Are there other stretches/workouts that will help me get over it? Is there a certain point where I should stop climbing because of pumped arms, instead of pushing through? (To avoid permanent damage) Where exactly is that line?  "
1927,What must be causing a decrease in sparrows and an increase in pigeons in my town?,"Has your city seen a noticeable decrease in population of common sparrows? And, on the contrary an increased population of common pigeons?  As per my opinion prime suspects appear to be stronger cellular networks and pollution?  Details:  City - Mumbai and Pune. Country - India. Continent - Asia. "
1928,Can I use a quilt with a bivi bag?,"Is it possible (read, can I spend a restful night sleeping?) By using a quilt, bivi bag and ground sheet?  Quilt I'm looking at is here, the idea being that I can take an ultralight bivi bag and groundsheet in addition to my hammock setup (which includes the quilt) so I'm covered whatever the terrain without having to carry two sleeping bags. "
1929,How long should a down sleeping bag last?,"I just looked at our sleeping bags, which we bought in 1972.  They are in pretty good condition, with only a few small patches.  Is it unusual for a down sleeping bag to give service for 45 years and still be in good condition? Or is this par for the course?   I estimate that the sleeping bags have been used for a minimum of 1,500 nights.  Between trips, they have always been stored unstuffed on a large shelf with nothing on them or pressing against them.  We dry-clean them probably every second or third year -- I'm not sure.  Also pertinent:  we sleep in them lightly but fully clothed.   They are the only pieces of our original backpacking equipment that we have not replaced several times.    "
1930,Are there any Draisines-Railbike Companies that have wheelchair accessibility?,"Railbiking is so much fun for those of us who are not limited physically in one form or another. Are there any Draisines-Railbike Companies that have wheelchair accessibility options for the disabled? The option could somehow be a motorized railbike or simply a spot on the railbike, while others do the pedaling for the disabled, so that they too can enjoy the Great Outdoors with friends and family? "
1931,How does the effort required for a hike or run depend on the amount of elevation gain?,"If I do a certain hike or run, it's going to cost a certain amount of effort, which could be measured by how many calories I burn. How does this effort depend on the amount of climbing? Is there a conversion factor, like a certain number of calories per 100 meters of elevation gain?  A related question, posed in terms of a specific hike, was ""How many calories does hiking burn? "" "
1932,Is the Park Service continuing its case to re-rename Yosemite Park's historic landmarks?,"I have often checked into the Ahwahnee in Yosemite Valley after emerging, filthy and undernourished, from the backcounty.  A hot shower in one of the cottages, an Ahwahnee Burger, a glass (or three) of wine and boysenberry pie a la mode delivered to the cottage patio -- bliss!    Imagine my shock when I heard that the Ahwahnee had been renamed The Majestic because the former concessionaire had trademarked its name, and that of Curry Village and several other historic places.  The San Francisco Chronicle said on March 11, 2016:     The park’s new concessionaire has gone as far as halting sales of   “Yosemite National Park” T-shirts because of its predecessor’s claim   to the park title. The name “Yosemite” is being used instead.   The article said that the Park Service had not given up and was fighting the case, but I have not found anything more recent on the subject.  What is happening?  What is an informed prognosis on the outcome of the legal battle?  The Majestic sounds like a Las Vegas hotel, but I better stop before I rant.     "
1933,What is a good length for first back country skis?,"I am looking for my first skitour skis. I have main focus 90% on ascent, and 10% on descent (mostly on piste). I am 184 cm heigh, and weight is 87kg.  What should I consider?   my weight? inclusive a bagpack (extra 8kg)? my height (how tall I am)? my ski (on-piste) skill is somehow 7/10   I consider Volkl BMT 94 in length 176 is it good choice? "
1934,Is there a Leave No Trace equivalent specifically for boaters?,"This question lists the principles of Leave No Trace, taken from the Center for Outdoor Ethics website.  While the general principals apply to many types of outdoor activities, this particular set seems geared toward land-related activities.   Of course all are true no matter who or where you are, or what you're doing, including boating. However, boats and those who use them also have some unique challenges in terms of leaving no trace. I'm thinking especially of things like water and air pollution; endangerment of water-related animal and plant life, sometimes permanently; human waste removal; making too much noise around other boaters or people on land; interfering with those who are using the waters for things such as swimming or fishing; and others I haven't named. With any challenges come responsibility, so I wondered if there's an equivalent organization or set of ethics provided for boaters to follow.   This would encompass things like   boaters and their behavior in general different kinds of boats and their purpose various types of bodies of water  boats which are moving, moored, or docked   geographical location, which might need to be named specifically if rules vary   Does such an organization or set of principles exist? If so, how can I find the information? It might need to be more than one group in order to cover all the things that concern me. Perhaps it's under the umbrella of the Center for Outdoor Ethics, but if so, I didn't see it.  "
1935,How to clean the ceramic filter of a water pump?,"We used a Katadyn Vario filter during our last hike in Scotland. It uses a ceramic filter when used in LONGER LIFE modus.   The waters in Scotland however have a tendency to be brown (due to the peat in the ground I suppose). As a result, the pumping became increasingly difficult. The ceramic filter turned brown.  Katadyn provides you with a cleaning patch for the ceramic filter and it helped a bit, but still, the filter has a brown color and the pumping is less easy as it used to be.  Are there any other tips on how to clean ceramic filters in general? Is there some chemical way to get them cleaned instead of cleaning them with the patch? "
1936,"Hiking in the Pyrenees late July/early August, what track should I do?","I'm looking for a 5-7 days hike. Or something around that, more or less, I'm flexible.  The idea would be to stay away from hordes of tourists. We don't mind people, but we don't like queuing up on a hike or fighting for a place to put our tent.  How safe is it to tent? Bears? Pumas? Other wildlife I should take into consideration?  Where should we make our approach from? Spain? France? What are the pros and cons?  Any resources to maps, tracks, tips and tricks would be welcomed from people that hiked there or that have researched the topic extensively. Thank you! "
1937,Emergency measures: sleeping bag not suitable for the current weather,"Related Questions: Keeping warm in an emergency,  Light-weight emergency overnight-gear  It has happened to me a couple of times that I have shelter and plenty of insulation underneath, but my 1-season sleeping bag turns out insufficient for the spring snow that surprised me at nightfall. What should be done in such conditions?  I have tried:   Enabling alarm every 30min or one hour in order to prevent white death Zipping the bag all the way, only my nose protruding. Unfortunately below freezing temperature breathing the icy air is very very uncomfortable. Zipping the sleeping bag and forming a ball inside. Unfortunately everything turns wet by the morning and even before that.   Heck, how do people in quality sleeping bags sleep in the winter with all that sub-zero air that they have to breath? "
1938,Recipe for baking bread/cake on the trail,"I cooked a couple of times but I was just aiding a colleague that also brought all the ingredients and had the know-how. And I have a poor memory, obviously.  How do you cook yours? What recipe do you use? Details are very much appreciated. "
1939,What are the minimum set of shoes required for hiking outdoors,"I recently moved to US (New York) and planning to go hiking to all nearby places - NY, NJ trails. Some hikes require that I wear waterproof shoes, and some hikes doesn't specify any.  I first thought I will go with lightweight waterproof shoes like the one that Merrell has on its website [website]Should I buy 2-3 pair of shoes really? Is it worth it? (Each pair costs about $100 approximately - Am I wrong?) I am not really a beginner, but I was hiking carelessly wearing sneakers, but now with my knee, ankle pain - I am little more concerned, careful and want to go with proper hiking shoes. Mostly it will be a one day hike and I will be hiking in and out of NY, NJ trails - I think they are not snowy.   Can you please help narrow-down to one kind of shoe? or at a max 2. Any shoe recommendations are welcome:) Thanks. "
1940,How do I know that I need to add an insole to my shoe?,"I am trying to learn more about shoes, but for the near term goal, I have this query - how do I really know that I need an insole? How to select the right insole that I need? "
1941,How many calories (aprox.) do we lose when washing in (very) cold water?,"This is a common problem during wild camping or survival activity, especially during colder seasons. You are tired, you have lost a lot of calories during day, and now you want to wash, but the only option you have is the cold water in the stream. And the temperature outside is also not very warm.  So, you want to be clean, but you don't want to lose another big portion of calories because of that, because your body is already driving on reserves.  But how much calories are lost when you, let's say, spend a 5 minutes naked and wet, with about 1 minute inside cold water (or pouring cold water on yourself, like in cold shower)? Of course, the exact answer depends on many factors, such as body mass, the fat/muscle factor, the exact temperature, etc., but I need only estimates, such as about 100 calories (which can vary from 50 to 200). Would it be about 100 calories, or 250, or 50?  "
1942,Commuting by canoe,"I live at a lake with my company in sight just 2 km (~1.2 miles) away. To get to work I have to cross the city, which is not only expensive in terms of money, it also costs a lot of nerves. That's why I think I should go to work in a canoe. What do I need to learn to do that?  I thought about an inflatable one because I can easily carry it the few meters from shore to my workplace and I need to be able to ride a bus with it. One of my choices is the Sevylor® Pointer™ K1 Kayak - 1 person (YouTube).  Does this look like a smart idea to cross the lake of Zürich with it every day? Mostly it's a pretty easy lake without large waves or strong drift.  PS: I'm fine with a ""may get wet"" I just don't want to get soaked on a daily basis, Especially in winter. "
1943,How to harden feet for walking barefoot on harsh surfaces?,"In the past I was only occasionally walking barefoot, on relatively short distances, on the earthy surfaces. But I'd like to train my feet to be able to do much more - including walking on harsh surfaces such as rocks. My inspiration are the documentaries of indigenous peoples walking barefoot in many environment, including rocky ones, and the family tales, that in the past people were walking barefoot to church, even in the winter.  However, I've done today a 20-minutes walk in the city. The pavements were hot because of full sun, and after reaching home I've found out that the skin on my soles is creased and I feel pain even standing. Luckily, it seems that I'm going to get out of it even without blisters.  Obviously my feet are too soft for harsher surfaces. I should walk a lot on earthy surfaces - unfortunately most trails in the surrounding are graveled... But are there any exercises, training programs or treatments to speed up the tempo of hardening foots? From what distances should I begin, and in which tempo to increase them? Does some ointments, cold or hot showers help? "
1944,Is it safe to swim naked in lakes in Northern Europe?,"Is it safe to swim naked in lakes (rather smaller ones) in Northern Europe (north from Alps), when it comes to possible interactions with the fauna?   I wouldn't expect to meet fishes such as infamous Candiru in the Northern Europe, but are there any fishes or other animals, that could be possible dangerous to the most delicate body parts, making swimming without pants not a very good idea? "
1945,What do you risk when you ignore blisters and carry on walking?,"The blisters can be very painful. If you walk further, you should expect it won't be easy and pleasant. And the blisters may get worse.  But what do you risk, except from pain and getting more blisters, when you decide to walk anyway? If you want to train long-distance walking and you decide to go on 30 km (approx. 18 Miles) walk, ignoring the fact that you have painful blisters on the feet?   Is there a risk of serious infection or permanent damage to skin? Or it's just about the pain endurance? "
1946,Is it possible to develop immunity against mosquitos?,"For me, every bite by mosquito results in heavy itching and the blister, which size is dependent on how long the mosquito was sucking the blood, in worst cases even 1 cm in diameter. If I would stay naked outdoors the whole nights, the blisters would probably cover my whole body with painful red crust. It could be very dangerous for the whole body, I think.  But our ancestors have to stay naked the whole day and night outdoors. There are still tribes in Amazon and South Africa, that sleep naked in the open air. How to they deal with mosquito bites? It is possible for body to get used to bites and not react to the bites with blisters? Or the skin can get thicker so that to make it hard for mosquito to get through?  "
1947,Can dirty bird feeders make birds sick?,"We have bird feeders of all shapes, sizes, and types of material. Some we've had for years. We dump out leftover bird seed and shells when we refill them. If there are obvious dangers, like algae, mold, feces or feathers, we scrape those off. We spray them with a hose, but we've never taken them down and given them thorough cleanings with soap or anything else.   We recently met someone who puts her metal, mesh and plastic feeders in the dishwasher with dishwasher detergent. The other types, like wood, she washes with soap and water, sometimes a very small amount of bleach. It's her opinion that this lowers the risk of disease to the backyard birds and the other animals who eat from those feeders.   Are our birds (examples include blue jays, grackles, starlings, sparrows, swallows, thrushes, woodpeckers, American robins, crows, cardinals, mourning doves, orioles, and others) at risk from eating out of communal feeders which haven't been cleaned? If so, what diseases are most common, so we can watch out for symptoms?  "
1948,What safety concerns are there about automatic belay machines?,"I have just tried using an automatic belay machine in an indoor climbing gym. I didn't receive any specific safety training, but it seems to be straightforward. So what safety concerns should I pay attention to?  Is there anything I can do by mistake, which could be dangerous for me or anyone around me? "
1949,How much land would one family need for sustainable food production?,"Help me settle an argument.  How big a patch of temperate wilderness terrain would you need to produce enough food to feed a family of four (two adults, two teens) indefinitely in an off the grid or SHTF scenario?  Assume:   Temperate climate similar to central-north California or the Carolinas. Agrarian diet, lots of grains/veggies, meat 2-3 times/week. Ground is red clay based but fairly loose / uncompacted. Basic farming skills and equipment but no automation/mechanization (ie, no tractors, mules, etc. Human labor only.). Access to electricity NOT guaranteed. Ability to research modern methods and techniques. Plentiful nearby sources of water (but no fish). Frequent rainfall and mild winters. Other humans aren't a threat. Around 100 person-hours of work per week   Assuming you dodged all the other dangers that would be present during such an event, what are the baseline space requirements to be able to grow enough to eat enough, with enough margin for error, to stay healthy? Oh, and we want meat. And pudding. Lots and lots of pudding. "
1950,What is the leave no trace thing to do when parallel trails start to form?,"Sometimes in areas with sandy/muddy ground, multiple parallel trails will start to form.    What is the least impactful way to walk a trail like this? Do you stay on whichever trail shows the most recent travel of the deepest or another option? "
1951,What are the components of a good climbing kit for recreational tree climbing?,"I've enjoyed climbing and cutting trees for many years.  I now want to go to higher levels, but safety is a primary concern, because I am afraid of heights.   I'm about to order gear for recreational climbing. (My long term goal is professional cutting.) Because mechanical ascenders (chest/hand/foot/knee) are not part of my life-support system, will generic ascenders be adequate?  I'm not planning to cruise a canopy or go to heights with such ascenders, but just practice with them.   If an ascender fails, will my climbing line/prusik catch me?  I'm unsure if I'd be ascending while on 2 points because I haven't been able to test this yet.  I want to be safe but as far as I can tell it looks like you could just foot-lock + prusik-slide your way up a rope w/o any mechanical devices at all, and that you and your rope (&amp; prusik) are all that matters as far as loads and safety. If I were ascending with a foot ascender that snapped on me wouldn't I just kinda spin-out on my rope?    Please critique my intended purchases below to see if they are adequate for climbing and for safety.  o 150' of a 16-strand rope; unsure if it should be double-braided.  I am a very cheap person but for buying rope, I'd only consider name-brand stuff (Yale/etc) and would only buy from a place I knew I could trust which, so far, is only sheffield/bartlett's/wesspur.  o Prusik &amp; carabiner to attach myself to my rope (triple-lock/30-whatever-kN is the ansi for hardware) via my rock climbing saddle. I don't know the brand but it is ""diesel"" and certainly seems overkill/heavy but redundancy is fine with me here!  o a simple pulley (not for rigging or life-support), a figure 8 (not for life support), 1-2 extra carabiners (proper kN but not triple-lock.)   Am I right in thinking that, if I've got my rope and (sling/multi-function-lanyard/flipline/etc), and it's OK to un-hook myself from one setup while advancing the other, then I could climb as high as my line safely allowed?   I plan to use some sort of friction-saving device on any redirects but still want my rope to last, which is why I was thinking 16-strand. Are there any other options for my purposes?  I definitely don't want some super stiff or heavy line and I absolutely need to be able to tie knots in it.  I'm placing my first order with a 50/50 expectation something will be wrong and I'll need order #2 before I can even try anything out. "
1952,How fast do you lose heat in cold water immersion?,"This question was prompted by PaulD's question about hypothermia prevention after a falling into icy water. A subsequent answer by Roddy stated that the immediate danger of cold water immersion is not hypothermia, as it takes quite long to lower the central body temperature. This statement caused some controversy on how fast this really happens and I feel like it is not what was asked by the OP. So here it is:  How long does it take after immersion into cold water to develop hypothermia?  I am interested in different water temperatures and without or with some kind of heat loss protection (relevant for diving/sailing?), just state for what conditions your information hold.  It is generally considered that the first stage of hypothermia begins below 35degC core temperature. Please reference studies, first hand experience or give any other sort of explanation, why your source is viable. I found many articles via google that claimed different things, mostly not well based (at least not declared). "
1953,How do you treat frozen lungs?,"You know that bleeding lung feeling you get after going out for a long run on a freezing cold night? The one where you can taste blood in the back of your jaw, and begin to wheeze and cough as fluids start forming in your lungs?   Whatever the circumstances may be, if you end up ""freezing"" your lungs from too much activity and breathing too hard in the frozen air, what's the best way to treat them and aid recovery? "
1954,Is it safe to drink snow?,"If it snows, is it safe to drink the water when it melts? What sickness can I get from snow? I am in Europe and would like to know for here, but other places would be interesting too. "
1955,What is the most effective means of melting snow with body heat for drinking?,"The related question Is it safe to drink snow? tells us that in addtion to then normal considerations for any wild water source, you also need to consider how the snow may tip your metabolism into hypothermia  If it is cold and you are traveling and/or without a heat source, what is the best way to melt snow with your body heat to have the least chance of causing hypothermia?  I think there are really two choices, put in your mouth and eat/drink it; or put in a container and hold it near your body to melt, then drink it. "
1956,Can you use a pull buoy in tidal water easily?,"Ok so I'm getting a pull buoy to help with my pull exercises when swimming (and a kickboard for the same with kick exercises) and I want to know if I were to go to a lake or the sea and swim, is it advisable to use a pull buoy in tidal water / open water?  Is it easy to use one out on big open water, or are there any techniques that differ to using one in the pool?  For those unsure a pull buoy is a leg float that you hold between your thighs.  "
1957,"Is there any evidence, one way or the other, that ""Adopt a Highway"" programs reduce littering?","My husband and I have just spent 3 person-hours picking up litter along a one mile plus stretch of quasi-rural road, both sides.  We have been doing this twice a year for a long, long time, but things have gotten worse since the county repaved the road.   As for the 2 larger roads that it connects -- ugh!     Is there evidence that ""Adopt a Highway"" programs reduce litter?   I can see it going either way: (1) the sign that the next mile is adopted by Group X makes some people think and not throw out that empty plastic water bottle; or (2) they think ""someone's going to pick this up so why not toss it?""  And then there is (3) litterers don't think at all.  This may be off topic, but there is lot of beautiful outdoors marred by roadside litter.       "
1958,Excercises to get in a mindful state,"   The practice of mindfulness involves being aware moment-to-moment, of   one’s subjective conscious experience from a first-person perspective.   I often have the problem that I can't bring myself down ""to the hike"" when on a short Saturday trip etc. This problem doesn't apply (at least for me) if I'm on vacation. After the second day I'm absolutely in the ""here and now"".   However, how can I improve my mindfulness or bring myself into a mindful state to experience the hike also on short trips?     Further explanation  In case you didn't get what I wanted to explain, here is a paragraph which describes the problem pretty well:      The problem is that you are often stressed from work and other things   and therefore you think about these things. However, as you hike and   think you forget to experience the hike itself. You are just wandering   around and forget to focus on the landscape, nature and so on. And   often you find yourself in the car again and think: ""Damnit, what have   I even done in the last couple of hours?"" This feeling goes away if   you are away from stressful things a few days. After you've hiked   (without smartphone etc.) for a day already, you are finally in the   ""here and now"" experiencing the hike.  "
1959,Repair a GoreTex jacket's zip?,"My trusty North Face Goretex failed yesterday. The coat itself is in fine working order but the zip is totally broken. Just came apart. I'm loathed to trash a £200 jacket simply because the zip has failed but I'm not sure what other option I have. I checked the north face web site and this kind of thing is deemed ""ware and tear"" so the warranty does not apply (not worth the paper they're written on most of the time in my opinion but hey).  To make matters worse the zip was one of the fancy waterproof one's with a plastic coating built into the zip, so it's heavily integrated with the jacket. Is there anyway or any body who would be able to repair the zip?   My mother in law is handy with a needle and thread but I'm thinking puttin holes in it isn't going to make it very waterproof? "
1960,Why did the wolf-pack withdraw from attacking me?,"While this has happened about 22 years ago, I never really stopped thinking about it and still regard it as unsolved mystery. While I asked plenty outdoormen, nobody had this experience. Having recently discovered this site, I'm hoping to get at least some answers.  I apologize for the long description, but I believe it is necessary to ascertain all the facts first, as any small detail may be important.  Scenario:   Middle of January, around 1am at night (gets dark around 3.30pm over there, so it was as dark as it gets) Quite warm temperature for the night (only around -20 Celsius, e.g. -5 Fahrenheit) Weather was good, initially the wind wasn't very strong, but then started gradually picking up such that walking became much harder and problematic by the time I got back home (e.g. you have to focus and exert quite some energy so the wind does not actually bring you down) Region has some steep hills, deep woods (and as an aside anecdote: a cold-war russian bunker) and small villages (think : couple hundred people, occasionally up to 800 - 1,000) scattered along the main road Region is known to have few wolf packs. Attacks on humans are rare, but not out of question (around 1 each 10 years). You know those 'scary cry-wolf' kids stories ? Well, in our village, that story gets attached to concrete people and names. I walked a short distance - maybe about 4-5 kms, mostly in total darkness (no headlamp or anything), directly over the main road, when I felt something was watching me, and indeed, at a place where road gets quite close to the woods (about 100 meters), I could see quite a few pairs of eyes. It was at that time that I realized the howling (it's a common sound in winter, so we get used to it fast) I was hearing before, was of those wolves (obviously) The alpha male then started running against me, but just him alone - the pack stayed at the boundary between woods and snowy field by the road He however stopped quite far - about 5-7 meters from me Over the course of next 30-40 minutes, he was gradually coming closer to me, step by step, but the closest he got was about 3 meters. He was growling, teeth out, he definitely looked ready to take a bite, had that pose where whole body is lowered (as a cat), getting ready to jump But he didn't. Despite the pack very loudly provoking him and aggressively howling This encounter lasted about 30-40 minutes, at which point I reached the top of the hill (with my village), where there were finally some first houses and street lamps He had me, for over half an hour, in total darkness, at a distance of 3-5 meters. Backed up with about 6 wolves (never exactly counted all those eyes, as I was busy with the alpha male, but know for sure there were more than 5) At one point, I could clearly see the pack was very thin, mustn't have eaten for quite some time, so I would provide a welcome and nutritious fresh meal   So, why on earth did they not attack ?!?  Additional facts about me:   Height : 190 cm Weight : ~100 kg (but my 'build' is wider, so I was very far from being fat at that weight)   I understand how they tracked me. Having just undergone a very strong argue with my brother, I was full of adrenaline, so I must have been reeking it for kilometers (especially in the wind) in that temperature.  It is this adrenaline that has kept me calm all the time, while I was walking with wolf for those 30-40 minutes.  I was looking into his eyes all this time (walking straight up the steep hill, yet head turned right so I could see what he was doing), and could 'see' the hesitation to attack, yet there was clearly a very strong hunger (he was very, very thin, poor thing) and instinct to just jump and take a bite.  I only read it recently you are not supposed to engage the wolf like that (as it is regarded as provocation).  I believe that level of adrenalin is also why I did not get scared (as those pheromones, which I already knew at that time from painful experience when one dog bit me to my back couple years back, can enrage even a small dog, let alone a proper wolf).  My only semi-rational explanation is that the wolf must have been waiting for the fear pheromone signal, which didn't came. And my height/weight must have become obvious only from those 5 meters (not sure about their physiology of vision - how it works in wolves (perspective and such)), so he became hesitant whether to attack.  Any other ideas ? "
1961,Is a mountaineering tent necessary for backpacking Iceland?,"I need a tent that will work in snow, sand storms, lots of wind, rain and sun(UV). Temperatures I'm expecting are -2C at night to 15C during the day. I will be backpacking, so the tent's weight should be sufficiently small for that.  How do I cut down on weight without giving up what's needed? I've been told to avoid fiberglass tent poles as they have shattered on others out there.  Are there key attributes mountaineering tents have over other tents that I need in the described situations? "
1962,"From the point of view of wildlife, what is the most dangerous component of roadside litter?","As my other litter question stated, I live on a semi-rural road, and about twice a year pick up litter from the verge.  Others pick up litter too, but there are swathes of floodplain land, conservation land, as yet undeveloped land, two houses owned by very old people....The result is that I do most of the litter pick-up, both sides, for about 1.5 miles.    It's a lot.  So far, I don't have to be selective about what I pick up, but if I do, what should my priorities be, from the point of view of the wildlife in the area?    Number one priority in terms of wildlife is six-pack plastic webbing. After that, plastic bags which are number one in terms of unsightliness. And after these two items -- plastic bottles, glass bottles, broken glass, foam cups, some old styrofoam (it's being phased out in our area), plastic food containers, metal cans, occasional auto parts, cardboard, paper and occasional unidentified stuff.  That's it. Is there anything it would be better to leave?  For example, is the one old tire in the middle of brambles useful habitat for some critter?   Edit in Response to Comments:   (1) Restricting the list of litter:  I've given a complete list above. Aside from the one old tire I mentioned, there is nothing I cannot pick up easily with one hand.    (2) Wildlife:  Deer, foxes, (and reputedly coyotes), and all the small furry animals from raccoons down to voles.  A variety of snakes and amphibians. Also birds. "
1963,How to estimate the size and or gender of a mountain lion from its tracks?,"If one were to come across mountain lion tracks, how would one estimate the size of the lion making the tracks?  Also, is it possible to tell the gender of the mountain lion(s)? "
1964,How to transport personal belongings while swimming long distance?,"What is common way how to transport personal belongings while swimming?  I am talking about scenario when I need to cross a lake by swimming. I would like to take my stuff (wallet, cell phone, shorts, t-shirt) with me in some waterproof sack or something like that. What is the correct/recommended gear for this job?  If I try to search for ""swimming bag"" or similar, I find only results related to fancy bags for carrying stuff to/from swimming training.  To clarify my question. I know there are waterproof bags on the market. My question is more about what is the best gear (or class of gear) according to experience of somebody who actually try that. "
1965,What determines whether the young of a cat is called a kitten or a cub?,"The young of cats are called kittens or cubs, depending partly on how large the cat is, and apparently partly on informal custom.  Wikipedia, kitten says:     The word ""kitten"" derives from the Middle English word kitoun, which   in turn came from the Old French chitoun or cheton. Juvenile big   cats are called ""cubs"" rather than kittens; either term may be used   for the young of smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, caracals and   lynx, but ""kitten"" is usually more common for these species.   So far, clear.  But take a look at the name for the young of cougars.  The young of mountain lions are often called kittens.  This seems an odd choice for the young of such a large cat.  Wikipedia says:      Cougars are the largest of the small cats. They are placed in the   subfamily Felinae, although their bulk characteristics are similar to   those of the big cats in the subfamily Pantherinae.   Cougar: The American Lion, a publication of the Mountain Lion Foundation says:     Newborn mountain lions enter the world as buff brown balls of fur   weighing slightly more than a pound. Biologists call them kittens   or cubs either is correct.   This article then proceeds to call them kittens throughout.  Sciencing calls them cubs.  Is there a scientific basis for choosing kittens over cubs, or vice versa, for the young of cats?  The extremes are clear: a baby tiger is a cub; a baby domestic cat is a kitten.  But in the middle -- is there a scientific rule or just personal preference?  "
1966,Why was I attacked by a bird (twice)?,"Last night, I had to climb a tower at work. When I reached the top platform (about 40 feet up), and turned my back to close the swinging gate behind me, I was whacked on the back of the head.  Fortunately, I was wearing a hard hat and was not knocked off my feet. It did hurt, though - without the hard hat it would have been worse.  What hit me? A bird. I saw it gliding away as I looked around to see ""what hit me"" (literally). It was probably an owl, as this was after dark. We also have seagulls in the area, and it's possible it was one of them, too. I wasn't being overly observant at the moment, obviously, as I don't know which one it was - it was a good-sized bird, though.  I realized then that the other time a similar occurrence transpired it had to be a bird, too - possibly the same feathered ""friend."" I had thought somebody had hit me with a rock or a dirt clod (but nobody was around; I looked at the ground below me, rather than outwards, where I would have no doubt seen a bird, as I did last night).  The platform is small and when the plant is in operation, very noisy and vibrates. I am almost 100% certain there is no nest up there.  So why did this bird attack me? Both times it/they whacked me on the back of my head, hitting my (plain white) hard hat. They were sharp blows that hurt, even with the hard hat protecting my noggin.  My question is: why would this/these bird[s] attack me? For fun? Because I was in their airspace? Or what? I have never molested them. I have shone a flashlight on them a couple of times as they sat in their tree. They have never swooped down on me as I was walking in the area, only when I'm about 40 feet above ground level.  This occurred in Marina, California, a quarter mile east of Monterey Bay (between the Bay and Highway 1).  Do owls (or seagulls) have something against white hard hats, or people climbing up on platforms? "
1967,How long can I trust the purity of water in a water bottle?,"In the morning on day 1 of my multi-day hike I opened up a one liter plastic bottle of water and drank half the contents. I stored the bottle in a loop on the outside of my pack and promptly forgot about it. A number of days later, sweating and thirsty I remembered the water bottle, but I worried that I might get an upset stomach if I drank the water.  Was I right to be worried?   How long can I trust the purity of water in a water bottle after it has been opened and exposed to a person's mouth? "
1968,"Does ""dive your deepest dive first"" still apply when using a computer?","When doing my PADI open water course, including all the stuff around pressure groups and calculating maximum depth times by hand, I was told that I should always do my deepest dive first, and go shallower in subsequent dives in the day. When doing things with the pressure tables, that seemed to make sense.  Last week, while diving with a computer on a liveaboard, the PADI qualified instructor who was also the dive guide repeated the same thing.  When diving with a computer, does the ""do your deepest dive first"" rule still apply, and if so why? Or can I just rely on the dive computer to calculate how much time I can safely spend at each depth on each dive, and go to whatever depth on each subsequent dive makes most sense for the conditions? "
1969,Ski set that does both downhill and backcountry?,"So I know very little about skiing and have only skied about 3-4 times. I would like to ski more this winter.   I want to purchase a ski set, but I don't know which one to get. Here is what I wanna do, most likely I want to do more of backcountry skiing, but I also would like to do random downhill skiing as well. So basically I would like to purchase something which might not be the best but good enough for both types of skiing .   I read about telemark skis and they tend to do the both. Are there any other options out there? Are telemark as much fun as normal backcountry and downhill skis?  "
1970,Acclimatization strategies,"While reading Hermann Buhl's tour book* of the Nanga Parbat expedition in 1953 (yielding to the first ascent on third of July, Buhl did the final ascent solo) I got curious about the height difference he made and therefore created following plot:    So they needed 6 weeks to get the gear for the high camps up the mountain, struggling with the weather, Sherpas, expedition leaders and the gear itself. Of course we can't compare nowadays expeditions to the old days and the expedition of Buhl was complicated but still I am asking myself   Is this style of complicated looking height progression done nowadays too? If so, is it done due to acclimatization? How did acclimatization strategies change over the last decades in general?   The expedition of 1953 wasn't having the infrastructure modern expeditions have but nonetheless I am interested how the effects regarding acclimatization are. I would assume Buhl was extremely well acclimated when he started to go for the summit.    *The book I read is this one, I am not sure but possibly this is a translation into English. "
1971,What is the purpose of the shoulder strap upper adjustment?,"  On both of my backpacks (40L and 100L) the construction is as in the picture. The shoulder straps are connected to the backpack body at some point A on the back of the backpack. Separately, there are adjustment straps, that connect some upper part of the shoulder straps to the top of the backpack (those are different from the shoulder strap length adjustment at the bottom of the shoudler straps).   Essentially, if the adjustment straps are fully loose, the shoulder straps are attached to point A, and if they are fully contracted, the shoulder straps are attached to point B.  What is the purpose of this? How do I adjust them correctly? "
1972,What crampon front-point setup options are specific for various types of ice climbing?,"Is it a matter of personal preference, or are there advantages to using different front-point setups on your crampons specific to what you are climbing?  For example, I'm still just getting into ice climbing and I have a pair of DMM Terminator crampons, which can be setup a variety of ways; dual front points, mono point, offset mono and mixed mono. They also come with bolt on heel-spurs, for doing things that I will probably not be doing anytime soon.  What are the advantages to these different setups? I understand that mono points are preferred for mixed and dry ice climbing, I can see offset mono points being useful climbing overhanging ice or ice columns, but could someone please list exactly what these different front-point setups were developed for?   "
1973,Why all the different accessory cord diameters?,"It's easy to get overwhelmed with all the different types and diameters of accessory cords. I usually always get 7mm for making my prusiks and cordalettes, but I've often wondered who uses the smaller diameter stuff?  I naturally assume smaller cord is used for friction knots on smaller ropes, but how small is too small? The answer given to this question: What&#39;s the minimum diameter cord to use when climbing a rope using a prusik , states that you should use cord for prusiks that is 2mm smaller diameter than your rope, with a minimum of 5mm, but who on earth is ascending 7mm ropes with 5mm prusiks?   Why are there so many different accessory cord diameters, and what are their intended uses in climbing?   "
1974,"Can anybody recommend a good mid-week winter mountaineering course or a good mountain guide in the Lake District, UK?","Me and my partner will be spending a week in February in the Lake District, UK (Monday to Friday).  We want to get as much walking in as possible and attempt a number of the peaks / ridges.  We are very aware that we will find heavy snow and cold temperatures and that crampons / ice axes are recommended for that time of year.  Neither of us have experience of using crampons and ice axes.  We've had a look at the local centers who offer courses, and they all offer 2 day courses where they show you how to use the equipment and how to stay safe.  However all the courses run at weekends.  Does anybody know of a mid-week course? Or alternatively, does anybody know of a good guide we could hire for a few days to guide us on some of the hikes and show us the techniques along the way? "
1975,"How can I use horsetail as a ""indicator plant"" to find gold while gold pannig?","How can I use horsetail as a indicator plant to find gold while gold pannig?     What are Indicator Plants?      Indicator plants are peculiar to a certain place. Though they aren’t necessarily rare, they don’t grow just anywhere. They tolerate only a narrow range of growing conditions, so their presence in a forest signals some distinctive aspect of that place.    Indicator plants can be used for a variety of reasons. They can tell us if we are the wetlands, an old field, a young woodlands, mature woodlands, human impacted sites or whether the soil is alkaline or acid and so on, as seen here  and here.  Field horsetail indicates a wet, poorly draining soil and is soggy at different times of the year as is mentioned here.      Horsetail is a perennial plant that is found in or near watery areas such as marshes, streams, or rivers. Horsetail grows in temperate northern hemisphere areas of Asia, Europe, North America, and North Africa. It flourishes where it can root in water or clay soil.   There are some who claim that horsetail can be used as an indicator plant for finding gold, such as the following:     Some of the most useful plants for mineral prospecting are:          Gold - Equisetum arvense &amp; confusa (horsetail) - Indicator Plants      The following site has this to say about horsetail:     The horsetail is a type of plant that grows in sandy soil usually very close to a water supply. Its uses are many as it has a high silica content that allegedly can be of some medicinal value, but its primary function during the gold rush days was for... - Horsetail Gold   My question is this: How can one know the differences between what makes a site possibly gold bearing over one that in simply wet, poorly drained and/or sandy, using horsetail as a plant indicator, while gold panning along a river or stream in the Great Outdoors?  "
1976,Why do I always wake up freezing?,"I like to go camping in the forest, mostly in summer, sometimes also when temperatures drop to about 0&deg;C/32&deg;F during the night.  I have a three-season sleeping bag (T-comf: -2°C, T-lim: -8°C, T-ext: -26°C), an inflatable sleeping mat (9cm thick, R-value 2.8), and a good enough tent.   My equipment should be sufficient for sleeping outside, let alone in a tent, in 0&deg;C (right?).   Nonetheless, I often wake up in the middle of the night, freezing. Especially, my hips, feet and legs are cold. And of course it is nearly impossible to go back to sleep, once cold.  I have tried wearing warm headwear, woolen underwear and socks inside the sleeping bag, to no avail. Drinking hot tea before turning in has not helped. Clothes, sleeping bag, tent are all nice and dry.  Why do I still wake up freezing? What else I can do to keep warm? "
1977,Can a compass be thrown off by its surroundings?,"Would it be possible for a compass be affected by its surroundings, such as a large iron deposit or other rocks  to the point where it is not working correctly?  I am not talking about declination but rather a change that is specific to a local area.  Is this possible and if so, how would one detect it? "
1978,How to process iron in the wilderness?,"How do you smelt and forge iron sources from &amp; in the wilderness? People must have started somewhere with this sort of thing!   I once saw a video from a primitive technology practitioner on YouTube who smelted iron from a orange bacterial build up in water that served as the ore, using a wildcrafted furnace he made. He noted it was mainly a demonstration of a wildcrafted furnace and that larger furnaces would be built using more charcoal and labor to produce usable quantities of iron. He did not take next steps once he had iron pellets. What would one do with them (or more of them) to make the iron pellets into something useful, such as a nail, a needle, a knife, or an arrowhead?  What are ways to process iron in the wilderness? Since this probably varies geographically, let's focus on common ways that are most widely applicable, and let's assume that we have only wildcrafted tools. "
1979,Recovering from Hypothermia,"I am not much used to Camping in Cold areas. But I have been told by hikers that Hypothermia is something that I should be very careful of. Since childhood, it has been like, I don't catch cold very often, but in windy places when the air is cold, I feel my hands get numb, and legs shiver a bit. Having said this, I am going for a hike in cold, not snowy though, I am a little worried about Hypothermia. When struck by Hypothermia, one has to remain awake. And, sleeping actually make your body warmer. Can a dip in the hot-water help for that matter? Is the Body-Heat (obviously from someone else) a good option? Or will that freeze my guy, like me?  "
1980,Why can't a Figure-of-8 descender be used for SRT?,"I've been told that a Figure-of-8 descender cannot be used for SRT (single-rope technique) because the descender must be able to be removed from the rope, without being removed from the harness. Why is this the case? If you remove it from the rope without removing it from the harness (eg. with a 'Stop' or a rack), you are no longer connected to the rope via the descender. If you remove it from the harness, before removing it from the rope (eg. with a figure-of-8), you are still no longer connected to the rope via the descender?  Am I missing something, or have I completely misunderstood this, because this doesn't seem to make sense to me. "
1981,Why do many climbers appear to not trust their belay loops?,"The belay loop is the strongest part of the climbing harness, so why do so many climbers not trust it? It’s very common to see climbers backing up their belay loop with a separate piece of webbing or clipping their belay carabiner through the waist and leg tie-in points to avoid the belay loop. I’ve even seen some climbers cut the belay loops off their harnesses because they’re “old school” and never had a belay loop when they first started climbing. What I believe so far is that one could not possibly generate enough force by rappelling or holding a big lead fall to cause a belay loop to fail. Not even close.   Then Why Are Belay Loops Not Trusted? When I started climbing I was asked to concede a fact that the Belay Loops are just there to hold the leg loops to the waist loop. "
1982,How to apply duct tape and mole skin to prevent blisters?,"In response to a question that was asked regarding preventing/treating blisters, a reputed and a respectable climber (DavidR) said:     ""Having 'duct tape', 'mole skin', or other adhesive products, and   knowing how to apply them to prevent blisters in trouble spots.""   I have no idea of how to use/apply a duct-tape or a mole-skin. Can anybody please elaborate how to do it? Also, what can go wrong if I do it incorrectly? "
1983,Is emergency overnighting using hammock/canvas tent considered wild camping (Europe/Germany)?,"Is (more or less planned) emergency overnighting with usage of hammock and/or canvas tent considered wild camping in Europe (especially in Germany)?   In many countries, such as Germany, wild camping is disallowed and fined, but if you don't use full tent, but only canvas to protect yourself from rain/insects, is it still in praxis treated the same and fined?  I'm not sure if canvas tent is the proper word, I mean something like that:  "
1984,How to Tell When Minimal Running Shoes Are Worn Out?,"How can I tell when my minimal running shoes go bad?  Let me explain.  Conventional Wisdom  The conventional wisdom of marathon runners is that running shoes will eventually 'go bad'. That is, at some point the shoes will still work fine for walking around the house and working in the garden, but they have ""lost their bounce"". At some point (roughly 400 miles) your standard pair of, say, Nike running shoes will start to feel like the soles are made of concrete.  Standard running shoes lose their bounce.  What about minimal running shoes?  I am training for another marathon in a pair of minimal running shoes (New Balance Minimus). And I know I have run 600 or 700 miles in this one pair of shoes.  But  minimal running shoes have no ""bounce"" to start off with. Just super thin soles. So... does that mean I can run in them until they have holes in the soles?  Do minimal running shoes 'go bad' too? Or do they work just fine until they're holey? "
1985,Are bears more attracted to menstruating females?,People have speculated that women hiking in bear country during their menstrual cycle might increase their chances of a bear encounter. Is this true? What can be done to minimize risk?  Related question: Handling feminine hygiene on multiple-month treks?  
1986,What is Arc'Teryx Technical down?,"Today I received an e-mail from Arc'Teryx stating that     Fall 2013 ushers in the arrival of technical DOWN and NEW GORE-TEX® Pro technology.   What is technical down? I assume it is some sort of hydrophobic down. If yes, how does Arc'Teryx technical down differs from other hydrophobic down technologies? "
1987,Trekking poles on planes,"Have people been able to bring their (folding) trekking poles onto planes? We're flying without checked-in baggage (on Wizz Air, from Europe to Israel). We've paid for ""two large cabin bags"", and the poles fit inside them. I'm not asking for promises, obviously, but does anyone have any anecdotal evidence whether this is allowed or not? "

What resources would every member of a small group of average adults need in order to realistically have chance of completing it:   Vacation time Money Equipment ?   Furthermore, what are the most dangerous spots? Places where one can slip in the mud and fall to death; places without civilization for days?  Would a bike tour be feasible? "
1989,How much more difficult is the Haute Route than the Annapurna trek?,We've completed the Annapurna trek from Bhulbhule to Muktinath in 11 days without special difficulties or knee aches.  How much harder would the Haute Route be? Would you consider doing the Tour du Mont Blanc instead as a less difficult option? 
1990,"Have a couple basic Q's on climbing-line (1 on safely descending/rappelling, another on using multiple lines and/or hardware to achieve ""1+1=2""?)","Hoping to ask a couple basic Q's before my order arrives, I suspect I may've gotten insufficient gear..  1 - Is doubling-up ropes, or hardware, ever acceptable in climbing?  IE, my 8mm prusik cord is acceptable despite being below ANSI strength, because I'm attached to two tails (so it becomes above 24kN), does this same logic apply in ways like me taking (2) lengths of my climb-rope (Blue Moon), knotting each's end to an O-ring, and making my own cambium saver/friction saver?  Or make a basal anchor by doubling-up in such a way?  2 - Is a figure-8 and your regular eye-in-eye hitch cord enough for a safe rappel?  I ordered a harness/rope/etc but I only got ascenders, for descent all I got was a figure-8....if that &amp; controlling the friction-hitch/eye-in-eye isn't sufficient for safe descent, what do I need?  Thanks a ton, am definitely going to be sure I never use anything not meeting ANSI but am planning on redundancies in some areas so wanna know these things, for instance if I set a canopy-anchor that my rope was running-through, but it wasn't a ring-in-ring but instead simply a carabiner tied to a lanyard, in such cases my instinct would be to just toss a 2nd carabiner there, even though the first one is ANSI-OK it seems to make sense both for peace-of-mind and just for rope-wear, heck I bought a handful of these steel thimbles to use in making loops on my rope, am already planning on using them in any&amp;every instance they're applicable to reduce rope-on-rope friction! "
1991,Top-rope soloing sensible primary and secondary device combination,"I have been trying to find the ""canonical"" post on this topic without success - each post has its own take on the issue. And I understand that opinions and preferences abound - but I'm looking for sensible principles to apply (and resultant recommendations). Perhaps the most reputable discussion I found is on Mountain Project.  But if I were to summarize what I have learned I'd say that:   You need two devices for redundancy, separate from each other as in this video:     and the Gri-Gri is not a valid alternative, despite some online presentations.     Petzl Microcender seems to be a crowd pleaser, among other things, because it is toothless, and doesn't fray or peel on the rope. However, it has been discontinued. Same goes for the Silent Partner and the Soloist.     Are the Petzl Rescucender and the Trango Vergo the preferred alternatives for the primary device? For instance, on the Mountain Project forum, here, here and here.       What is the (or some of the) preferred secondary device? On the first image above, the secondary device (Handled Ascender) looks quite bulky... Should a toothed device like the Petzl Micro Traxion be a favorite option? By using it as a secondary device, you get all the benefits of a toothed device, but protect the rope since it will only get engaged if the primary device fails.     Of note, I have also come across the recommendation of the Petzl Micro Traxion as the sole device as in this:    The Yates Rocker and the Wild Country Ropeman mentioned by Climbing Magazine.     Is it best to use a static rope (less elastic excursion; less problems with toothed devices) with two strands equalized via, for example, a figure 8 knot at the top - one strand for climbing; the second strand as an escape belay or lowering (gri-gri) rope? This is probably shortsighted, giving priority to the rope over avoiding potential spine injuries with falls on static ropes - although possibly not all that likely...  "
1992,What overnight backpacking trails are clear of deep snow now (or likely to be in the next two weeks) in northwest Washington?,"I am looking for an overnight backpacking trip to do in the next few weeks somewhere in western Washington. But I am worried about deep snow remaining on the trails.  Based on last winter's snowpack, the rate of melting this spring, and on prior knowledge of the trails in that area, can anyone here suggest a trail or trails, or even a local area, that would have good hiking conditions and possibly, although not necessarily, a few places snow-free places to camp?  For example, should I be looking at places below N feet in altitude?   "
1993,Looking for information about the large circles free of snow that form in the spring around the trunks of large trees?,"We have often used the large snow free circles that form in the spring around the trunks of large trees as camping spots.  Even in an area blanketed with deep snow, there will be such bare, dry ground to camp on, although one may have a steep climb into or out of such a spot.  They are like dry wells.  First, what are such bare-ground wells called?    I assume that the dark tree trunk absorbs heat and then acts as a heater to speed up melting around the trunk.  Moreover, the snow was probably shallower around the trunk because of the tree branches.  We observed these circles under evergreens.   Second, does this accelerated melting happen only when daytime temperatures go above freezing, or does it start earlier?      "
1994,Rappel: How do I start rappel from a ledge when using rappel extension,"I'm using a rappel extension similar to what is shown in this video and that one.  When the rappel start is a straight drop-off from a ledge and the anchor is low to the ground, I find it difficult to start the rappel as shown in FotH 9th ed. p.216 (description below) as my ATC (tube-type breaking device) often gets stuck above while I lower into position below the ledge and weigh the rope.  An obvious solution to this would be to forego the extended rappel and clip the ATC directly to the belay loop and clip the autoblock on the leg loop but I'm not a big fan of the leg-loop approach.  Is there a way to start straight drop-off rappels using an extension without getting my gear stuck above?  As to the technique described in FotH: Essentially the procedure it describes for steep ledges and/or low anchors is to 1- sit down on the ledge as though sitting in a chair; 2- start to rotate to your left until you're facing the rock (assumes right hand is brake hand). This works much better when you can find decent footing. They call the technique is called 'sit-and-spin'.  As to how the ATC gets stuck: It means that most of my body is over the ledge and the rope is weighted but my ATC, due to the extension, is still on top of the ledge. Given the rope is weighted, it is difficult to make the ATC pass the over the ledge. "
1995,Is it possible to 'live off the sea',"I've recently become aware of the american 'survivalist' or 'prepper' phenomenon.   The general idea seems to be that 'something bad' (exactly what seems to vary) is going to happen, civilization will collapse and the survivalists will run to the hills and live off the land.  It occurs to me that the hills are likely to get over crowded fairly quickly.  Rather than living off the land, is it possible to live off the sea instead?  This isn't a question about the mechanics of living afloat (repairing your boat, fixing leaks, keeping the reverse osmosis plant working) it's more a question of can someone gather/hunt/farm all of the nutrients required to be healthy whilst never having to land again? Obviously fish would be a prime source of food, but would that provide everything a human body needs? Is plant matter essential for survival and if so are seaweeds adequate and can they be farmed? Or are their some essential nutrients that can only be gathered from the land? "
1996,Use of a personal anchor system to rappel (abseil) off a cliff with anchors by the edge and at foot level,"Definitely not a duplicated question to this one... Rather a much more specific question...  The situation arises when there are bolted anchors at foot level on the edge of the cliff:    The issue is that if you have set up the anchor off a cordelette (or a sling) as in...    and you clip a dynamic rope to this anchor, and then set up the rappelling device (extended ATC with Prusik knot)     you may very well find yourself hanging from some 4 to 5 feet of slack.  If you can't set up a static rope in the back of the ledge (say, off a tree or boulder) to lower yourself smoothly until the rappel device comes under tension, I only see two solutions to avoid downclimbing on a slack rappel setup with a possible nasty slip:   Set up a static rope off one of the bolts (using one of the locking biners already in use for the main anchor), and use a grigri to lower yourself until the Prusik engages the ATC and makes the rappel device taut. This would entail connecting a dynamic system and the static rope to a single biner, which is probably not a good idea.  Perhaps using a personal anchor system. And this is the question. Good idea? And this is the question... Good idea? Can the Petzl device below (with progressive lengthening options) avoid a bad fall with a huge fall factor? How can the PAS be disengaged after placing the rappel system under tension?   Like this...    ... using the Petzl personal anchor system:   "

1998,How do people deal with sweating and 'feeling hot' at high altitude climbs (above 5500m)?,"How do people deal with sweating and 'feeling hot' at high altitude climbs (above 5500m)??  Just a background on myself:  I've done hikes/climbs up to 3000m where temps hit at the lowest of around -1 celcius only.  Those hikes/climbs are only day trips.  Those hikes/climbs are considered extremely easy in the whole grand scheme of it.  Last and most importantly: I sweat A LOT and EASILY  My experience during my climbs was that I tend to always want to remove a layer of clothing as I actually feel hot and am quite wet with perspiration to the point where I've only got my 'dry-fit' tshirt on at temperatures close to freezing.  Hence, I'm extremely curious as to how people combat this at higher altitudes as I've been reading a lot about some proper expeditions as I'm sure going 'single layer' at those altitudes is just plain stupid.

2000,"Choosing a kayak for a 5'9"" 300lb man","I'm looking to get myself a kayak, but weight limits are an issue for me. I like the ascend kayaks from Cabala's because of the high back seats.

What other things should I look for?  I will mostly be cruising down rivers with little to no fishing going on. I had a 10' sun dolphin arua ss but I was about sinking it and the seat back was to low and uncomfortable on a 3 to 5 hour trip. "
2001,I've been out of the water for a little over a year; what should I focus on refreshing before I dive again?,"I've been scuba diving for several years, but it's been a little while now since the last time.

I have my PADI Open Water and Adventures in Diving books I can reference, but I'd rather not re-read them in their entirety :) While I feel capable of just jumping back into diving, I'd prefer to be confident I'm not forgetting anything.  What are the key points I should make sure I'm comfortable with before getting back in the water? What should I practice? What should I do when I arrive (I'll be renting most of my gear rather than bring it with me, if that matters). "

2003,How can I prevent calf muscle pain while descending?,I am 43 years of age and recently took up high altitude trekking in the Himalayas. I have observed that on my descent (with practically no ascents) my calf muscles start paining immensely. If I turn around and start trekking upward I wouldn't feel any pain at all. Typically this pain comes after about two hours of continuous (with short breaks though) descent. Over time the pain spreads across to the thighs as well.  I would request the experienced trekkers to provide some guidance on how I should be stepping while descending such that the pain is minimized? Any advice on the proper stepping / gait while descending?

I didn't see the bird, but I think it was in my Mulberry tree. The closest body of water would be the Potomac, but that's at least two miles from here.  Sorry I can't provide more hints. I don't know a lot about birds, I just found the song quite striking. "
2007,What is the different between climb-spec and military-spec webbing?,"I'm shopping for some 1"" tubular webbing. There is climb-spec webbing and military-spec webbing. The military-spec description says     Meets industry-standard military specs for breaking strength and resistance to abrasion   What exactly is the difference, if any, between these two? When should each be used, and what are the specification differences? "
2008,Dozens of dead little spiders in the snow,"The winter suddenly set in here and it was pretty warm before. We walked through the snow in a central European forest and I realized a lot of ""black dots"" (dozens of them) as a contrast to the white. It turned out that these were little spiders - dead little spiders.  I saw one rappel down from a branch (quite slow; like exhausted). It died as soon as it reached the floor (so, the snow).  What happened there? Were they just hatched little spiders frozen to death cause of the sudden cold?      "
2009,How to calculate how much sugar to use as antifreeze in drinking water?,"Sea water does not freeze until about −2 °C (28 °F) if you add more salt you can lower the  freeze point to -21°C.   We know from How much sea water can I safely drink? that drinking salt water is not good.  But adding any substance to water that will form a solute will lower the freezing temp. You can drink as much sugar water as you want, the only risk is added calories which you likely need anyhow.     The higher the concentration of salt, the lower the freezing point drops. Any foreign substance, such as sugar, alcohol, or any chemical salt, added to the water, forms a solute, which will lower the freezing point and melt ice.    Source   So if I want to add sugar to my water to keep it from freezing how do I calculate how much sugar per unit of water I need to add, to keep it liquid at a given temperature?  "
2010,What is the safest and most effective additive to keep drinking water from freezing?,"I know that the antifreeze used in fresh water RV tanks is non-toxic and can protect to -50F.  Thinking Sugar might be a good choice I posted the question How to calculate how much sugar to use as antifreeze in drinking water? from the answer it looks like you don't get much real benefit for reasonable amounts of sugar.  So what potable/drinkable additive can I use to keep my drinking water from freezing?  How much of it do I need to use to get to protect at different temperatures.    Optimally the answer includes a chart that shows the volume to add per unit of water, for an anticipated temperature. "
2011,How to correctly wear a backpack,"I've often thought about if there is a thumb rule how to wear a backpack comfy and safe. Where should it sit on the back to be ergonomic etc.? How do I adjust the shoulder, hip and chest straps to achieve this?  "
2012,How do you reset your body 'thermostat' after hiking in snow?,"About 10 weeks ago, I did a 16-hour snow hike in Newfoundland (off-topic: insanely gorgeous country!).  The outside temperature was still very warm for November, with highs of -5ºC / 23ºF and lows of -10ºC / 14ºF.  I wore multiple layers, as I was prepared for remote possibility to stay the night on the mountain, should I become too tired. For great majority of the hike (10-12 hours) I had all 3 layers open, as it was simply too hot (just -5ºC / 23ºF) and I was sweating like a pig, especially the middle part of the ascent, before I reached the steep gully, where the wind picked up and I eventually zipped  all 3 layers (though only for the rest breaks). My best estimate is that the wind-chill before summit was around -13ºC / 8.5ºF, still far from cold, but at least more comfortable for hiking than the ""hot"" -5ºC / 23ºF.  The problem now is that my internal thermostat / cold resistance got somehow readjusted during the hike, by roughly 4-5 degrees Celsius.  As an example, the default in-room 20ºC / 68ºF now feels hot. Not for 5 minutes; all the time. It's more than 20ºC / 68ºF everywhere I go indoors — office or home. I've found out that the comfortable room temperature wearing T-shirt and shorts is now around 18.5ºC / 65ºF, which is insane for everybody else.  My best guess at this point is that my body 'thermostat' returned back to the winter values I was used to 20 years ago back in Europe, with highs of -15ºC / 5ºF and lows of -25ºC / -13ºF.  But, it's been over 10 weeks since the hike. There must be a switch I can flip back!  Any ideas how to readjust it back? Or at least do things differently for next snow hike?  Perhaps the water intake is to blame? I underestimated the hike (and I quite honestly did not expect excessive sweating at -5ºC / 23ºF) by ±6 hours, so those 6 litres of water (I need 1 litre per 2 hours in winter, much much more in summer — hence the preference for winter hikes) I was carrying up (though I left few additional bottles in car, and I drank half litre right before start of the hike), got consumed very fast (and I basically ended with 1 last litre for last 6 hours — though that was descent, so much less water was physically needed). "
2013,Hiking in SE France,"What are:  a)some good resources for 1-2 day hikes in southern France, between Lyon and Nice?   b)some good 1-2 day hikes between Lyon and Nice?   I am looking for something with scenery (e.g. lakes, mountain pass, above tree line).   I have found the area around the town of Gap (Southeast of Grenoble) in the Parc National des Ecrins appears very nice. Can anyone suggest a particular entry point and hike, as well as logistics (best place to park a car overnight or arrive by bus/train? best places to sleep - any huts or villages)?   I'm using this site to figure out some of the hikes: Sentiers en France (Sentiers proches de Gap).  I am open to considering other options nearby that may be more accessible from Nice and Lyon (different people are coming from different parts); Corsica is a little far given the time frame we have.  Thank you. "
2014,B2 boots for narrow feet,"I'm looking to get some B2 boots, but am having difficulty getting a good fit. I tried Scarpa Manta's but my heel kept lifting. I think the issue is that my ankles are quite narrow. Does anyone have any good advice for getting better fitting boots or is it just a case of trying a range of brands? Are some brands known to make narrower boots? "
2015,"From an outdoor recreation point of view, does it matter who manages a national monument?","In the United States, many national monuments are managed by the national park service, but not all.  For example, Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah and Upper Missouri River Breaks are both managed by the Bureau of Land Management.  From an outdoor recreation point of view, is it relevant who manages a national monument?  Does it make any differences? "
2016,Does cotton really kill?,"For outdoor hiking, backpacking or camping trips, I always hear people saying Cotton Kills. That means don't wear cotton anywhere (underwear, shirts, pants), and no cotton blends. Usually it's given as a strict, no compromise rule if the temperature is somewhat cold &lt; 40F.   I understand that cotton retains moisture (sweat, rain), which makes it less thermally insulating, harder to dry out and heavier. This can lead to hypothermia, pneumonia, etc. Thus, synthetic materials and wool are preferable. But by how much?   Are there any studies showing how much more thermally insulating damp synthetics or wool are compared to damp cotton? I'm curious if cotton is just like 50% worse or more like 5x worse.  That might allow you estimate, for example, that you could survive 5 hours with wool vs. 2 hours with cotton under certain temperature conditions. "
2017,How to camp in wolf country?,"   How safe is sleeping in bear country?   I, too, like to sleep in a bivy sack under the stars. And while during the summer I am not too concerned about wolves (in spite of locals reporting attacked horses and cattle), the winter scares me. Recently, along with one more person, we slept for 3 nights in the snow, and on the night of the fourth day we saw a pack of wolves.   We got scared and immediately headed for the civilization. However, I would hate it to never again have the courage to sleep in the snow.  Are there any precautions that can be taken against wolves, especially during the winter, to make sleeping safe?  We hike on marked trails. There are no marked campsites. "
2018,How to stay hydrated with minimum water usage,"A friend of mine asked a experienced long distance hiker, how to drink during such a hike. The answer was, drink 0.1l water per hour and then you are fine.  Is this correct and can anyone add some facts to this answer? Can I stay hydrated over several days with a this given amount of water?   What are factors to drink more water and how much more e.g. (wind, activity, temperature, ...)?  Side question:Are there studies on this topic? "
2019,V-threads (Abalakov): How many holes are too many?,"V-threads, or Abalakov threads (after the inventor Vitaly Abalakov), can be tricky to make (especially left handed in the dark...), but when you miss the mark on your first attempt, or second attempt, or third... at what point do you abandon your anchor and try again somewhere else? How far apart should v-threads be from other screw holes in good ice? I have a hard time trusting a v-thread unless I get it perfect the first time, I feel as if I'm compromising the integrity of the ice if I try to drill another hole to meet the first if my first attempt misses.     At what point does an attempted v-thread become unsafe? "
2020,"Is there a technique to snow-shoeing besides ""walk on the snow""?","I've spent a lot more time cross-country skiing than I have snowshoeing, but have some snowshoeing opportunities available to me in the near future. In the few times I have gone snowshoeing, I've basically just treated it like normal walking, just with extra equipment on my feet. Is there a more nuanced technique that I may not be aware of? For example, with skiing, you learn to kick-and-glide instead of just shuffling back and forth. What (if anything) can I do when snowshoeing to ensure that I'm expending my energy efficiently and doing it ""right""? "
2021,When should I boil water before distilling it?,"One of the surest ways of purifying water is distillation water is boiled and only things that evaporate at or below 100C are captured.  This does lead to the potential issue of things like petroleum products with a lower boiling point, getting distilled into your collection chamber.  It would seem that if you pre-boil your water in an open container, any contaminates that boil at temps lower then 100C would get cleared.   When should I boil water before distilling it? How can I know how long it should pre-boil in an open container?  "
2022,Compass compatibility: Can I use my US compass in Australia?,Background  I bought my compass in the US last year. Next week I'm going to travel to Australia.  Question   Is my US-compass compatible with Australia? or do I need a special compass? Do I need an adapter?  
2023,How effective is sulfur for delousing my camp?,Sulfur has been used for centuries to get ride of nasty little bugs that infest the warm places we like to sleep.  Assuming I have found natural sulfur sources can they be used to effectively and safely de-louse my camp?  If so what is the best way to do it?  
2024,How to empty bowels before a hike,"They say prevention is better than cure, so for beginner hikes, especially dayhikes, how can one try to ensure that their bowels are empty and they won't suddenly need to poo? Are there proven ways? Is taking medication and relying on it bad?  "
2025,What's a good time to see autumn colors in the Maritime and Cottian Alps?,"What is a good time of year to see autumn colours in the higher areas of the Maritime and Cottian Alps, in particular yellow larches such as in this photo¹?  I may have the opportunity to visit either 27 September – October 1, or October 7–11. Would I have a good chance to see autumn colours during either of these periods?    ¹Photo is taken further north than where I intend to go but illustrates the kind of colours I would like to see. "
2026,When ski mountaineering should I bring a whippet or ice axe?,"I've seen whippets while skiing and am thinking of taking one (or two?) on a 4 day tour in glacier terrain, but am confused as to their purpose. Do they replace ice axes or are used in conjunction with them? "
2027,Is it worth getting a divemaster certification if I don't plan to work as a professional dive master?,"I have been an avid diver for over a decade. Once upon a time, I wanted to get my divemaster certification in order to work (for a short time) as a divemaster. However, that ship has since sailed, but getting the certifications is still on my radar as something I'd like to do. I am a rather calm and comfortable diver, with over 200 logged dives in various conditions and locations around the world. I have my PADI Master Diver. I feel like the next step is to do the divemaster. But what would the purpose be if I won't ever work as a divemaster?  My reasons are:   Finishing what I started. As in, fulfilling that old goal Improving my safe diving skills such as navigation and situational awareness of (and for) those around me   Does having a divemaster cert make it easier to go out on dive on my own? (I mean with a buddy in a boat, not alone obviously) Are there costs associated with having a divemaster cert? Or necessary regularly upkeep?  Is there any reason why a non-professional diver should not have a divemaster cert? "
2028,"How do you pace yourself while doing strenuous hikes above 3,000 meters (10,000 feet)?","How do you know how fast or slow to go while hiking at elevation (say above 3000 meters) on an instant per instant basis? Elevation, weight carried, steepness, surface underfoot (e.g., trails, cross-country over granite, talus) all affect your energy levels, so it's not as simple as saying N feet and X miles in one hour.  How do I pace myself?  How do I know whether to push myself or to slow down or stop; I want to avoid ""hitting the wall"" or become so exhausted I can't go on.   "
2029,"""Official"" providers of topographic maps per country","If I want to go to some contry, with no specific region in mind yet, I often have trouble to get good topographical information for hiking beforehand.  I usually find it rather difficult to discover by quick Googling, especially if I don't speak the local language.  But in many countries, at least in Europe, there is some kind of official institution which publishes map data and/or series of detailed topographic maps covering the whole country (or most of it), suitable for outdoor purposes.  Often these instututions are related to surveying, cadastral registration, or the military.  What are these official institutions per country, and what do they provide? If there is no such institution, what is the de-facto standard map provider in that country (which means: (almost) full coverage, organized series, used by ""everyone and the alpine association"", etc.)?    This is a self-answered ""big list"" question, discussed here.  If you have something to add, please edit the CW answer.  Stick to the official institutions or their de-facto alternatives -- not just every publisher producing maps. "
2030,How to fish from a kayak?,"As a present I was recently given a Pelican Odyssey 100X. Before getting that I had fished using a neighbor's regular kayak.   Is fishing from the shore the same as fishing off of a kayak, and is kayak trolling a good way to fish?(Which lures are recommended for trolling?)   I would be fishing for bass/pickerel in a local pond.  Basically just trying to become a decent fisherman. "
2031,Is it possible for birds to develop mental problems?,"A buzzard seen nearby has been continuously attacking people for over a year now. As far as I know this isn't normal behaviour, especially not outside breeding season. Please correct me if I'm wrong. While not 100% sure this is the same animal it surely looks like it because it is always in the same place (let's say plus/minus 100m), the style of attacks is always the same (from behind, usually just flying over a person's head but sometimes effectively scratching them, sometimes severely), and simply because according to biologists I talked to such attacks are fairly rare and it would be exceptional if a whole bunch of them behaved like that.  Another story: years ago we had a male common blackbird in the garden which without any obvious reason started to produce it's alarm sound from sunrise to sunset, almost non-stop, without any evidence whatsoever of any danger (no predators to be seen, no humans, not a single of the many other birds of all kinds of species sounding alarmed). This lasted for about 2 weeks then it stopped for unknown reasons - one possibility being the bird died. In any case, this again isn't exactly standard behaviour. I've been around blackbirds my entire life but never have witnessed something like that.  So just like people can develop mental problems, both cases always led me to think those birds had mental problems. Would that be a feasible explanation? Or is that not regarded as a proper diagnostic for bird whereas it is for humans? Are there other known cases, possibly studies? Could the cause of such behaviour be genetic, a virus, bactaria, parasite perhaps? Or just some disfunction with hard to track cause (again, like for some humans)? "
2032,Could a steam juicer be used to desalinate water?,Could someone use a steam juicer to desalinate water? The juicer is used on a stovetop and the steam rises to the fruit in the top basket and the juice collects in the middle pot.  I think it might work but does anyone have any ideas?

2034,Biking from Whitehorse to Vancouver,"I'm planning to travel along the Alaskan highway this summer (end of June until mid July). I'm not an extremely experienced camper and have only once spent a night outside of a camping ground so far. My greatest bike ride so far was from Zürich to Bern (145km/90m) which I managed in a single day, so I expect to be able to do around 80-100 km each day. So I think I should be able to make it to Vancouver in less than a month. I've read a handful of blogs from people who did it, so the idea isn't quite as outlandish as it first seemed. I'm mostly looking for information about camping spots, emergency situations, necessary equipment, further sources of information and just general tips and tricks. Here's what I've planned so far:  1 CHF = 0.98 USD   Fly from Basel to Whitehorse and from Vancouver to Basel - totaling at around 1500CHF (including bike). I plan to spend around 1000CHF for the entire trip (25k total). I have a city/mountain bike hybrid that is made to be easy to fix. I plan to carry around 3-4kg in a backpack and maybe 4-5 in saddlebags. I think I'll only pack as much food as necessary and stock up along the way.  I should be able to reach some form of settlement every 2 days. I speak fluent English and some French. The Temperatures seam pretty bearable at 11° degrees in July. I'm going to be alone. I'm planning to sleep in a tent most of the times. I'll probably stay as close to the road as possible.   Here're some of the stuff I am worried about:   Is there a better Forum for trips like this? Wild animals (bears, buffaloes, elk), which precautions are necessary? Are they known to attack unprotected travelers? Do they keep off the road? Are the prices somewhat reasonable? In Switzerland you get robbed along the highways. Is the road kept in shape for bikers? Do I have to watch out for reckless drivers? Is there a danger of highway robbery? How quick do emergency services respond? Is camping along the highway even legal? Alternatively, are there enough camping grounds? Online research has been inconclusive. Is it even safe to travel alone, or should I look for a friend to join me? Is there cellphone coverage up there? Is there a way to get Internet? These are just some of the worries of the top of my head, I'm sure there are more.   So are there people who have done similar things? I'd love to get in contact. Where should I look for more Information? I'm mainly looking for the exercise and some scenery. Canada seams to most suited for this, but if there are other places for a novice I'm open for suggestions. "
2035,"Fish aren't biting, how to get more bites?","I live in Miami, Florida. I have been attempting to catch fish in a canal near where I live with a light rod, 8lb test mono line, and size 6 and 8 hooks. I have primarily been using night crawlers as bait but have also tried several jigs and crankbaits. When fishing worms I use a float about 1.5 - 3 feet above the hook with enough split shot to make the float vertical in the water.   If I drop my line near the edge I can usually get baby Mayan Cichlids to bite. Other than that though I have not had any luck, not even bites no matter where I cast or what time of day I go. I have seen schools of fish swim right by my bait without even attempting a bite. Sometimes when I am bringing my line in as it drags across the surface of the water a baby Florida garr will chase it and attempt to eat my  worm but other than that I have not had any action.  One rare time I casted into the opening of a boat shed and almost as soon as the bait hit the water an adult Mayan Cichlid took it. This was a rare and singular event.  But all that to say, what am I doing wrong? Could my 8lb line be spooking fish or do some fish not have any interest in worms? Maybe using a float is not an effective way to target fish that hang out near the bottom? I know it is hard to say if you are not actually there to see it yourself but I am hoping for some general tips for this type of situation from seasoned anglers. I want to catch some fish that are bigger than the palm of my hands! "
2036,Can microspikes replace crampons when crossing ice in summer?,When hiking in early summer I often come across patches of old snow. Till now I have managed to cross those by cutting my steps in the snow or walking around. And whenever I had my hiking sticks with me I was really happy. I believe microspikes could be of great aid in those situations as well.   Something like that:    Would they also be useful on ice in summer? I mean small ice fields or non-serious glaciers. Are they in any way comparable to crampons? Do people in general walk on glaciers wearing microspikes?  
2037,How to deal with keeping a first aid kit inside a hot car?,"Excluding parking the car in the shade or carrying the kit in person, what are some solutions to handle emergency car kits in the heat?  I am aware medications, ointments, creams, adhesives are the ones to worry about, but I'd like to ask for any experiences and suggestions.  Other details that also came to mind:   How often to rotate in these conditions? What is the best material for storage or even as ""extra layers""?  (e.g., a thick bag, container or cooler)  Where is the best place to store? In the car's interiors like the glove compartment or underneath the seats? Or in the trunk? (I've read different opinions about the car trunk being the hottest/coolest area.)   I live in Southern California so the temperatures can get pretty record-breaking, particularly in the summer. I recently started volunteering at my local park and trails so I've been very curious for answers to better educate and prepare myself. "
2038,What kind of mittens is Les Stroud wearing?,What kind of mittens is Les Stroud wearing? Is there a name for them? I'm interested to find out about them and what it costs for a pair.  
2039,Hot water system as a heater for car camping?,"For car camping near the snow line, is there anything that can safely be used as a heater while sleeping?  For example, how large would ordinary hot water bottles need to be, to comfortably emit heat for the entire night?  It seems like electric heaters are unfeasible unless there is mains power available (as even a truck battery would struggle to run a space heater for a quarter of an hour), and gas heaters are obviously unwise inside a sleeping space (due to exhaust).   Has anyone tried using a portable gas hot water system (located outside), to circulate hot water to some kind of radiator inside the sleeping space?  "
2040,Wild animal in Virginia that sounds like monkey cackling/laughing?,I'm here hunting turkey in Virginia and I keep hearing unidentifiable sounds that I'm pretty sure are not turkey.  One of the most common one is something like a monkey (chimp) cackling/laughing. It's usually 16 equally pitched notes in a 4/4 beat: ka-ka-ka-ka times 4. It's probably a bird.  Do you know what animal this could be? Can you provide links to examples of the sound? 
2041,What are the major difference between a regular sleeping bag and one designed for women?,I see more and more sleeping bags designed for women.  I was wondering what were the major differences with the regular sleeping bag?  Does it have to do more with the shape or insulation? 
2042,Dealing with rashes between thighs and around the groin,"This, I believe, most of outdoor people once in a while do have to deal with: Rashes between thighs, around the groin. This may really screw the entire trip and make it annoyingly miserable to walk any further.  The best that I thought I can do to avoid them is, applying coconut oil before starting. But when I trek through waterfalls or cross streams, this habit doesn't work. And, after that when I sustain such rashes, there is hardly anything that I can do.  Still, what can be done? What should be done to avoid them? And, what I can do to suffer less anyway if I sustain that thing?  "
2043,Who places the anchors that rock climbers use?,"I've always wondered about the permanent ""hooks"" (it seems the proper term for them is ""anchors"" — pitons, bolts, etc.) that are placed in the some rock climbing routes to help climbers. Since they're fixed in the rock and used by everyone, I wonder, who is responsible to put them there and make sure they're secure? Are there regulations that need to be followed when placing them, e.g. minimum distance, stress tests, etc?  While searching around for this, I found three Wikipedia articles (First ascent, Sport climbing and Aid climbing) which contain some related information, but don't directly answer the question. I expected the Climbing route article to also provide some information, but most of it is about the naming of the routes, rather than how their anchors (if any) are placed. "
2044,How to find new poles for old tent?,"I have a nice and small tent I really like that is around 30 years old.  It is from Sierra West, but I don't remember the model name.  Here is a picture so that you can see the size and general construction:    This tent is held up with two bows of fiberglass rods that fit into each other.  A small bow of 4 rods makes the arch at the foot end, and 6 rods are used at the head end.  Unfortunately, one of the rods has just broken:    The rod is 14 inches long, the fiberglass part is 6.5 mm in diameter, and the outer diameter of the aluminum piece is 9.5 mm.  The fiberglass is cracked near the aluminum sleave, and it is rough with fibers sticking out at the right end where it fits into the aluminum sleave of the next piece.  The problem is, the company that made this tent seems to have vanished and I don't know how to get replacement rods.  I'd like to get a complete set of rods, since if this one went the others are probably not far behind.  There seem to be aluminum rods available with bungy cord in the middle, but finding a set that is exactly the length this tent requires seems to be impossible.  Anyone know how to get parts for this old tent, or have any other ideas?  Added:  Yes, it's easy to find generic replacement tent poles, but the ones I have seen are all quite different from what my tent uses.  This is a particularly small tent and the radius of curvature is significantly smaller than other tents.  This means the thicker poles that are easy to find would be stressed much more.  Mine are only 6.5 mm diameter, probably for a good reason.  The replacement poles are also much longer than mine.  I suppose the long poles could be cut down, but cutting fiberglass is tricky and can easily damage the material if the right tools aren't used, which I probably don't have since I don't know exactly what the right tool would be.  I am imagining just cutting with a saw would fray the fibers, which is basically cracking the fiberglass, which can't be a good thing.  Another issue is that the pole ends need to fit into the grommets on my tent.  I rather doubt there is such a thing as a standard grommet diameter.  This is not as easy as just Googling for ""tent pole replacement"".  Surely someone here has been thru this process before and has some words of wisdom?  Added 2:  This is in response to a comment asking for more details of the rods.  The grommets that the end of the tent poles fit into are just circular metal disks with holes in them.  I don't have the tent here, but the inner diameter of these holes is a little larger than the diameter of the tent poles, which is 6.5 mm.  The picture shows a middle piece, but the end pieces have black plastic end caps, with the tips of those being about the same diameter as the fiberglass rod (6.5 mm).  The fiberglass rods are solid, so have no inner diameter.   "
2045,How to deal with hail outdoors without special equipment?,"Today on the short geocaching trip I've barely escaped hail storm. It wasn't very long, but I was without any special equipment. Light umbrella would survive a few minutes, and my jacket would provide a limited protection from water for a short period of time.   What are the strategies to deal with such situations? Look for the protection of big tree (yes, I know, thunders, but staying on open ground is not a good idea either)? Search a thick bush? Improvise some umbrella from sticks and leaves? "
2046,Are there 1-person 4-season tents?,"I'll be camping in Scandinavia during the winter, but I can't find any 1-person 4-season tents on REI or similar sites. Do these things exist?  Could it be that I can't find them because it's highly advised against? (Yikes!) "
2047,Is it safe to drink hot water? How hot can it be?,"Many mountain hikers recommend drinking hot fluids, because they provide a lot of energy. According to the discussion ""Does eating snow help dehydration?"", the actual calorie gain is minimal, however there are calories available practically immediately.  However, how hot can water/fluid be to be able to safely drink it (how many degrees)? Too hot water would burn your lips, but if the water is not hot enough to burn the lips, is it safe to swallow? Does the large amount of hot fluid in the stomach pose any threat to the body, or I can assume that anything I can swallow without getting burned is safe for me? "
2048,Will using a sleeping bag stop the body from adapting to cold?,"The sleeping bag (at least as I've understood it) works in that way, that it uses the heat the body creates to create a layer of heat air between the body and the sleeping bag's border, therefore providing pleasurable feeling of warmth.  But after watching some videos about people such as Wim Hof and scientific research on their body's behaviour, I've found that something quite opposite is taking place there. Their skin is getting very cold, while the body core remains hot. So, there's no pleasurable feeling of warmth, there's no warm air layer, the skin is feeling trembling cold, and the body protects itself from cold isolating the skin from the body core, therefore using skin as isolating layer.  So, when using sleeping bag, the body is not trained to develop such mechanism, because the skin has always contact with warm air, am I getting it right? So, actually, isn't using sleeping bags stopping the body from real accommodation to cold conditions? "
2049,"Is cold shock response a real danger, if someone is used to cold water?","Various sources (mostly TV stations, at least in my region) are constantly warning about the danger of cold shock response, if someone goes to water too quickly.   But on the other hand, Bear Grylls is famous for not passing any occasion of jumping naked into ice-cold water. The sudden heat loss by swimming in such cold water (near 0 degree) must be immensely greater that when you go from heat air into c.a 20 degree water in summer. And I've never heard of him having cold shock response.  So, is the cold shock response a real danger for someone used to cold water? Or it's just a problem for people who never take cold showers and swim only in summer? Or it's just an urban myth, popularized by media in cucumber season? "
2050,Chasing with mosquitoes,"Mosquitoes are the one of the most disliked petspest, but they don't seem to take it to heart.   When I go fast through their territory, they seem to have problem with biting me (but if there are enough of them, they manage to do it), but they are circling around me and bite with joined force when I stop. Sometimes after I have to run a bit to get rid of them, but some are still chasing me.   I wonder if there are tests made, to check, what speed is necessary to:   Make it hard/impossible for mosquito to bite? Are the fast hand/leg movement more important factor than the core speed? To leave mosquitoes behind, assuming they are willing to pursue you (if you go from shadows into full sun, they probably aren't)?  "
2051,Will the benefit of an axe outweigh the drawbacks and win over a large knife?,"I've hiked some in my life, and gotten used to carrying a small axe for chopping wood for the fire. But after I bought my self a large fixed-blade bowie knife, I find myself relying less and less on the axe for chopping since the knife very much acts like a small axe.  So my pickle is, now that my axe is left in the dust by a more versatile tool(?), would it make sense to completly remove it from my pack list? Or are there more benefits to a small axe that I can't see?  Perhaps it is better to carry a small axe and a normal-sized fixed-blade knife instead of the pretty large bowie knife?  "
2052,What can I use an old tent for?,"Similar to the question about old ropes.   I have an old plastic tent. It is for 3 persons, but is heavy and now not waterproof anymore, with some damage to the small room around the door.  How can I use it in its end-of-life?  I have an idea to carry it to some place that I go often enough, pitch it there with all the windproof stakes and leave it there. Is this a good idea? "
2053,Clarification need on layering principle for head in wet/rainy conditions,"I've researched extensively and yet I'm still not sure what to do for rainy/freezing temperatures.  If I don't want to bring a beanie, how do I apply the layering principle to my head? Is it enough that only my hard shell has a hood or should I obtain an insulating or at least a mid layer that has a hood?  "
2054,Fly fishing rig knots,"I have been fly fishing with my dad for a number of years but recently I went on my own and hit quite the stumbling block... I didn't know how to set the kit properly, normally I drive the boat while my dad sets up the rods, and as much as I try to watch what he is doing I also have to not crash the boat. The main issue I had was setting up the line.   I have a reel which has a loop on the end of the fly line (floating line) and I was unsure how to connect that to a leader, and the leader to the tippet. I already know how to attach the fly to the tippet (I use a tucked blood knot).   What I would like to know is:   How do I attach a leader line to a fly line that has a looped end? (What knot do I use?)  How do I attach the leader line to the tippet line? (What knot do I use?) How long should the leader and tippet lines be?  How strong should the tippet and leader lines be?    I am targeting 0.5-2 kilo brown trout in natural rivers &amp; lakes, trout have good sight &amp; the water is very clear in the Swedish mountains so I like to keep it as thin &amp; hard to see as possible. Likewise the knots should be neat and small, in my experience big lumpy knots will deter the fish &amp; make casting more problematic. "
2055,How dangerous is it to fall 3 meters when lead climbing?,"Consider a vertical rock with clip-ins 3 meters apart, dynamic rope, no more than 15 meters ascent.  I guess most probable and dangerous is to fall just as one is clipping in. This way the rope is overextended, plus one i holding with only one hand.  How dangerous is it for a for a beginner climber to fall? What protection equipment should be used. What training exercises should be completed beforehand? "
2056,"What is the longest time you can go, eating only freeze-dried food?","As a former member of the Swedish home guard youth, I was told during a survival exercise that you could eat only freeze-dried food for about two weeks. Young and green as I was, I swallowed the statement without any further thought.   I have come to discover that this statement was not all truth. The recommendation is given by the Swedish military to make sure that soldiers don't go too long without varying their meals. Since the MREs (meals ready to eat) you are getting at the army is somewhat limited in variation, they also recommend that you try to eat plenty of fibre alongside your allotted food rations.  Deciding to test this out by myself I bought the approved MRE (aka. Grönpåsen) for full two weeks. After about a week of nothing but freeze-dried, I felt pretty normal in forms of physical strength and nothing stood out. Aside from the fact that I went to the bathroom about three times in that week, it didn't feel like anything was wrong.  After the full two weeks, I felt that nothing had changed, except the regularity of my bathroom visits (and the fact that I was getting pretty bored with the food). I should probably have ate something rich in fibre on the side to alleviate the lack of it in my diet. This I discovered when I returned to eating normal food, let's just say that I was struck by ""Montezuma's revenge"" a couple of hours after my first ""normal"" meal.  So my question is as follows:  What is the maximum time one could live on freeze-dried food and keep a healthy level of nutrients and minerals? Also, how would this diet affect the digestion?  "
2057,Are water purification tablets safe?,"There are a few questions regarding safety of water purification, one regarding expiration date, another regarding iodine, but I know that there are more than one types of water purficiation tablets.  If I am using a water-pump filter. Is it necessary to combine this with a water purification tablet? Katadyn, a water filter company, suggests doing so.  However, this makes me question the safety of putting such chemicals into my drinking water. In general, is it best to just avoid it? Or are there any water purification tablets that are proven safe? "
2058,Are trekking poles proven to be helpful?,"I covered quite a lot of ground, but approaching 36 my knees are starting to give me troubles. Should I expect trekking poles to restore my previous stamina and walking durability? Or are they just fancy status symbols? :) "
2059,How can I ignite coal on a grill device without using kindling?,"Today I tried to ignite coal on a grill device, without using kindling (we ran out of it). I gathered a lot of small twigs and a bit of medium ones. I managed to set all this on fire, but the coals didn't ignite, and it was extinguished soon after the twigs were out.   I've observed my grandmother putting coals into the fire in the oven, but after twigs, she put blocks of wood into the fire, so the temperature was quite high. It's not applicable on a grill device.  Are there any special techniques of putting coal into the fire with the campfire of limited size, such as those on a grill device? Is it possible to achieve the temperature with such a small fire? "
2060,Orienteering skill organized trainings in Germany?,"Are there any schoolings/trainings for orienteering skills in Germany?  I hike during weekends, but mostly using GPS (geocaching) or using trails, so there's not much opportunity to fully train orienteering skills. Orienteering runs are not for me, because I'm hiker, not runner. Rogaining is too extreme.  In Poland, I was using opportunities such as trainings organized by student's outdoor organizations, or on orienteering marches, where individuals had to navigate to the selected points using the maps such as that:    I think that what I'm looking for is at most similar to pathfinding or some military marches done in woodlands.  Are there any similar options to train orienteering skills in Germany? For example, student organizations or orienteering/outdoor schools? I was trying to find something like that, but without success. "
2061,What is the Leave No Trace way to dispose of coffee grounds?,"If one makes coffee in the backcountry, there will be used grounds. Coffee grounds are biodegradable, but should one instead pack them out completely?  What is the Leave No Trace way to deal with used coffee grounds in the backcountry? "
2062,Ultra-light camping setup for solo-backping in the Uintas,"I am considering a solo three-day trip in the Uinta Mountains in Utah in August. I have lots of experience backpacking but I've never soloed before and so am thinking of ways to shed some weight. My tent especially could be an issue; I have a mountain hardwear lightwedge 3-person tent.   I'm wondering if I could leave the tent body behind and just plan on the groundcloth / rainfly fast setup. I realize this will make me marginally more vulnerable to windy rainstorms and critters, but it'll cut out a lot of weight. Is there something else I need to consider? Should I roll the dice with ticks / mosquitoes and the weather? "
2063,What is the strongest knot using a steel-thimble to make a steel-eyelet at the end of the line?,"(to be clear, I know I can just check knot-strengths for a general end-of-line attachment, it's the inclusion of the steel thimble - I'll find a link to add to end of post - it's that inclusion that makes me think that the type of knot becomes critical, if the knot capsized over the thimble it'd be catastrophic!  Part of me fears that these things are not safe for use AT ALL with rope, only with steel line, in which case they're deskweights for me....but they DO make rope-OK thimbles so I just don't know if these are OK to use and, if so, what knot I should be using) And would there be any reason to use a different knot at the end-of-a-line where you're connecting a steel O-Ring?  I'll be cutting pieces of 11.7mm climbing rope to make things and the ends need to be strong so I got 1/2"" steel thimbles so I can have steel ""eyelets"" at the ends of these lines, the problem is that all I know is that I can't use cinch knots, past that I know any fixed-knot will work but what I need to know is which is the strongest, or at least one of the top couple strongest?  (Anchor bend? Clove hitch? Nilsson knot? Figure 8? Figure 8 on a bight maybe, because then you could ""count the line twice""?)  I know there's a specific/exact/objective answer to this and ""a fixed knot"" isn't useful, these ropes are being made for tree climbing where failure would be disastrous (should go w/o saying but, no, I am not going to be using such knots in a life-critical situation an hour after learning them, I just don't know what knot to make my ""go to"" when I'm cutting sections of rope to affix carabiners, o-rings etc to for making false-crotches / lanyards / etc)  I got the heavy duty, 1/2"" thimbles / the largest ones found on the bartlettman webpage, they are thick/heavy steel.

2064,How much vegetation is represented by the green on USGS 7.5 minute topo maps?,"On official USGS topo maps, vegetation is represented by green, and non vegetation by white as you can see below.    How much vegetation does an area need to be colored green? Are short bushes enough or does it require trees? "
2065,"What temperature rating of sleeping bag, season of tent and R value of a pad are needed for autumn camping in Norway?","I'm currently planning a trekking trip in the north of Norway in September/early October.  Because most of my current gear is way to heavy or only for hot weather I'm buying a new set of camping equipment.    The gear I'm currently planning to buy is:   Terra Hiker down-feather sleeping bag rated for an optimal temperature of 0°C (32°F) Naturhike Cloud-up 2 (upgraded), which is a 3-4 season tent (and I assume it would handle cold wind well as there is a version with a snow skirt) Some cheap inflatable sleeping pad with an estimated R-value of about 1,3 (extrapolated from similar products which list the R-value)     My question now is if the products listed above will comfortably keep me warm during the autumn weather of northern Norway.    The weather statistic for Tromsø would indicate that I will encounter temperatures from about 15°C to -5°C (59°F to 23°F).     Aspects to take into consideration when answering or suggesting other gear:   I'm limited by my budget (student) I do not want ""throw-away"" gear which won't last more than one trip It's an 8-14 day trip weight is important  "
2066,Using roof rails to set up hammock,"Has anyone experience with attaching a hammock to roof rails of a regular car?  I just bought a hammock for my next camping trip. I will be traveling mostly by car and sleep in a tent but wanted something to relax in outside of the tent or car and also might try sleeping in the hammock.  My question is: Is it possible (i.e. safe for both, me and the car) to attach one side of the hammock to the roof rails of the car? This might make a lot of places hammock-feasible, as I‘d only need one additional tree.   I am pretty sure that I have already seen auch a set-up with a Jeep-like car somewhere. But the car in question is an Opel Astra with normal roof rails so I fear that the rails might not withstand the sideward pull a hammock would cause on them. Since it is a borrowed car from a family member, I really do not want to damage it.   Any advice? "
2067,Blizzard Chaser: What to take on a 5-hour Blizzard Hike?,"Thank you for taking the time to read through this !  I just noticed there is a chance of Blizzard (Winter Storm Jonas) in our region (NY/NJ) and I would like to take this unique opportunity and go for a short (5 hours) fun winter hike.  While current predictions (as of Thursday night) only hint at a so-called Hot Blizzard (e.g. temperatures around -5 Celsius), the windchill has a way of sucking out the warmth, so I'd like to run the plan by the local experts here and get some critique.  Here's the plan:   Bottom Layers: Based on experience with the Chicago blizzard, I will now take second pants (I only had one pants on me and after 2.5 hrs my legs were quite cold) Boots: My new boots were proven in my 16-hour snow hike few months ago, so I take it they should be more than adequate for just 5 hours Top Layers: Two regular T-shirts + long-sleeve thin shirt + long-sleeve thick shirt + wool sleeve-less vest (very warm with inner warm layer) + waterproof windbreaker jacket 2 Gloves + Scarf + Skiing Cap Glasses (eyes tend to water a lot, the older I get)   This is what I want to have on me (in case I loose the backpack to wind):   2 small vodka shots for the instant energy boost (practically zero weight, yet pack an incredible punch, proven to override fatigue and give you the 'kick' - even when you run out of adrenaline) 2 pairs of reserve gloves (it's very easy to loose them in the wind) 1 reserve cap cell phone compass   This is what I want to put into backpack:   6-8 liters of water : I love to walk against the blizzard, which takes a huge amount of energy, especially a lot of water - I'm pretty sure I'll have to consume over 1 liter per hour reserve gloves/cap survival kit   I've hauled an enormous amount of food with me up the snowy mountain 10 weeks ago, but did not consume anything during the 16 hour hike. Not even the Snickers bar, let alone bananas or the sandwiches I had. So, I'm thinking I probably should not carry any food for 5 hours (as the hunger would be the least of my worries, should I get stranded), correct ?  While I'm not a complete beginner, there is always room to improve - here are my prior experiences with blizzards:   few years ago I did a 2.5 hour hike in what was deemed 3rd worst blizzard in Chicago history, but it wasn't really that bad. I'd like to double that to 5 hours now. my whole childhood, we never had a 'snow day' just because of blizzard, so we got used to walking to school in blizzard conditions since early age I believe the coldest blizzard for me was -27 Celsius (only god knows the windchill), and I had to wait 1.5 hr for the bus (at that time I did not know I was actually slowly freezing on that bus stop :-) ) and then walk to school another hour against the wind (actually, it was painful, legs refusing to move).   Would you recommend adjusting the layers or taking additional items with me ?  "
2068,Is there any way to dispose of liquid fuel?,"So that's the case - I have a camp stove and a bottle of liquid fuel for it (gas? benzine? petrol? ah, whatever). Hike is over and I have to get on a plane - thus I have to get rid of this fuel. How do I do it? Or maybe there's no way to do it right and I've got myself a problem? "
2069,Adjustable cross-country-skiing poles vs trekking poles,"Are there any features to regular trekking poles that adjustable cross-country ski poles do not have? I know that many people use trekking poles for snowshoeing but are there any reason adjustable cross-country ski poles won't suffice for either snowshoeing or trekking?  RELATED:  Should I get trekking poles for snowshoeing, or stick with ski poles?  Note: The above question doesn't mention adjustable poles "
2070,Backcountry Skiing Bindings compatible with soft boots,"I love downhill and cross country skiing and am getting into back country skiing. Cross country boots are great for comfort because they're soft. Downhill boots are great for turning in part because the heel attaches to the ski.  My question is: can you get the best of both worlds. Can you get soft or semi-soft boots which attach to the ski on the heel when going downhill, but allow the heel to float when going on the flat or up hill? This is how Alpine Touring bindings work, but I've only ever seen those with hard plastic boots. Is there a way to make Alpine Touring bindings work with softer boots? "
2071,How do I get my fingers and toes warm before rock climbing at cold temperatures?,"I've had now a couple of days when going rock climbing while the temperatures are below the general comfort zone (meaning below 6 °C/ 43 °F).  When starting to climb, my fingers got cold rather fast until the point when I only felt pain and lost the feeling completly. So I fell off the wall. Luckyly after that, warm blood came back to my fingers and they were warm enough to climb on for a long time.   But here comes the next problem: my climbing shoes are really tight and on my 2nd go with warm fingers I eventually start losing the feeling in my toes, because they are so cold until I eventually slid off. So I put off the shoes and warmed up my feet a little (with the hands) until also here the feeling returned (warm blood came back) and I could finally climb properly.  Has someone got any tips on how to get the warm blood in my fingers and toes before going in the 1st route? I hope there is a method of minimal pain ;-)  One thing I tried, was to circle my arm pretty fast so that blood is forced by centrifugal force in the fingers, but that didn't really do the job (worked only for a moment). A friend of mine told me this method is not useful since the body has to give the signal of sending warm blood itself, otherwise the effect won't last long enough, as I also experienced. So should I do a warm-up exercises like sprinting around, doing push-ups etc.?  Does anyone know how the pros are doing it? When I see Adam Ondra or so on Youtube bouldering or climbing hard routes near or below zero degrees (0 °C), I always wonder how they warm up and avoid the mentioned problems?  Cheers "
2072,Any swim goggles that may be beneficial for a surfer?,"I took a surf lesson and got the following:    Splash/ sand in the eye in an abrasive way that put me out for 20 minutes and was bothering me for few more days Bright tropical sun  Pros / cons of having them on for water protection vs visibility?

2073,Why do Sandpipers sometimes hop on one leg?,"While walking on the beach in Monterey, I have noticed several Sandpipers that I at first thought had lost a leg; they hop along on the one, eliciting pity from naive onlookers.  Then, though, they stretch their other leg back down and begin walking as normal.  Why do they do this? Are they resting the leg they retracted? Are they playing a joke on us gullible humans? Are they feigning being one-legged for some other reason? "
2074,Why do Sandpipers show off their catch?,"I noticed a couple of Sandpipers today who, after extracting a larger-than-normal morsel from the sand under the receding waves, ""strutted their stuff"" and dropped the morsel they had discovered for all surrounding Sandpipers to see, and then immediately snatched it up again.  The dropping of the catch did not seem an act of clumsiness, but a very deliberate ""Look what I got!""  My impression was that they were proud of themselves and showing their flockmates what good hunter-gatherers they are.  Am I right? Is this a way for a male to show off what a good provider he would be? Or is it just the equivalent of a baboon beating his breast or a football player spiking the ball after scoring a touchdown, or is there some other reason for this behavior? "
2075,Is it ever necessary to double up locking carabiners?,"I see people doing this a lot:    My question is: Why?   When is it necessary to double up locking carabiners? Ever? Doubling up non-locking carabiners with opposite and opposing gates was, and still is a safe practice, but locking carabiners were an innovation invented to provide the same security, but eliminate the necessity of using two carabiners. Yet, there are people doubling up locking carabiners, as if they didn't have locks on them at all, and recommending it as best-practice. I support the notion that there is no such thing as overkill, but, if you're using a 25kN biner with a triple action gate, you are going to be plenty safe top-roping or using the biner to tie-in to your harness. So why are so many people strict on the practice of doubling up on lockers? "
2076,What are the advantages of a vapour barrier?,"I was recently reading an article on UKClimbing by Andy Kirkpatrick about clothing in winter. It talks about vapour barriers:     I’ve played around with vapour barrier socks over many years, and   think just having a cheap thin shopping bag next to your skin, then a   good sock over the top, is a no brainer on any super cold, or extended   routes.  Having it next to your skin means you don’t end up with   stinking liner socks, and you also have a little more friction between   the layers when front pointing.  You really get the advantages from a   vapour barrier system when your day becomes extended, say that 12 hour   winter route on the Tacul draws on to a 24 hour epic, where saturated   socks suck the heat out of your feet with the combination of nighttime   temperatures and fatigue.   I don't really get this, I would of thought that keeping moisture next to your skin would be a bad thing.   What's the thinking behind this? When should they be used? "
2077,How do I know when my snowboard edges need to be serviced?,"I haven't serviced my snowboard for a couple of years but then again I haven't used it much in that time unfortunately either.  I went a couple of days ago and did fine, did double black diamonds with moguls and it went well.    My ride notwithstanding, how do I know when my board needs to have the edges sharpened?  What are some of guidelines? "
2078,What should I do if I get sprayed by a skunk?,"There are times when I just barely miss getting sprayed by a skunk (there are a lot of them in my area). I haven't actually gotten directly sprayed, but I would like to be ready in case that happens. I hear that taking a bath in tomato soup helps, but don't want to waste all that food if I can help it (especially if it doesn't work).   If I have quick access to civilization, what's my best route of action? If I'm out in the middle of nowhere, how can I make it tolerable while I finish/abort my mission, and return to civilization?

2080,Which wildlife is it legal to hunt in the UK?,"Does someone have a list or a link of exactly which UK wildlife it is legal to hunt &amp; safe (&amp; tasty) to eat? For example, are rabbits safe to eat, or is myxomatosis still a problem?  Background: I'm a reasonable shot with a shotgun on a clay pigeon shoot, and am prepared to train in order to learn to take wild game cleanly &amp; safely. I'm only really interested in genuine wild animals, not pheasant shooting or the like, and I'm aware that I'll need a shotgun licence and a suitable gun cabinet. "
2081,Why should I carry a snow anchor?,"I regularly see online that on expeditions snow anchors are strapped to the side of the backpacks. This is typically an item like the upper on following pic:    I never saw this in the Alps by myself. But I also saw it in this video where he shows his stuff for alpine multi day trips. I learned to build a deadman (snow anchor) with my ice axe. For more technical routes I have 2 axes and it's said that you could even use nearly anything to build a reliable anchor (poles, backpack, gloves and even a lighter).   So what is the point in carrying this additional item? What are differences in using this snow anchor compared to using my ice axe? And what are the differences in the items seen on the pic? How does the actual activity/tour makes a difference what to choose?  "
2082,Reliability of snow bollards,I just discovered there is a way to rapell (e.g. for crevasse rescue) without any equipment building a snow bollard:     How is this done in the best possible manner? What do I have to look for in terms of (snow) conditions? How can I check the reliability of my construction?   I don't know if anybody uses this to rapell without backup (e.g. on top of a climb). But if so I would like to have some idea how secure this setup will be. 
2083,What is the point of belay glasses?,"I was going through the REI website for some of the products and I stumbled upon this one here.  It's called Y &amp; Y VERTICAL Classic Belay Glasses  The product punchline says:     Stop wrenching your neck to keep an eye on your climber. The Y &amp; Y Vertical Classic Belay Glasses feature metal frames and high-quality prisms that allow you to look straight ahead while belaying.   Have anybody used this one? What purpose does this product serve? How is this supposed to work?  I agree that I can read the user manual and get on with it, but I'd prefer get a word from someone with a hands-on experience with it. "
2084,Can you attach a non-load bearing hip/waist belt to an existing bag?,"Is there a way to upgrade a bag to have hip belts?  If so what should I look for in identifying a good product to fill this niche?  Something like this but a hip belt  I would prefer not to have to sew, but this does not have to bear any weight, so I'm hoping that is not an issue. My main concern is to be able to clip easy-access storage onto the new belt. "
2085,Is pouring boiling water into a plastic Nalgene bad for you?,"I've heard that pouring boiling water into a Nalgene-style bottle is either completely fine or definitely going to kill you. Which is it?  Are there any scientific studies demonstrating exactly what happens when you pour boiling water directly into a Nalgene, and how bad this could be for a person?  Let's assume we're talking about a sturdy BPA-free plastic Nalgene-style bottle (not necessarily that brand), available today from outdoor retailers designed for (amongst other things) outdoor sports. You fill it with boiling water (from a stream, snow, faucet), then close the bottle to let it cool. You will drink the water later once it's drinking temperature. "
2086,How to permanently label Nalgene bottles?,"It's pretty common to use 1 oz Nalgene bottles to hold the spices in a spice kit for backpacking as they are waterproof and the right size.    Image Source  The problem comes when trying to label the bottles, as permanent markers or even cow id tag markers will rub off.  Best solution I know of is to wrap the bottles with masking tape and then write on that but the problem is that once it gets wet the tape comes off.  Is there a better solution for permanently labeling these? "
2087,How dangerous is it to rummage the ground in the mountains of Nevada desert with venomous creatures out there?,"I made plans to do some hiking in the mountains of Nevada this weekend. I'll have someone there nearby and a hospital is an hour drive away. We thought it would be fun to uncover rocks and even dig the soil to try and see if we can get lucky finding gold nuggets.  But now I'm really starting to wonder, how dangerous is this?  Venomous snakes, scorpions, spiders, and lizards seem to be of most concern. With many thousands getting bit by these venomous creatures each year in the US. And then there's also the unlikely event of a bobcat, wolf or coyote attack.  In the event of something like this happening, the hospitals could end up billing me tens of thousands of dollars. And my insurance likely won't cover this. The hospital bills could either bankrupt me or destroy my credit for years.  Am I being overly cautious to worry about this, or is this something that could potentially happen?   What would you guess the probability is of being bitten or attacked in the Nevada desert for every 1 hour of walking around a mountain, uncovering rocks and digging in the soil? "
2088,Why is a Reverso not useful when belaying a first that's crossing a Bergschrund?,"I started reading Petzl's tech tips for mountaineering. While on the section for Crossing a Bergschrund, specifically in the part for Belaying a leader we have the following warning:     Warning: the leader will fall below his belayer without a directional anchor. VERSO and REVERSO cannot be used in this case. The second can belay from his harness with a Munter hitch or using a body belay.   Granted... mountaineering is not really my thing, but I'm still curious:  Why would belay devices like the Verso and Reverso useless in this scenario? "
2089,How can I guess if an outdoor expanse contains flammable gas?,"As someone who frequents valleys, I was unhinged to learn of Dax Cowart's calamity beneath.    What types of alfresco terrain ought I most beware?  It obviously can happen only in small hollows in the land (that I'll call dale), but how small?   Please see the titled question. I know that propane is denser than air.       In July 1973, Cowart, then a pilot in the Air Force reserve, and his father were visiting a tract of land that his father was thinking of purchasing. The land lay in a small valley and, unbeknownst to the Cowarts, a gas leak had caused the valley to become filled with propane gas. After surveying the land, the Cowarts returned to their car, and the sparking of the ignition set the gas on the floor of the valley ablaze, severely burning both men. According to Cowart, ""I was burned so severely and in so much pain that I did not want to live even in the early moments following the explosion. A man who heard my shouts for help came running down the road, I asked him for a gun."" He said, ""Why?"" I said, ""Can't you see I am a dead man? I am going to die anyway. I need to put myself out of this misery."" In a very kind and compassionate caring way, he said, ""I can't do that.""    Afterword: I learned of this on p. 63 of Better Never to Have Been (2008 1 edn). "
2090,Is there any statistical evidence that hunting reduces the likelihood of mountain lion attacks?,"There has been some discussion on this question about whether or not hunting would increase or decrease the likelihood of a mountain lion attack. I have seen some websites saying that it does not, but I am skeptical of their objectivity.  Have there been any reputable studies done on this? Or at least non-biased? As in not done by either hunting organizations or organizations who consider almost all hunting to be bad?  I do realize that the number of attacks is fairly low, but as this is can be a rather controversial subject, I would like to know if any research has been done on it? "
2091,How to safely heat a enclosed tent with electricity,"How should I heat that tent? Is heating It with a heater okay? Are there any safe devices designed for electric heating?  Is it safe to heat a tent 24 hours? Do you recommend heating while sleep, or should I turn off before sleep. Are there any safe devices provides 24 hours heat?  Can I heat with this types of stuff or not.   "
2092,How to protect a body in the wilderness?,"I am hiking in the wilderness, a round trip to civilization and back is at least 24 hours.   I know where I am and I can return to the same spot.

2093,Birds not eating Nyjer (thistle seed)?,"I purchased a sock filled with thistle and a large bag of bulk thistle from the same store. The sock is hung and the bulk thistle is in a feeder, but the birds don't eat from either.   Is there anything wrong with this thistle or is there something else going on? How can I tell if thistle has gone bad?  Also, if needed, what is the best way to dispose of thistle? I imagine dumping 10 pounds of thistle would start a thistle invasion! "
2094,Why aren't (poly-)cotton tents more popular?,"Tents with (the outer tent) made of cotton or ""technical cotton"" (cotton blends) are heavier, more expensive, and take some more time to dry but they also have benefits (see below). Sure the weight is an argument against for backpacking but in other travel scenarios the benefits are more relevant.   Nevertheless my impression is a decline in selection of cotton tents. What's the reason for cotton tents not being more popular? Several people I spoke with mentioned a fear that cotton tends to leak but experiences of people that actually use cotton tents tell the contrary, so may it just be bad marketing?  P.S.: Asserted benefits of (poly-)cotton tents include   better climate because the material breathes better sound insulator, less noise in wind and rain better resistance to UV light and heat, resulting in  likely easier to repair  "
2095,"When, and how, is it safe to relocate a burrow of chipmunks without harming the young?","One of my neighbors is terribly concerned that her resident chipmunks will harm her flower beds.  They dig holes, and she finds the holes unsightly.  She wants to trap them and relocate them.    Trapping a chipmunk is pretty easy -- I have trapped several that got into the house -- but you can do it only one chipmunk at a time.  Moreover, I looked up some chipmunk facts, and I am not sure the young are capable of making it on their own, or whether they need a few more weeks or another month.  I live in northern Virginia, near DC.  I have several chipmunks scurrying around, and they look adult, but I'm no chipmunk expert.  I just know they are a joy to watch, and I don't want my neighbor's prematurely thrown out to fend for themselves.  When can the chipmunks be safely relocated?   (Not a valid part of this question, but does anyone understand why people move to a woodsy region if they see animals as pests to be displaced?)   "
2096,GSI and similar plastic camping cookware: safe to use over fires?,"I'm interested in the GSI Bugaboo 4-person cookset and the accompanying Destination Kitchen however I have two similar/related concerns about safety and I was hoping someone in this community might have experience with them or similar products.  In the Cookset product description it says:     ""For your safety, we recommend you not use directly over a campfire...""   I can't tell if this means: don't stick the pots/pans directly into a fire, or if it means that its not even recommended that you use them over a fire, on top of a metal grate/grill...  If its the former, then obviously, I'm all set (duh! dont put stuff that has plastic in it directly into a fire!). But if its the latter then...how the heck are you supposed to cook with them?!? I'll be doing a lot of camping this summer, and at each campsite there will be a fire pit with a metal grate on top of it that can be used as a cooking surface. I need a cook set that can be placed on such a grate and used safely.  Similarly, the Destination Kitchen contains a spatula...will this thing melt the moment it comes into contact with a super hot pot/pan (thats cooking over a fire on a metal grate) or is it some kind of super plastic that will withstand that type of heat? "
2097,How can my neighbor encourage chipmunks to move away from her front-yard flower garden?,"This question is related to my earlier question about when it is safe, from the young chipmunks' point of view, to relocate a burrow of chipmunks.  To recap the background of the earlier question:     One of my neighbors is terribly concerned that her resident chipmunks   will harm her flower beds. They dig holes, and she finds the holes   unsightly. She wants to trap them and relocate them.   Beyond the unsightly holes, she is concerned that the chipmunks will harm her flowers.  I don't know what she is planting, because this comes from a neighborhood on-line site, and I don't know her personally.  We live in northern Virginia, 20 miles or so to the northwest of DC. According to the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries the chipmunks in question are probably the common eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus striatus).  (I say probably, because animals are migrating.)   As I say, I don't know what style of garden she favors, formal or centered on naturally occurring species, nor whether she is at all inclined to change her plantings, so I will try to be more specific:  What are non-lethal, and non-harmful (to the chipmunks) tactics to encourage the chipmunks to move away from her front yard?  For example, are there candidates for a chipmunk very-friendly garden that she could plant out of sight?  Almost everyone here has at least an acre.  I'd like to suggest an alternative or three to the options she is considering: amateur and perhaps premature trapping, exterminators, stuffing mothballs into the burrow, and (don't know how serious this is) getting a cat to control the chipmunks.   "
2098,At what point do I need snow goggles or glacier glasses when hiking?,"I'll be backpacking Europe in the winter (snow and rain) and parts of my trip will be outdoors, such as hiking in Dolomites, Italy. For purposes of packing light and risk of losing expensive gear, I don't know if I want to bring both sunglasses AND goggles/glacier glasses, especially since I wouldn't use them for the majority of the time. Nonetheless, I don't want to damage my eyes.  I'm no outdoor expert, but is it generally advised that people take both types of glasses? I won't be doing any mountaineering or ice climbing, but at what point do sunglasses become insufficient in protecting my eyes?  "
2099,Which is more durable: Hard shell or soft shell?,"From my experience, I've only ever used hard shells simply because I've always thought they were made for more treacherous weather. However, I recently saw a video by Patagonia that claimed soft shells are more durable. Is this true? If so, why is it that hard shells are advised over soft shells for harsher weather then? "

2102,Bootstrapping for outdoors,"Greetings Outdoor experts, I recently moved to USA, and looking to bootstrap myself for hikes, camping and other outdoor activities.   I have not bought a proper outdoor setup earlier, rather I carried what ever that was available. In fact, I did not care about the shoes, the bags or the warm clothes, but that had costed me and that was also when I was in my teens.   But now, I can invest in good outdoor gears and equipment that will be with me at-least for the next 10 years or more (with the exception of shoes, which I guess needs to be replaced every 6 months or according to the condition).  There's myriad of options, brands, prices and things to buy when I Google. But that is too confusing, and a big-big research. I would like to hear about the basic gears, equipment that I should invest on and the total cost that I should keep on mind. (Say, within [tex]500? to begin with or can it be even cheaper?)  For example, something like the below list:   Daypack -  backpack   sleeping bags   Shoes - 1 sandal, 1 hike shoe etc. Swiss knife GPS &lt;...hiking pant, shorts, cargos, compass, bandana... &amp; so on>   I would be doing more of regular hikes.  This question is something closest to what I am asking, but I am looking for a more specific list to setup really fast without doing a lot of research and missing the rest of summer, and product recommendations if possible. I hope that your answers will be helpful for anyone trying to bootstrap. BTW, I don't have any friends from whom I can borrow these things, I have to buy for myself. "
2103,How to estimate the depth of a pool of water from a distance above?,"In a few episodes of ""Man vs. Wild"", survival expert Bear Grylls was seen jumping off a cliff into a pool of water below. He made some rough estimation of the depth of the pool before making the decision to jump. I am puzzled as to how he managed to do it with just quick visual observation. Any wrong judgement could lead to a broken leg or even death.  If the terrain becomes too difficult, a jump from the cliff to the pool of water below might be the only way to make any progress. How would a person go about estimating the depth of the pool and the height of the jump by quick visual observation? Is there a proper guideline for jump height versus pool depth? "
2104,Difference between Gore-Tex Pro Shell and Gore-Tex Active Shell,What is the difference between the two Gore-Tex technologies in real world usage?

FYI: I am planning on getting a jacket that would be for occasional mountaineering and regular commuting on a bicycle. 
2105,Dog Breeds for Backpacking and Trail Running,"Which dog breeds are best for backpacking? I know malamutes do well in the cold and on mountains, but what if I'm backpacking in the summer?    Which dog breeds are good for daily trail runs?  I would love a dog that would wake up with me every day and go on a 3 to 7-mile trail run. Somehow, I can't see a Corgi keeping up.   "
2106,What are the suitable choices of crampons for Scarpa Charmoz GTX Women boots?,I have Scarpa Charmoz GTX Women boots for mountaineering (upper than 4000 m) in Iran. I want to find a good pair of crampons for them. I cannot choose automatic crampons but somebody says I can use newmatic or semi-automatic crampons. Is it correct? If yes which brands do you suggest?  
2107,Can the Swiss Alps be hiked in the winter?,"I would like to hike part of the Alps that go from France to Slovenia, but I'm not sure what type of equipment I'll need. I'm wondering if I need to bring crampons; I have Icetrekkers (Diamond Grip), which are more like traction cleats than crampons.  Because I'll be backpacking, I would prefer to know in advance instead of bringing an extra two pounds that I won't end up using.  Update: I'm not looking for equipment advice, which is why I didn't post this to OSE. I want to know if it can be hiked: Are the trails cleared for hikers? Are they even open? Or are the trails open, but not cleared, thus leaving the trails ""hike-able"" only to those with special equipment and training, such as mountaineers?  Looking at the official Switzerland tourist page and other various pages, I was unable to find any such information. "
2108,"Tie in to harness, top to bottom or bottom to top","When tying into a harness with a figure eight follow through knot, does it matter if the running end comes up through the tie in points or goes down through them?    From the figure it is hard to see which way the running end passes through the harness. I have often heard ""it doesn't really matter"" or ""either way is fine"".  Can anyone elaborate on scenario's where there are pro's and con's?  At the climbing gym the majority of people I watch go bottom to top, however I go top to bottom; should I be conforming to the masses? "

2110,Devils path shuttle,"I'm planning on through hiking Devil's Path in the Catskills in November with some friends, and I'm trying to figure out the transportation. We leave about 3 hours away, so I'd prefer not to have to take two cars to leave one at each end. Some suggestions I read online thought that I we could plan on hitching a ride from one end to another, but I hate to count on that since there are 4 of us and its pretty late in the season.   I couldn't find any sort of shuttle for the path. So I'm looking into a taxi service from end to end, but that seems super costly. Does anyone know of a shuttle or an alternative I could explore? "
2111,Why are eye friction hitches not commonly used in rock climbing?,"It seems that the majority of professional arborists favor friction hitches that are tied with a free cord rather than a loop:   Blake's Hitch Schwabisch Distel Valdotain Tresse   This is often tied using an eye to eye hitch cord like this:    This is a Blake's hitch:    One can also tie an asymmetrical Prusik without access to the end of the rope using one of these cords.  As far as I know none of these are popular among rock climbers.  Some people do not carry any dedicated Prusik loops, relying only on runners, but I have seen enough climbers that do.  For those that are carrying Prusik loops why not a single or double eye hitch cord?  I find ascending a rope with a Purcell and a waist Prusik challenging enough.  If one of these arborist's hitches works just a bit better why not consider it?  I think it is valuable to know that one can tie a friction hitch using the end of the rope itself (Blake's) even if this wouldn't be a typical application; it's another tool in the toolbox.  Am I forgetting other critical uses for a Prusik loop that an eyed hitch cord cannot perform?  Are there other practical reasons to choose a closed Prusik loop over these hitches, or is just a matter of different culture and experience?  (Splicing eyes is not a typical climber skill from what I gather.) "
2112,Legal situation for camping in the German Elbsandsteingebirge,"Am I allowed to bivouac in the German Elbsandsteingebirge (Elbe Sandstone Mountains)?

2114,"Am I allowed to ""wild-camp"" in my car?","It's generally prohibited to camp in the great outdoors in a few European countries like Germany (check out this related question). Speaking for latter, it's allowed to sleep in your car however.   So, let's say I drive my Lada up a German mountain and sleep in it. Am I allowed to do so?  Note: I mean to sleep in the bare car. Like laying on the back seats or even in the common driver's seat if that's comfortable enough.   Edit: Aravona added a good point. Of course we can consider that we are generally allowed to drive there (not a privately owned land etc.).     Bonus question: If yes, am I still if I transform it to a camping-device?

2115,How does drying stuff in your sleeping bag work?,"A pretty common trick when winter camping is to dry anything that gets damp/wet (e.g., base layers and socks) in your sleeping bag (cf. How do you dry wet socks when camping/backpacking if it&#39;s raining and the socks cannot be hung to dry outside). Similarly, people will also sleep with their boots to keep them from freezing and try and dry the liners out.  Where does the water go when sleeping with wet/damp clothes? Aren't you just transferring the moisture into your sleeping bag? "
2116,Roof-top tents vs conventional tents?,"I have noticed a slow but steady rise in the number of campers using roof-top tents like these and those, among many others.     What are the advantages and disadvantages of these over conventional ground tents? In what circumstances would someone prefer one versus the other?  Note: Assume this type of setup is permissible, I'm strictly asking about the gear usage. "
2117,Timing on building a small log cabin,"I'm interested in building a small Lincoln-log style cabin (more like a shed, &lt;200 square feet) in hardiness zone 4/5 of northeast USA. Available timbers are mostly red spruce, some eastern hemlock, a little bit of white and red pine, and precious little cedar. My question is about the timing of construction. Below I'll pose a few different questions, but they all amount to ""What are the timing considerations for construction of a Lincoln-log style cabin?""  When should logs be cut for the cabin? I know Spring is generally a bad time for logging due to mud and sapflow making it more likely that both felled and standing trees will be damaged more than necessary. Other than the details of logging, can trees be turned to logs at any time of year for use in a log cabin? In general the logging itself is something I'm comfortable with in terms of timing and all, but just about every part of the process after that is where I'm not sure about timing I should aim for.  How long should the logs be left to dry before they are hewn and fit together with notches? Can processing logs begin pretty much immediately upon them being cut, or (more likely I'd guess) do the logs need to sit (stacked or on the ground, in shade or sun) for some (2, 6, 12) months?  And what period can the processing take place over? For example can all the hewing, notching, fitting, etc. be finished over the course of a summer or even a year, or is there any particular time frame it should be done within? I imagine it's a work in progress for its entire lifetime, but maybe there's some critical timing with things like roof and floor completion.  Any info or resources I could look into for guidance would be appreciated. The standard of quality for this one is pretty low as it's an experiment (basically, sturdier than a tent), but I'd still like to try and do it right and learn the process correctly.  "
2118,What type of trailer do I need for my Granada 24 sailboat?,"I'm about to get a Granada 24 sailboat and I can't really figure out what type of trailer I need.

2119,How do you create a sense of community on a backpacking trip?,"Having a sense of community on a backpacking trip can mean the difference between enjoyment and misery. It can also be the difference between backpacking as a team instead of as random group of people.  The technical definition is,     McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) define sense of community as ""a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their commitment to be together.""   Source  What could people on a backpacking trip do to encourage this? I don't think that it can be forced, and being on a backpacking trip will help, simply because people are spending time in close proximity, but are there things that a group or group leader could do help create a sense of community?

2121,Why does this blue tit bird desperately want to come inside?,"There's a strange thing going on since a few days ago in the office. Suddenly we recognized a blue tit flying like crazy up and down on our window. It looks quite average, a beautiful bird, not like somehow sick or something. Still, the first day we thought: ""Okay, this poor thing sure is ill."" We didn't bother anymore since we thought it's going to die soon.   The next day however, the blue tit flew a few charges again. Always flying to the window just to go up and down on it then. This lasts for about 5 minutes before the bird moves away again.   The behavior is shown frequently for about the last 5 days. Approximately the tit comes every 5 hours trying to storm our window. This doesn't mean, that it's always exactly 5 hours. Sometimes it's only there once per office-day and sometimes it comes back after an hour.   I've never seen something like this. What's wrong with it? What causes this behavior?  "
2122,Could this year's unusual warmth harm turtles?,"I currently live about 25 miles northeast of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.  On February 20-21, 2015, a fairly significant snow and ice event struck the area.  On February 29-March 1, 2016, a smaller event occurred also bringing a thin coating of ice.  From February 20-24, 2017, it is sunny and approximately 60°F (16°C) or higher.  I mention this just to illustrate how unusual the weather has been at this time of year, during 2017.  My workplace overlooks a pond.  In past summers, I have gone so far as to break out binoculars and a guide book, and identified that we have at least one map turtle, five painted turtles, and maybe a red-eared slider.  Today (Feb 24, 2017) I went outside for a break and saw the map turtle and two of the painteds on one of the logs on the edge of the pond.  Considering that the long-term forecast does not preclude a return to more normal conditions (there is a blizzard not 200 miles away right now), is there any chance that this early emergence from their hibernacula could ultimately be harmful to these guys?  Or could they just as easily return to the pond bottom and resume a state of brumation for another month or two?  UPDATE 6 MARCH 2017 - Early last week there was some heavy rain that swelled the pond and turned it murky. Still, I may have seen one partially-submerged-turtle-shaped object drifting around. Then a few days later, it froze overnight and snowed until noon the next day. Now it has returned to the unseasonable warmth. A bit of a roller coaster from both human and reptile point of view. Anyway, today I saw two painteds on a log. Keeping an optimistic spirit here, until next update.  UPDATE 21 MARCH 2107 - We remain on the temperature roller coaster, though it seems to be starting to stabilize. Anyway, ever since the snow events a couple weeks ago, I have seen no more than two painteds at any one time, and so far no other species. Still too early to jump to conclusions, though. At the least, the fact that there are two definite survivors is good reason for optimism.  UPDATE 27 MARCH 2017 (FINAL) - Great news everyone! I just went out for a look during lunch, and saw a total of five turtles around the pond. One was the map, three were painteds, and one was either another painted or a slider. With the weather stabilizing toward definite spring conditions, it looks like our carapaced friends are in the clear. Yippee! "
2123,"I have a compass but no watch, how can I tell when it will get dark?","I was reading all of the answers to Are there any situations while backpacking that would require a watch? and surprised at the number of answers that said you need a watch so you would know how long until dark.  People have been walking around the world for a very long time, portable time pieces have only been readily available for about hundred years. They do have a longer history but spent much of that time as very high end luxury items.   The compass has a much longer history, it is simpler instrument, with a much lower cost to acquire and maintain.    A watch alone, will not tell you when it going to get dark, nor when the tides will be low, but combined with other information it can help you determine when the forecast event will occur.   If I have a compass, how can I use it to estimate how long until sun set?  "

2126,Are elephants used in tourism in Thailand cracked and if yes why is it possible to take the infants away?,"A friend of mine told me that elephants used for tourism in Thailand are mistreated. They are taken away from their mothers in the wilderness and brought to a station where they are tortured to make them calm, ready to be ridden by everyone. This process is called ""cracking"". Is this true? How exactly does this process work? Why do the gameskeepers not react? "
2127,Mimosa Pudica (touch-me-not) medicinal uses and edibility,"I started reading about an interesting plant that is common around here called Mimosa Pudica, known as ""touch-me-not"" because of its leaves that close upon touching.  It seems to be a plant with valuable medicinal uses, amongst them antibacterial properties[1], anti-anxiety/depression properties[2], inhibiting effect of Naja snake poison*[3], anti-arthritic properties[4], list could go on (i.e.: use as laxative, inhibitor of tumor growth).  It’s also known that it contains toxic mimosine and parts of the plant contains calcium oxalate, but I haven’t found evidence of acute toxicity of the plant.  I'm interested in the use of the plant as a survival aid, both as a medicine and as an edible if possible, so my questions are:   Is the Mimosa Pudica a safe plant to regularly drink teas from, despite the presence of mimosine and calcium oxalate? If not, what preparation steps should be taken to avoid intoxication, or what dosage should not be surpassed? What about dermal application of ethanol/water extracts of the plant as a antibacterial/pain-relief herb for wounds? In this case, I don't think the calcium oxalate would be an issue, but I'm not sure about the mimosine. Does the plant have some nutritional value besides the medicinal uses?   I don't mean to make the questions too scientific, they are just a guideline, what I'm looking for is information about how to use the plant for survival, so any information regarding this is really appreciated!  Obs: If the community believes the question is more appropriate in Biology SE I can write it there. My choice of The Great Outdoors has to do with the survivalism/wild living approach. For example, there are laboratory studies of extracts of the plant, but I’m only interested in the ones that are practical enough for a survival situation.    * The articles I found used the pre-incubation method, which exposes the venom to the extract before application. Probably it isn't as effective being applied/consumed after the bite, but in an emergency every effort to buy some time prior to medical treatment seems reasonable (as long as it doesn't cause issues with the latter).

2128,Is there any reason to avoid sunglasses with blue lenses?,"I want to buy some sunglasses with a white frame and blue lenses because I like the look of the colors together, something like this (I also like the side protection of this particular model):   When looking for information about the benefits/disadvantages of different lens colors, I found some information about benefits of lenses which block blue light.  I also found this image showing benefits of differently colored lenses:     Among the listed benefits of various (non-blue) lenses is that they block blue light. Also, blue lenses are not shown as an option, which is concerning.  I assume blue lenses allow more blue light through than other colored light. Is this correct?  Blue-blocking lenses seem to be commonly used for eye protection, and they are usually orange. Red, yellow, and blue are the 3 primary colors, and orange is made up of red and yellow.  Is there any reason to avoid blue lenses? Will I do more long-term damage to my eyes than choosing another option like these?      Is it best to wear lenses which are both UV-blocking and blue-light blocking?  So are orange lenses the best?  EDIT:   As mentioned by 1 of the answers, I now know that lenses can be 1 color and have a different color mirror layer on the surface, as in this example where you can see a neutral gray lens with a blue mirror layer:    While the lenses from the above range seem to be colored:   "
2129,Transition from ascending to descending a rope,"Consider an ascension of a single rope with an ATC guide in locking mode and a foot loop with a friction hitch, as described in this answer:  Quickest / most efficient way to ascend a hanging rope with rock climbing gear?    Now assume the ascent has ended mid-rope (i.e. no stable anchor to hook in to) and the climber wants to transition to a rappel.  What is the safest and most simple method of flipping the ATC guide and the entire system out of auto-locking mode and back into a typical rappel mode? "
2130,Finding fuel for a Trangia stove in Russia,"For my Trangia stove, I usually use denatured alcohol / ethanol / methyl alcohol.  Bringing methyl alcohol into Russia is apparently prohibited, and bringing ethanol is subject to a 22€/litre duty.  I've understood that actually finding спирт, as it's apparently called in Russian, is potentially very difficult, according to sources (1), (2), (3), (4).  One of those sources recommends an industrial site near Moscow and to pay the guard a bit of money for him to get some methyl alcohol...  Where specifically can I find fuel for my Trangia stove in Russia?  I will have almost a day in Moscow before I head north to Inta prior to my hike.  I've heard they might sell it at the аптека, perhaps in 100 mL bottles.  But I'm also told it should be sold at camping stores.  Where can I find a fuel that will be suitable for my stove?  (I will be taking the train, so aviation limitations are not relevant in my case) "
2131,Tradeoffs between different stopper knots,"Because a number of accidents have occurred when a climber was lowered or rappelled off the end of a rope, it is wise to tie a stopper knot in the end(s) of the rope.  My question is what stopper knot do you prefer and why?  It seems to me that the desirable features of a stopper knot are that it should be secure as well as quick and easy to tie.  According to animatedknots.com, a figure eight can work free (though I would have thought that with sufficient tail, this would not be a problem).    Though not strictly necessary, if you're aware of any empirical tests comparing the effectiveness of different stopper knots, that would be great.  I would also be interested in hearing about any accidents in which failure of a stopper knot (e.g. rolling off the end of the rope due to poor knot choice) was a factor.  I personally always use a barrel knot (triple overhand) with 12-18"" of tail but some of my climbing partners have different preferences so I am interested in knowing how much difference the choice of stopper knot makes.  In particular, are some stopper knots dangerous to use?  I would imagine that a single overhand could be a risky choice (particularly with a short tail). "
2132,"Is it OK to throw pebbles and stones in streams, waterfalls, ponds, etc.?","I love the outdoors, but I'm not really an experienced outdoorsman, hiker or camper. I have little to no education in outdoor etiquette, beyond the really obvious stuff (pick up your trash, etc.).  Last week I took my family on a road trip through a mountainous area, and we stopped at several little mountain streams and waterfalls to explore the area and enjoy the view. On many of these trails, my young toddler had a great time picking up dozens of pebbles and small stones from the path and throwing them into the stream / waterfall / pond / etc.  Only later I thought to wonder if there's something wrong with doing that. Were we contributing to erosion, disturbing animal habitats, interfering with water courses, or something? Should I stop him from throwing rocks in the future and educate him about why that's not environmentally conscious, or is it not a problem, so I can let him throw pebbles to his heart's content?  (My personal guess is that driving our car through the area [on public roads] probably did more environmental damage overall than throwing a few pebbles, but, well, I really don't have any education to back that up!) "
2133,Is the Battery Life of the Garmin InReach Mini enough for a 2 week trip?,"I am going hiking for 2-3 weeks with no possibility of charging the battery again. Assuming I only turn the InReach on only once a day to send a ""I'm ok""-message and then turn it off again, would the battery last?   Alternatively, if I left it off during the entire trip and used it only as an SOS button, what would the situation be like then? "
2134,Why did backcountry camping at Canyon de Chelly collapse?,"Looking at Canyon de Chelly backcountry camping visitation by month:    Backcountry camping went from usually more than a hundred per month, up to several hundred per month, throughout spring, summer (except for August, which is probably too hot), and fall in the 2000-2017 period, then collapsed to just a handful per month in 2018 (and with August now the most popular month!).  What happened?  Did it become nearly prohibited?  Or did they just stop counting or change definitions? "
2135,Does a Mammut Smart Alpine belay device go well with a Black Diamond Gridlock carabiner? Any other recommendations?,"Has anybody ever tried to use a cross-load protecting Black Diamond Gridlock carabiner with a Smart Alpine belay device?   I do think the Smart Alpine does not go very well with the CRAG Smart HMS carabiner from Mammut. The Smart Alpine belay device sometimes gets caught in a corner since it is pretty broad and rather chunky. In a hectic situation this may cause danger to the climber.   I never had this issue with a regular Smart or Smart 2.0 device, so this question specifically for the Smart Alpine variants.   Maybe someone has a perfect (cross load protecting) carbine match for the Smart Alpine suggestion?   Thank you very much in advance.  "
2136,Splitting up weight hiking as a couple/mixed gender group,"Assuming equivalent fitness, what is a fair way to split up weight when hiking as a couple/in mixed gender groups? Should the weight be proportional to the individuals weight? Are there other considerations? "
2137,How safe is it for women to hike alone?,"Should a woman legitimately fear to be assaulted or raped on popular backpacking trails in the US when hiking by herself? How common are attacks of that nature? How does it compare to residential areas, where we don't tell women to never be out by themselves?  I would like to keep answers focused on criminal behavior by others, and not the risk of having an accident. "
2138,Clarification sought on the six-inch-cat-hole rule,"In areas where the park service asks hikers to burry their feces, it is commonly suggested to dig a six-inch hole. I have come close to filling up one of those before, which got me wondering: What is the goal behind this rule? Is the goal to have the feces buried six inches, meaning, should I anticipate the volume of the deposit, or am I fine as long as nothing shows on the surface?  Are there any suggestions for areas where reaching the target depth is difficult due to rocky soil? "
2139,Alternatives to retreating quickly when caught in a lightning storm when rock climbing?,"The general advice I have heard for surprise lightning storms when climbing is to retreat. Since retreating quickly is not without danger itself and often is not even all that quick (I personally have spent two hours plus retreating), I was wondering if there are any other well tested strategies. I was thinking leaving most metal gear behind on the route and just waiting out the storm on a ledge could work? Are there any reported incidents of climbers getting struck by lightning with that strategy? Are there other strategies that have worked for people? "
2140,Sleeping solutions when camping with dogs?,"My dog enjoys hiking. I haven't taken her on any overnight trips yet, but would like to try some summer/fall backcountry camping with her (i.e., what I think Europeans call wild camping -- not car camping). The wilderness areas near our home (Los Angeles) are mountainous, so it will be cold at night, even in the summer. I'd like her and me to get a pleasant night's sleep. I usually don't bring a tent (do sometimes bring a tarp) for summer/fall backpacking in California. She has fur, so I'm sure she could survive the overnight conditions just sleeping out in the open, but she'd probably be unhappy, and would whine and want to crawl into my sleeping bag, which would be uncomfortable for me.  Does anyone have any experience with this and suggestions for how to do it? I would prefer something compatible with an ultralight style. She's small (10 kg), so I could let her sleep under my lightweight down sweater, but she'd probably damage it. I wonder if it would make sense to get a cheap, used synthetic sleeping bag and cut a piece out of it for her to use as a blanket? "
2141,What's the fastest and easiest way to replace an in-boom outhaul?,"I have an old 20' racing sailboat where the outhaul is mostly missing. The wire is there at the end of the boom, but there's no rope coming out to cleat it. How can I run a new rope through the boom? Do I have to take it completely apart? "
2142,How to cope with thorns when hiking barefoot?,"There are two main factors that cause me to get thorns in the feet when hiking barefoot:   Usually, the forest ground consists of many layers - grass, beneath it rotten leaves, beneath it grass roots, but still aerated. Thorny plants can be hidden beneath the grass and fully invisible. One can't always look down where he is stepping, therefore encountering from time to time raspberries or blackberries.   When I hit a thorn, it usually hurts quite a lot in the first moments. However, my feet are dirty from walking and seeing the thorn is difficult. Furthermore, even if I locate it, it is usually embedded deep enough to make removal difficult.  How can I identify which thorns are dangerous in the long therm and should be removed promptly (instead of leaving it inside the foot)? How to determine if the painful thing that hit my foot is a plant's thorn, that will dissolve in the body in a few days, or is a tiny piece of stone/glass, that, if not removed, will embed there and hurt indefinitely long?  "
2143,"Can I use satellite images as hiking maps, how?","I tried to find topographic maps of my area in Brazil, but the best I could find is some 1:50000 map from 1983.  My biggest need for a map (besides not getting lost) is avoiding private properties and finding some terrain features to help me navigate. My area is very flat, so pure elevation maps aren't much of a help here, but the satellite images (like those from Google Maps) do provide some hints to what is a private property and what is forest area.  I haven't been able to discover a way to print or manipulate the images to use those as a map, can it be done? Also, is it ok to navigate using satellite images (instead of proper maps)?  EDIT: To further illustrate my need, here is a Gmap4 location of my area and its ""flatness"". In the aerial view I can see forests, streams, houses, roads, I don't know how distorted it is and to print it to scale, but I seen to be able to get much more info about the terrain from it, than from the top.

2144,What's the difference between Sport Climbing and Traditional Climbing?,What is the difference between Sport Climbing and Traditional (Trad) Climbing? Is it just that Sport Climbing uses bolts? 
2145,How safe are stoppers/rocks when threaded through rock tunnels?,"Last year, I learned that you could thread the wire of stoppers/rocks/hexentrics through tunnels in the rock if threading cord or a sling through them would be too difficult. As a reference, see the following image (left: sling/cord, right: stopper):    I used that method a few times for rather non-critical pieces or where the tunnel was too narrow to fit a sling through it. However, I am wondering:   How does that method change the usual safety considerations when using tunnels for protection (thickness of the rock bridge etc)? For example, would additional forces be exerted on the bridge? Or would the forces even be smaller since the stopper distributes them around the hole? (All of this assuming that the stopper is large enough to never slip through the hole.) "
2146,How to safely train for and grip pockets?,"I was spurred to post this after reading Which fingers to use in a 2 finger pocket when rock climbing?    Last year I injured myself training on a shallow three finger pocket with an open hand grip and my pinky dropped.  While hanging with maximum effort I felt a popping sensation in the palm of my hand and heard a brief but audible ripping-paper sound.  Pain and swelling followed.  I never received a professional diagnosis, but seeing as I would not be climbing for a while I had time to read fairly extensively on the subject, and I concluded that in all likelihood I had suffered a partial tear of the fourth palmar lumbrical.  This is a small muscle that runs between the flexor tendons of the fourth and fifth digits, seen below:    When some of the digits are nearly fully extended and others maximally flexed a shearing force is created in the lumbricals, which can lead to a tear.    Reference this illustration from Lumbrical Tears in Rock Climbers – A. SCHWEIZER [PDF]    Since this injury I am shy to commit to any pockets.  I can baby the fourth lumbrical by avoiding splitting the fourth and fifth (ring and pinky) fingers, but that does not protect the third lumbrical from shear as shown in the illustration above.  As I have become more aware of the interconnection between digits I have noted that none of them are independent, not even the index and middle fingers which do not share a lumbrical.  For example if I:   with my wrist extended or at least straight hold the 3rd, 4th, &amp; 5th digits straight (in line with the palm) using the other hand and flex my index finger down toward my wrist as far as possible   I feel a sharp and almost painful tension in my forearm.  I did not feel even this much discomfort in my palm before the tear so it seems probable that this is another source of potential injury.  It seems that not flexing the dropped fingers from the lowest joint (MCP) greatly reduces shearing stresses.  This works OK when I can prop the fingers against the face of the rock, e.g.:    However on protruding plastic gym holds or overhanging routes when I cannot prop my fingers I don't seem to be able to hold them back like that and still truly exert.  Is this something I just need to practice?  Contrarily I see plenty of strong climbers bending the dropped fingers at the palm like this:    Did I injure myself only because I was trying too hard?  It happened at near 100% exertion, and afterward someone told me to train at no more than 60-70% intensity.  If that is true (is it?) an injury could still happen on a hard route unless I intentionally limit myself, right?  How can I minimize the possibility of (re)injury while training for and climbing hard on pockets? "
2147,UTM Rulers for Odd Scales?,"I have a Green Trails map at the scale 1:18,000 and a National Geographic map at the scale 1:35,000 and I can't find UTM corner rulers for either of them.  Shouldn't maps from such popular map makers have more common scales? Is there a trick that allows me to use a more common scale and easily convert? "
2148,What respirator should I get for urbex?,"Sometimes while hiking/trekking/whatever I practice urbex (in random buildings, factories, farms, tunnels, the usual), and I'm aware of the risks to my health caused by toxic gas, asbestos, lead and other substances. To protect my lungs, what kind of respirator should I get? Should a surgical mask be enough?     There are so many different variables, I don't even know where to start. Because I usually explore spontaneously while I'm out, I need something that is at least a bit practical, that I can bring in my backpack.  Also, something as discreet as possible would also be great. I don't want to be caught in the woods after exiting a tunnel looking like a wasteland warrior.   &lt;-- Looks cool, but no thanks.  Any info that helps me understand how all this works and what I should look for is much appreciated. Cheers. "
2149,Bouldering beside the freeway,"Hello I have a question that I ask myself every morning when I commute to work. I live New England and I take the I-95 south from New Hampshire to Massachusetts every weekday. During my commute I drive across faces of rock besides the highway. I have only climbed outdoors once and I am itching to get outside this spring. (I started climbing a few months ago but it is 99% indoor because winter in New England stinks.)  I've lived in New England my entire life but I have never seen people attempt to climb the rock faces besides the highway. I was wondering, is it legal to climb these rock faces at all? And if it is, why don't many people do it (I haven't seen anyone do it.) Are there just better places to climb at?  Thanks "
2150,How to differentiate between a Hobby and a Kestrel?,"I often see Kestrel's in the countryside around my house (Hobby &amp; Kestrel). I live outside of the range of hobby's so I don't really see them. But if I did, how do you differentiate between them? They seem very similar birds.  They're both small raptors with similar colouring and both ""hover"". Often I don't carry binoculars (or have my glasses on).  Is there any one glaring difference between these two birds that will help me identify one from the other? "
2151,"How do Plover sentinels give the ""move out"" signal?","During my usual weekend morning jaunt along Del Monte Beach in Monterey (California), I noticed for the first time the Plovers, who normally seem to forage nonstop, actually taking a communal break. About a dozen or so gathered together in a circle, and all but one or two bent their heads backwards and buried their faces in their ""shoulder feathers.""  They seemed to be just catnapping (the eyes slits, but not completely closed).  The one or two ""sentinels"" seemed to keep on eye on other critters getting too close (humans and dogs) and also on the surf. If something got too close, these sentinels somehow indicated this to their brethren. But how? If it was a sound, it may have been subsonic (at least, I didn't hear anything).  How do they say, ""Wake up, peeps, and move over a bit!"" And all moving together in the same direction at that?  What is their communication ""secret""? "
2152,What are the easiest methods to carry a backpack when cycling?,"This question might be flanked by The Great Outdoors and Bicycles, yet I'll ask.  When I am off for a mountain-biking thing, I usually have a backpack with me which contains clothing, medical kit, basic toolkit for repair, tarp, sleeping bag, food and water, etc.   What would be the ideal method to carry it? Should I haul the pack on back or should I attach it to the carrier that my bicycle has?  Lets consider a 35-Lt backpack and an offroad rough terrain with lots of ups-and-downs. "
2153,How unpleasant is Hypothermia?,"There are a lot of ways to die in the great outdoors.  Prevailing answers at What are some mortal dangers in temperate woods? suggest that Hypothermia is near the top of the list.   I have been really cold a few times. It seems to me that getting warm again was more painful then the getting cold.  Hypothermia has nothing on the ordeal of Aron Ralston, and wandering around in the dark or a blizzard seems like a good way to find a very painful end.    So if I am hunkered down, waiting for the Sun to come out, what should I expect to feel if I won't be seeing the Sun again?  "
2154,What Navigation Aids can I make on an island with only a knife?,"In a recent discussion about navigating from a deserted island, it was suggested that if I have a knife and natural resources I could create my own navigation aids. In this instance I was planning to sail from the island with a compass that I happened to have been stranded with.    If I didn't have any navigation aids (no compass), I have only a knife and natural resources what navigation aids could I make? How would I make them?  "
2155,Deer activity in the wet,"Over the years, when out walking and on my commute through the countryside I've noticed that, when it's intensely pouring with rain, Roe deer seems to come out of the forests into open fields to eat.  I would have thought being out in the rain would reduce their ability to hear predators sneak up on them. However that said, in the UK there are no natural predators for Roe deer and they are only culled by the forestry commission and other governing bodies.  Why do they come out to eat like this in the rain? And can you use it to your advantage when hunting? "
2156,What are the pros and cons of both a DIN and a yoke valve for a scuba-diving regulator?,I'm looking at buying regulators for scuba-diving this weekend and we came across the options to have a DIN or a yoke valve for our first stage.

2157,"""Due to the sheep in the settlement the surrounding area has no mosquitoes""",I was surprised by this Visit Greenland statement on Qassiarsuk:     Due to the sheep in the settlement the surrounding area has no mosquitoes.

2158,Does the altitude you live at influence the time required for acclimatization?,"Let's say that two persons are going to attempt to climb a mountain that is 6 000 metres high. These persons are equal in every way, except that one lives at sea level and one lives at 2 500 metres above sea level. Is there likely to be any difference in the acclimatization pattern for these persons?  If not, at what altitude must the second person live for there to be any noticeable difference?  If yes, at what lower altitude must the second person live at for the difference cease to exist? "
2159,Do American mourning doves only make their plaintive cooing sound where people can't see them?,"We have American mourning doves in abundance in Massachusetts. They spend months in our yard, eating seeds both on the ground and in the feeders. They also peck around in my flower garden, so I think they might be eating grubs and insects. We see many of them every day, rain or shine.   I love their plaintive cooing sound. It's hauntingly beautiful. I used to think it was an owl call but know better now.   What's interesting is that the call sounds like it's coming from a distance away.  It doesn't sound close enough to be at my feeders. I've never seen a bird using their mouth in such a way as to think I was watching them speak. Even when they're in the tree branch above the feeders, as in my second picture, they look and seem silent. I know it's not because they're nocturnal, as I hear it all day, though sometimes louder towards dusk. I don't think I'm just missing it, as I frequently sit outside with them for hours.  There's a whooshing sound when they rise from the ground, but that comes from the flapping of their wings, and stops when they land.  Do these American mourning doves ever make that lovely cooing sound on the ground, feeder, or anyplace where people can see them? If not, why not?    The first picture is of their favorite feeder, which is on a pole about six feet in the air. Frequently at least four share that eating space, with one or two sitting on top waiting for their turn. The second picture is on a branch beside a rope that leads to a feeder a few feet down. The third is on the roof of my sunroom, where they sip water as it runs down in rivulets after a rain.      "
2160,Why are these turkeys circling a dead cat?,I recently came across a gif file showing a gang of turkeys circling what appears to be a dead cat. It appears to be a structured formation as the turkeys are trotting at the same pace and spacing between each bird.   Is this behavior common in turkeys? Is there any explanation for the behavior?   
2161,Ski setup for skijoring,"I was born on ski's and switched to snowboarding and now on the return to skiing. However I intend to do both downhill and skijoring in the next season (skiing with my dogs)  I am having trouble deciding on which ski and binding set would be best suited.  Factors:   ungroomed trails flat/ hilly terrain downhill distance   So my questions are: 1. knowing the above factors, is there a ski setup that could handle both downhill and backcountry at speed? 2. knowing downhill will probably need a separate setup what type of ski could handle like a backcountry ski but with a skating motion in a cross country binding/boot setup?

2162,What are the pros and cons of greased feet in boots?,"I was just reading this answer at Can you keep your feet warm in ski boots on a very cold day?     Yes, add fat to your feet. I don't mean gain weight. Just slather it on before putting socks on. Petroleum jelly will work, as will almost any other fat (other than coconut oil). A nice layer of fat, even external, does wonders for heat retention.   Ignoring the ick factor that is mentioned in some of the comments to the answer.  From a physical perspective what are the pros and cons of using Petroleum jelly or some other grease on your booted feet when out doors?  I want to know about impacts to foot health as well as impact to socks and boots.  "
2163,Has Joe Simpson ever explained why he did not cut the rope himself?,"I have just watched the docudrama ""Touching the void"" for the umpteenth time. I am a climber and mountaineer and have a great deal of respect for Simon Yates and his efforts to save Joe Simpson and also for his decision to cut the rope supporting Joe Simpson. On my last viewing of the movie the blindingly obvious question occurred to me. Why did Joe Simpson not cut the rope himself?   He was in a hopeless situation. Suspended on an overhanging face in severe wind chill conditions, he had lost the ability to climb up the rope, Yates was in an unsustainable position and it was obvious to both parties that this was the case. One of the two had to make a decision. Yates hung on for as long as he could and then cut the rope.    Joe Simpson has never blamed Simon Yates for cutting the rope,     Simpson publicly defended Yates. He dedicated his book and the documentary to Yates, saying his climbing partner saved his life by staying with him on the mountain for so long. Simpson said he, too, would have cut the rope if their positions had been reversed.   Source  but has he ever explained why he did not cut the rope himself? "
2164,Lake Tahoe kayaking conditions,My wife and I would like to take my 7 year old son kayaking this summer. Was thinking about a circumnavigation of Lake Tahoe. It looks like there are plenty of put ins and take outs. I am curious how rough are the waters and how difficult are the landings/launches? Is there anything else unique to paddling on Lake Tahoe that we need to be aware of? 
2165,Climbing at the Skytop area of the Gunks,"The Skytop area at the Gunks has a number of stellar climbs including Foops (5.11) and Super Crack (5.12+). From what I can piece together, climbing there requires a guide and buying a meal/pass at the resort. Despite the ridiculousness of paying over $500 to be escorted by a guide, is it possible to hire a guide who will sit back and just let my partner and I climb the routes we want? As I was not strong enough to climb Super Crack back in the days before requiring a guide, if we are in over our heads are the guides strong enough to retrieve our gear? "
2166,"I've just been bitten by a rattlesnake; how, exactly, do I ""keep calm""?","My question is prompted by the answer of @WedaPashi to this question, which is about rattlesnakes, specifically:     • Remain calm and first move beyond the snake's striking distance.      • Keep calm, panic will make the adrenaline come in picture and the   blood circulation will increase, only resulting in causing the venom   to spread much quicker.   This is excellent advice in an excellent answer, and I don't question that keeping calm is the thing to do, but I'd like to know exactly what is meant by ""keeping calm"" and some advice on how to keep calm.   Obviously, I should not start screaming, running around, and flapping my arms, but I assume ""keeping calm"" means more than not behaving hysterically.  And what can I do to achieve a calmer state?  And why is part of the answer not Xanax, if I happen to have it with me?    "
2167,Do I need protective measures against wild animals in Yosemite National Park?,"I know that hundreds of black bears roam around Yosemite, however they are considered harmless and an attack towards humans has not been reported so far.

What are (allowed) protective measures against wild animal attacks specifically in Yosemite?  "
2168,Redundancy in rappel systems,"What is the simplest setup for rappelling that is fully redundant?  The most common system seems to be rappelling off of both strands of a rope passing through two rappel rings on separate anchors. While providing the option to recover the rope by pulling on one end, that setup still leaves the rope as a single point of failure.  Assuming the highest degree of redundancy is required, would it not be more safe to tie two figure-eight knots on two bights, connecting each to a separate anchor, and then rappelling off of those two strands? Thus if one of the anchors fail, or even if one part of the rope fails, the other strand is still fully intact.  Any specific reason this setup is not more common? "
2169,"Is a slackline, ratchet, and tree protector alone enough equipment to setup the slackline?","I'm new to slacklining and planning to buy a slack line kit from Amazon  With the rope and ratchet and tree protector which will be used on trees.

What exactly do I need to slackline if I have two trees? "
2170,Sailing rules within three boat length circle,"When you are within the three boat length circle in a race, do other rules of racing apply?  So, if two boats are within the circle, one boat has overlap, is on the inside, and is on starboard tack (boat A), and the other boat is on port tack (boat B), can boat A push boat B off its proper course, taking more room than necessary?  Or does boat B only need to give enough room to round?  (Boat A entered the circle with overlap.  This would be the downwind mark.)      (Under the rules of US Sailing) "

2172,How to escape a cave in an emergency situation?,"I have been doing a lot of cave climbing recently. So I am not talking about your average tourist cave, I talk about real miles deep labyrinth like caves, where nature never thought of humans getting in. To rule-out trivial answers I'd like to sketch the current scenario:  You are with an experienced guide in a cave for about 2h, the guide loses consciousness after an accident and needs immediate medical attention. Since you relied on the guide's expertise, you are uncertain about the route back to an exit. You know that help may arrive in the next 48 hours or so since you may not return in time from your expedition. You have a light source, a compass and a map of the cave. Your light source will pose no immediate issue since you have power for at least the next two days. However, because the guide is in serious trouble and would possibly die in the next few hours (after performing first aid) you decide to try the escape anyway.   What is a good strategy to escape the cave in order to get help for the guide in trouble?   Note: The question is less about the guide in danger, rather about possible strategies to navigate back. ""Stay where you are"" is a valid answer if you hope for rescue.  A second similar scenario is:  You were beamed by an evil villain into a cave unknown to you. You have a light source, a compass and a map of the cave. The cave has an exit. You want to get out.  What else would you need to get out of the cave? How would you plan your escape? How would you try to locate yourself and navigate to an exit? "
2173,Where to insert slackline into ratchet?,Where to I insert the slackline in this picture? Does the slackline wrap around a cylinder of the ratchet or just hang? I can't get the line to be locked in place.   It'd be helpful if someone would paint over this.   
2174,How do I tell if a glacier is safe for crossing?,"Sure you have to look out for crevasses which is nicely explained here: How to detect a crevasse on a glacier.  But what else does one have to consider when trying to cross a glacier?   Some glaciers are recommended to cross depending on ""the conditions"". What are safety related glacier conditions to be considered when you have the goal of crossing one? "
2175,What are known failure modes of the auto-braking mechanism of Grigris?,"Disclaimer first: The brake-hand principle (always hold the braking strand of the rope) always applies to assisted braking belay devices, including the Grigri. This question is in no way targeted at putting that in question, follow it at all times!  In a recent question about quickly belaying on top rope, some discussion happened in comments about how the braking mechanism of a Grigri can fail. In general, the Grigri is known as a very reliable, while bulky tool for belaying with a brake-assistance.  Now excluding user failure (e.g. fully holding the Grigri in one's hand and thus disabling the braking mechanism), what scenarios are there in which the Grigri will not by itself start braking and finally arresting a fall?  In addition: What is/are the countermeasure(s) to let the braking mechanism engage in the respective scenarios?  I am only looking for scenarios which can be/have been demonstrated (in practice or in a test setup), not in hypothetical problems. "
2176,What can I do to be more visible to other ships’ radar when traveling in a sea kayak?,I’ve seen small radar reflectors for sale.  Should I carry one when kayaking?  What else can I do such that boats can use their radar to be aware of my location when they can’t see me due to poor visibility?  
2177,How do PADI and SSI qualifications match up?,"In a similar manner to this question: When describing my PADI qualifications with a CMAS diver, is there a well know equivalence table? How do the PADI qualifications match up to the SSI ones? Is there an equivalence table for these two as well?  My friend is PADI Advanced Open Water (AOW), however there seems to be a SSI qualification between PADI AOW and SSI AOW. Ideally this will be for when we get to the point of booking diving holidays we want to make sure everyone can do everything planned.  The SSI qualifications (excluding free-diving and snorkelling) are:   Scuba Diver Open Water Scuba Diver Specialist Diver Advanced Open Water Diver Master Diver  "
2178,Is it more likely for a viper to bite in a muddy weather?,"Today is / was one of the few days (vacations aside) when I’m completely free, so I really wanted to go out somewhere. Nothing serious – one day of walking in the European woods, with many villages around.  However, I reluctantly resigned having been warned against vipers. The argument was, we’ve been having showers since like three weeks, there’s going to be lots and lots and lots of mud. First, in a dry weather, I may see a viper and walk around it, but I may be completely unable to notice it in the mud. Even more importantly, in a dry weather my ankle boots may protect me from a bite, should I nevertheless happen to annoy the snake – but in the mud, my foot is likely to plunge pretty deep, allowing the venomous snake to reach above my boots, biting me through my trousers.  Are such worries reasonable? If so, how to protect oneself from these dangers (because I find it hard to believe that mud itself would be enough to force someone to stay at home)? Would similar problems occur, for example, in the snow? "
2179,How can I safely wade through swamps/bogs?,"It looks like I may be able to spend couple months from March in Newfoundland. During my last trip I noticed a great number of hauntingly beautiful bogs, right by the road - thus one could effortlessly explore them. Aside from one Bear Grylls episode, I have not seen the swamps being navigated through. The ones with dead trees are the most charming.  Is there a known and proven safe way to walk through them without risking you won't get out? What gear is used?  Granted, March probably wouldn't be a best month, as hypothermia would be quite possible, but do they really get warm sooner than in June?    Is there really any other risk involved other than drowning? Perhaps I missed that but the official classification did not specify any animals living there. "
2180,When do you need compensation training for bouldering?,"Not only, but mainly while bouldering you are likely to push hard moves and strain your body onesided. As a consequence you can pain your muscles, ribbons or tendons. But...   How do I know if the ache in muscles is stiffness and therefore nothing to worry about? How do I notice that I train very onesided and need compensation training? Which training methods do you prefer?   What's most important here is to notice and decide, when you need compensation training for bouldering? "
2181,Snowboarding / Skiing - snow gathers on our goggles - what do you do to deal with this problem?,When we are snowboarding / skiing snow gathers on our goggles. What do you do to deal with this problem?  We can use special liquids like 'fog block' - but are they effective in the terms of snow and rain?  Or maybe wipers would solve the problem? :D [website]Any ideas? 
2182,How do I prevent myself from getting pumped when climbing?,"Usually when I climb I take plenty of rest between attempts however, yesterday I decided that I wanted to test myself and climb 25 problems at my local gym. I chose problems that were below my level but by the 7th problem my forearms just swelled up so much I hadn't experienced this type of stiffness since my first day climbing. (I've climbed consistently for 4 months now) As a result of becoming pumped so quickly I only managed 17/25 problems that night.  From my knowledge, which isn't much, common sense tells me to warm up before climbing and to rest between attempts however, when I watch pros climb competitively, they hardly get any rest between attempts (e.g USA Bouldering Nationals). Therefore there must be some tips/tricks that they use to maximize their performance.  What actions should I perform before climbing to decrease my chances of getting pumped?  What actions should I focus on while climbing to prevent my arms from getting pumped? "
2183,What happens when someone dies on Mount Everest?,"I have read that Rob Hall's body (who died very near the summit in 1996) was discovered. However I have not seen any validation of that. I just watched the movie Everest and I'm curious. Has it been confirmed that his body has been found?  When someone dies on Mount Everest, are there attempts made to recover, or track location of bodies?  "
2184,IOS Map App that creates routes by tracing a path?,"I've been using a topo app on the PC for years that lets you, among other things, trace a route on the map with the mouse, then it gives you the distance and height profile for that route (even turns it into GPS waypoints for you). It's a little heavy, though, lugging a PC in my backpack :)  So, I've tried several mapping apps on IOS, but have yet to find one that will let me trace an intended route in this way. They all seem to do a great job of tracking how far you've gone, how many steps you've taken, how many calories you've burned, etc. However, I'm really not that interested in what I've already done... I was there, I know where I've been. :) I'm more interested in, ""if I scramble up this canyon along this stream, how far is it to the end and back?"" or ""my planned path was blocked, how far would this alternate path be?""   All the apps I have tried will let you create waypoints by touching, then build a route out of the waypoints. That works, but it can be kind of tedious. I also find that I wind up spamming an area with so many waypoints to make reasonably accurate routes that I can no longer read the map on the small screen.  Is anyone familiar with any IOS topo map / GPS apps that allow the user to trace a path with a finger, and then reports distance (and preferably elevation profile) info? "
2185,How effective or ineffective are tactical flashlights on bears?,"I've seen ads touting tactical flashlights, and at least one such flashlight was claimed to be capable of ""blind[ing] a bear"".  I wanted a reality check, and not specifically whether a sufficiently strong tactical flashlight could temporarily blind a bear. My understanding is that people are more visual than many other mammals, and so on egocentric lack of Theory of Alien Minds, customers targeted by the ads would think ""I'm mostly incapacitated when I can't see, so being temporarily blind would be an incapacitating experience to a bear,"" where for bears sight isn't quite so central and a blinded bear may well be capable of getting to you off of hearing and smell, not to mention even more upset for pain in the eyes.  If you want to be able to defend yourself from a bear, how effective or ineffective would a sufficiently strong tactical flashlight be? Would it be an asset or liability combined with a can of bear spray?  Thanks, "
2186,How can I identify Woolly Adelgid on a Hemlock tree?,"Note: An update has been added to this post, and is found below the first set of pictures.    I live in Central Massachusetts, in the town of Holden. We're on the border of the large city of Worcester.   In a previous question, one of my photographs caught the eye of a user here in Massachusetts who is monitoring the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid, an aphid-like tree killer.  This insect is decimating forests and home landscapes all over the country. The New England Area is so badly infested that hemlocks are under quarantine in both Maine and New Hampshire.  It seems the most significant research in New England has been taking place at Harvard Forest, the 3500 acre forest owned by Harvard University. It's located in Petersham, a town about 70 miles west of Boston. Senior Ecologist David Orwig has spent decades studying and educating about what has been called the ""woolly bully"" at the forest and other regions. His research is getting widespread attention. In April of 2015, The National Geographic published an article entitled Are Harvard's Dying Hemlocks a Warning for Trees Everywhere?       The hemlocks here teem with a pest that’s slowly killing them; their demise is all but inevitable. “I’m hoping some will survive,” said Orwig, the forest’s senior ecologist, “but we’re on borrowed time.”    Because this is such an important issue, I'm concerned not only about my own tree, but also about how to identify the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid while out walking, in order to report it to the proper authorities. I'm hoping other people here can be encouraged to do the same.   First, Is my tree infected? An excellent publication detailing the life-stages, with pictures, can be found here. My tree doesn't seem to have the large growths that are the hallmark of the mature adelgid, but I do have a lot of leaves with a white dusty coloring, which can be a sign of a young infestation.  I did find a woolly-looking thing with pinchers attached to a twig, and a few areas of white netting. There are a few round solid lumps, which I thought might be bird droppings, but the experts would know better about that.   All the pictures below were taken in the first week of March, 2017, except the one with the doves, which is from July of 2016. To save space, I've made all of them smaller. Please click on them to see larger, more close-up versions. Some are blurry, but I have others I'd be glad to post instead if need be. Don't hesitate to ask.   The pictures are as follows: First row left: The woolly thing, which dried up after I removed it. First row right: The same thing attached to the branch. Second row left: View of a branch with leaves with white dusty covering; an area of white netting joining some leaves; and a small round mass at the bottom. Second row right: Another look at discolored leaves. Third row left: A view of a branch from behind to show the twigs. Third row right: The picture of a branch taken in July of 2016. Fourth row left: A view of the same branch taken on March 2, 2017. Fourth row right: The base of the trunk, which I didn't realize was damaged until last week, when I went out to take these pictures!              Update: Shortly after posting this I had the tree  examined by a naturalist/ecological arborist who's been studying the adelgid for years and treating trees all over Massachusetts. He said it was very healthy, with good new growth and no evidence of adelgid. He was intrigued by the picture I had posted of the suspected infestation. As part of his research, he's been finding that something had happened, most likely a weather pattern, to cause the adelgids to die off without human intervention. Many previously-infested trees have made remarkable recoveries, most likely including mine. This correlates with information provided by Olin Lathrop's answer below.  He examined all of my trees and plants, and did find some Wooly Adelgid on a hemlock in a completely different area of my yard.   He explained that Wooly Adelgid is identified by the appearance of white, cotton-like masses at the junctions of the twigs and the needles. The wooly substance is a coating covering an adelgid with eggs.   He said my infestation was in a young stage, and didn't cover a large enough section of my tree to be doing major damage. He recommended removing the affected branches, which we did, and keeping an eye on the rest of the tree as we come into the spring and summer. If we see a lot more, and want to treat them, his approach to control begins with spraying the affected area with horticultural oils. The spray coats the adelgids and suffocates them, while not harming the rest of the tree or other plant or animal life. This is the least invasive treatment, and should always be the first choice when possible, especially for a homeowner with only a few trees. If the infestation gets out of control, the next step is to treat the entire tree with an insecticide. Imidacloprid has been used successfully for years, but permethrin seems to have some better qualities, and is becoming more popular. All trees are part of the delicate balance of the outdoor eco-system, and removing them shouldn't be the first course of action.   He agreed that the vicious adelgid is doing tremendous harm wherever it's found. The number of infested trees makes control very difficult, and sadly, especially in forest areas, the adelgids are still winning the war.   I appreciate and give full credit to Olin Lathrop for spotting the problem on the original tree, which precipitated this question. Without his keen eye, and generous help, I would never have had it examined. Then I wouldn't have known I had trouble lurking in a different tree, and probably would have lost it.   Below are pictures of our actual adelgids, taken in March of 2017. They're similar to Olin's, further confirming the correctness of his answer.        "
2187,How do slow sand filters work and are there any alternatives?,"   Slight Introduction:   A slow sand filter is a filter used to purify water. The original design is composed of a layer of gravel, then a layer of fine sand. Sometimes, however, there is an extra layer of bacteria on the top doing most of the purification.  This layer of bacteria is called the Schmutzdecke (German for dirt covering).       Questions:    How do slow sand filters work (I'm referring to ones without the Schmutzdecke)? Are there any other materials that have the same ""water purification"" abilities as sand and gravel? Is the gravel base optional? Does it help with any of the actual purification? How do you grow the Schmutzdecke?     I do see that in the picture, the gravel is used as support. But I'm wondering if it'll affect the clarity of the water if removed.  I've seen that to grow the Schmutzdecke, you just have it sit in water for a week, and it should grow. But I'm not sure that's correct, because   Where will the bacteria come from? The bacteria won't have any food to grow!   And also, setting a bottle with dirty water in it for a week did nothing to the top layer of sand. "
2188,Do squirrels' teeth grow again when lost?,"In another forum, an user claimed that squirrels' teeth grow again if they are somehow lost. So, if you would pull out a tooth (please don't do this!), it would grow back again. Is this true? If yes, how long would it take to grow back?  "
2189,How effective is survival trapping?,"Is it true worth someone's time to learn survival trapping in case of an emergency situation to get food, especially in the winter months?  My gut feeling is that this is not worth my effort to learn this skill because animals can eat through the rope or cord that they employ in setting up their traps. Is my gut feeling correct? The survival trapping websites never show a successful trap catch either.  I am not asking about professional trapping, where trappers use very technical equipment. "
2190,SPF Equivalence,"With SPF 30 sunscreen, I am usually protected for an entire day and wont be getting more than a little darker. Now, I am getting low on SPF 30 cream but I have a large supply of SPF 15. Can I just use that one twice often to make up for the difference?  How does SPF 15 and SPF 30 sunscreen relate? Is it additive in strength or duration? Meaning can 15 be applied twice as often or twice as much? Or is the protection different?  Note that I am looking for how the various protection levels relate. "
2191,Why doesn't it snow much at -30 °C?,"I live in Canada, and we get a decent amount of snow in the year.  However, it is very well known that you never get a lot of snow when the temperature is really cold.  For instance, you never get a foot of snow (30 cm) when the temperature is at or below -30 °C (-22 °F).  What is the reason for this?  Why doesn't it snow much when the temperature is very cold? "
2192,How dangerous are wild horses?,In some parts of the western United States there are herds of wild horses. How dangerous could a herd be to a human on foot while hiking or backpacking?  If they are dangerous how should a human protect themselves? 
2193,What and where is the builder's plate on a boat?,"What and where will I find the builder's plate and CE marking on a boat in Europe?  The CE marking obviously does not apply outside of Europe, but has anyone seen one of these and if so, where should I start looking for one on a boat? "
2194,"Wooden (or natural) obstacles in ""the wild"" looking like horse-jump obstacles","I recognized a bunch of obstacles in an area where I often hike lately. They popped up half a year ago and are spread along our local river. It seems like they are aligned to a trail.  I have not managed to photograph one yet, but they look like jumping obstacles for horses. A few are made out of wooden beams and others are just a straight cut hedges.   What are these and what are they used for? Is my assumption correct that they may be used for a cross horse jumping course?   (I'll take a photo and add it soon) "
2195,Using Lanolin for Merino Clothes,"For our little baby's merino wool overtrousers-diapers we use Lanolin, which is absolutely recommendes by all producers of this kind of overtrousers. My question has two parts:   I have googled this now for a while and no outdoor producer of merino stuff (like woolpower, smartwool or others) even mention lanolin. Would there be any point not to wash my merino stuff with lanolin? I have a jacket with different materials. In this case         Outside: 70% Merino Wool / 30% Polyamid - 22,5 Micron Lining: 100% Polypropylene-Mesh    Would there be any negative effects washing this jacket with lanolin?  Maybe the breathability is affected by a lanolin impregnation but if it is just as the natur is doing it (re-fatting or re-greasing, I am not sure about the vocabular here) it should be still breathable.  "
2196,How do you get bear spray off skin and or gear?,"Let's say that you are out backpacking and a bear spray canister accidentally goes off and gets on your skin or in your eyes or onto your clothing?  It can't be a pleasant experience as it is meant to deter bears, how can you get it off yourself and your gear in the field (as any residue could potentially either get onto your skin from the gear or potentially attract bears)? "
2197,Is this bar-headed goose's behavior an indication of a problem?,"After seeing this question which had this animation:    I was left wondering whether this behavior was ""normal"" or at least healthy. I know sometimes when an animal exhibits odd behavior there's something wrong with it, even if the behavior is normal for other animals, such as humans, or even considered cute.   So is there something wrong with this bird, or has it just learned that a cute behavior causes the bread dispensers people to give it food? "
2198,Does a BCY 425x string harm my tradtional recurve bow?,"I've a Bear Archery Super Kodiak from 2013 with 40 #. I shoot 8,2 gpp arrows on it.

2199,Sign in/Sign out sheets for dangerous passages while hiking!,"Many years ago, while hiking with a friend, we came across a particular point in the trail which was rather dangerous. If one slipped, the fall would surely be fatal.  What struck me most is the fact that there was a sign in/sign out sheets (which were in a green box with a plexiglass lid) at the beginning and end of this particular section of the trail. One was encouraged to print one's name, the date and time. The reason for the signing in and out was to know for a fact that hikers actually made it to the other end. If one did not sign in on the other side, Search and Rescue had a idea of where to look.   These sign in/sign out sheets were in mid trail and there were no sign in sign in sheets at the trailhead and no permits were required either.  My question is this: Are Sign in/Sign out sheets for dangerous passages while hiking a common practice? Are there any laws requiring this? "
2200,What is the history of the Duckbill rock formation in Oregon?,"During an internet search for fun places to go in the Western United States, I came across a number of articles about an unusual rock formation in Oregon called Duckbill. It was called iconic, treasured and beloved.   It had been weakened for years by people standing on, climbing, and falling off it.  It was fenced off for protection of the monument and the people.   In September of 2016, it was willfully  and completely destroyed.  Publications both nationwide, like the National Geographic Society, and even in Europe, including the BBC News, reported the  incident.   Other than the reports of its demise, I'm having trouble finding Duckbill's history, including at the website of Cape Kiwanda State Natural Area.   I have a few specific questions, but any and all information would be welcome.   What type of rock is it made of? Was it created naturally by erosion? Was it formed on purpose by people? When was it given its name?     Source   Source "
2201,Leather Work Gloves or Aramid Fiber Gloves for Bonfires?,Whenever I make a large bonfire I normally use leather work gloves while I'm tending the fire with my fire rake or if I have to move a partially burning log by hand (within reason of course). I've been looking at the aramid fibers that you can buy that can resist up to 932°F (500°C). Would those be better for fire tending than the heavy leather work gloves? Is there a downside to them being synthetic? 
2202,Difference between Mittens and Gloves,"I have heard and hence used the term 'Mittens' for those that I use while rappelling. But, the ones that I use for bike-riding are referred as 'Gloves'.

If it makes easy, we can limit out scope to:   Use case: The way they are used and for the purpose of usage Material those are made-up of. The way they look  "
2203,Are there standard whistle signals for communicating with separated party members?,"Similar to the previous question that turned up when I searched on this topic: Is there a standard set of light signals for mountaineers?, but for sound?   Repeating sets of 3 blasts is standard for distress. Freedom of the Hills mentions pre-arranging a communication system with your party (e.g., 1 blast = general ""how are you"" query; 2 blasts = ""I'm fine""; 3 blasts = ""Help!""). Any other common codes used for simple communication between separated members of a party?  The main thing that seems to be missing from the basic code outlined by Freedom is some clarification around the ""I'm fine"" response. ""I'm fine; keep going"" vs ""I'm fine; wait for me"". And from the group's perspective, telling the separated person to return vs continuing to forge their own path. Anyone know of or worked out a simple system for this sort of signal?  Granted, ""don't get separated"" is a good rule to follow, but things happen, so would be good to have a communication system in place. "
2204,How to abseil without a descender device?,"Lets assume I am abseiling multiple pitches with some tuber device and at some point at a belay I dropped the device. How do I improvise something that does the braking while descending? I still have standard climbing equipment like biners/slings just no braking device. The less equipment needed the better.  One obvious way is to use a Munter hitch, but as this question shows this results in serious twisting of the rope. So I am mostly interested in alternatives and if still is to be the Munter hitch, is there a convenient way to get both strands (loaded towards the top and unloaded towards the bottom) to be parallel? "
2205,What is a suitable workflow for cutting down trees?,"I have many trees on my land that need to be cut down. I would like to know what suitable workflows there are for the whole process. Should I cut a tree down, cut it up into small pieces, and split the pieces to make firewood all in one step? Or should I cut many trees down and move them to a separate area to process the wood? I would like efficiency to be a high priority.   NOTE: Assume the following equipment - 5x8 trailer with winch, 18"" chainsaw, sledge hammer, splitting axe. 10-15 trees. All are 50' or taller. They range from 10""-18"" in diameter. I have all summer to do this. There will be at most 2-3 people working at a time. "
2206,Why are people so worried about Giardia?,"Everyone I have ever been camping with seems to have an unwritten rule never to drink from streams no matter how clear they might seem, for fear of Giardia. I have also heard people telling about having to go to the doctor for a pill and ""living"" on the toilet for a while.  Even as recent as the 1900s, people have been out exploring and drank from streams with no hesitation, but I don't hear stories about people dying (or suffering greatly) from Giardia.  Basically, my real question is: Have our bodies become weaker somehow? Or why is everyone so scared of it now, when no one seemed to care before? "
2207,Is the ACE 1 Ultra-Clean Biomass Cookstove too good to be true?,"I was looking for a loan on Kiva and found this loan in Lesotho (Africa) The product people are borrowing money for is the ACE 1 Ultra-Clean Biomass Cookstove which sounds fantastic. It is designed for use in very rural areas, it is a high efficiency stove that burns any biomass (wood, dung, corncobs, etc) produces low to no smoke.  AND it includes a solar charger, light and USB port for charging your phone. It weighs 4.6 Kg (10 pounds) so it would not be a great backpacking choice.   But it sounds like a great addition to a bike/canoe adventure. It has been out for a couple of years.  I looked around for user reviews and didn't find anything.  It is principally designed for rural home use, and I am considering hauling it around in my canoe behind my bicycle.  So a couple of related questions. I don't have any question about it's efficiency, the claims made and the supporting documentation seem reasonable.    Is there anything comparable to this by other manufactures? What kind of durability is it reasonable to expect?   As single summary question, is this a product I can expect to holdup to the hazards of bike trails and rivers?   Given considerations, it weights a lot and it is not water proof. I can accept these limitations "
2208,How do I make and test a radar-reflecting hat?,"At significant risk of tin foil hat jokes, I’ve read compelling evidence that a homemade hat incorporating angled and crumpled aluminum foil may slightly increase a kayaker’s visibility on radar — not enough to provide real safety by itself, but as a small addition to other best practices.  Thanks to this answer to What can I do to be more visible to other ships’ radar when traveling in a sea kayak? for the link to Radar, Reflectors and Sea Kayaks: A Visibility Study:        How do I replicate or improve the performance of this hat while making it something I’ll actually wear on a long ocean paddle?  Most importantly how do I make sure the design is doing its job as intended especially after use and wear?   "
2209,Cargo capacity of a kayak,"I've been paddling three times (one week each) in rental (Canadian) canoes. My girlfriend and me brought all gear and food with us and there still was plenty of room for our dog in the boat.  I know from internet ""research"" that kayaks provide less space, but I'd like to try using one in the future due to the benefits of a kayak.  The cargo capacities I can find on various websites are somewhat meaningless since I don't know how many kilograms or liters I needed so far.  Therefore, assuming the following requirements:   2 persons one week light-ish tent, mattress, sleeping bags food for the whole time, preferably not only fully processed trekking food no need to carry water   Let's also assume   moderate climate (night temperature not below 10°C, rain not unlikely)  fresh water lakes Sweden    Will this be possible without crazy requirements on clothing and other equipment?  Will two one-man kayaks or one two-man kayak provide more cargo space? "
2210,Impact of throwing away fruit waste on a peak > 3200 m above a glacier,"Is it okay to throw away the non-edible part of the apple - the apple core / or in general fruit waste? Does it decompose on the rock (maybe with the help of animals) and temperature, or does it interfere negatively with the nature? "
2211,Knee injuries prevention using knee protectors,"Knee is basically one of the main joints that provides you the ability to walk. There are several ways to prevent or ease the knee pain (see Knee pain when descending a mountain), but I would like to dive deeper into one of the preventive measures, by using knee protectors.  I've noticed that there are different types of knee protectors out there: knee braces, knee sleeves, knee support, etc. Assuming that one does not have any knee problems, which of the knee protectors are best to prevent knee pain in a long distance hike with frequent ascent and descent trails?   Also, in order to maximize the effectiveness of knee protectors, should the user be wearing it in all situation while hiking (uphill, walking, descending, etc.)? "

2213,How to remove butter stain from raincoat?,"Long story short, I got a huge oily stain on my raincoat. More precisely butter, on the shoulders part. It looks bad, it smells like butter, and I am really not comfortable having it on my clothes + under my nose.   What I've tried so far:   removing the butter mechanically as much as I could (wiping with toilet paper) washing it with soap, by hand washing it in the washing machine, with plenty of dishwasher liquid, as I thought this might remove the stain (as it helped before with other clothes, but not this time)   The stain is still there, and I don't want to wear it like this. It is not a high-tech gear (just a Decathlon poncho), but I would rather not throw it out.  What other ways are worth a try? I haven't found any useful information on the label, just wash on 30 degrees, no chemical cleaning etc.  Also, does it (the butter AND the washing) affect the waterproofness of the material? "
2214,Will beginner notice a difference between lower and higher middle-end stand up paddle boards?,"I'm considering stand up paddling as a sport for rest periods for my legs (running, hiking, cycling) and a way to train upper body muscles.   I've checked the prices, of course the cheapest are the ones from local Walmart-equivalents (300-400[tex]. The ones from local stand up paddle trainer/reseller starts from 1500$. Of course they are much better quality (more layers etc) but... as a beginner, would I notice a difference?  I would paddle on calm waters (a lake) without rocks or other obstacles that could damage the board. Under that circumstances, could I reasonable profit from better, but more expensive boards?  "
2215,What should I do when in an unintentional contact with a bear?,"Let's say I'm camping and I slept close to a river (50ft) and when I woke up a bear was searching through my stuff, what should I do to avoid him? What to do if it notices me? And last but not least, What should I have brought on me? (guns, pepper spray, not big guns and bows though, pistols, revolvers and any thing that can be used with one hand(kind of, 500S&amp;W might not be appropriate))  Assume I'm inside my tent, and I need to either escape or kill the bear, the bear is at 10 feet away or within from my tent, pretty close, no ""acting big"" to scare him, because it might result into sushi me. "
2216,Will Black Bears actually follow you up a tree,"I always see it pointed out, when discussing how to handle/avoid bear encounters, that black bears can climb trees.  Granted, but does that matter?  Has there ever been a case of a black bear pursuing someone up a tree in order to attack them?    It seems logical to me that bears wouldn't fight in a tree like that unless forced to as they are busy using claws for climbing, but I'm not exactly an expert. "
2217,How to kill a bear with a bow?,"I'd like to know which kind of arrow would slow down or kill a bear, which vital spots should I aim at, which kind of bow should do the job, more specifically, against black and grizzly bears?   ""What is the lethal zone of a bear?""  ""What is the minimum weight of a bow to bring down a bear.""  ""Which diameter and broadheads to use for bears?""

Are these worthy concerns, or are there good enough cures available that they can be outruled?  I know that giardiasis and many other diseases take a week or two to develop by which time I will have either died in the wild, or have been rescued. Are there quick-acting ones that will debilitate me faster than dehydration?  To drink, or not to drink? "
2223,What's the best way to apply patches to partially waterproof softshell jackets?,"In a bike accident, I managed to damage a softshell jacket. The damage consists of some smaller holes, and the manufacturer provided me with a patch kit that is basically a piece of the material that is large enough be cut into patches for all the individual holes.  What is the best (i.e. most waterproof) way to sew/apply these patches without too much rain getting in through the seams?  Edit: I know that the question is really similar to How should I patch holes in a waterproof/breathable jacket?, but my situation is slightly different: I already have the material and am just wondering how to best use it.  Edit 2: I just noticed that some confusion might come from the fact that my softshell jacket actually has/is made of some membrane material and promoted as somewhat waterproof (5000mm hydrostatic head). (See Hardshell vs. Softshell jackets .) That's why I am worried about losing some of the waterproofness. "
2224,Is there statistical backing for asserting the wilderness is safer than the highway?,"My brother once told a concerned parent (whose son he was taking hiking in the ""wilderness"" (John Muir trail) for a few days) that the most dangerous part of the trip would be the drive there and back.  All joking aside about a person's driving skill, I believe my brother was almost certainly correct in that statement. Of course, to get real precise you'd have to compare the exact area/type of driving vs. the exact area/type of wilderness exploration. In general though, I'm sure my brother's thoughts are valid.   My question is: does statistical evidence exist to back it up? I'm sure there are statistics for how many hours, on average, a person will be a driver or passenger in a car before they are maimed or killed. But are there the same statistics, for comparison purposes, for wilderness trekking?  IOW: which activity would more likely be life-threatening: walking the Pacific Crest Trail, or driving across the country for the same period of time (same hours per day, same months)? "
2225,Aftermarket access panel to clean inside fresh water RV tank?,"When I was searching for boat inspection plates amazon example I saw a review where someone had bought one to install in the top of their RV fresh water tank to make cleaning inside easy.  I thought it was a wonderful idea, so I bought an extra, but now that it is getting close to spring, I am having second thoughts about installing it.  A bit a quick details, fresh water tank is located under bed in tow behind camp trailer.  The bed lifts to provide access to the tank and additional storage. The water tank is about 25 gallons, 12 inchs tall, and about 2 foot by 3 foot square.  I drain it before winter storage, and run RV anti freeze through the entire system.  The tank is semi transparent plastic.  I general travel with a full tank of fresh water, unless I know there is potable water at my destination.   I was planning to cut a hole in the top of the tank, just like for an inspection port, this would allow me to reach in and scrub the inside of the tank, rinse it out, and flush the system with clean water.   The standard alternative is to fill the fresh water tank with bleach and water, drive around to try and slosh the water around, flush repeatedly, and sometimes use backing soda to get the bleach taste out of the water.    Being able to reach in and clean will make it quicker, easier, and probably more effective to clean the inside of the fresh water tank.   The inspection port is designed to keep water out, so I think there is some risk that sloshing water, or overfilling could force the inspection port cover off. As I would not realize until I stopped, meaning several gallons of water could be sloshing around outside of the tank and inside the camper/trailer.  Are there any examples of this working well or failing miserably?  Are there known good solution to provide cleaning access inside of a fresh water tank?  "
2226,Do military style obstacle course trails exist in a genuinely forested setting and open to the general public?,"I am interested in knowing if there are any military style obstacle course trails that exist in a completely forested setting for the military, police, search and rescue, and so on, yet are open to the general public?  Ideally the course would have be to several miles/kilometers long and both natural and manmade obstacles would be incorporated together.  Do such military style obstacle course trails exist in a completely forested setting that open to the general public (in the USA)? Other countries may be added in as a complement. "
2227,What are the dangers of walking barefoot in towns/cities?,"I've walked barefoot practically all summer for every summer I can remember. However now that I'm a teenager my Mum is saying I need to wear shoes because of glass, needles, worms and diseases. I have done some research but no answer is super clear as to ""What are the dangers of barefoot walking?""  I have stepped on tiny pieces of glass that have penetrated (and were tricky to dig out) as wells as bigger shards that didn't get through, and I have burned and blistered my feet out of my stubbornness. So, what are other relevant dangers of walking barefoot in a small town of Canada? "
2228,Is Permethrin safe for cats after it dries?,"I'm concerned about ticks and want to treat some of my outdoor gear with Permethrin, a spray-on very persistent treatment against ticks and mosquitoes, to reduce the chances that I'll bring home ticks from mountain biking and hiking. However, I know that Permethrin is very toxic to cats.   Is Permethrin relatively safe around cats after it has dried on your gear after initial application?  My cat does have a habit of trying to sleep on my pile of dirty clothes sometimes. Would it be dangerous for my cat to be exposed to my sweaty dirty laundry after a hike, or do I need to keep him completely segregated from gear previously treated with Permethrin? "
2229,How to follow the movements of a player while remaining unnoticed?,"I know that this isn't the best stack exchange site for this question but was the best I could think of, if you think there is a better one please move the question / notify me.  We are 2 friends who loves to play ""treasure hunt"" so each time we meet (once a week) we alternatively prepare a short treasure hunt game for the other one. These games are full of riddles about our common hobbies, past experiences, etc. and requires to move around to find clues hidden in the environment, convince other people to do certain actions without them knowing about the game etc. This game is played in the city or in a really really big shopping center.   Now, following the other one to see how he tries to solve the riddles / deal with people is half of the fun. The objective of the game is solving the riddles to finally find the place where the other guy was hidden so following the player isn't possible. How can I track the movements of the player to allow me to ""participate"" in the game without him knowing where I am?  Just asking him, ""How did you solve this? What did you say to people X?"" isn't very fun.  Edit:  The game is Max 2 hours long. "
2230,Post-hike Care and Pain Relief for Blisters and Hot Spots,"There are many, many articles and web sites that will tell you what to do if you develop a hot spot or blister while on the trail, and need to perform some field treatment to allow you to get back in your boots and finish your excursion.  There are many more that will help you prepare for your hike and take steps to prevent these from happening in the first place.  This includes handfuls of questions and answers here at TGO.SE.  However, what I have not been able to find is anything that discusses the long-term and after-care.  For that time when you've been back to home and work for a day or two, yet there remains this patch of red, angry skin on your heel or toe.  How can you help it heal?  How can you reduce the pain while it heals?  Although I would prefer a generalized answer that helps the entire community, I will describe my own case. I've just finished a week-long vacation with some light hiking at several stops going there and back.  Further, my hiking shoes were not 100% broken in yet.  The good news is that I never blistered, just formed hot spots on the bottom of both big toes.  The bad news is that those spots are still rather painful- as I unpack and clean up, I really notice it.  I've tried a moisturizing foot lotion, but it's been no help.  I'm not sure whether to try a warm water and epsom salt bath or not. "
2231,Birds singing and dancing on telephone wire,"Location: UK East Midlands, suburban garden. Bird: possible marsh tits, something in that size range with a black cap. Time: late July.  Two similar-looking birds were observed making high-pitched, very loud calls while ""dancing"" (wobbling from side to side) perched on a telephone/telegraph wire. If disturbed they would move to another wire and carry on as before.  I have a few related questions. First off, is this courting behaviour? And if so, why are these birds courting when small British bird species do not nest after July?  Second, is this kind of shaking ""dance"" and call combo diagnostic for a particular species? "
2232,Does bottle color affect mold growth?,"I'm currently looking at using colored see-through water bottles. Mold is green because it reflects green light, so I have a theory that a green bottle would grow the least amount of mold because it only allows green light through which the mold can't absorb.  So does bottle color make any difference on mold growth? If so, is it worth it to look specifically for green bottles? "
2233,How to progress to harder graded problems?,"I've only just started bouldering, and we have been using the easiest to grades VB-V1. I find V1 are moderately challenging but the next step up, V2, I just entirely struggle with. What can I do to improve to move up a grade when I always find it vastly different in difficulty, when there is limited access to my local bouldering gym?   This question has a lot of great info, however I am limited to a gym only (no outdoor locally), so everything is predefined, and we can only get there a twice a month maximum as it's quite far away. I visit my regular gym twice a week, however, so what can I do here, or at home, as well? "
2234,Is it safe to carry propane gas cylinder in minivan?,"Is it safe to carry the 20 lbs propane gas cylinder in the minivan?  I have carried the small Coleman's gas cylinder for camping in car trunk but now with family, I am not sure if what's the right way with the larger 20 lbs cylinder. I guess I am asking, is that the standard way people carry it when going camping with a gas stove? or perhaps they carry it in open truck? "
2235,Leave-no-trace-exception for tissues?,"I'm absolutely harsh when it comes to littering in the woods. After a break I take an extra turn to check if everything was picked up. Someone accidentally left a tissue on the last tour and I put it in my pocket. As we randomly chatted about this ""incident"", he told me not to care so much about handkerchiefs cause they are perfectly biodegradable. Is this true?   Extra kudos: What about cotton handkerchiefs?  "
2236,Is a barrel knot the same as a double/triple overhand knot?,"Climbing.com  has a video showing how to tie a barrel knot in the end of a rope. To me (and many of you, I suspect) this knot is the very commonly-used  double overhand knot.  Confused, I looked for other uses of the term barrel knot and found this snippet on the Animated Knots page for a barrel hitch (emphasis mine):     ""Barrel"" Confusion: Unfortunately, the name Barrel has been applied to various other knots. Ashley himself used it as an alternative name (ABOK # 1413, p 259) for the Blood Knot. Some have applied it to the Poacher's Knot, e.g., descriptions by IRATA and Access Techniques, and others to the Double Fisherman's, e.g., Cave Now.    Also, Wikipedia's list of knots says a barrel knot's alternative name is the blood knot:     Barrel knot (blood knot) - joins sections of monofilament nylon line while maintaining much of the line's inherent strength   However, the blood knot and double fishermans/double overhand are definitely different knots.  So what's happening here? Is this just another name for the same knot, or is this a clear misuse of the name by a well-established climbing website? "
2237,What's the problem with burying toilet paper?,"In the backcountry, we should bury solid human waste (i.e. poop), and we are told to carry out toilet paper.  According to this answer on tissues, for some kinds of waste the ecological impact is small, but we should still leave no trace for social reasons.  If I bury my poop and bury (biodegradable) toilet paper along with it, what is the harm done?  The ecological impact should be small, and it is unlikely another hiker will see my toilet paper.  Then why do we need to pack it out?  Note: I am assuming areas where burying human waste is considered good practice in the first place, thus excluding areas where visitors are required to carry out solid human waste. "
2238,How to transport diving knives / shears?,"If I am required to transport my diving equipment (in the UK and Abroad) what are the best practices of transporting my diving knife / shears?  If on a plane this can just go in the hold luggage same as transporting any knife, but the UK seems to allow knives and other weapons which are part of sport equipment to be transported so long as it is with the equipment however, it can still be taken off you if you're under the influence, acting aggressively etc. I'd assume this is not the same everywhere and I'd have to take some precautions / research other countries. So some idea of how other people transport their knives would be good to know, or even if they don't and hire them instead as part of equipment hire? "
2239,Tent floor length relative to height,What is a good rule of thumb for tent floor length relative to height? I'm tall and looking for a backpacking tent. How many inches more than my height should I look for in the floor? 
2240,What sleep quality do you get in the outdoors?,"I should say I haven't ever done anything very outdoorsy, but I would like to make sleeping outdoors a part of the bicycle touring which I hope to do. But a worry for me is that I have always had problems getting proper sleep even indoors, and I want to make sure that I maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I am very easily distracted by the breeze and by outdoor noise or the general openness (whenever I try to read a book in the park). What is your experience? Would a tent or tarp be better for being closed vs open? Earbuds? Would animal noises be able to wake you up in the night? Is it possible to sleep properly in heavy rain? "

2242,Can you get burned by boiling water on everest?,"At sea level, pure water boils at 100°C. In my hometown, water boils at 97°C, and being at a higher elevation we always had to boil or cook our food longer than the recommended times given in recipes.   I recently learned that it was impossible to cook a hardboiled egg on Everest, because water boils at only ~70°C at the higher camps, so the egg whites can't get hot enough to cook and get solid.   My initial research seems to indicate that at 70°C, you could hold your hand in a pot of water for almost half a second before getting burned, so if you were to spill boiling water over yourself high on Everest, with the combination of elevation and cold air, would you still burn yourself?      Side Question: Water boils at higher temperatures if it is impure or has minerals in it. Supposing you wanted to boil an egg on Everest (in the name of science) how much salt/what would you need to put in the water in order to bring the boiling point back up to 100°C or a temperature high enough to cook the egg solid?  "
2243,How do you pitch a tarp so that you will not get wet in a heavy rain?,"A noted authority (Ben Crowell) stated in a comment on What sleep quality do you get in the outdoors?     A properly pitched tarp works fine in a heavy rain. It just requires   practice to set it up properly. I've sat out a very intense storm   under a tarp without getting wet.   Question:  How?  For example: How big does it have to be?  Does the tarp serve as its own ground cloth, or do you have a separate ground cloth?  Will this work for a prolonged rainstorm?  Will it work above timberline?         "
2244,How should I position my hummingbird feeders to attract the most birds?,"I'm trying to increase the hummingbird population in my yard in Northeastern United States. I grow certain types of flowers specifically designed to keep them happy, and have often found them drinking from flowers people say they'll completely ignore.   I have one plastic feeder which I keep filled with nectar. I make that at home, or buy a bottled product made only of sugar and water, because red dye and other additives generally found in commercially prepared nectars are dangerous, and sometimes fatal.  My plan is to increase the number of feeders, but I'm not sure about the best way to position them.  Specifically:   Is proximity to other types of bird and squirrel feeders a consideration?   Is there a sun or shade preference? Does the height from the ground matter? Should they be near trees and bushes, or is it okay to put them in an open field?  Can they be close, or attached, to a window? Can they be near each other, or should there be a distance between them? (I ask this because I was told that hummingbirds are territorial, and a male can guard a perimeter of up to 3 feet, making it important to keep their feeders at least that far apart.) Should they be among the flowers they like, or is the feeder a good way to attract them to different parts of the yard?   If you know of anything I haven't mentioned, I'd appreciate all suggestions.  "
2245,Can you boil water on top of Everest?,"We recently had the question Can you get burned by boiling water on everest? and not to long ago the question Why aren&#39;t there any electric stoves that can be used for cooking where you can&#39;t build a fire?  The first teaches us, the higher you go the lower the temperature at which water boils. The second teaches us, by weight battery operated stoves are highly inefficient.   Assuming you packed a small gas stove to the top Mount Everest 8,848 m (29,029 ft) would the gas burn?  It is cold, the air pressure is low, the oxygen content is low, it is windy, there are several challenges.   Would a propane stove, wood fire, or other fuel source burn at elevations and conditions at the top of Everest? Is it even possible to light a fire to boil the water that won't get hot enough to cook an egg?  "
2246,"How to ""hide"" text so that it can't be vandalized but without damaging any public property?","This might be off-topic so I understand if this gets closed.  I'd like to set up a kind of treasure hunt (perhaps geocaching) for my friends. I was thinking that I could take pictures of places (signs, doors, corners of buildings, stuff like that) but from quite close so that you won't see the surroundings to make it a bit harder, and hide something (text, a hint) to where the picture was taken.   An example: A picture of a graffiti from under a bridge (the picture shows only the graffiti). My friends, once they find out where the graffiti is, go to the bridge and find the next hint.   The problem is how to place the hint (probably text) to the place I want so that it stays there. If I'd leave a post-it note, there's a chance someone will take it if they see it. If I write with a marker on a wall, it'd probably stay there, but I'd rather not do any ""permanent"" damage to buildings and structures.   Any ideas how to accomplish this? How to hide text on public so that it stays there and without damaging property? "
2247,How should I vet belayers? What should I look for?,"The other night I went to the climbing gym, intending to look for a climbing partner once I got there. (My usual gym climbing partner isn't available to climb as often as I want to.) The gym provides a whiteboard where you can write your name if you're looking for a partner.  A woman came up to me and offered to climb. She said she was there with a friend, but the friend didn't know how to belay. This was my only real clue that she herself might be inexperienced as a belayer -- probably the two of them were mainly there to boulder. I checked that she had the card tied to her harness that the gym gives you if you've passed their belay test. I belayed her on a climb, and then she belayed me. The belay device was a grigri.  When I was ready to be lowered after finishing the climb, she initially dropped me about half-way down the wall at very high speed, then suddenly stopped me and lowered me much more slowly the rest of the way. When I got to the bottom, she was very embarrassed and apologetic. She apparently hadn't understood how to control the speed when lowering with the grigri, and had probably just pulled the lever back all the way and let go with her hand on the brake strand. She left immediately after this.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to screen potential belayers in a situation like this, and what to do if they seem inexperienced? The best thing I'm coming up with so far, other than checking for the belay card, is to ask explicitly how experienced they are. (A lot of people seem to ask, ""How long have you been climbing?,"" which is probably a nice neutral way of getting this kind of information.) Then if they say they're inexperienced, I can give them a quick mini-review. "
2248,How to get rid of illegal artificial paints on historical monuments?,"India is known for its historical monuments and Caves are essential part of them. While among them, almost all major tourist attractions are very well conserved and looked after, unfortunately some of them are yet to be admired at that level.   I don't want to get into why the Archaeological Survey of India is so ignorant and careless about the majority of the historical places and overall conservation activities.   As a watchful tourist, I have seen plenty of places that are easily reachable and (hence?) spoiled by careless, ignorant people painting their names on the walls of the caves and forts and what not.  The good part is that the authorities are trying to reach out to frequent travelers, experienced mountaineers and archaeological experts to identify ways to prevent the damage, set new rules and encourage new ideas as to how to get the paint removed without damaging the structure and the rock.    Given the authority and opportunity, many of us are looking forward to contributing towards the initiative.  Have you known of trusted/proven ways to remove paint from a historically important surface without damaging it?  EDIT: Majority of the monuments I am referring to are about 400 to 1000 years old. I do understand that it is really not a span to sum up in two lines of course. But you know, that's the whole point about conserving them. If people and authorities do not care, its a huge asset to be ruined.  Secondly, and more importantly the rock/stone surfaces I am referring to are Basalt. "

2250,How would navigation be different while hiking at night?,"If one were to hike during the night and sleep during the day, what differences in navigation would one have to take into account?  In my experience you are more on instruments (such as a compass or GPS) so to speak because of the lower visibility, but are there any other differences? "
2251,What is the sport of Horse Boarding?,"Recently a user mentioned something called Horse Boarding. At first I thought she was talking about boarding horses, like in a stable, but she was actually referring to an activity that's popular, especially in the UK.   What exactly is the sport of horse-boarding? How is it done? Is it only in the UK, or in other parts of the world?  "
2252,How do choices in design of a paddle-craft influence its handling characteristics?,"If you imagine cutting a canoe or kayak along each axial plane, you get three shapes.  If you cut along the  waterline and look down from above, you get the plan.  Cut thwart-wise at the widest point and view from head-on, that's the cross-section.  The cross-section may or may not include tumblehome, a narrowing of the sides toward the gunwales.  Finally, cut lengthwise and view from the side, that's the rocker.  Designers have a variety of shapes to choose from for each of these, as the sketches below illustrate.    (This discussion ignores things like external keels and tracking channels.)  As a paddler, you will need to learn how your craft handles, and will observe these characteristics:   Stability - high resistance to capsizing Speed - low resistance to moving forward through the water Maneuverability - low resistance to changes in direction Tracking - high resistance to wobble (aka jitterbug) while moving forward   My question is how the various choices in plan, cross, and rocker translate into improvements or sacrifices in stability, speed, maneuverability, and tracking.  I already have some broad intuitive notions, as well as a sense that what improves one of these traits generally degrades another.  I am wondering if someone can help with the gritty details, possibly even get into the physics and mathematics of it (i.e. give us a primer on fluid dynamics as it relates to paddle sports.)  Just as an example, I have a kayak with a flat rocker, mid-range plan, and gently rounded cross-section with tumblehome.  This kayak is very stable, has good tracking, is reasonably maneuverable, although it is not fast.  If it were narrower, my guess is it would be faster but less stable.  If the cross-section was more round, it would be more maneuverable but at the expense of its good tracking.  Are these ideas correct?  Why exactly?    Note: The image captions are, in order: long narrow plan, short wide plan, flat cross-section, round cross-section with tumble home, vee or hard-chine cross-section, flat rocker, moderate rocker, round rocker.

So getting lost and starving to death are not primary concerns.   Related Question How can I recognize a game trail? "
2254,Why did people rub snow on frozen feet?,"If you read old books from cold areas, it's not infrequent to run across the idea of rubbing snow on one's feet when they got frozen or frostbitten.  However, subjectively, it seems to me that this would only make the wounds worse.  Having lived my whole life in places where it gets cold, the best way I know of taking care of frostbite is to warm up the member.  Was there any logic behind this practice?  Is this method encouraged / discouraged by modern medicine? "
2255,Why does suspension trauma happen?,"This question once more brought up the topic of suspension trauma.  I tried to read up on the topic, but found that the Wikipedia page was not as informative as I would have liked. Especially I'm still unclear as to what exactly it is that leads to suspension trauma:   Is it being unconscious while standing/hanging/... upright? Or is it the actual suspending (generally in some sort of harness) that somehow interferes with the blood flow in a way that will eventually harm you?   I guess I was wondering about this because the exact reason will also change how one should go about situation in which suspension trauma could become an issue. Were #1 above correct then one wouldn't have to be terribly concerned as long as the person was still conscious. In case #2 on the other hand we're basically racing a clock from the second somebody is suspended somewhere... However for #2 I guess the issue could be mitigated by special gear which prevents the circulation/suspension issues all-together? "
2256,Unofficial camping in Kettle Moraine State Forest,"I'm going to be hiking the ice age trail in the Northern unit, between shelter 1 and 2.   Do you think I would be fine to just pull off the trail and find a good spot to pitch a tent in an unofficial capacity? There seem to be only 5 official spots to camp along the route and they are all reserved.    Specifically, how would the rangers react?  I know that some parks are more lax than others about camping at unofficial sites. (I know and practice leave no trace.)  There are more campsites but only 5 ""backpacking"" sites on the trail (dispersed canping) as opposed to pulling up the camper to a 12x12 plot of grass with neighbors.  See [website]"
2257,How to prevent an autoblock knot from twisting?,"When tying my autoblock knot my cord keeps twisting, and it does not end up looking nearly this nice:    I use a double-fisherman loop of cord that stays permanently tied, and it lays flat. How can I prevent my cord from twisting?  Perhaps I should pre-twist my cord to counter the twist that the knot introduces? What do others do? "
2258,What is the warning call for falling rocks in your area?,"I was inspired by the question ""What should one do when climbing if someone above you yells ROCK?"" to ask what the equivalents are around the world.  So, what would I shout to warn someone below me of falling rocks?  Equivalently, what word should I react to when I hear it shouted?  I've created an answer as a Community Wiki to accumulate knowledge from everyone; please contribute to that. "
2259,Differences between shock absorber and via ferrata set,"What are the differences between a shock absorber as it is used in professional rope access and a via ferrata set?  As I found out that in my country shock absorbers have to fulfill EN 355 and via ferrata sets EN 958. Are there any noteworthy differences like length, strength, maximal force or so?  Can a industrial climbing shock absorber be used in combination with two slings and suitable carabiners for via ferratas? Or vice versa?  Edit: For both cases I think about tear-webbing absorbers. "
2260,Which option should you use for a multi-pitch climbing anchor after traverse?,"I am going to do a climb that has a long lateral traverse I drew up three options, and Option #2 seems to me to be preferable to the other options.    What do you think the best option is for this situation? Also, if a roof was added above the anchor, does this change your opinion? I imagine getting pulled into the roof head-first if your second falls wouldn't be very nice. "
2261,Good resources for climbing,"We have a number of questions dealing with how start climbing, how to learn it (and how not to learn it) - e.g. Is it realistic to teach yourself rock climbing?, What to teach someone who wants to start lead climbing?, Reference request: books on self-rescue while climbing  Regardless from how I am practising and learning climbing, I would be happy to read one or two good books (or online courses, or other comparable resources) about the topic, since I really enjoy learning from books. The things I am mostly interested in are climbing safety, technique and tactics for sports and trad climbing. I am not so much interested in mountaneering or bouldering.  Could you recommend any books, maybe including some details about the books' focus and content and what makes it recommendable?   (Since not all of our users have english as their mothertongue, I think including great books in foreign languages would be a good idea.) "
2262,Getting into canoeing - UK,"It's been a beautiful Sunday here in the UK today and I went by the river (Thames) with my girlfriend to get some sunlight and fresh air. (We rarely do that, so that might be why I'm writing a question right now.)  We've seen quite a lot people canoeing on inflatable canoes on the river and we thought: Hey! That actually seems fun! Could we do that?  So I looked up inflatable canoes on eBay and these seem rather cheap - then I tried to look up how to approach ""getting-started"" but I'm a bit confused now.  This leads to a question: As a total water-newbie(my experience with water ends on swimming in a pool back when I was a child)what do I need to do to be able to legally and safely canoe on Thames?  Do I need any official training? Do I or my canoe need to have a licence? "
2263,Are Italian mountain huts accessible when unstaffed? Do I need a key?,"I am considering a late October trek through the boundary area between Ticino (Switzerland) and Verbano Cusio Ossola (Italy), including the Valle Cravariola.  This takes be along several bivouacs and rifugi on both sides of the border.  Because camping may be difficult and of unclear legality (although I suspect bans would not be enforced much in this time and place), I am considering to sleep in mountain huts, passing along such huts or bivouacs as Campolatte, Sironi, Bonasson in Italy (operated by the Clup Alpino Italiano (CAI)) and Grossalp in Switzerland (operated by the Unione Ticinese Operai Escursionisti (UTOE)).  The Grossalp hut is open year-round, but how is it for the Italian huts?  I do not expect any huts to be staffed in late October, but is there still an open part where I can sleep?  If yes, do I need a key (Wikipedia mentions the Alpenvereinsschlüssel)? "
2264,"Choosing a backpack size between small and medium, which is preferable?","After reviewing many backpacks, both online and in person, Iv'e decided that I want the Osprey exos 48. Unfortunately, the only Osprey dealer in my area carries only the exos 58, and they had it only in the medium size, which I tried and felt great on my back, although the hip belt felt was a bit large (I'm slim fit). Since the 58 is too big for me, I'll be ordering the 48 online. My torso is of size 18"", which by the Osprey sizing chart (attached) means small or medium. I'm reasonably sure that the small would be an even better fit for me, but is it worth taking the chance?  What's worse, a slightly too big or slightly too small backpack?   "
2265,Differences between Fjällräven's men and women backpacks,"I'm looking for a Keb 52 backpack but can only find the women's model where I am (and I'm a 190cm-tall man). Here are the specs for the men's and women's models on Fjällräven's website:   Men model: [website]Women model: [website]What is the actual difference between the two models? Could the difference be so minimal that such a backpack, once the straps are adjusted, would fit nicely anyway? "
2266,"Fact or Fiction: ""If you want to keep your feet warm, wear a hat."" (and the various explanations for it)","Inspired by several questions and answers here and also one at Biology SE, I have been looking around to try to find out whether this idea I heard constantly as a youth has any merit, or it just folk-wisdom gone bonkers.  Usually expressed in the slogan given in the title- if you want to keep your feet warm (at night), wear a hat (to bed)- this counter-intuitive notion was repeated to me often by many I respected.  My relatives, Scout Leaders, and others all believed this notion.  The explanation falls into one of a handful of broad categories, but the most common is that things like hearts, brains, and guts are very important, while things like fingers and toes, not so much.  So when the body is in a situation where it needs to ration resources it might steal resources from the extremities in order to give a greater share to the vital organs.  It does this by constricting the blood vessels in the extremities, reducing blood flow to those areas, and keeping more of the warm, oxygenated, nutrient rich blood nearer the core.  This explanation seems to be confirmed in Causes and remedies for cold feet.  Another explanation I heard was that the majority of heat loss in the body is via the head.  Some would continue by saying that heat rises, and the head in on top.  I recall one grizzled old outdoorsman I encountered in college making all of us put our hands just over our heads and ""feel the heat.""  But it seems this claim may not be due to physics, but that people tend to cover the body rather thoroughly when outside in the cold, except the head.  So the heat simply has no where else to go.  In reality, given uniform insulation, the body loses heat proportional to surface area.  See, for example: Fact or fiction: Does wearing a hat keep you warmer? and the linked Biology question.  Of course, this may be exactly the source of my title's slogan in the case of sleeping - you are everywhere wrapped in an insulated sleeping bag, except your head.  So when you add socks and blankets around your feet while leaving your head exposed, you aren't really helping.  Putting it all together, it is difficult to separate cause and effect, science and myth, and determine what exactly goes on in a body out in the cold.  What, if anything, can one reliably conclude?  "
2267,Why don't climbing professional use all their fingers on small holds?,"Why do climbing professional use less than 5 fingers on some holds?    From [website]I mean, why don't they put the other fingers, even if they don't quite fit, to reduce by a few grams the corresponding tension on the other fingers. Adding more fingers would reduce the global tension in the other fingers that are hardly used: why not? "
2268,What happened to my sunglasses?,"I have a pair of Ray-Ban polarized sunglasses (so not some cheap drugstore sunglasses, and they are made in Italy not China) that I got two years ago.  I just got back from a vacation, and I noticed that one of the lenses has some sort of damage along the bottom:    On the inside of the lens, you can see some of the coating has started to come off:    What happened?  I never dropped them.  When they're not on my face or hanging from my shirt collar, I always put them inside a hard case.  I never leave them sitting unprotected in a car.  If I ever leave them in a car, it will be for less than an hour, and they will be inside of the case inside of my backpack.  Sometimes I will clean them using Zeiss lens wipes.  Also, I don't wear them every day - I only wear them on trips, so they have not been subject to excessive wear.  I have heard of something called ""crazing"" that can affect lenses that are subject to excessive heat - could that be what happened here?  The only other thing I can think of is sweat, but I don't know if perspiration can damage lenses. "
2269,Systematic and random error of GPS or barometric altimeter. How to optimally use GPSMAP 66s?,"A barometric altimeter is supposed to be more accurate than a GPS altimeter in the relative sense (total ascent, total descent, during stable weather), but may have considerable error in the absolute sense (more than 100 metre error if pressure has changed a lot since last calibration).  The GPS altimeter may have an error of perhaps 3–4 times the horizontal error, which for positioning may be much better than the barometric altimeter; however, the GPS altimeter is noisy such that tracks are noisy and ""total ascent"" is a fiction.  See also Random and systematic error of GPS or barometer based altitude measurements.  I've personally found that for accurate positioning, the GPS altitude (on my GPSmap62 which has no barometric altimeter, or on the GPSMAP66c which does have one) is often more accurate than the barometric altimeter.  Is there a combination of settings that will improve the accuracy of the barometric altimeter?  Alternately, can I disable it in favour of GPS-measured altitude?  Some online sources about GPS altitude error agree with me:  From geoawesomeness:     The general rule of the thumb is that vertical error is three times the horizontal error.    From borgelt instruments:     the GPS altitude is the GEOMETRIC altitude above  Mean Sea Level accurate to 10 to 20 meters* and explains from theory and practice that GPS altitude at 10 to 20 meters (35 to 70 feet) error  is superior to Pressure Altitude.   From dcrainmaker.com states (emphasis mine):     Barometric altimeters from a sports standpoint tend to give you graphs that are ‘shaped’ correctly – meaning when you go up the graphs show an incline, and when you go down they show a decline.  The challenge though with barometric based devices is that* *the baseline altitude can sometimes be incorrect.  This is because normally barometric altimeters are calibrated off of a known barometric pressure reading.  In airplanes for example, this ‘calibration factor’ is constantly being tweaked as the pilot flies the plane.   Pressure changes can easily lead to barometric altitude error in excess of 100 meter.  My horizontal accuracy is usually around 5 metre, which is consistent with an elevation accuracy in the order of 15-20 metre.  Although I can access the GPS altitude via the satellite screen or frequently calibrate the barometric altitude by the GPS altitude, an automated low-battery solution would be preferable.  I've noticed there is an ""auto calibration"" option, but I don't understand what it really does.  What combination of settings can I use? "
2270,Sleeping solo in a double sleeping bag,"I'm buying a double sleeping bag for travels with my girlfriend. Parameters (of the bag, not the girlfriend): 1500g of goose down, 680 in³/oz (393 cm³/g), 90/10% down/feather, rated to -9...-15°C T-comf when two people are inside.     Question one: Would I be comfortable sleeping in it alone or would the extra inner space sap my warmth? What if I hogtie the bag with a bungee/paracord? Question two: what would be the (approximate) T-comf for such solo sleeping?..     NOTE RE: ZIPPABLE BAGS Yes, I had had thought about them. However, there are a few cons:   They have to be Left/Right, i.e. matching. The company that I'm buying my bag from doesn't produce matching sleeping bags.   I've owned zippable bags and checked out some. All of them had one problem: the zip would stop at the shin level, basically creating two separate spaces for feet. That could be uncomfortable to sleep in (a double mummy-type bag would have a tapered but single feet space). Two bags are more expensive than a single double bag, and we're talking down which already has a hefty price tag Two bags (usually) weigh more than a single bag from the same model range  "
2271,When do insects normally hatch from insect houses?,I have a bug house and it looks as if several insects have laid in the house over the spring/summer. All of the bamboo seems to be clogged up and has been for a couple of months.  Are there still insects in there to hatch?  Would insects dig this out next year to lay again?   
2272,Sea fishing rod all rounder,"I'm looking at getting into sea fishing, I used to do coarse fishing.   I'd like an all rounder rod to try pier fishing and maybe some beach casting or fishing from a sea wall.  What should I look for most, rod length? Casting weight? Etc. Seen one which is 9ft with casting weight of 200g.   I don't know what weights I need either, or how rod length and weight affect each-other. "
2273,Is it worth it to switch from Osprey Atmos to Exos to save weight?,"My wife and I started hiking this season (we have been cycling for 10 years before that). We have pretty light and compact gear, except for the backpack. We carried Osprey Atmos 50 and Osprey Talon 22 on a week trip. Everything including food and water fit in nicely. Base weight of the 50 liter pack was around 7,5 kilograms and it was about 15 at the most with the food and 5 liters of water. Now I am considering to switch to Osprey Exos for the next season to save additional 500 grams.  My concern is the suspension system on the Exos which seems to be less comfortable than that on the Atmos. I already had some discomfort when carrying 15 kilograms in the Atmos. I am concerned the weight saving might not be worth it.  Is 500 gram weight saving significant? How noticeable is the difference in comfort from 500 gram weight saving?  I have another crazy idea - bring the Atmos to the local workshop which mades my bike bags and let them replace the heavy fabric on the Atmos by a lighter fabric. But I would prefer not to do that.  Update: We hike in northern Europe, temperatures 10-20 degrees Celsius, 5 days without a resupply (at most), water has to be carried for at most one overnight stay. Winds up to 35 m/s, but rarely. No snow. We hike in trail runners and most of the gear is already reasonably light. Our combined base weight is about 14 kilograms (for two persons). "
2274,Garmin inReach vs. overcast sky,"Garmin says about inReach that to have a two-way satellite communication ""you need to have a clear view of the sky"".    And what about cloud cover?.. Say it's winter and 100% overcast with angry cumulus clouds 100% of the time. How much interference / hindrance would that give?  NOTE Maybe not everyone knows what's an inReach is. It is NOT a GPS navigational device per se, it is a two-way satellite communicator that uses the Iridium network. "
2275,How to wind-proof an existing tent,"I have this tent: Fjord Nansen Tromvik II. It's very well built and thought-out, lightweight (around 2kg / 4.5 lbs) and is a pleasure to sleep in during summer / early autumn.  However, since it's so lightweight and very well ventilated (with outer fly not even touching the ground), in windy conditions it feels almost like sleeping without a tent :)    I don't want to buy a second tent at the moment. Is there a simple / inexpensive way to wind-proof this tent? Shall I buy some cloth and sew it to the external tarp to create a skirt? "
2276,Fishing reel line capacity,"With modern high strength, small diameter lines, spinning and bait casting reels can hold a tremendous amount of line. I usually spool up about half capacity with an inexpensive monofilament then fill up with the better line. That gives me much more good line than my longest cast, plus plenty for retying, etc. And then there's all that line I'll never use.  In freshwater fishing, why do these reels still have so much excess capacity?  Are any manufacturers now making lower capacity reels that are not ultralights or similar? "
2277,How is an attempt defined in sport climbing?,"I started to track my finished routes and I cannot find anywhere a definiton of an attempt. Of course if I try to send the route, give up in falf, go down, have a snack and then go again and finish it then it's two attempts.   However what if I fall in middle, and after descending a bit I solve the part and send a route? Is it two attempts, too, or should I complete it again in one go? If so, is it then two or three attempts (does the first climb with fall count as one or two attempts)? "
2278,Should I add holes to my fire pit/bowl?,"I own a cheap but relatively effective solid metal bowl-shaped fire pit:    (football [soccer ball] provided for scale)  We sometimes have difficulty getting it lit - the smallest kindling takes well, but I think it doesn't burn hot (or long) enough for larger twigs to catch. I've been wondering if maybe a bit more airflow would help.  Would you recommend drilling some airholes in the base of the pit? If so, any tips on size and/or location? Anything else I need to be careful of - such as integrity of the weatherproof paint? "
2279,How fast does suspension trauma happen?,"In this question I asked about suspension trauma and why it's effects come to be. Apparently the main reason is reduced blood flow/ circulation. This is due to   blood vessels being constrained/pressed on by the harness, lack of movement in leg and feet muscles aggravating the problem.   My question now is this:   How fast will suspension trauma happen? How quickly does one have to react would one be confronted with such situation where a group member is suspended and cannot immediately self-rescue or be rescued?   Wikipedia mentions: ""Onset of symptoms may be after just a few minutes, but usually occurs after at least 20 minutes of free hanging."" 20 minutes doesn't seem a whole lot of time!  The point I'm getting at:   How long should we wait/try rescue until we have to start using increasingly desperate measures to save the suspended persons life by getting them off the suspension?        In case this helps, let's assume the following hypothetical scenario: a party of 2 climbers on a multi-pitch climb. The weather is good and decently warm (i.e. no additional problems because of cold temperatures, winds, ...).  "
2280,Eating ants/termites on outdoor expeditions,"Recently on one of the jungle trails we came across a colony of termites and we went ahead and tasted them (Bear Grylls style?). We did the same with the weaver ants which are quite common in the South Indian forests (these do taste good by the way!).   I know ants and termites are a rich source of protein. However, according to one of my friends they carry parasites which could harm human beings.   I wanted to know if we could end up in trouble with these kind of culinary adventures (we do not eat them as a primary source of food). Any precautions to be taken?  Would love to know if any of you have done something similar as well :) "
2281,Should one store a tent loose for prolonged periods between uses to maximize its lifetime?,"Explanation of why my question is not a duplicate of What is the best way to store my tent?.   I am specifically asking about an aspect not addressed in the earlier question or any of its answers: does prolonged storage (several years, not several months) in its stuff sack without ever taking it out affect the lifetime of a tent?  We have two tents, one smaller than the other; we use the smaller one when we expect mostly fine weather.  We use the larger tent only when the likelihood of bad weather is high. Thus, the larger tent may remain in its sack for more than a year.  Once, after prolonged storage, the rainfly failed.   Is it likely that keeping the tent in its stuffsack for a couple of years was the cause of the failure, and that its exposure to UV over its years of use made it really inadvisable to store it this way?      "
2282,Is a .22 air-rifle powerful enough for a clean kill of a rabbit?,Many many years ago me and my brothers used to go rabbit hunting with air-rifles. I was pretty young TBH and the details are not sharp in my mind. It occurred to me that the .22 calibre air-rifle that we we're using at the time wasn't very powerful. Would this even kill a rabbit cleanly?  In the UK this is pretty much the most powerful gun (there's .175 air rifles too) you can get without a license.   If I wanted to go hunting today would this rifle by adequate?  What weight pellet should I be looking for?  What muzzle velocity would be adequate?  How close would I need to get? 
2283,"Fisherman rescue, what gear is required?","Apologies for the word problem. I'm sure there's a simple solution or two, but I'm trying to work out a real world scenario. We used to indoor top rope belay but that was years ago in boy Scouts so our rock climbing knowledge is incomplete and rusty. We've fished this area for years without needing rescue equipment but as everyone gets older and with the level of parkour required to fish this creek, I feel it's time to be more prepared.  Likely scenario: pair of fisherman radio for help with sprained/broken ankle. Unable to follow creek rest of the way to the exit point.  Worst case scenario: single fisherman misses 15 minute radio check-in. Assume unconscious.  Environment: single lane (shared w/ oncoming traffic) mountain road follows creek being fished. Approximately 5 miles between entry/exit points. Road can be as much as 50 feet above creek and incline can be as steep as sheer cliff face though it's usually a sharp incline with near unclimbable shifting gravel. 1 hour drive from cell service, another 1 hour drive to Gunnison hospital.  Rescue team: pickup truck with two adults. We'll drive up till we spot fisherman. Probably anchor to the truck or nearby pine trees, blocking the road for other campers/fisherman. Alternate route for them would be a 5 hour drive around so I believe blocked traffic will wait.  Question: What gear should we prep for potential emergency rescue? I'm assuming this is similar to crevasse rescue without ice picks? "
2284,"How rapidly (or slowly) is work progressing on ""consumer"" exoskeletons for baby boomers to extend their hiking and backpacking years?","Several years ago, the Washington Post had an article titled This remarkable new exoskeleton slips on like a boot and makes your walking more efficient.     Engineers at Carnegie Mellon University created this unpowered,   effort-reducing ankle exoskeleton. The walking-assist clutch engages a   spring in parallel with the Achilles tendon when the foot is on the   ground, offloading the calf muscles and making walking easier.  (Lisa   Lau and Steve Collins/Carnegie Mellon University)       The latest exoskeleton technology doesn't need an outside power   source  to boost your strength. It harnesses the power of your own   muscles to  put a spring in your step instead. And soon baby boomers   could be  using it to keep hiking and jogging just a few years longer.   As of the end of 2015, this device reduced the energy required for a healthy person to walk on a flat surface by 7%.  See the line under the picture at Greg Sawicki on Successfully Reducing Walking Metabolic Cost.  If you choose to watch the video, which is heavy on the physics and engineering of the device, it is only the last six minutes or so that discuss the benefits for healthy people; the first 35 minutes or so discuss the benefits for stroke victims.      How much has work progressed on this or similar devices since 2015?  Is there any projection as to when ordinary consumers might be able to order a pair at a cost commensurate with other high-end sporting-goods items, e.g., a pair of high performance skis?  Has any TGO user tried one in the lab or in the field?   Footnote: Note that exoskeletons are in development for the army and to aid paralyzed people to walk, but, important and life-changing as these developments are, this is not what this question is about.  See, for example this story in the Washington Post about a woman paralyzed from the waist down who is walking the Appalachian Trail with an exoskeleton costing tens of thousands of dollars. "
2285,"What are ""burnable gasses""?","When wood is heated, the first thing to ignite are the ""burnable gasses"" released by the heating process (producing flames).  Some time later, the combustion of these gasses heat the wood to the point that the carbon eventually burns (seen as embers).    What is this gas which is given off by the wood when it is heated?  To clarify:   There are two broad stages of combustion, which can be summarized as before and after the carbon in the wood is heated enough to combust directly.  I am asking about the combustible compounds consumed during  the first stage (before carbon ignites). We are all familiar with the end result of a fire:  smoke, steam, etc.  These contain many chemical elements, such as CO2 and nitrous oxides.  I am not talking about these byproducts. When making char cloth, a flammable gas is given off.  At night, this  often appears as a blue (or green) jet of flame extending from the  charring container.  This (I suspect) is the same or remarkably  similar to the gas released by burning wood.  What is it? Gasifiers can be used to power vehicles or other machinery by heating  wood in an environment with limited oxygen.  What type of flammable  gas is produced by a gasifier?    "
2286,Can I use one helmet for both kayaking and skiing?,"I am doing little kayaking and just a bit more skiing (the seasons for both are very short where I live). Both of these need helmets, but I feel reluctant to buy 2 items, each of which will see little use.  So I wonder whether I can buy 1 helmet that will be sufficiently safe (but not necessarily convenient) for both activities.  My thoughts so far:   A kayaking helmet must be sturdy enough and protect the ears and the back of the head. I see no contradiction with skiing. A kayaking helmet must have holes. No problem for skiing. A skiing helmet should protect from cold. However, I don't really need this - it's never too cold where I am skiing. I am not proficient enough in all the details, so I am afraid to miss some important considerations.   So, how can I choose a kayaking helmet that is also suitable for skiing? Or vice versa? "
2287,How do you lower a backpack over a cliff without damaging it?,"I was backpacking in Coyote Gulch, Utah this past week and ran into an issue with my 70 liter backpack. The entrance to the gulch through ""Crack in the Wall"" was a narrow ""slot"" entry, so the backpacks could not fit through. Hence we had to lower our packs down the canyon wall with rope while we climbed down separately.   The problem is that abrasion against the canyon wall caused a small rip in the front pocket. So that was annoying because now my bag has a tear in it.   I was wondering what the right way to lower a pack over a canyon wall is--or perhaps more generally, how to deal with reducing abrasion damage to a pack? Is there some sort of covering I should have used for the pack, or is there a certain way to thread the rope through the pack so that it goes down a certain way, etc? "
2288,"Is there a type of binoculars to view both nature reserves (birds, etc.) at a distance, and airplanes?","I'm after a pair of binoculars for visiting Nature Reserves to get a better view of colonies of birds on the water (at some distance) etc.   Separately I'm interested in aviation and being able to view airplanes that fly overhead (about 15,000-30,000 feet) - not necessarily to absolute detail (registration number etc.) but to be able to see more than I can with the naked eye.  Is there a strength/specification of binoculars I could buy that would be optimal for both of these? Or should I look at 2 separate pairs?  I'm just a ""hobbyist"" and don't have a lot of money to spend, I'm just looking for a ""consumer"" spec item. "
2289,What's the best way to self-arrest on a sandy slope?,"What is the best technique for self-arrest on a sandy slope? I was canyoneering last week and the sand in the canyon was very soft and powdery--with a steep drop off at the bottom of the slope. Luckily I did not have any issues, but I was trying to figure out the best technique for self-arrest on a sandy slope--similar to self-arrest with an ice axe on a snowy slope. Any suggestions? I thought that plunging a longer backpacking knife, like a 7 inch blade, into the sand with your body weight over it might work--but this is just an idea.  "
2290,Is there a general rule for climbing runout grading?,"Climbing route grades in Yosemite Decimal System can be suffixed with an ""R"" to notify a runout. The Wikipedia entry for a runout is     A lengthy distance between two points of protection which in some, but not all, cases might be perceived as frightening or dangerous. May also be used as an adjective to describe a route, or a section of a route.   However, your frightening and my frightening are completely different.  If I see ""R"" on a route grading, how far of a runout should I expect? Is there a general rule or consensus for runout distances? "
2291,Are the seagulls begging or contentedly sighing?,"For any Dr. Doolittles out there, when a seagull makes a ""cooing"" sound, is it more like the ""miaow"" of a cat, or the purring of a cat?  Specifically, when the seagulls ""talk"" to each other, it is oftentimes in barks or croaks; whether they mean by these sounds ""watch out!"" or ""look at that!"" or ""get out of my way!"" I don't know.  But when I feed them bread by flinging it heavenward along the strand, whilst they swoop down and snap it with their beaks, those anticipating a tasty morsel are making sounds, not like the cawing of a crow (Monterey, where I live, should be renamed ""Crow City""), but more like a dove, or the whining of a puppy. Is this sound akin to a contented sigh (""isn't this great!"") or is it more of a begging sound (""Gimme summa dat bread!"")? "
2292,Preparing rice and mashed potatoes with warm instead of cooking water,"For a one week trip in a dry region I need to conserve water and weight. My idea is to bring precooked ""instant rice"" and pulverulent mashed potatoes. I´d warm a bit of water to about 40 - 50° C and mix it with the rice or mash. Would that resemble anything edible? (I'll try at home and post the results, but hope for some thoughts and input.)  The benefits: I don´t need the power to cook a liter, warming a quarter will do. That`s 1/10 of enery and 1/4 of water for every meal. Instead of using a full fledged gas cooking device, I can bring some Esbit. For each 3 day-intervall of water self-suffiency, that saves 5 kg. What are possible downsides?  EDIT: I have been unclear about the pre-cooked rice. I mean the vacuum-packed, non-dehydrated rice they sell it in grocery stores. Usualy you´d just warm it up for 2 minutes in a microwave oven, and that´s it. But I am not sure if the warming up is for safety or taste reasons. "
2293,Why static rope rather than webbing for toprope anchors?,"I'm signed up for an AMGA single-pitch instructor course (to learn how to teach other people single-pitch climbing). One of the pieces of gear we're supposed to bring is a 30 meter static rope ""for setting up big 'v' anchors."" I don't own one, and the instructor says I can borrow one, so it's not a problem for me, but it makes me wonder why this would be considered such a fundamental piece of gear.  If I'm understanding the application correctly, the idea would be to extend the anchor so that a toprope doesn't have to go over the lip of a cliff, or allow the construction of anchors in which the pro is widely spaced. I would normally have used 1-inch webbing for this purpose.  Why would one prefer a static rope rather than webbing for this purpose? It's more expensive, and a 30 m length would not be useful for other applications such as canyoneering. What are the pros and cons? "
2294,What is a splice in spools of tubular webbing?,"While trying to answer Why static rope rather than webbing for toprope anchors? I immediately thought about splices in long pieces of webbing. For example, REI says that spools of Blue Water webbing may not be continuous, although I cannot find a reference on Blue Water's site.  I haven't worked with spools of webbing in a long time. My recollection is that a spool typically had 3 or so splices that were marked with tape an a pin. We use to cut around them, when making shorter slings. I do not remember how much space we left. My recollection was that apart from the pin/tape, there was no visual indication of the splice.  I cannot find any information about splices. I guess I have 4 related questions.  Do spools of webbing still have splices?  How weak is the splice?  How big is the section of weakness?  What do splices look like? "
2295,How can I transfer my weight to a toprope anchor at the bolts?,"I'm going to the crag with some friends in a few days and I plan to lead the first route, clip into a quickdraw on one of the anchor bolts and build a top rope anchor on the bolts. I've been practising the anchor styles that I could use and I am in the situation below. I know that I could simply unclip the quickdraw and slowly lower myself onto the anchor but I don't want to fall onto the anchor, even though it would certainly handle the fall. How can I slowly and properly transfer the load from the quickdraw to the top rop anchor? Are there any interesting ways to do this or should i just unclip the draw and get the belayer to take and lower?  "
2296,Is this sand dollar with barnacles attached to it at all rare?,"While taking my usual stroll along Del Monte beach in Monterey yesterday, I found this sand dollar with a clump of barnacles attached:    Is this rare at all? Any observations on why it would wash up onto the beach? "
2297,Does any Household Object Function as a Passable Fire Steel?,"Suppose I am trying to teach a class of 12 children how to build campfires. I would like each pupil to have a flint and steel for the lesson. As it turns out ferrocerium rods can be acquired cheaply for about a dollar each if I bulk-buy them. That leaves loads of leeway for rods getting lost. The problem is no striker is provided.   Is there any common household item I can have the children bring in to use as a striker? My first idea was a butter knife, but after trying this to no avail I realised the knife reads STAINLESS STEEL on the side. I am aware that a carbon-steel knife works as a striker; indeed some paring knives work. But I cannot get such a knife for less than 5 dollars, and I need a dozen plus spares. Moreover if I instruct the children to bring in a knife each, then chances are half will be stainless steel anyway.  Any suggestions? "
2298,"When clipping into quickdraws, is it dangerous to pass a finger through the gate?","When learning to sport climb, I was taught not to pass any of my fingers through the gate of the carabiner when clipping into a quickdraw. Lest any of my fingers get stuck and degloved in the case of a fall while clipping. Has this ever happened? Is this a realistic concern?    In an effort to lead climb more efficiently, I was researching different methods of clipping quickdraws. During my search, I found that one often recommendation when clipping with (eg) one's right hand into a quickdraw whose gate is facing right is     Pinch Clip Technique         Starting from your tie-in knot at your harness, slide your hand down the rope to grab a length of rope.   As you bring the rope up to the quickdraw, let it run over your pointer finger.   Use your thumb on the spine of the rope-end carabiner to stabilize the carabiner.   Push the rope and your pointer finger into and through the gate of the carabiner to clip the rope.      Source: REI, emphasis: mine.    Some sources warn against putting fingers through the gate while using the pinch clip technique:     Quick safety tips when clipping quickdraws      Keep your fingers out of the carabiner      Push the rope into the carabiner gate, rather than your fingers. You don’t want to lose them if the event of a fall!   Source: Moja Gear "
2299,Is belaying with a hip belay unsafe?,"It has been suggested to me in a comment, about an answer of mine that suggests using a hip belay, that:     There's a reason ATCs, plates, GriGris, etc got popular: they're safer.   I know I stopped using hip belays when I got a proper harness and realized how much more comfortable belaying with a Munter hitch was. I didn't even consider that it might be safer. While I agree that GriGris and other devices with assisted braking capabilities are nominally safer than a hip belay, has there been a climbing accident attributed to the use of a hip belay that would have likely been prevented by using for a belay device without assisted braking capabilities? "
2300,How hard is the East Buttress route on El Capitan,"I am relatively new to climbing, and so far I have only done bouldering climbing. The hardest route I have climbed is a V5, and I am a solid V4 climber. My question was, to anyone who has climbed East Bustress, how hard is it? From the ratings I saw, It converts to a V0 in bouldering scale, with the hardest parts being a V1. Is this accurate? "
2301,"Is ""survival"" paracord with fire starter strand dangerous","There are a number of ""survival"" products on the market that integrate ""extra"" strands into the standard paracord (US MIL spec, ~4mm accessory cord, usually 7 strand nylon or cotton)   Most of them feature a tinder strand, at first glance this is a useful gimmick, if one is using the cord for something else (wrapping, lanyard, bracelet) you can have it around in case you need it, on the other hand it seems that any accidental heat exposure could lead to a major accident or injury.    Are these products the death traps I imagine them to be? How likely is the fire starter to ignite and how prone is it to extinguishing itself? "
2302,How can I store milk for long periods of time?,"I'm in the process of setting up my overland vehicle so that it has ""essentials"" in it at all times. I've got a kettle and ways to boil the kettle etc.  I am interested in having the basics in my vehicle such as water, tea, coffee as well as military-style dehydrated food.  I was wondering if there is an option for keeping milk on a long term basis? I understand that I would need to keep it cool but even then surely it would only have a short shelf life. What other options are there in regards to milk?  I know that the obvious option would be to just buy milk when I need it but I want to be able to stop somewhere and have a cup of tea or coffee and not have to think about supplies. "
2303,What to look for when purchasing a ~70m rope for canyoneering?,"I'm looking for a good longer rope (e.g. 70m or so) to use for rappeling during canyoneering trips. Most of the ropes on Amazon or REI are dynamic, and my understanding is that static ropes are generally preferred for canyoneering.  Most of the lighter ropes I see (7.9mm or 8.5mm) are only rated twin or half. Presumably these would be usable when rappelling double-rope, but wouldn't be advisable for single-rope rappels due to low friction?  In short, for the described purposes, what kind of specs should I look for in a rope? "
2304,Long distance hikes with small children,"In recent years, my wife and I completed a few long distances hikes together, for instance:   Kungsleden from Nikkaluokta to Abisko, 105 km (Sweden) Landmannalaugar to Skogar via Laugavegur and Fimmvörðuháls, 78 km (Iceland) Svartárkot-farm to Herðubreiðarlindir, „Askja Trail“, 93 km (Iceland) Ammoudari to  Agia Roumeli through the White Mountains, 48 km (Crete, Greece)   We carried everything we needed for the entire trip (food, tent etc.) on our backs and refilled our water supplies where possible. We slept in our tent and used other shelters only in case of emergency. Thus, we were as self-contained as possible and had no problems with the more remote parts of the trips. Also, we carried no unnecessary bits and pieces.   Two years ago our daughter was born. In the first year, we though that it would not be a good idea to take her on a prolonged trip like those above. However, in the meantime she enjoys being outdoors a lot and also likes to be carried around in one of those kid carrier backpacks. Therefore, we thought that generally it could be possible to take her with us on a muti-day hike.   However, the child on one back leaves only one back free for all the rest of the stuff we need. And obviously, the equipment now also includes some diapers, a selection of toys and books, more clothes than before, an extra sleeping bag etc. Summarizing, it seems impossible to carry everything with two adults only.   We did some research and then started out this year in June to complete the West Highland Way (WHW) in Scotland (154 km from Milngavie to Fort William) together with our daughter. We chose the WHW for these reasons:    You are near civilization on the entire trip, so if you need help, it is easy to find. Also if you want to abort the trip, buses and trains are within reach.  The total distance can easily be divided into stages which are not too long so that daily walking times and child-in-kid-carrier times are not too long. We had 9 days of walking and two rest days. We also took more breaks than we would have done walking without our daughter. We slept in the tent every night. The path is well maintained and easy to walk without any major difficulties.  You can have your baggage transported along the whole way. We definitely made use of this option. This way, I carried our daughter (18 kg including herself, the carrier, clothes and shoes) and my wife carried water and food for the day. The rest was transported in two 80 L drybags by one of the baggage transfer companies.   Everything worked out surprisingly well and we finished the WHW exactly as planned. Also we have the impression that our daughter also liked the experience. That was really great!  Therefore, now I am looking for other options for the future which might be feasible with a small child that cannot walk the distance itself (so it is carried at least for parts of the way). What I wonder is particularly:   Has anybody here made experiences with long distance hikes with a small child? Which long distance hikes can you recommend with a small child? Are you aware of other routes which offer baggage transfer services similar to the WHW? Are there any other realistic options apart from baggage transfer? Which things did you consider to make the trip enjoyable for the child? Is there anything else to consider from your point of view? What could you do with two or more children?  "
2305,What is this red bug infesting some trees in southern Germany?,"I've just recently moved to Europe (southern Germany), so this might be a common sight to someone who has been living here for longer.  Yesterday I noticed dozens of these insects walking on the sidewalk and grass. Then I looked at the trunk of some trees and, lo and behold, saw HUNDREDS of them, just chilling there.  Apparently they don't bite, don't fly, don't do anything except cuddle up to each other.  I first saw them early in the morning (around 9am), but again late in the evening (11pm).  So, what are those? Is it common to have so many of these or should I be worried?    "
2306,What should I look for in a reel for a two handed fly fishing rod?,I want to buy myself a Shakespeare Oracle 11' #7/8 EXP switch rod to get started in two-handed casting for large-sized local rainbow trout at a wide water body where back room for casting is scarce.  What reel would you recommend? Is any reel made for #7 lines fine? Or do I have to take anything special into account? 
2307,Overnight hiking in Italian Alps in late autumn?,"I am planning to spend about a week in Italian/Swiss border Alps in late October. The base plan is to hire a 4WD and drive along the border slowly, stopping a lot for less-than-a-day hikes (staying overnight at backpackers).  Still I am curious about doing overnight hiking there:   Are there huts to stay overnight (like in New Zealand) or would I have to carry a tent? In late October, how much would that likely be winter hiking with winter gear needed?  "
2308,Looking up fish species by body of water and vice versa,"U.S. here (and specifically New York state but that's probably irrelevant). Is anyone aware of any websites, apps or DEC resources that allow you to look up what fish species live in any given lake/pond/body of water?  Ideally there would be a ""two-way mapping"", meaning:   I could start with a specific body of water and get a list of all the fish species known to be living there; and I could start with a given fish species and see all the applicable bodies of water where they are known to dwell (within some reasonable radius of course)   I was hoping on X maps would have a layer/filter for something like this but it doesn't appear that they do. Any ideas? Thanks in advance! "
2309,How to coexist with bees/wasps?,"Due to some peculiar health issues, for the time being I cannot study around people. I've found a secluded place in my college, it's outdoors, no one goes there and still catches wi-fi.   However, bees/wasps keep flying by me. I've read somewhere that when a bee flies by, or around you, it is a sign of aggression. And they've been doing it rather frequently.   This is worrisome, because I am likely allergic to bee stings, since my mother, unfortunately, recently found that she is allergic.   Furthermore, I cannot control my jerky movements when I hear them because of a phobia, which as far as I understand, only angers them further.  I feel like I'm eventually going to get hurt, but I am stuck with this solution of studying outdoors.  Any tips on how to coexist with them? Perhaps there is some way to encourage them to have some sense of personal space?  Update  My current measures to avoid disturbing them are: wearing solid white shirt and keeping myself in high ground using the nearby emergency stairs. I still have to cross a field to get there, so I am careful as to not step on one of the little guys.   In the coming days I will look towards meeting my doctor about the mentioned epi-pen. Unfortunately I don't have much time, since the exams are in a few days, but after that I'll be sure to consult a medical professional about it.   Thank you for your responses, they are helpful.  "
2310,How to improvise or make pot grip / pot handle,"How do you deal with handling hot pots / cups without using a pot grip (see the picture for an example)? It's inexpensive and rather light-weight, but why add gear if you can use what you already have? :) I've been usually using a small Leatherman and a stick to stabilise the pot, but it's not particularly convenient and I've had a few mishaps (a whole cup of hot water ending on the ground...)   "
2311,Can Cormorants swallow and digest large prey like eels whole?,"Can a cormorant really manage to digest a huge, living eel, bones and all?  Does the poor eel (it was quite a bright/pretty green color) stand any slim chance of escaping (that thrashing, biting, etc.) the hungry birds stomach or is it destined to become food at that point?!   I would think the eel’s slime acts as a protective coating and help it turn around in such stretchy/elastic surroundings too?   Backstory about how the question(s) came up:  I recently saw a cormorant at our local park. It dove pretty quickly, soon after it came up struggling with a large green eel. The thick 2' eel seemed quite determined to escape by thrashing and even wrapping around the birds neck! Still, after about 2 minutes the bird somehow opened it’s throat real wide and swallowed it down entirely... BUT the battle for life and dinner wasn't over yet! The desperate eel still was resisting and seemed to rise partly (I could see it come back out!) escaping the bird’s neck/stomach many times, only to be gulped back in. Watching the Cormorant contend with this monster was some sight! Eventually the uncomfortable cormorant swam away with what appeared to be the unfortunate prey frantically wriggling in its stomach!  "
2312,How to descend a few exposed scrambling moves with minimal equipment?,"I plan to visit a summit which involves a few hours of easy scrambling, with a slightly more technical part at the end, which is very short (2-3 m) but exposed. I expect no problems on the way up but it will be scary and/or dangerous on the way down.  I would like to use minimal equipment to save weight (because there is only one place where I would need any equipment). My idea is using 10 meters of 5 mm wide cord to belay myself (I'll most likely be alone).  What is the minimal (by weight) amount of additional equipment I can use to increase my safety? How to use it? "
2313,How can I protect myself in case of a human attack like the murders of the hikers Jespersen and Ueland in Morocco?,"I read about the murders of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland.   What safety mistakes these girls did during their camping trip? What could have been done to avoid this situation? How can I protect myself in case of an attack like this? Pepper spray? Taser gun? Guns?   Note: Assume that I am foreign to that region. And hiking with a friend or camping alone.  Attackers admitted they choose these girls because other potential victims were with tourist guides. They attacked Ueland, a Norwegian, and her Danish friend, Jespersen, in their sleeping bags, and beheaded them.  This BBC article contains background into the attack and the trial. "
2314,What is the risk of starting a forest or wildland fire with a flare gun?,"When firing a flare gun in the air, what is the risk of accidentally starting a forest or wildland fire?  Does the flare go out completely before it touches the ground?  "
2315,Is there a safer way to use a flare in a wooded area?,"This answer on another question says that there is a risk of causing a forest fire when using a flare.  Is there a recommended/safer way to use flares that lessens this risk, in the event that someone must use a flare (even against the risk of fire)?  Obviously, one shouldn't shoot a flare directly at dry wood, but are there other practices that should be avoided when using flares? "
2316,How can I make sure there are no more ticks around?,"I'm back from outdoors and while lying down in bed I noticed a tiny tiny insect walking around on my clothes. While trying to take a picture of it to see if it is a tick, it just disappeared and I cannot find it anymore. In the mean time I checked my body to make sure nothing is there and I found two of them on my leg and toe. The one in the leg came off easily with tweezers as close to the skin as possible, where the one in the toe felt like didn't detach in whole and there was a spot of blood after removal. I'll get someone check the spots again for me, but:   how can I make sure I haven't brought more of them with me home?  And that the one I lost hasn't landed on my head among bushes and bushes and bushes of hair? (It would be impossible to find anything from my head with all the hair that I have).  I threw the ones I removed in the bin. Can they get out and creep around again?        "
2317,Does a backpack negatively influence my archery shooting?,"Last weekend I've shot with a backpack for the very first time. I ordered one which is able to hold my quiver and my bow to hike'n'archer :)   However, I suddenly shot like 250 points were I normally would do about 390. I thought I just had a bad day and so I didn't really care. The next day we went out shooting again and my unstable form continued. I told my mates about this and one said that I should get rid of the backpack. I did so and guess what, my shooting improved/was normal again!  So the question is, is it really a general thing that you can't shoot (or let's say ""shoot worse"") with a backpack? Or do I just have to get used to it?  Note: I'm shooting a traditional hunting-recurve instinctively.  "
2318,How should I regulate hydration on long hikes in hot temprature?,"I hike in western ghats of Maharashtra India, where temperature in the afternoon varies from 35 degree Celsius to 40 degree Celsius with high humidity (more than 50%).  On my last hike I perspired a lot, even though my ascending speed was very slow during a steep ascend.   How much water should I carry on such hikes, if I know I am not going to get near any source of water till evening?  How should I regulate hydrating myself? I can just keep drinking water until I run out.  Is there  a way to control perspiration, so that I lose less water? "
2319,How late in the season can you hunt coyote?,"It's currently April and I know that's considered late in the season for hunting coyote. Given that I live in a desert climate, how late can you hunt coyote? Is there a reason why I couldn't hunt them into the summer and other parts of the year? I have already checked with my local/state laws and there are no time limitations on coyotes.  "
2320,"Are crows more interested in identifying individual humans than vice versa, and if so, why?","I live in Crow City, USA (AKA Monterey, California).  I can't tell one crow from another without their perching right next to me on a bust of Portola. They seem to all be clones of each other, as far as I can tell (and I'm sure that's true of most non-ornithologist humans). Yet crows can differentiate humans one from another.  This (presumably) does not prove that crows, clever as they are, are more intelligent than humans, but does it indicate that they are more interested in us than we are of them? If so, why? Or what is the reason for this gap in observation skills?  Some humans are birdwatchers, but it seems all crows are people watchers.  UPDATE  This corroborating link (Friend or Foe? Crows Never Forget a Face, It Seems from The New York Times, Aug 25, 2008) was provided by a cat who had a hard time adding it for some reason.   An article published by the National Wildlife Society on November 7, 2012 describes that study, as well as results from other research. It goes into more details explaining that crows and other birds do recognize us, and potential reasons why. It also has links to more information about crows and other birds in general.  "
2321,Buzzer / chironomid hook size for still water fly fishing,"I'm tying buzzer/chironomid flies to use when fishing under a slow retrieve in lakes. I thought that by chironomid we meant midges, and expected flies in sizes 18 to 26, but a lot of the patterns that I find out there in the internet use much bigger hooks. This link lists flies all the way up to size 12, for example. Moreover, some patterns like Tak's Crystal Chironomid (here tied in sizes 10 to 16) turn out to be very hard to tie in the midge sizes above 18.   Are there buzzers that get that big? What size should I tie my chironomids / buzzers? "
2322,"Can you train wild deer to get ""used to"" your scent before the hunting season","United States (and more, specifically, NY state -- though that shouldn't matter at all) here.    I am brand new to hunting, and in a few weeks I will be going out into the woods and hunting public land for the first time. Just to be clear, I have taken the NYS Hunter's Safety course and have purchased my hunting license and I have my tags. I am doing everything by the book.  I have read from several credible source now that:   Deer are very keen to the smells of different areas of the forest Hence, unless you attempt to manage your scent (minding the wind direction as you stalk, experimenting with various scent blockers, etc.) once they smell you, they will realize that ""something is wrong"", meaning, they have detected a smell in that area of the woods that ordinarily is not there -- and they ""bump"" or run away   So this gave me an idea, and I wanted to share it here in the form of a question to see if any experienced/skilled hunters think its a viable idea or sheer rubbish!  I should also say that this idea would also be used in addition to the common, popular forms of scent management (making sure I am downwind of them, using scent blocker, etc.).  The idea  What if I went into the woods to my ""spots"" (the general areas where I plan to hunt) and carefully placed a few old, dirty shirts with my scent on them down on the ground and left them there for the next 3 - 4 weeks.  Disclaimer: DEC states in their manual that it is unlawful to use public land as ""storage"" and that any hunting accessories such as stands, mineral blocks, trail cams or other hunting equipment must be removed within a certain number of days of the close of the season. I would absolutely remember where I put these shirts and remove them in keeping with state law at the end of the season. I am one of the biggest critics of litterbugs and would never be one myself!  So the thinking here is:   Deer get used to my smell radiating through sections of the forest where I intend to hunt If, while on a hunt, my scent management fails and my scent ""leaks"" into the air, I would think they might not spook as easily as if they would if they were totally foreign to that smell being there   Is this a crazy idea or valid?  I'm thinking it's either a great idea and will work wonders, or, its the polar opposite and will instead drive all the deer out of my ""spots"" for the entirety of the season :-/  Any thoughts/comments/concerns/input here?

2323,What to look for in a electronic inflator for an inflatable stand up paddleboard?,"I have a stand up paddle board (14'0"") and I am looking for an easier way to pump it up. I found some cordless handheld inflators for tyres, which are rated at 120W and maximum pressure is 150psi. It can do just 25L/min.   Would this type of inflator be able to fill an SUP in under 8 minutes? (Since that is how long the battery lasts)   Or, are there other cordless, electric pumps used to inflate SUPs? "
2324,Drawbacks and advantages of using a trimaran instead of a monohull for sailing in the arctic?,"Which would be the main advantages and drawbacks of trying to sail a cruising trimaran in summer from the Azores to the Arctic, well past Svalbard but not quite to the pole?  From the experienced sailor's perspective, would a monohull offer more stability with problems like frozen sea spray (since it adds weight to the ship) and floating ice (hull resistance)? "
2325,What would the basic gear for fly fishing be?,"If one were to get started fly fishing what gear would one need just to start with?  Of course, there is all sorts of gear and better gear, but what would the minimum gear to start with be? "
2326,Hiking with a mule or two?,"For an older guy (say 65+) who likes to hike alone - are a mule or two a help or a hindrance? Maybe a mule for the pack, and a second mule to ride when I get really old?  Historically people preferred to ride a mule - I am not sure it is still practical nowadays :-) "
2327,Hiking with goats?,"I asked around (including on this site: Hiking with a mule or two?) about hiking with a mule or a horse.  Some people on other sites actually suggested hiking with pack goats. (for weights on the order of 5-10-20kg/10-20-50lbs, depending on hike)  Is this something people actually do? Does it work out? "
2328,Does mountaineering organization membership provide wilderness rescue/evacuation expense insurance?,"Garmin inReach devices and its subscription plans seems to offer (optional?) rescue/evacuation insurance already:    Does mountaineering organization membership such as Sierra Club from California, and Mazamas from Portland, Oregon include such coverage? "
2329,Why is there such a singular place for bird watching?,"There are a lot of interesting things in nature, but of all land vertebrates, birding has highly disproportionate attention. People (perhaps including birding enthusiasts) may note and appreciate mammals they see, and reptiles, but birding stands on its own as a hobby.   Why, about birds and about us, are we so interested in birding?  I can imagine a partial answer in that birds are more interestingly likely to fly in and out of an area one is observing, and that birds are often brightly colored, but this is a guess on my part, and I would give them only a guess's degree of probability.  Why emphasize birding? "
2330,What materials from nature can you use to build a pair of skis on a mountain?,"I'm working on a survival story and want to make it authentic. If you were stranded on a mountain trying to get down as fast as possible, what would you do?  EDIT: What if this was after a plane crash on a desolate snowy mountain? Would it be possible to fashion some kind of combination from debris and nature to propel down the mountain? "

There are two sizes in Ultralight rain cover model.One is 'M' size (upto 50 L) and another is 'L' size (50-75 L). Have anyone bought 'L' size cover? I am bit concerned with 'M' size because when the bag is fully loaded will it cover well? Is it better to go for 'L'? 
2332,How to prevent strap slippage through buckle?,"A strap running through a buckle is typically easy to loosen and tighten as desired. Usually, it stays in place. Sometimes, however, it slowly (or quickly) works its way loose, as though the thickness or smoothness of the webbing doesn't quite match the size or shape of the buckle. What can I do to make the strap more grippy?  The specific problem I have is with a new backpack (no wear and tear), and it happens in dry conditions (not wet and slippery). The straps even have cloth-elastic bands wrapped around, right next to the buckles.   One method could be to add a separate clasp, as per this question. Also, I imagine I could intentionally soak it in sea water and then not rinse it, leaving the salt crystals to gum up the works (I know this happens to kayak gear and it's usually a nuisance). Other techniques? I consider replacing either the strap or the buckle to be too drastic a solution. "
2333,Clothing for cold weather hiking,"I will go for two day hiking on a mountain (intermediate level). The weather will be chilling (3 °C to 5 °C, no snowing,but it may rain). I would like to know what kind of clothing would be better?   I know I should not wear cotton. Can I wear Nylon? Also, can I wear thermals inside? (I am worried if it brush against skin and become uncomfortable). On the top I am planning to wear a down jacket. "
2334,"What are the differences between prismatic, lensatic, mirrored, and optical sighting compasses?","Background  I am looking at compasses for backpacking and camping, and have come across more compass varieties than I had ever thought possible. Three terms that often come up together are ""prismatic"", ""lensatic"", ""mirrored"", and ""optical"".  I do understand these types of compasses are for sighting, and are not just the typical protractor-style compass for placing on a map. What I don't understand is what the different technologies are useful for, and when one would choose one over the other.  Question  What do the terms ""lensatic"", ""prismatic"", ""mirrored"", and ""optical"" mean in this context? When would one choose one style over the other? "
2335,Can orange safety vest be used when hiking during hunting season?,I'm going to be doing some winter hiking in parks where there are going to be a lot of hunters. Probably only during bow hunting season for deer in NJ. I'll be getting some blaze hats but for the vest can I use ansii orange safety vests which I already own? Is it the wrong type of orange? Will the reflective take be an issue?  Edited to add picture and link of my vest.    Milwaukee   Premium Large/X-Large Orange Class 2-High Visibility Safety Vest [website]
2336,Shore based shark fishing,"So I have wanted to catch sharks like 7 gill in california and I have some questions about reels and rods.  So I want to be able to cast my bait out to where the sharks are but most people seem to use a drone or keyak, but somebody on a fishing forum said they they casted from shore with a 9 foot pole. So I was wondering if I could actually cast from shore like that. I was looking at a rod blank called jawbone 2 xtreme sledgehammer that's 10 ft and 50-130 pound line. wandering if that or anything else like it? Also would a spinner or bait caster be better? "
2337,Synthetic insulated belay jacket vs thicker mid layers or down,"When it gets colder while walking, I'd add an extra fleece as a mid layer and when we stop to eat, I would put it on too, or I'd wear a down jacket if it's dry.  However when it's wet, it seems like taking off outer shell to add mid layer is troublesome. Isn't it better to get a synthetic down jacket that can be worn on top of my shell, even if it's a bit wet? This way I can just throw it on top. I've heard this can be referred to as belay jacket.   What are the pros and cons? What have been your experiences in, e.g. Scottish weather?   PS. My shell is actually Paramo, which in my experience will be more breathable than a membrane, so I don't believe I'd be getting wet from the inside.  "
