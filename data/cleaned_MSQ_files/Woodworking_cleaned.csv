0,What is an accurate and safe way to piece together wood with a rhombus cross section?,"I am interested in making a bunch of Penrose tiles.      Please note that the triangles and half circle on the figures shouldn't be there, they are for alignment purposes only.  One of the tiles is a rhombus with corners of 36, 144, 36 and 144 degrees.  I am looking for the community's ideas on how to make a piece of wood with this cross section.  Lets say the sides are 1.5"".  I have a table saw, jointer, planar, router and access to most of the other tools.  Accuracy is important.  Any ideas and suggestion are appreciated.  Edit #1.  I really appreciate all the responses.  This seams like a great stack exchange.  The process I was envisioning was the following.  Get a 6' piece of stock with the correct cross section, then use a band saw to cut off the individual tiles to correct thickness.  Aside from the difficulty in getting the correct cross section, are there other issues / problems with this approach?  Edit #2 I found this approach on YouTube to cute acute angles.  Does this seems safe and accurate?   "
1,Issue sanding between coats of polyurethane,"So I am playing with finishes for the first time and experimenting with polyurethane. My problem involves quoting the instructions on the can and giving some background into my process. Bear with me.  From other answers on WW I understand that applying only a few coats of poly can be sufficient but traditionally you could use as many as 21 over the course a year. Since I don't need an exercise in futility I opted for 3 coats.  I did 2, what I thought were, thin coats 3 days apart and the last one was 2 days previous to now. I did not sand between coats; again because it is not required between coats (Again based on other answers required).  Referencing steps from the directions on the can and the Minwax website        Apply a THIN coat of MinwaxÂ® Fast-Drying Polyurethane using a high-quality natural or foam brush.   Let dry 4-6 hours. Then lightly sand entire surface with fine sandpaper (220 grit) to ensure an even finish and proper adhesion. Remove all dust.    Apply second coat. If third coat is desired, repeat step 5 before application.      Aside from the lack of sanding between coats I adhered to the instructions rather well.  I left the table to cure in my shed. Issue with that was my shed seems to have become a haven for boxelder bugs. Which would be an issue except they pissed on the table in several places. Some of it just chips off but I needed to sand out several of them. Sanding with 220 grit with only a few passes it looks like I sanded through the two coats down to wood!?  Why would they suggest I sand with that grit if it takes away the coats to begin with? Obviously they didn't intend for that to happen and I am doing something I am not supposed to do. Should I have used a finer grit? Are my poly coats to thin? "
2,I wonder how this alternating stain effect is made," I saw this example in a how-to page of sashco company!. I'm wondering how all the samples have a lighter and darker shade. Is it a double applying of the same product on it's right side?  And how can I apply a similar transition on a piece of wood. Is it sufficient to tape it off, is this why it has a dark line like if it had a cut. What kind of tape to use then? "
3,Is there a safe way to make a plunge cut with a chainsaw?,"Having looked up chainsaw safety videos on the internet it seems that a big danger with chainsaws is kickback - where the tip of the chainsaw contacts something unexpected and throws the blade back up towards the users head/neck.  Is there a way to make a plunge cut with a chainsaw into thick wood safely (i.e. pushing the tip of the chainsaw into a thick block of wood, maybe 12 inches thick) or is this just a flat out bad idea?  Is the potential kickback on entry hard to avoid or control?  Is the wood more likely to bind onto the chain in this case and/or break it? "
4,Design considerations for a machinist's work bench,"I am considering hiring a cabinet maker to construct a built-in workbench for machine work and would like to know the key design considerations and recommended jointing options for such a project.  The table would be mounted to a stone wall in the back and one side and have two legs. I envision using something like white oak 4x4s for the legs and having a 3"" or 4"" hard maple top. It has to be able to mount a large vise. I have seen Sjosberg benches but they are not really appropriate since they are designed for wood work, not machine work and blacksmithing.  What would be a recommended way of constructing the maple top and joining it to the legs?  In the photo below is traditional machine vise bench:    Like many such benches it has cast iron supports, not an option for me. Also, notice top is made from 2x4s sistered together, which seems logical to me. Do you bolt them together? "
5,How do I cut a large log into boards?,"An acquaintance was clearing some trees from his land, and I asked him to save a section of big leaf maple so I could mill it for an electric guitar.   The piece ended up being roughly 9"" x 9"" x 36"". I figured I'd let it dry then saw into boards. Now, about a year later (and after learning much more about woodworking), I realize I should have had it milled before drying. It has cracked some as it dried, but should still be usable.  My problem now is I don't know how to go about milling it. It's bigger than I had asked for and I don't have the tools to break it down.  Here is what I have:   Circular saw (7.5"") My grandpa has a 10"" table saw Handsaw (18-24"")   I'm not sure I like either of those options. Seems like the blade could bind, and while the piece is too heavy to kick back on a table saw, it could burn up the motor, or toss the circular/break my wrist.  Do I chalk this up to beginner's mistake and scrap the idea, or is there something I could still try (bandsaw, chainsaw, etc.)?  Note: This question is different from What is the process, from start to finish, for milling a tree into boards? in that this question is about milling a chunk of wood that is small enough not to require or justify the size of tool (e.g., bandsaw mill or chainsaw mill) which is usually used to mill large tree trunks. As @bowlturner pointed out in a comment, it also may be too small for some such mills. "
6,How can I make a dowel with a table saw?,"In LeeG's answer to How can I make my own dowels? he says     You make a jig to pass the piece through perpendicular to the blade and turn the piece to round the corners...         Image source  How does one go about doing this? I'd specifically like to make some 5/8"" dowels from some old 3/4"" diameter turning tool handles. "
7,Am I able to make a wooden Zero Clearance Insert for my tablesaw?,"After watching more videos about table saws I got excited and wanted to make a ZCI. When I looked at my saw the current insert gave way too much room. I had lost some wood down there on one occasion and was worried about kickback.   I took off the cheap flimsy plastic, that was starting to bow, only to find this:   Note: The ""tab"" on the right looks more recessed than it actually is  The place where the potential ZCI would rest is between 1/8th - 3/16ths of an inch from the table (both tabs are not equal distances from the table). That would mean for a very thin piece of the board at those locations. That would likely snap when it got some pressure. Also the side of the gap facing the blade (that you cant see in this picture) tapers at a 45 degree angle. I could see sawdust or, if nothing else, debris getting in there.  All the good ZCI's that I see are one unit and I don't see how I could do that with this setup.   Can I safely make a wooden ZCI for this table saw? Would I need to mill one from metal to get the same effect? "
8,Would a thick riving knife be useful with a dado stack?,"As I understand it, a riving knife prevents kickback by keeping the workpiece from pinching or being pushed into the back of the blade.  Pinching the blade is unlikely to happen with non-through cuts, which all dado cuts are, but the workpiece could still theoretically be pushed askew and contact the back of the blade.  Would a riving knife with the same thickness as the kerf of the dado stack prevent this? Or are non-through cuts just not as dependent on a riving knife for safety? "
9,What types of table saw cuts cannot be made with a riving knife installed?,"Similar to When is it not possible or not practical to use a blade guard?, what types of cuts require the riving knife (and blade guard) to be removed? "
10,How do I accurately cut a board exactly in half?,"This might be a silly question, but how do I accurately measure, mark and cut a board perfectly in half on a miter saw?  I know that if I want to cut a board of a specific length, I would mark that length, and then align the blade right on the other side of the line, so that the cut piece is exactly measured distance.  But say I have a 8' board, and I want it in half (roughly 4' each, minus the kerf), how do I quickly measure/cut this? Ideally the result would have no waste.  Do I just align the blade with the line and cut directly on it, or do I need to measure the blade kerf and account for this somehow?  I realize a table saw would help make this more accurate and repeatable, but right now I'm limited to a miter saw. "
11,What's a bench hook?,Comments in What is a shooting board? have taken me further down the rabbit hole.   What is a bench hook and how is it used? 
12,What is this type of screw from a piece of flat-pack furniture called?,"Does anyone know what this type of screw is called in the UK?    I ask because I have some flat pack furniture that has been sitting in the attic for ages, and now I try to assemble it I find some of the screws are missing. Unless I can buy some more screws like the one pictured I'm going to have fun trying to assemble the furniture.  The screw has a 4mm hex socket in the end. I'd guess they're targetted at us amateur flat pack assemblers rather than the professional woodworkers. But as I don't know what this type of screw is called I don't even know where to start Googling.  Later:  Many thanks to everyone who answered. Several people suggested this is a custom made screw and I suspect they are correct. The paperwork with the furniture (a bed) is missing, but I think it is this bed made by Birlea.  With clues from all the answers I've found several similar screws - they all have sharp points but I don't think that matters as I suspect the tips have been removed just to stop amateurs like me impaling themselves. The closest seems to be these screws from Spax, though they are startlingly expensive! Searching for timber construction screws, lag screws and coach screws returns an array of likely looking hits. "
13,How can I join two mitred handrails?,"(posted this on diy.stackexchange but it was suggested I try here)  I have an old staircase with winders, so if I want 32 inches between handrail and nose of stairs, I'm going to have to cut some angles.  If the overall run of the handrails is going to be about 180 inches, and I'm cutting a 17 degree miter about 40 inches from the top, how would you securely join the two pieces?  Options I've considered:   wood glue and finishing nails.  I've done this for the returns, but one doesn't expect a lot of load on the returns, right? some kind of rail bolt, like this one dowels, though I'm nervous about getting close alignment on a mitered join.   Here's a picture of what I'd like the finished handrail to look like. the joint in question is towards the end where the walls meet:  "
14,When are pocket holes an appropriate joinery technique?,"I have come across a lot of designs and plans for things like outdoor furniture, kids' furniture, etc., that call for the use of pocket holes.  I can appreciate why this is enticing to a lot of people as it's a lot simpler that mortise and tenon joints or dovetails while still being concealed.  Matthias Wandel has an article on Testing pocket holes against mortise and tenon and dowel joints where he finds that they are indeed significantly weaker than other joint types.  With the exception of small objects, 99lbs as an average breaking force for a pocket joint doesn't seem very strong at all.  I could see a tabletop generate forces beyond this with just a few adults leaning on it.  Are there any times when this is an appropriate joinery technique to use, over alternatives? Or are they just typically used when someone doesn't have the skill, time (or maybe cost) to build a more robust joint? "
15,I am about to stain a new Redwood deck. Does anybody have first hand experience with a good stain for Direct/Heavy Sunlight?,"I am about to stain a new redwood deck. Does anybody have first-hand experience with a good stain for Direct/Heavy Sunlight? I live in a hot and arid part of Colorado and we have used a few different stains on some older wood fences and decks. They all failed.  This year we built a new deck and I am about to stain. I have read the reviews on a lot of expensive and inexpensive stains. I can't tell based on the even amounts of good vs. bad stains which one will hold up. I have read that oil-based is the way to go as opposed to water-based. We have a dog that frequents the deck and don't  want to see the trail from the dog walking up and down the deck.   Another question, I was reading here that you may want your deck to sit for an extended period of time before staining it. Is this recommended?   [website]"
16,What are my options when laminating wood with butt joints?,"I plan on starting to laminate soon. I was hoping to just do long pieces with each piece of wood would be as long as the the entire work. However, after looking at my stock, In order to get the best thickness I have to cut up the lengths to account for some warping.   I see on some lamination finger joints are used. I am just working with pine and don't have the means to do efficient fingers joints. I want to do just butt joints as the face of the wood should bear most of the burden.   Do I actually need to ""glue"" the butt joints together before laminating them to another piece? Do I work like I would a normal whole piece and just laminate the whole thing with clamps on either end? "
17,How strong is a titanium coated bit?,"How strong is a titanium coated bit? Some people say that it can not be sharpened by a diamond file or a grinding wheel while others say yes. How much longer does a titanium bit last compared to other bits? like HSS, or carbon oxide?  "
18,What are some good ways to hang plywood from a wire?,"I have an art piece composed of many strips of plywood put together. I'd like to hang it from a ceiling with wires.   Here's the tricky thing... The edges of the strips of plywood face the ceiling.   I don't feel like putting a bolt with an eye loop  on it into the edge of a piece of plywood would be very sturdy... What other hardware options do I have? Mount to the side of the wood? If so with what? Use a piece of hardware to straddle a piece of wood and clamp onto it, giving me a D loop on top? ...does that hardware even exist...?  The constraint that is fairly rigid, given this project, is that the piece is suspended from above by cables or something similar. The piece weighs about 200 pounds, it's about 12 feet across, and will be held by about 20 or so cables.   "
19,Wobbly table - maybe an easy fix,"recently I've asked a woodworking professional to build me a table for my living room.     It looks good but the problem is: it is wobbly. I can pull and push it on the direction indicated below:    I want to guarantee that he fixes the problem so that's why I would appreciate your professional help: if he builds these ""triangular structures"", does it fix the problem?    Would the problem really be fixed? Is there an better solution?  Sorry for using so many tags, i didn't know how to ""label"" the question.  Thank you. "
20,Do I need to worry about wood dust for very small-scale manual sanding?,"I have recently discovered carving as a very relaxing and pleasant hobby. From small branches of wood I whittle hair-sticks with interesting shapes (the kind of object you use to put long hair up) with small knives and use sandpaper (by hand) of various grits to even out the shape, make the surface smoother and shinier. I like to do the sanding outside, but I do it in my living room sometimes.  I was never concerned about the safety of using sandpaper (at least manually) until I stumbled upon the subject somewhere on the web. Virtually everybody recommends using dust masks when sanding wood, but it seems that people generally refer to using power tools on large-ish things like pieces of furniture..?  I am generally very (and sometimes over-)concerned about my health. On the one hand the amount of dust generated by finishing hair sticks seems very much insignificant compared to what kinds or techniques of woodworking are commonly assumed, but on the other what do I know, really! I have been uneasy working on the sticks since I read all the horror stories.  So my question is, should I still wear a dust mask - or are my lungs damaged more by walking by a busy street for five minutes? "
21,How do I know what tools I need?,"I'd like to get into woodworking and am looking at tools in order to make some small simple storage solutions. I love to sew, but a lot of my recent sewing ideas for around the house have included some kind of wooden frame. For example, I would love to be able to make something like this (found on amazon):    I have done a bit of research but still am unsure exactly what tools I need to start. This is what I have so far:   Drill + electric screwdriver: Already have, my husband owns one.  Circular saw (What power? Would 1150W be enough? (this one))  A workmate bench for securing the wood (like this).    I'm sure there are other things I need too. How do I figure out what other tools I will need for a particular project?  "
22,Hose converter between Dewalt Saw and Shop Vac,"I recently bought DEWALT DW715 15-Amp 12-Inch Single-Bevel Compound Miter Saw and was hoping to hook it up to my Shop-Vac 12-Gallon 6-Peak HP Shop Vacuum. So far, I've been unsuccessful at finding a converter piece. The descriptions read 1.25"" for the hose out of the back of the saw and 1.5"" for the shop vac hose. Can anyone tell me where I might be able to find the piece I need? "
23,Can I use the filter from a shop vac on my dust collector?,"Someone gave me an old portable, single-bag dust collector like the one pictured here:   The one I have is a Jet, but it's essentially the same thing: 1&nbsp;HP, 650(ish)&nbsp;CFM. I had been planning to get a 2&nbsp;HP stationary one to make a centralized collection system, but this one fell into my lap for free.  It was given to me with no bag (or hose, or wheels...). I'd like to make a cyclone dust collector out of it using a Dust Deputy, but one way or another, I have to put a bag or filter on the end of it. Replacement bags for the one in the picture come in 30&nbsp;micron ([tex]35) versions, and a 1&nbsp;micron canister-style filter runs about $230.  This Shop Vac filter runs $15 at Lowes and supposedly has a 0.3&nbsp;micron rating:   I'm game for cobbling together some connections to make it airtight if it can work. My question is this: would the Shop Vac filter be too restrictive? If it cuts down the airflow on an already marginal collector, then it wouldn't do me much good.  Also, would it matter that I'm pushing air through it in the reverse direction than what it was designed for? I could probably just wrap some screen or expanded metal around the outside of the filter pleats to support them so they don't get blown out. "
24,Is making this picture frame do-able?,"My wife would like me to build her a picture frame, but she has some requirements.   She wants it to look like metal.  (She apparently found a spray paint that makes it look metal). She wants the visible portion of the frame to be no more than 1/4"" wide.   (She basically wants a metal frame, but doesn't want to pay 60$ for it, since it's a custom size)  Now, here's my reservations with this....   If the visible portion of the frame is 1/4"" wide, that means the rabbet holding the picture/glass would be around 1/8"" - is this enough material to support the picture/glass? Again, if the rabbet is 1/8"" - That's REALLY thin material spanning from the front of the frame to the back of the frame.  I picture this not being thick enough to prevent breaking. I don't know if I have the tools and expertise to cut pieces this thin...  A 1/4"" piece with a 1/8"" rabbet?   My only possible solutions for this:   Use PVC trim pieces.  They may be able to withstand forces better, being only 1/8"" thick. Build the frame without a rabbet.  Use a router and a slot cutting bit to route out a slot in the frame - it doesn't necessarily need to be 1/8"" - just enough to keep the picture held in.  Fashion a slot at the top of the frame.  Instead of setting the picture in from the back, I'd drop it in from the top, which wouldn't be visible.   Thoughts? "
25,What happened here? Wood tension?,". It was originally straight. After I ripped it (resawed?) on the table saw, the pieces are no longer straight. The thinner piece is drastically worse than the thicker one as well.  Did I release tension in the wood when I cut it?   Any way to prevent this in the future other than cut thicker and plane it down?  "
26,Loft bed design,"So I am very much new to woodworking and I stupidly proclaimed to my housemates that I was going to build myself a loft bed. Obviously this ambition was met with a lot of ridicule and doubt so now my stubborn ass has no choice but to make this bed for better or for worse. I've researched as best I can and come up with a very messy preliminary design which I've had to make on ms paint as I don't really have the money to be paying for any actually good software, I was hoping you might be able to provide me with any tips/hints/improvements that could be made.   The wood I'm currently planning on using is 100mmx100mm 5th grade Scandinavian redwood for the 4 legs and then 50mmx100mm white fir for everything else (side note: could I get away with using the white fir for everything? The 100x100 legs are a significant expense which I figured is probably necessary but I'd love for someone to tell me I'm wrong hahaha) The length of the bed will be 190cm, width will be 135cm and height will be 136cm. The stupidly colourful diagrams below represent the corner joints - 1 is a birds eye view of the joint where the yellow is the leg, red is the rail and blue is the stretcher. 2 shows the view of the joint from the front and 3 is from the left (both with screws/bolts). For the middle stretchers I thought I'd just do a lap joint. I wasn't sure whether I should be using screws or bolts for this, is there generally a better or more appropriate choice of those two? I'm also still unsure on how best to join the horizontal and diagonal supports.  I know adding another horizontal support on the left side would increase stability as would adding a diagonal on the back - these are things I'm open to doing but would prefer to not as I have a wardrobe/chest of drawers on the left so a horizontal beam would be slightly inconvenient, and there's a window at the back which I'd prefer not to block with another diagonal if at all possible. Do you think these things are necessary or can I get away without them?  A few notes   I can't drill into the walls as I'm renting If possible I'd like to avoid using glue so I can take it apart when I have to move out and take it with me My current plan is to use plywood on top then put the mattress on that, does this make sense?? I haven't bought any of the wood or screws etc yet so open to change on anything really Please be nice/constructive I am aware I'm in way over my head lol but I'm going to attempt this even if it is going to be a disaster I'd just really like it to not be   Thanks in advance for your help!

27,How to glue hardwood to plywood core door?,"I'd like to create a modern interior door. No rails/stiles. Just horizontal stacked panels stained. I plan to use maple or birch.  I don't want to use a paper-thin hardwood veneer plywood. I've read that gluing thicker wood to ply will lead to failure. So, how do engineered hardwood manufacturers manage to glue veneer 5/32"" thick to ply core?  How were slab doors done in the olden days done? Solid wood? If so, how did they avoid wood movement issues?  What's more likely to prevent warping: solid wood frame with mortise/tenon or say baltic ply core? "
28,how do you transfer diameter from caliper to cylinder?,"I'm trying to transfer a caliper diameter to the end face of a cylinder on my wood lathe. How do I determine that the caliper is centered in order for that diameter to be transferred?  For example I have a cylinder like this:    and calipers like this:    Say, hypothetically the cylinder has a diameter of 10 units. I want to mark the bounds of a smaller, 5 unit circle using the caliper. How would I do that in a way that's precisely centered?  If the question is unclear, please let me know and I can include more info "
29,Is this plane any good for anything?,"New to planes, so not sure. This is a cheap one. I get dust instead of shavings when I try it on a piece of dry wood. Is this because the blade is not sharp? Wrong angle of the blade?  Edit: dumbest mistake ever, I've put the blade the bevel up...  Now the plane is doing something, not perfect but probably if I know how to sharpen and adjust the blade properly (trued sharpening on a sheet of 250 grit sandpaper) it will be better.       "
30,How to plane boards to the same thickness,"What is the best way to plane boards to the same thickness?  I was recently using and researching a bit into bench-top planers like: [website]My first thought was there would be some minimum thickness ""stopper"" that could be locked in for a given project, and then I could start shaving a bit off a handful of boards until they reached that thickness.  It appears this and other planers don't offer such a feature (or have I just not found it)?  Thinking about another way to achieve the goal: it seems I could pass all boards through, lower the height of the cutter head, pass them all through again, lower again, and so on, with the final height being the same. That way seems like more work-especially if the starting thicknesses are significantly different. "
31,Do I need to use epoxy primer on fiberglass/epoxy before painting?,"I am building a stitch&amp;glue plywood boat that is coated with fiberglass and epoxy on the outside. I am trying to determine whenever I need to add epoxy primer on top of the epoxy coat before painting. The dealer who I bought the epoxy from says that it is not needed, as the resin he sold will act as a primer itself. I called another store, specializing in paints, and they say that I do need to buy epoxy primer from them to get a good grip for the paint.  I will be using two coats of polyurethane paint.  Can someone clear this up? Is there any practical difference between epoxy resin and epoxy primer? Do I really need to spend extra money on the expensive primer, when I still have lot of resin?  Thank you in advance! "
32,How to repair breakout at the intersection of two through-mortises (inside the joint)?,"I'm making the joint for the leg shown in the following diagram, using handtools. There are two intersecting through-mortises. A tall one (for the apron running topleft-bottomright in the picture), and a square one (running topright-bottomleft).    I have (incorrectly) started my joint with the tall through mortise first. I should have used a sacrificial piece to occupy the first mortise hole while working on the second, but I didn't, and my chisel blow has broken out maybe a 1/4"" chunk from the lower inner wall.        On the left, the overall view of the leg. On the right, inside view from right side (high-res here).     It didn't break off cleanly, so I removed the chips. On the picture on the right, I've drawn a rough polygonal outline of the breakout.  Can this hole be re-filled with something? Or should I just restart the leg? I considered making an epoxy or glue+dust fill, and re-chiselling around. "
33,Sourcing Wood for non-commercial DIY Projects,"Now to be honest this is specific to the UK, which if this site is anything like StackOverflow, means my question will soon be closed as ""too localised"". However, please consider that the UK is very small relative to the US for example, and sourcing wood is problematic as much original timber is hard to come by.  I'm looking for places to obtain plywood (reclaimed is fine if I can find large enough sheets), initially for shop projects. I'm only just starting out this new hobby and it strikes me that Â£40 for a sheet of plywood is fairly expensive for building basic cabinets etc.  Obviously I've looked at ""big box"" stores like Wickes, but all their stuff (timber and sheet) is rubbish from a combination of poor manufacturing and poor storage.  I've heard of Jericho's reclamation centre near Oxford, but that's a long way from me. Are there any tricks people know for obtaining wood more locally? Things like going to new housing estates and asking to purchase offcuts etc?  Many thanks in advance. "
34,Routing a through dado in a small piece of wood,"First of all, I might have used wrong term in a question title, not sure if what I need to do can really be called ""dado"". Feel free to correct me in that case.  Here is what I need to do:    Speaking about the left and right pieces of it, there is a thing which I referred as ""dado"" - some material removed to create a slot with a rounded end.  I'd like to ask you - what is the best and easiest way to do it? In which ways the way I'm going to go (described below) might be improved?  Here is my plan - use a router table with a straight bit and cut it with several passes in such way: 1) Set a small material removal (let's say 1mm above the table surface).  2) Set up a stop block on the left part of the fence not to cut through.  3) Set a feather stops before and after the bit to prevent kickback (as the detail I'm going to cut is quite small)  4) Enable the router, push the detail through from the right side until it reaches the stop block  5) Disable the router, only then remove a piece, rise the bit a little bit and repeat routing. Repeat this until I cut through.  I'm actually asking this question because I'm completely new to power router and not sure which operations are safe for me and which of it are safe for detail I'm working on. "
35,"Just realized our deck was built with CCA pressure treated wood, what shall we do to eliminate or reduce the harm?","I just learned that the green stuff overlapping the wood board is a pretty positive sign that the pressure treated wood contains arsenic. We just bought a house and didn't realize until now. The CCA woods are in lots of areas. Instead of replacing all of them, is there any effective way to reduce or eliminate the toxic? Perhaps paint them? Any suggestions of what kind of paint?  Thank you! "
36,Sharpening Stones for Chisels and Planes (the 1000th time),"A form of this question has, no doubt, been asked a 1,000 times, but I need some specific guidance.  As and early Father's Day present, my wife bought me a Veritas Mk. II Honing Guide. Maybe this little dude is overkill (maybe not, tho), as I have never sharpened anything in my life, but I have been fooling around with chisels and not a one has been sharper than a table knife's edge. So, I'm pretty excited!  Of course, a honing guide has to have sharpening stones, and that gets me to the root of my questions.  My daughters bought a Naniwa Economical Waterstone (3000 Grit) and a Naniwa Flattening Stone to go long with the Veritas. In the mean time, a friend gave me a BearMoo 3000/8000 whetstone. (Boy is there a great difference between BearMoo and Naniwa -- the latter kicks the bear's butt.)  Now, the chisels I have are mostly from the early 20th century. Some have been used by my forefathers and others by heavens only knows who. Consequently, their bevels are mostly off by several degrees and none has a micro bevel. That in mind, I'm sure a 3,000-grit waterstone isn't going to cut it.   ...which leaves me to wonder what stones I should buy, keeping in mind I can't break the bank on this purchase ($200)? I've been kicking around and come up with a plan, and I'd like some input on prospective/current sharpening media:   Buy four DMT 6"" Diamond Whetstones, the very course, course, fine, and extra fine. I believe these are 60, 45, 25, and 9 microns, equivalent to 220, ~300, ~400, and 1,000 grit waterstones. (I used this chart to determine rough equivalences between different media and their grits.) Use my 3,000-grit Naniwa and 8,000-grit BearMoo waterstones Use a buffalo-hide strop with green compound. (I bought this a little while back for a different reason than sharpening chisels and plane blades, but it should work, right?)   I like the idea of diamond whetstones because they don't need flattening, and I hear they take off metal more quickly than a waterstone would. They seem ideal for getting my chisel bevels to the correct angle.   The DMT stones are on sale so I can get those for ~[tex]50 per stone. However, the span of ""grit sizes"" seems awfully close together. I've not found any article that recommends going from 220 to 300 to 400 grit when sharpening chisel/plane blades, but maybe the ""equivalense"" chart is wrong about the comparison between microns and grit sizes.  If I were to buy just the 220/300-grit equivalent diamond stone, should I also get the 9-micron (1000-grit) diamond stone or would a Naniwa 1,000-grit waterstone be better? It seems like I would need one or the other.  I think the 3,000-grit, 8,000-grit waterstones and leather strop are all used for honing the blade. Since I already have these in hand, they are part of the ""plan."" I asssume I would go through the 3,000-grit waterstone when creating my primary bevel; however, do I need to use all three when finishing off my micro bevel?  Thanks for any insight/opinions. I'm really starting to feel overwhelmed by all the choices. "

While designing the lift cradle and box surround and my ex-circular saw which will be stripped down. So it will not have the guard.

38,Working with Green wood,"Some friends of mine are getting married in the fall and I want to make them something more unique than a set of martini glasses.  I got this idea to make bookends for them out of solid blocks of green wood--something simple as I'm a relative novice, likely either cubes 4"" or so, or maybe longer blocks or rounds from a branch. My thinking is that as the wood dries, it will crack/warp, revealing a character that's unique to the block of wood and the environment in which it is kept. My basic question is, will this work?  I've never worked with green wood before and so I have a couple other questions:   Will blocks that big change the way I want them to? I understand that thinner boards will warp and crack, but will the changes on something this thick (4+ inches) be noticeable? Are there certain features of the wood (grain, location in the log, etc) that I should look for when picking out blocks to shape? Is there a way to sort of predict how the wood will change as it dries (everything I've seen is for planks, but I want to use something thicker)? Do certain woods have more movement than others? I'm located in the mid-Atlantic, and ideally it'd be something native to the region. Ideally, these pieces would be something that are constantly changing over the life of my friends' marriage, but I know that at some point the wood will become stable. Is there any way to slow the drying process down so that it takes years instead of months?   Has anyone done this sort of thing or worked with green wood and can give me some pointers/tips?    "
39,How flat is flat enough when laminating boards?,"I'm making a workbench top using 2x4s of douglas fir laminated face to face and a hand plane.  I know that the quality of the glue-up is going to be a function of the clamp strength, the flatness of the glue face, and the glue coverage.  The question is, how flat do I need the glued faces to be? I'm measuring with the corner of my plane across the boards at various points along the length and looking at the light that makes it through. But I'm not sure what is a ""flat enough"".  Any tips or rules of thumb? "
40,How do I fix a wobbly bench?,So I just finished building this bench:   [website]I like the bench everything came together really well and everything seems square. I built the full 8 foot bench and my concern is I have a slight wobble in it from left to right. I'm trying to figure out where to put some diagonal cross-braces and I'm not entirely sure where the best places would be. I'm pretty new to this woodworking thing so if I could get a little advice that be great. Thank you. 
41,Glue-up for butcher block-style countertop,"Background  I am working on a butcher block style countertop / tabletop, and am wondering how best to glue the wood together.  The countertop is unfinished maple hardwood floor, with the tongue / groove cut off, flipped on its side.  So, the final result will be about 1 3/4"" thick, mostly quarter sawn, 3/4"" width strips.  The final countertop will be 7' long and 20"" wide, with the wood running lengthwise.  (To clarify: I am calling it a tabletop / countertop, as I am not quite sure what to call it.  It will be installed on top of a half-height wall between the kitchen and hallway, and will be used as extra counter space, a serving area, and a 'breakfast bar'.  For extra support it will have three steel beams on the underside, with grooves for screws to allow for a bit of expansion across grain.  The ends will be finished with a breadboard end joint, although that is outside the scope of this question.)  For illustrative purposes, this is somewhat how the tabletop will look.  Each strip is 3/4"" wide:    I plan on the glued-up tabletop being longer than 7', and then trimming to length.  I will be using Titebond 3.  Question  My question is how to do the glue-up in such a way as to eliminate any gaps where I glue the strips end-to-end in a given row.  I am obviously going to be clamping width-wise (across the 20"" side), but am not sure how to clamp each row length-wise (across the 7' side).  I hope to do a handful of rows at a time (maybe 5 or so?), let them dry, then add more on.  Some Possibilities  Some possible answers I have come up with:   Make a clamping block that includes some sort of padding (styrofoam?) underneath a solid board, so that you can clamp 5-ish rows at a time without applying pressure only to the longest one.  My concern here is that I don't think styrofoam would provide enough pressure. Just push the rows together end-to-end while I am doing the side-to-side clamping, and rely on the side-to-side clamps to prevent any movement.  I don't think that this will work, as glue-ups are always slippery. Use a strip of rubber innertube that I use for guitar body glue-ups and individually wrap it around each row.  This is the most promising approach so far, IMHO - the rubber strip is very long, and should have no problems wrapping around the length of it 4 - 5 times.  My concern here is that I won't have time to get it wrapped up before the glue has started to set.  I suppose that starting with just a couple of rows to make sure I have time will be the answer there.   Thanks in advance for any suggestions!  Cheers  Edit after completion  Thanks to all the responders, I did the glue-up and things are looking good.  A few comments, in case it helps people in the future:   5 at a time was way too many.  3 was borderline too many; I found that 2 worked best. You need to plan your layout before gluing anything.  I laid out all the pieces to ensure that the butt joints were not aligned or too close to each other. I tested my first few end joint cuts for 90 degree, and they were perfect.  Unfortunately at some point after the first ones my miter saw must have gone out of square, and the later ones were slightly off.  Nothing too big, but enough for a 1/16 - 1/32"" gap in some places.  Sigh.  Wood filler has worked well for this though. As hard as I tried, I was unable to get the glue-up to be perfectly flat initially.  Some of the boards were slightly higher / lower than the others (not too bad, the worst was less than 1/8"", probably closer to 1/16"").  This meant that I needed to plane more than I would have liked. On the topic of planing, I got the surfaces flat with a toothed hand plane.  Only after it was flat did I use a belt sander to make it smooth.  My limited belt sander skills would not allow for me to get the surface flat if I had just used the sander... maybe others are better with the sander, but for me the plane was the way to go.  The toothed iron helped to avoid most of the tearout (laminations are very hard to plane due to the grain going every different direction). I did not end up using the steel bars - as commented by Martin, this this is already a beast.  The breadboard ends will help to prevent warping over time, and from a strength POV I could jump on it without it moving at all.   Here's some pictures:  During glue-up (the laid out pieces are on the left, and the glued pieces are in the clamps on the right):    Here's a closer look at one of the ends before finishing (not great for looking at the glue-up quality, but decent enough if you zoom in):    Applying finish:   "
42,What is this rotating joint called? Where can I find one?,"This round plastic object is inserted horizontally in the wood socket, then rotated and allows tightening the screw to fix together two pieces of my bed.  What is this hardware called?  Can a replacement be purchased independently?   "
43,Table top attachment with aprons on only two sides,"I'm building a small computer/writing desk. It will have a solid top, so I'm figuring out how to attach it to the frame to allow for wood movement.  I planned on using tabletop fasteners (Z clips), but I've run into a possible snag. The design only has aprons on the long sides. The short sides have stretchers a foot or so down from the top. So the only place I have to attach the fasteners would be on aprons that are running parallel to the boards in the solid table top, which wouldn't allow expansion along the width, right?  Any suggestions on how to attach this tabletop?   "
44,How to re-seal a kitchen chair seat,"Long story short here of several rookie mistakes that have led me to this question...I have a couple of kitchen chairs that I refinished recently. I chalk-painted everything but the seats, and left the seats as-is, leaving the wood unpainted. I was not smart enough to cover the seats while I painted the rest of the chairs, and a few paint flecks got onto the seats.   Mistake number 2 was using a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to try to get the paint off, which ended up just stripping the finish of the wood right off.   Mistake #3 was trying to bring the sheen of the seats back to life with boiled linseed oil. It never cured and stayed sticky for days on end, so I finally took it off with turpentine, which ended up taking the rest of the chairs' original finish off along with the BLO.   So here I am, with dull, unfinished chair seats, all because I didn't cover the chairs to begin with!! What's my next step? I would like to be able to just spray on some sort of clear sealant, since the surface area of the seats is small and I feel like painting on a new finish will only lead me to more imperfections.   Do I need something heavy-duty like shellac, polyurethane, or polycrylic? Or will any clear sealant do, just to bring the shine back?  "
45,Strength of board from squared branches as opposed to trunk wood,"I have a lot of well-dried branches and I was wondering whether it was possible to turn them into constructional lumber by gluing them together as follows:   cut them into equal length parts of about 20 / 30 cm square them so they all have the same thickness (about as thick as a finger) glue them all together in a brick pattern   Would this glued together board be as strong as plates from tree trunks? By which I mean: could it be use constructionally?  And if so, why aren't those kind of board produced on a large scale? I suppose it's better for the planet if only cut off branches are used. "
46,How to construct roof correctly covering walls corners?,"I'm trying to create a 3d model of the house which should resemble medieval one. It's not aiming to be perfectly aligned nor have strict measures; I'd like to learn how roof would be constructed if the mentioned house was real one.  I'm searching for a correct way of creating its roof. The house walls form some corners which prevent roof to have perfect forms. Here is a screenshot of the house without the roof:    There is a corner on the near side, however there aren't any on the other side (the wall is straight there). And this is its plan without roof:    house plan is highlighted  I don't have decent references and not aware of principles as to how are roofs constructed to cover that form. Should it be like this example ? (it is only a schematic representation of forms)      roof is highlighted  However its is now curved which is not something I saw on the ridges of the roof. What is the principle of constructing roof for similar case and how roof for that house could look like ? "
47,"Should I seal my bed slats, and if yes, with what?","I hired someone to put together bed slats for my new bed. The bed frame comes with center support for the slats that he's building and the slats will be screwed down onto the center slat and the side rails of the bed frame. He ordered furniture grade hard maple wood which has been planed and sanded.  He thinks that the bed slats might warp if I don't use a sealer. I really like the look of the hard maple without a stain or sealer though. Most do it yourself manuals for bed slats online don't even mention using a sealer. So this is what I want to know.   Should I use a sealer and why? If so, what sealer should I use that won't be noticeable or discolor the wood and still do the job?  "
48,Spots on live edge after sanding,"I have a slab of walnut with two live edges. After sanding down the live edges at 150 to remove bark and prep for finishing, I noticed these spots.

I want to dovetail the legs to the top, but the tail on the end will be about 1/2"" wide on the narrower end.

51,Proper grain orientation for a box,"I'm making a small box that will be used to hold mail, and I came up with the following design, with keyed miters on all the outside joints and dados for the dividers:    I've been reading recently about wood movement and I'm wondering if this design won't work, or if it's something I won't have to really worry about. Is there a certain grain orientation I should use? Currently, the grain on the front, back and sides runs horizontal and the grain on the bottom piece runs the length of the box. Should I change the grain of the sides to run vertically so their width can expand/contract with the width of the bottom piece?  Details:   Made with poplar (not sure yet which wood to use for the keys) Size is about 15"" x 5.5"" x 5.5""  "
52,Installing a solid wood tabletop on this steel frame,"I would like to screw this solid wood tabletop (the long one in the back, it's beech wood)    onto this steel frame.    The slab's dimensions are going to be 200 x 80 cm. I read that ""wood moves"", so I would have to screw the table top on in a way that allows for movement.  The problem is that none of the methods that I've read about that allow for movement are compatible with the screw holes facing up in the frame.   How can I solve this? Should I worry about movement for this type of tabletop at all or can I just screw it fixed?  Here's another photo of how the wood is supposed to look after it's been oiled:  "
53,Any way to straighten this wood gate piece?,"It wasn't until I got this gate piece screwed, glued, and hung up that I noticed there's a slight warp to it. I think it's due to just one piece in particular, but at this point I think I'm cooked. (Would have to drill out pocket hole plugs, dissolve the glue, and unscrew to replace the board.)  Is there any way to fix this? Hand plane it perhaps? (Newbie woodworker.) It's not awful, maybe a 1/4"" gap. Enough to bug me though.      "
54,How do I use a handplane to smooth a cutting board?,"I've never used a hand plane before, but recently decided to give hand planing a go.  I purchased a Lie-Nielsen No. 5 Jack Plane.  For a project to experiment with, I threw together a simple long grain cutting board made with alternating maple and walnut - smoothed first through a machine surface planer.    I had this idea that I would be able to run the hand plane over the surface of the (already smooth) cutting board and peel off whisper-thin shavings.  Especially with a new plane and a new blade.  Unfortunately, I can't find the sweet-spot between ""the blade's not even touch the wood"" and ""there's no coming back from a gouge that deep...""    So where do I go from here?  Is my flaw entirely technique and I just need to keep practicing?  Or does an out-of-the-box blade need to be ""sharpened"" first?  Maybe just a tool setup issue? Or, have I selected an inherently difficult practice project  (or inherently difficult for a jack plane)?   "
55,Are there alternative tools to a straight ironing rasp (or why are they so hard to find)?,"I'm looking for a tool to smooth/flatten down a surface in a rectangular channel in the center of a piece of wood (I constructed the piece by gluing two halves together, but stupidly didn't clean the channel halves well prior to gluing).  The channel measures ~1"" wide x 2"" long x 8"" deep (you can think of it as an 8"" deep mortise).  It's roughly square, but needs a lot of help.  Only one surface actually needs to be flat/smooth.  The best tool that comes to mind for the job is a file or rasp, but I need the handle offset so that it can actually get in the channel (the piece's construction is such that without an offset handle I wouldn't be able to put the face of the tool against the surface of the wood).  Alternatively if there were a way for me to sand inside the channel that would work too, but I'm unfamiliar with any way to get sand paper in a channel that deep/narrow.    After a ton of searching for things like ""crank necked rasp"" and ""offset handle file"" I finally learned that there is a name for what I think is my dream tool: straight ironing rasp.  This, for example, looks great:    It's pretty pricey and ships from Europe.  There seem to be tons of curved ironing rasps available from many of the usual online stores in the US, but very few straight options.  So far this is the only one I'm able to find.  This link implies that Auriou used to make a straight one, but now I can't seem to find it anywhere. Am I missing something here?  Why are there so few of these tools?  Does it go by a more common name that I'm just unaware of? "
56,Tips for planing huge panels of joined wood,"Somewhat akin to the purpose behind this question (Recommendation for manual planing and sanding), I am seeking advice from some experts that would help a hobbyist such as myself trying to manufacture large panels of wood made by joining together (mostly by glue - no fancy biscuit, dovetails, or dowel joints).  I even ran into problems when I had access to a decent variety of equipment at a hobby wood shop, when the thickness planers feed width was smaller than the width of the panel I was trying to prepare.    Since I figure cabinet makers make some pretty big armoires and wardrobes, how do you smooth up the glue joints and even up the panels so that they are nice and level?  Hand planes (manual and electric) would probably only give excellent results in the hands of the truly skilled.    Are the thickness planers and hand tools described in both the question and answers in the linked question above really the only options? "
57,How can I create a sturdy walking cane,"I've read a little and I see that butcher blocks are really sturdy, but they only seem to be used for flat surfaces, can I somehow adapt the technique for walking cane. eg. make a dozen cylinder and glued them on top of each other ? That would probably be pretty strong in the up-down axis (assuming the cane is standing up) what if I wanted to reinforce it so that it can't bend as easily ?  EDIT: I'm not looking to get the butcher block look or even actually make a cane, I'm looking into techniques to reinforce objects of that shape aka long, curved and thin pieces. For example, an ""S"". "

59,"Router tears wood, leaves streaks","I bought a router and am practicing. When I cut across the grain (actually, it does not matter, see ""conclusion"") I noticed that sometimes it tears bits of the wood out. For example, here are two ends of the same piece of 3/4"" pine:    Both ends were cut by me but on the bottom you can see the rough cut. This is a hand held 1.5 hp router at ~20000 rpms using a straight blade with 2 flutes. The blade is 3/8"" diameter and I removed about 1/8"" of uneven material. I used the router base against a clamped piece of wood as a guide. The feed direction was against the blade rotation.  Why is this happening and can I avoid it? Did the router actually rip those bits out or do those pockets already exist in the wood? Is it a problem with my technique, wood quality, or just a normal unavoidable thing?  Conclusion (Probably)  Following CoAstroGeek's answer I inspected my equipment and tried more consistent cuts to repeat the problem.  I sawed away a portion of the wood near the tear and verified that it was not an internal defect, it looks like I did the damage:    I then cut material off in the same way as above using all four straight bits from the same set, increasing diameter each time. I kept my speed more consistent this time and tried to go a bit faster. Cuts were made right to left in images below. Looking closely, even though I did not have tearing as above, the results are very poor (I burned the first one a lot cutting off too much material, so I couldn't move quickly):    The second bit was OK. The third is the one I was using in the original images. The streaks are in the same positions as the tears. This is probably not coincidence. All four blades also leave light horizontal streaks the whole way down, which I initially attributed to sanding.  Also while I thought my cuts along the grains had no issues, on closer inspection there is still notching:    When I inspected each bit under a magnifying glass, one of the flutes was slightly chipped or dented at the location of every deep scratch. I could not determine the cause of the lighter more frequent scratches.   I tried similar experiments with my other bits, not part of this set and from a different manufacturer, and none had any of these issues.  The general conclusion is this set of bits is probably just crap. It was fairly cheap. It also taught me that I should be very careful when storing bits because even small defects can ruin a cut. I do not know if the dents are manufacturing defects or damage to the bits done by me in storage (all of the bits used were brand new before this post). Time to go shopping. "
60,Make a bunk bed v2,"I decided to make a bunk bed for my room as it is small and I need a desk. I made a first design in this thread Make a bunk bed      But I realised that all the strength would be on the angle brackets and the screws. So I made a new design where the two main wooden beams are laid on the four vertical beams. It reduced the number of 3m wooden beams by two because instead of having 4x2m beams I had 4x1.4m beams.     I made some tests and saw that the main wooden beams could support about 1000kg but the slates could only support about 50kg. With the help of the bed, the weigh should spread on the other slates but I still would like to have your opinions.     If I had a center horizontal beam, the slates would have ~60cm on each side of the central beam and the support capacity would be much higher but I'm not sure wether it's well attached to the rest of the structure or not.     Did I use the sagulator tool right ?  Do you think I should put the center beam ?  Should it be attached better to the rest of the structure ?

61,What tool can cut thin wood or acrylic/plexiglass without melting it that is suitable for NYC apartment?,"I live in NYC. I have a small roof deck but mostly must work inside and I have very little space to keep tools. I need to build cases for my electronics projects. Acrylic/plexiglass seems like a nice option but I'm at a loss when it comes to cutting square holes in it. Some say a Dremel will work others say it will melt the acrylic.  Right now I have:   Large manual drill Small manual jeweler's drill serious glue gun soldering station heat gun  various needle nose pliers a million scissors every screwdriver nippers/tin snips/snippers/flush cutters Tiny shop vac   I'm thinking of getting one of the following:   manual scroll saw scroll saw jig saw  Dremel   But I can't decide what would help me build cases for my small electronics projects most out of thin (think under 1/4"" wood) and plastic. Noise can be and issue. That's why I love my manual drills.  They also are much more precise and don't melt plastic. I'm leaning towards the manual scroll saw ... but I don't have any way to try before I buy...  Maybe I need more than one saw? Any advice? "
62,Caliper Showdown: Dial vs. Digital vs. Vernier,"  I recently purchased a digital caliper to make more precise measurements than a basic variety vernier and it works great. I wanted them to measure the width of my table saw for making my sled runners.   After watching a video on making an accurate table saw sled I started to notice more instructional videos using dial calipers.   Of course this could just be a case of frequency illusion but it begs the questions:    If you were given a choice between dial, digital and vernier calipers which one should you pick?  As far as woodworking is concerned what would make one preferential over the other or is this just a matter of personal preference?  "
63,"""Annealing"" wood?","Is there a process for wood similar to annealing for metals to relieve internal stress?  For example, if I have a thin piece of oak used for trim that is bowed sideways (bowed parallel to trimmed face), but I force it straight when gluing and clamping, is there something I can do to make it happy in its new position so it doesn't exert any force on the piece it was glued to?  I realize this may be a silly question. I also know there are better solutions, e.g. planing the trim or not using a bowed piece, lining up grain correctly, etc. I am wondering if this specific process exists, though and what it is called if it does (searching for ""annealing wood"" doesn't yield sensical results).

64,Can I apply polyurethane over oil before oil cures?,"Specifically I am wondering about polyurethane (Rustoleum Ultimate) over boiled linseed oil, but in general polyurethane or other top coats with similar chemistry over any drying oil.  Question is: Can I apply polyurethane over an oil before the oil completely cures or do I have to wait?  I looked up linseed oil on Wikipedia and it led me to drying oils. These oils polymerize by reacting with ambient O2. I also attempted to research the curing process of polyurethane but discovered there are many different types with many different uses, so it was difficult to find info. I think they cure by reacting with ambient moisture.  My knowledge of chemistry is too limited to be able to understand if polyurethane would allow O2 to pass through to react with the undercoating of oil as it cures.  The other random bit of info that I found is that Rustoleum Ultimate polyurethane primarily consists of:   Dipropylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether (DPM) Methyl-n 2-Pyrrolidone (NMP)   Neither of which I understand. I reached the conclusion that they are moisture cured from this article although it concerned types of polyurethane used on metal. Not sure if it's the same as wood.  So, can I apply polyurethane before the BLO cures? Will it continue curing underneath? Or do I have to wait? If I do have to wait, what will happen if I don't? Is it different for an oil-based polyurethane (it looks like the Rustoleum one is water-based)? "
65,What material is suitable for a children's desk/furniture?,"I want to build a children's desk for my wife's two nieces. I have some very nice oak but I don't feel like using something like that would be smart because it will be beaten up, painted over, and let's face it, not appreciated.  What would be a suitable material, in terms of durability and cost, for a children's desk? The desk would most likely be painted over with a ""children's"" color. I was thinking about using MDF but I don't know how it will hold up or how it compares in cost to, say, maple or oak.   Also, what tips/advice do you have for using the chosen material that would be different from using normal hardwood?  EDIT: I live in the Midwest so I will be limited to materials within the region.

66,Is there a better way to make a wand?,"I recently decided to make a magic wand with my son as a small project. He's been showing it off a bit (despite being very simple/basic), and now we've been asked to make a bunch more for family/friends.  Before I do, I'd like to know if there's an easier or more effective way to do this. They're being made from 1/2"" oak dowels (straight from a big box store), about a foot or so long:    I didn't want to use a lathe, mainly because it's so thin in some areas. So, I ended up using the outer edge of a disc sander to shape most of it. It was somewhat tedious, and it's not as symmetrical and ""smooth"" as I'd like. There's also a limit on the angle/shape of ""cuts"", since I can only hold it to the sander at so much of an angle.  They would all be a bit differently shaped, with varying handle sizes, groove locations, etc. So I'm guessing anything that uses some sort of shaped jig wouldn't work.  So, my main questions are: Would it be safe on a lathe to go down to about half diameter? If not, what would the best tool for the job be? "
67,Can I use a conventional oven or toaster oven as something similar to a dry kiln?,"While researching the answer to the question about What are the techniques to seal or remove sap? I found that putting the wood in a dry kiln, under specific circumstances, is one sure way to bake/seal the sap.  While there might be an accessible dry kiln in my area I am not using large piece or large quantities of wood to justify the potential cost.   So, as my title says, can I use a conventional oven or toaster oven as a dry kiln? "
68,What to look for in making a good shellac finish,I'd like to learn to use shellac. From what I've heard it's one of the more difficult finishes to achieve. Why? I plan to practice on a few pieces before I use it on something I really care about. What should I be watching out for? 
69,Woodshop and fiber insulation,"My basement shop area currently has open floor joists above it, with insulation batting between them. (Yes, I know current theory says insulating there is of minimum value, but for sake of discussion ...)  Hand tools, and even small power tools, don't throw enough dust that I've had to worry about this. But as I scale up and start to get more serious about dust collection,  it occurs to me to wonder...  How much risk is there of enough sawdust settling in that insulation to compromise its non-flammability? Do I need to speed up the decision about whether to install a ceiling or remove that batting?    (I suppose I should note that the insulation in this case is a fireproofed cellulose -- the batting equivalent of blown-in. Much more pleasant to work with than fiberglass.) "
70,How can I stain birch plywood to match sapele?,"First of all, can it be done?  If so, how does one mix and match stains to achieve the right color? Is it highly unlikely that I'll get it right? "
71,"When making a box joint, how do I calculate the width of the board so that the teeth appear even?","I have made some box joints and thus far I've found it difficult to ensure that the teeth are evenly spaced; there's usually a pin that is cut down a bit.  Is there an equation or method of determining what the board's width should be?  Is it as simple as ""always ensure board is a multiple of 2x the kerf of the dado set? "
72,How thick do slabs need to be in a slab bench?,"My cousin's fiancee is looking to build a bench for their kitchen. From his description, it sounds like what I would call a ""slab bench."" Just three thick slabs of wood, two for legs and one long one (about 60 inches he said). He hasn't decided on a wood. I recommended hardwood, but in retrospect given the thickness of the slabs, I think it might actually be worth trying in pine.  I told him I would typically use a frame or angle braces to prevent the seat from bowing and to make a rigid connection from the legs to the seat, but if it's a thick enough slab maybe that wouldn't be an issue: Is a 3-4 inch thick slab enough that it won't noticeably bow?  If they were to not use angle braces or a frame (i.e. there are only 3 members, no supporting structure), how should I connect the legs? I thought maybe just a really big mortise and tenon for each leg would do it, but I'm still concerned about it being weak. Should I just tell them to suck it up and reinforce the connections?  edit I've been provided with a reference picture of what he's looking at. It looks like it's just reclaimed 4x4 lumber with a miter, ... maybe biscuits or something as well, but no braces or anything.   "
73,What is a wedged through tenon and how is it used?,"What is a wedged through tenon and how is it constructed? How is it different than a ""standard"" mortise and tenon? When should it be used? "
74,Is it safe to resaw on a table saw?,"I have been under the impression that if you want to resaw lumber, the tool of choice is a bandsaw. I don't have a bandsaw, but I do have a contractor-style table saw. However, I have read elsewhere that it isn't safe to resaw lumber on a table saw.  But looking through Mathias Wandel's site, I found a couple places where he resaws lumber using his table saw; like here, for example.  Is this considered safe? If so, what are the rules of resawing on a table saw? I presume I should treat it like a rip cut. Is there a minimum safe length of board, where going shorter would become unsafe? Are there other safety considerations specific to resawing I'm not aware of? (Obviously all the standard rules of table saw safety should still apply: Don't stand directly behind the board being cut, use push sticks, etc.) "
75,Does MDF have a grain direction?,"Plywood is assembled, at least from I can see in this video, so the sheets are arranged perpendicular to each other so that the directional durability of the grain is complimented to give an overall unidirectional strength.   When paper is milled it has a grain direction. The paper is stronger along one direction than the other. You can tell this by both looking at the paper and bending it along its lines of symmetry.   Does the manufacturing process of MDF give the resulting boards a grain direction?  If I were to glue two MDF boards together would the orientation matter for stability? "
76,Leveling a finish/finishing the finish,"I'm using Emmet's Good Stuff (poly gel varnish that you wipe on) as a finish on a walnut slab.  I've read a lot about finishing online, but am a little confused about ""leveling the finish.""  As I understand it poly varnish requires some minor abrasion between coats for good adhesion.  The guy at my local woodworking store told me to use 320 to accomplish this as well as to knock out any streaks left by my application rag, dust nibs, etc in between coats.  I take it that this is not the ""leveling step"" described in sources like Flexner's ""Understanding Wood Finishing"" and is really more of a very light hit with 320 so as not to ""bust through"" the finish?  How many coats of finish should you put on before ""leveling""?  As I understand it ""leveling"" means sanding (possibly wet sanding with ~320 grit) until the entire surface is at an even sheen, which presumably requires some amount of build up or else you're going through to the wood.  Flexner's book (page 156 -- ""Brushing Varnish"") says: ""brush on the first coat....sand the surface lightly with 280-grit or finer...apply the next coat...sand the surface lightly with 320-grit or finer sterated sandpaper...If you're trying to achieve a perfect or near-perfect flat surface, sand out the brush marks after the next-to-last coat...use 320-or 400-grit wet/dry sandpaper lubricated with soap and water or mineral spirits.  The last coat will then level better.""  Does that mean that if you apply, for example, 5 coats of finish that you sand the first one with 280, the next one with 320, don't sand the next one at all, wet sand the 4th coat, and polish the final 5th coat?  If you apply 7 coats would that imply two more coats with no sanding/abrasion at all?  On a related note his book also warns about ghosting or going through one layer to another.  If you're leveling a surface, which has brush marks in it are you not -- by definition -- taking off more material in some places than others, which means that you must be intentionally ghosting in certain spots?    After leveling I take it the next step is polishing/rubbing, which can be done with things like abralon discs and the like.  Is that typically done on the leveled surface or on yet another coat over the leveled surface? "
77,What is the difference between a sabre saw and a jig saw,This is more out of curiosity. I came across the term sabre saw and tried to figure out what it was.   Searching the internet turned up results for both a jigsaw:    ...and a reciprocating saw:    This leads me to wonder if sabre is a descriptive word to describe a reciprocating blade mechanism found in both jig saws and reciprocating saws. Or is it another type of saw? 
78,How do I fix a new douglas fir tongue and groove exterior floor that is oozing sap?,"I've just had installed a new Douglas Fir tongue and groove porch floor - the porch is covered but will still get some rain. The flooring already has two coats of Woodlife Classic and I will be priming and painting it.  Upon closer inspection I found seeping sap. I've read other posts on this topic here and elsewhere, but still have questions.   What I have done is:   dug out the sap as best as I can - there are 13 spots - they are differing sizes - from 2"" - 5"" long and about 1/4"" - 3/8"" deep.  3 out of the 13 have a diagonal vein of sap that runs deep   I'm afraid to go any deeper - the boards are 5/8"" thick and I don't want to go all the way through.     What I have read is that I should prime with BIN and then fill with a wood epoxy, however I have found two different opinions on which should go first.   So, my questions are:    Which goes first, the epoxy or BIN?  Can I leave the deeper veins as they are and just clean them out as best as I can?  When I dug out the sappy parts, the wood is pretty rough - will the epoxy better adhere to a rough surface or should I sand them smooth?  I know sanding will be required once all is said and done - should I retouch the Woodlife?   "
79,Alternatives to grip tape on a longboard,"Making my first longboard, and I'd like to put some art on top of it. On most skateboards (like Carver for example - see pic 1) grip on the top side of the deck is achieved by using a grip tape. On other boards though (like Globe for example - see pics 2, 3) some other technique is used. It looks like it's grains of sand + glue or lacquer, which is great because you can apply colorful art on top of it.  Any one has an idea how to create such grip on the longboard's deck? How to create grains? What type[s] of glue to use?  Thanks  Carver with grip tape (not what I need)   Globe, colored, with grip that is sort of see-through (what I want to achieve)   Globe, closer look  "
80,Is low-formaldehyde plywood important if the wood will be finished with polyurethane?,"I'm willing to pay a premium for low-VOC materials to improve indoor air quality. Recently, I've been using PureBond plywood, which uses a soy-based adhesive instead of urea formaldehyde.  This surely has some air quality benefits when cutting and sanding the wood, but I typically finish my projects with at least 3-4 coats of a low-VOC water-based polyurethane. Since I'm doing that, does it even matter (in terms of outgassing and indoor air quality) what comprises the plywood? Can hazardous gasses escape the polyurethane layer? "
81,What is the proper humidity for a shop and how should I achieve it?,"I'm off to build my own workshop for mostly woodworking projects in the (huge) basement garage of a very old house. The garage is about 5 by 30 meters(16 by 100 ft) and has a varying height of 3 to 6 meters (10 to 20 ft). It has just a huge garage door (approx 4 by 4 meters (13ft)) and no windows.   I haven't gotten around to test all the corners for their average humidity, but I fear that it may vary quite drastically from season to season (Central Europe) and even be different in various locations inside the place.  I think I'd be aiming for somewhere around 40%?!? in average humidity and hope that to the rear of the room (which is basically a dead end tunnel) the humidity will drop and I can store and dry my lumber there.  Is there a ""rule of thumb"" for the ideal workshop humidity level? Are there some tricks I can use to bring it down to some degree without using ""expensive to buy and run"" machines?  In winter I will probably heat the place up with a gas powered heater as it's fast and relatively cheap but I fear that this will cause fast and rapid changes in humidity -> which I think is quite bad.

82,UFP treated woods for raised garden bed,I have a raised garden bed using wood logs that have 'UFP Treated' tags at the end. I am using my raised bed for growing vegetables.    What does 'UFP Treated' mean?  Are these board safe to continue to use it for my vegetable garden bed?  
83,Is wood glue enough to hold a pine serving tray together?,"I'm making a serving tray out of five pieces of pine. Will wood glue be enough to hold the tray together? If not, what should I do instead? "
84,Miter saw does not cut all the way through,"I have a cheap miter saw. When I saw something the blade does not go all the way through. The blade does not reach entirely between the fence and the bottom, leaving a part uncut. Is this a known problem? Can I adjust some settings on the saw to solve this? Is my saw blade too small?  In this picture, the blade does not reach the red part:    I also made a video of me sawing. "
85,Warped Walnut Slabs,"I have 2 walnut slabs I want to make a table with but they are slightly warped, is there anyway to flatten these back out with water and weight or by bolting the wood down to a frame and then moistening?  Not sure and don't want to make the warping worst than it already is?  "
86,Can I make a stool from thinner OSB,"I have some leftover piece of 12mm OSB. I want to make this stool out of it:  Originally it was made from 18mm plywood, obviously I need to adjust to use thinner board.  I want to keep the weight to the minimum, and keep the strength (I'm going to stand on it occasionally to reach high shelves).  My questions are: 1) Where should it be reinforced? I'm thinking two 15*15*1 mm steel square tube along front leg:   and 20*20*2 mm steel angle bar along the center of the back leg.  2) How should I join the corners? Original screws to the edge seems unreliable for a thin board. I'm thinking screws to aluminum angle bar. "
87,Fettling a hand plane,"I have a #5 faithfull handplane (don't judge me, I didn't know any better!) that I tried to get working last year and failed miserably, so it sat in the cupboard for 6 months whilst I sulked. Since then I have bought a couple of books, and read a few forums, and i want to try and have another go at working with hand tools to make basic things for the house (a new gate, a repacement door, blanket boxes etc).  All that waffle aside, I have some feeler guages and initially I want to check the sole of the plane for flatness. Will a piece of formica kitchen worktop be a flat enough reference surface to see how bad the plane sole is, or do I need to find something flatter (if so, what can I use that is likely to be found in an average house?)  Then secondly, if the sole needs a lot of flattening, is that something I can easily do on a series of grades of Scotch paper glueued to the worktop, or am I just creating more problems for myself here?  Cost is more of an issue than time, I am doing this to do soemthing creative with my hands, but as I do not know yet if this is somethign I will actually enjoy long term, I don't want to buy a lot of equipment that could end up on ebay in 2 years. "
88,Driving a nail into wood that has split and been glued back together,"I built a trellis this weekend, but before I could secure it to the fence it got blown over in a storm.  Luckily, the only damage was a splinter on one of the horizontal boards.  I glued it back in place and now I have to re-attach the crosspiece that went there.    The former nail hole is marked by the red arrow.  I plan to drill out the glue that has filled the nail hole and drive a new nail in.  Is this the right approach?  Do I need to take extra precautions to prevent additional splitting or undoing my repair? "
89,How do vertical saws avoid cutting their support,"I'm wondering how this is possible. Vertical panel saws don't cut into the support beams the stock is resting on while being cut.   Making horizontal cuts I have seen that the support rails are moved out of the way, but how does that work when sawing vertically? Are there some predefined positions? I don't think so as I have seen one in action and it seemed to be free to cut anywhere.   Can anyone working with such a saw explain how this is possible? "
90,Stains on Hardwood Floor,"I am a newbie here and have already done some research about this, no luck yet. I am trying to get rid of the stains on my hardwood floor. Two -almost exact- stains. Trying to get rid of the original stain, following some research, I applied hydrogen peroxide and ended up with light colored areas. Now I need to make them look as the rest. I tried to sand across with some sandpaper (120), wiped the sand dust and applied ""parquet lacquer"" (parkettlack here in germany) but didn't work.  Should I get more aggressive on sanding, sand the surrounding area as well? Maybe I can purchase one electric hand-held sander. Should I also get into ""staining"" - the hardwood is quite fair colored and has matt lacquer?  Do you think this can be solved without needing professional help?  Thanks a lot!   "
91,Square corners in CNC-cut plywood,"I'm thinking about making a workbench out of CNC-cut plywood with the legs as several layers of plywood.  I'm thinking about attaching the legs to the skirt (top frame to make rigid or whatever it's name is) like this (this only shows one leg, the horizontal part is the skirt, it will extend further after I mirror the leg to get the other 3 legs in the CAD):    In this design I need inside square corners which the CNC cutter cannot do.  The question is if I design it with square corners, then round the corners right before sending the files to the CNC shop to accommodate for the limitation of the cutter, will it be easy to cut the square inner corners manually afterwards with enough precision for the parts to match? Or is it better to accommodate for round corners in the design somehow so that it all connects with round corners? "
92,Tabletop attachment apron slots buttons tightness,"Thinking about attaching a workbench tabletop (800mm x 600mm) made out of a 40mm oak panel (or probably 2 20mm oak panels glued together if I cannot find a 40mm one) like on the image below with buttons made of 2 glued layers of 21mm plywood (the workbench legs and apron will be out of CNC-cut plywood, so making the buttons out of the same plywood makes sense)  How tight should the buttons fit into the slots? If I make 20mm slots for 21mm thick buttons will this be too tight for the buttons to move as the tabletop expands/contracts?  Should the slots in the apron be positioned such as to make the top of the buttons a bit lower than the under surface of the tabletop to press the tabletop tight against the aprons? How much lower?  How much movement both along and across the tabletop should I expect max with this tabletop size? (to size the button slots in the apron)   "
93,Random Orbital Sander rounds table edges,"My Bosh GEX 125-1 AE Random Orbital Sander tends to round all my edges. I am sanding a table top and all points are now curved down, instead of straight.  I believe this is happening because the sander's pad is somewhat concave, probably to better suck out the dust, and when I pass it over an edge, the edge gets into the concave and gets its form, thus, being rounded.   I am somewhat new to woodworking, so I would like to know how the experienced guys deal with this, do you avoid sanding edges with a Random Orbital Sander at all and only sand it by hand? Or is it there some sort of trick?  "
94,How can I evenly distribute small boards of lumber to make a bigger board?,"I'm not the best mathematician, so I want to run this by real woodworkers:  I need a board of red oak 29 5/8""W x 16'L to make a cabinet top and then stain it.    This is what I'm thinking to make the wood look evenly distributed... If 1x4 is really 3 1/2""W then 7 * 3.5 = 24 1/2""W - which is acceptable for what I am doing.    So I need 7 1x4x16, correct?  What bothers me is having to butt joint &amp; glue 7 boards of expensive wood hoping it all comes out flush and level.  Is there a better way?  EDIT:  I made a typo...""I need a board of red oak 29 5/8""W x 16'L""  should have read, ""I need a board of red oak 24 5/8""W x 16'L""  Clarification:  The final length is 159 15/16"", but local lumbar yard only sells 16' boards.  Hence, I plan to glue-up the 16' boards and then cut to size.  "
95,Built-in plywood desk and wood movement,"I am building a built-in desk for my home office.  I plan to use 3/4"" plywood over a 2x4 frame and attach the frame to the studs.  I understand that the table top needs to be allowed to expand/contract so I'm planning to attach the plywood to the 2x4 frame using cleats or similar hardware for this purpose.  The desk will be from wall to wall (~8').  Do I need to leave a gap between the plywood top and the walls to allow for expansion and contraction?  If so, how much would you recommend? "
96,Can I rub out out water-based wipe-on poly with steel wool?,"I'm finishing a small side table using this water-based wipe-on poly, and wasn't sure how to go about ""rubbing out"" the end product. I was planning on following this video. Basically, sand with a fine grit sandpaper, go over it with #0000 steel wool, and then go over it again with the steel wool, but with soapy water as a lubricant.  Since the finish I'm using is water based, is using steel wool in this process okay? I know that steel wool isn't supposed to be used before the finish or in between coats, but I wasn't sure about using it after the finish is applied. If it's not ok, what are some alternatives? I've seen synthetic steel wool, but the ones available at the local big box stores seem to be of not very good quality. "
97,What should be done to treat decorative wood for outdoor use?,"I'm building a live edge bench in memory of a loved one, and would like it to last as long as possible while weathering the elements year round.  I live in Pittsburgh, PA, which means we get occasional sunny summer days in excess of 90 degrees, but of more concern are occasional sub-zero (C) temperatures and lots of snow and ice in the winter.  I'm also concerned about bugs.  The bench will be made from several bookmatched slabs of live-edge Cherry at approximately 1.5"" thick.  That includes the bench, seatback, and side/legs.   Hidden lateral supports will be made from pressure treated 2x4 lumber.  I planned to do nothing to the pressure treated 2x4s.  I planned to cut and sand the live edge slabs, then have the dedication laser-engraved.  Then apply 7-10 coats of UV-resistant outdoor poly-urethane.  Then anchor together using outdoor deck screws with a dab of 100% silicone over the screw holes (they will be hidden).  What other measures should be taken to keep this piece protected from the elements?  Is there any sort of chemical that should be applied and allowed to seep into the wood?  Keep in mind that any treatment to the visible decorative areas must not negatively impact the appearance of the wood. "
98,Why is clear epoxy not often used to fill cracks in live edge slabs?,"I've worked with a few live edge slabs in the past, but the one I have now is the first one with a sizable crack.  I don't like the look of butterfly keys, and I don't believe that this crack needs much reinforcement, but I was going to fill it with West epoxy just in case (and as a way to finally try using it).  The thing that has surprised me in the videos I've seen is that all of them use a very dark tint, many going with straight black.  It creates a very striking aesthetic effect, but I don't think I want to pull the visual focus away from the wood like that.  I was considering using the epoxy without a tint so that the reinforcement is relatively invisible, and went with the 207 hardener for this purpose.  However, I have not been able to find a single example of clear epoxy being used.  I've done some googling but in addition to not seeing any examples, I also cannot find any discussion of why tinting is so common.  Since it is done so rarely I assume there must be a reason, and don't want to ruin my slab due to my inexperience, so:  Why is clear epoxy not used?  What considerations should go into a decision about whether, and how, to tint? "
99,Handsaws for very small flooring project,"Is there one excellent-quality handsaw that does both crosscuts and rip cuts, and, if not, what two handsaws should I buy?  The task is to install either an engineered wood, or possibly hardwood, floor in a small (165 sq ft) room.  Speed is not important but neat, precision cuts is. I am a highly-motivated novice.  If hand-tools are totally inadequate for the job, what is the minimum set of power-tools? "
100,What are the potential issues with this bench design?,"I am building a memorial bench out of live edge slabs.  I liked the idea of the 'legs' matching the form and style of the seat and seatback slabs, so I decided to cut them out of my scrap slabs.  Either side of the seat slab will be corner notched, and the notches will rest in the side pieces.  The seatback will have a notch cut for the armrest and will be screwed to the side pieces.  The seat and back will not extend more than an inch past the side pieces.  This outline shows my initial design for the side pieces.  As the pencil marks are difficult to see I've created a second photo where I messily highlighted the cut lines in purple.     Are there any potential structural, construction, or even aesthetic issues with this design?  I am aware that in a perfect world the wood grain should run at an angle down the legs to maximize strength, but given than I'm cutting this out of a single slab that's not possible.  The legs are just under 2"" at their thinnest point, which I believe should be sufficient to hold the bench and users?  This slab is approximately 1.5"" thick, kiln-dried Cherry (approximately 7% moisture content).  I am attempting to utilize as much of the natural edge as possible so the edges will not be cut straight; bark will be removed completely and the edges lightly sanded.  Epoxy will be used to fill the cracks.  The armrest will be heavily sanded on each side to provided rounded edges for comfort, and is approximately 1"".  The seatback posts are sloped back at a 5 degree angle and approximately 2"" at their thinnest point.  The underside of the seat will have two pressure treated 2x4s running the length and attached to the side pieces.  An additional scrap piece of slab (approximately 1.5"" x 3"") will be run at the lowest center point to provide additional lateral stability. "
101,Wood conditioner then stain then oil?,"Iâm about to finish my first woodworking project, itâs a tv stand made from 2x4s. Iâve been doing some research on finishing but canât find an exact answer. Iâve seen that a wood conditioner should be used first to get a consistent blotch free stain finish. Should I then use a Danish oil on top of the stain? So it will be conditioner, stain, oil? "
102,What tool can I use to cut/plane a lot of dowel rods?,"I made a piece of sculptural wall art out of pieces of wooden dowel rod, joined together with epoxy glue. It looks similar to these:   Example 1  Example 2    Though I tried to keep the bottoms of the dowel rods (which would be against the wall) even with each other, they are sitting at different heights in the back meaning the piece won't hang flat against the wall.   What sort of machine or tool would I use to cut them all down flat to be even with each other? "

104,What kind of finishes can kids safely work with and apply?,"I'm developing a hands-on workshop/demo series for elementary schools kids. At some point, I'd like the kids to apply a finish to the baubles I/we make during the workshops.  What would be a good wood finish that's safe for the kids to work with, and apply to their creations?    Maybe Shellac would be an option too??? I know it's normally made with denatured alcohol, which is poisonous. But I just found out our provincial liquor control board may permit the purchase of pure ethanol for medical, research, manufacturing, and other 'non-beverage' purposes.  I understand that dry shellac flakes are safe. Is this correct? If so, I could mix up my own shellac with 'shellac flakes + pure ethanol,' which I'd regard as a fairly kid-safe mixture. Would this work, or am I missing something here? "
105,Using a Jim Miller Tenon Jig,Has anybody built the tenon cutting jig from this article (video here). I bought the issue of Popular Woodworking issue that it came from and it says the curved support (on the left in the picture) is optional and I'd like to try to build one without it.  But I can't figure out how the jig would be held to the bench.  I need to get a suitable vise and can't get a fancy tail vise as used in the picture.  Would a Moxon-style vise work?

I've completed a large puzzle, dimensions ~ 62"" x 42"", and I'm interested in creating a ""frameless"" frame to mount it on the wall. This would involve cutting and securing long, slender cuts (preliminary dimensions 1"" x 2"") to a 1/4"" thick piece of MDF board. The entire process can be seen here.   The video uses pine DAR (Dressed All Round, seems to be an Aussie product) secured to a 6mm thick MDF board. The sides of the pine DAR are stained as well. However, I can't seem to find any DAR locally in the US. I've seen that furring strip is cheap and comes cut in dimensions I can easily work with.    Is furring strip ""structurally"" sturdy enough for me to use in this application? Is there a specific name for the ""x brace"" pattern being used here?    "
109,Are sharpening jigs reasonably universal?,"I'm considering buying a new sharpening system, either the Axminster Ultimate Edge Reverse or a Sorby Pro-Edge.  And I'm wondering about sharpening jigs, I've got chisels and woodturning tools, but I'd also like to put whichever system I buy to use on knives and possibly an axe. Some of that I could do free hand, but there seems to be jigs available for sharpening every type of edged tool and I wondered if anybody knows whether the different jigs are compatible between different systems?  For example, would an Axminster knife jig work on the sorby? Would a Tormek axe jig work on either? I've little experience with any sharpening equipment before, I just know I find doing it by hand laborious and challenging! "
110,"2-part dust collector, loss of CFM or not?","So I'm about to order a Grizzly G1028Z2 1-1/2 HP Dust Collector rated at 1300 CFM. I'm unsure if I should get a super Dust Deputy to go with it. Will I lose a lot of my CFM's if I do this?  Also, a side question: does is matter if I buy a super Dust Deputy or a regular Dust Deputy? I already have a normal Dust Deputy, would it work the same if I just have adapters for it? "
111,Do I need to sand off old finish completely before applying polyurethane?,"I want to add polyurethane to wood floors to protect them from wear. The floors were already finished and looked fine. I sanded one floor with 120 grit sandpaper, and now the finish looks patchy. I sanded another for less time and the finish still looks more consistent.  If the finish looks patchy now, do I need to sand it all down in order to get a consistent look? In other words, after I apply oil-based polyurethane, will it retain the patchy look?  For the rooms that haven't been sanded as much and retains a consistent finished look, can I apply polyurethane directly without sanding it down further? "
112,How to smooth out final polyurethane coat?,"first time posting here and first time doing any sort of woodworking.  I purchased the Gerton table top from IKEA and it came pretty scratchy. So I sanded it with 120 grit sandpaper and applied 3 coats of polyurethane to it.  For the most part this all seems fine, but the top level feels a bit uneven, and there's some small air bubbles all over the place.  I was wondering what's the best way to smooth out the top level of polyurethane? Should I try sanding it?  I've looked online but found contrasting ideas on what to do, so any feedback would be great to hear.  Thanks! "
113,Remove old oil stains from oak table before refinishing,"I've bought an oak table to give it a second life as our dining table, our plan is to refinish it with (hardwax) oil.  It was quite stained and originally treated with some kind of oil. So my stripping process up until now has been:   Soda-water to extract the oil from the wood took out some nasty stains along the way. (this was repeated twice) Oxalic acid (on the whole table) to remove a few black rings that I guessed were caused by some metalic pots.   Now I have a few stains left that I have no real idea on how to handle them.   Here is the current state of the table top for reference:   And the following two kinds of stains that I would appreciate some advice for:   Some kind of glass shaped stain, maybe wine?      Some kind of oil stain of where I think the protective finish was missing and something leaked through? These are in quite some places in the table and give it a bit of a dirty look.     What I can find online is primarily for fixing these kinds of stains after they have just happened or when there is still some kind of finish on the wood. So what should be a sensible plan of attack here? "
114,What strong options are there to join these pieces?,"I'm planning to build this table base which consists of 4 legs, 2 leg-to-stretcher pieces, and 1 main stretcher. The leg and leg-to-stretcher shapes will be cut on the bandsaw, and will support a solid wood top with similar thickness.  What's a strong way to join all these pieces (or should I rethink the design)?  My first idea was simply dowels, but I find dowels hard to align properly and don't see them adding much strength. I don't have a domino joiner. The surface area is too small for a biscuit. Is something like a tongue and groove joint the right idea, and if so on what plane?  For scale the height is 15"", the wood thickness is 1"", and the cross sections to join are 1""x1"" and 1""x2"". The grain will be running approximately vertical for the legs, and horizontal for the rest.    Edit: To complicate things (and justify the cut-off points) I've added fillets to the design:   "
115,Turned-leg bench: splayed or straight?,"I want to build a bench with legs that go through the top that is similar to this:  I have two main questions.   I am thinking of doing the legs straight up and down for a more minimal, easier construction. What does it change structurally if I wanted have the legs straight? If i wanted to copy the angled assembly, I planned on drilling through the top with a drill press set at a fixed angle, but I'm not sure how to go about removing the material for the leg at an angle?   "
116,When is using melted wax filler preferred over wood putty?,"Melted solid wax as a filler seems like it can provide a good color match and apparently a sufficiently strong/hard surface for a lot of repairs. Is it a good general substitute for drying/curing wood putties? Putty also seems to have those properties (potentially good color match &amp; solidity).  As an example, here's a Thomas Johnson video where he happens to use both types in the same job but without an explanation (unless I missed it) of why he preferred one filler over the other for the different circumstances.

117,How to fix a crack when bending a veneer,"Iâm trying to Re-veneer a part of my cars console and the piece has a bend of about 80 degrees. Iâve glued the veneer down with contact adhesive, but around the bend it has developed a crack. Is there any way to repair it? is it salvageable or do I need to redo the veneer? How can I repair the crack before I start polishing?   "
118,What wood for inexpensive door casing,"I'm replacing the door casing for our old, small house and plan to do a simple craftsman style using boards, probably 1x3s, possibly 1x4s. I plan to paint them white.    I have a table saw, router, and miter saw.  I did one door in our laundry room, using primed finger-jointed moulding, but was disappointed that I had to sand some of the boards because the primer wasn't smooth.  So, buying primed boards isn't important to me at all.  I'm thinking of just buying boards at Lowes or Home Depot, but I don't want to spend a fortune. So, I'm wondering what wood to use that won't be problematic in the future.  Does it really matter, other than having straight edges and no holes?  Is cheap pine OK, or perhaps whitewood?    I don't really want to use MDF for a few reasons. "
119,Outdoor gate build - should I treat cut surfaces (half-lap joints) before gluing together?,"New to woodworking and doing first project which is a garden gate. I am using pressurized 2x4 timber for the frame. To join the vertical and horizontal timbers together, I am using the half-lap joint (I am limited to a circular saw and combi drill for my tools).  My question is do I need to treat the newly exposed faces of the timber (I have bought some creocote) before gluing the lap joints together? Or can I just use the glue and ignore the creocote?   I am in the UK so rain and damp is a given for a large part of the year. "
120,What is this happned to my furniture,"I have a closed room where I keep some furniture which is made up of engineered wood. By closed, I mean I dont keep windows open. Also in that room, I keep wet cloths to dry on cloths drying stand below fan (which is ON all time). The room is quite small. After some days, I realized something is wrong with my furniture. Some white/yellowish colored deposits were found on its edges as can be seen in below pics. When I cleaned, the edges were looking normal and undamaged. So, it doesnt seem to be termite. What is it, a fungus due to moisture in the room or anything else? Is it something to worry about? Should I do something to avoid it in future? I am thinking to keep my exhaust fan ON all time too. Will it help to get rid of moisture (if it is indeed happening due to moisture)?  PS: I have no experience in woodworking.     "
121,Is Rubio Monocoat appropriate on red oak furniture?,I am making a bunk bed out of 8/4 red oak. It has very open grain/pores in some places and I'm concerned about my finish process.   I'm basing my design on plans from the Wood Whisperer. He finished off his bed with Rubio Monocoat but he used Alder. Will Rubio alone give me a good seal and finish? Or should I pre-treat the wood with anything to close up the pores in the wood?   Rubio's site states that it bonds strictly to wood fibers and not to itself. Seems to reason that it might cause an issue with not sealing up large pores if it can't seal with itself.   But if it only seals to wood fibers then can I even use a pre-finish?  I'll likely end up sealing a piece of scrap with it to get started but the stuff is expensive and I don't want to waste any if possible.       
122,Are there industrial standards for wood screws?,"Piggy backing on this question about wood screws, are there any industrial standards to define quality in wood screws? When I purchase machine screws I usually look for which standards are adhered to. For example McMaster lists these standards for their socket head machine screws:     Screws that meet ASTM A574, ASTM A574M, and ISO 898-1 comply with   specifications and testing requirements for material quality. Screws   that meet ASME B18.3, ASME B18.3M, ISO 21269, and ISO 4762 (formerly   DIN 912) comply with specifications for dimensional standards.   This is usually how I know I'm getting an inferior product when I have to buy machine screws from the big-box home store. Are there any corresponding standards for wood screws? Is there any way to tell a quality wood screw from a junk one from the big boxes? "
123,How to add a consistent chamfer across a non-linear edge using hand tools,"I am beginning to really like using hand tools as opposed to power tools and I can see a lot of use cases for them.  However I don't understand how can you apply a consistent chamfer on a non-linear edge (i.e. curved, round etc.). A chamfer plane, for example, can be used to apply a consistent chamfer but that works only on a straight (linear) edge.  I recently made a small egg-holder for my fridge ( [website]"
124,Worried about pre-stain conditioner results,"I sanded a door to the bare wood. And before I went to stain it I pre-conditioned it, but the results were not what I expected.  The color after the conditioning is darker than I expected. I used Varathane wood conditioner.   Questions:   Should I stain it or just polyurethane it?  If I stain it what color should I use?  I was going for Natural but now it has what looks like reddish undertones and not sure if Natural will work. If I polyurethane, which kind should I use and do I have to recondition it? "
125,Outgassing of oil-modified polyurethane,"We recently (a month ago) had our oak floors refinished with Precision Oil Modified Polyurethane. The odor has diminished substantially, and I hardly notice it at all any more, except sometimes when I first enter the house.   But my partner is worried about the toxicity and has the windows open and many fans on during much of the day. Until the other day, we thought that the finish was purely oil-based, but from other articles on this site, it appears that it mainly water-based -- which we thought we had been avoiding due to concerns about appearance and durability.    Is she right to be so worried about the toxicity? How long should we be subject to outgassing, and are fans the best way to speed up the process?  (In a few weeks, it might not be so comfortable to keep the windows open.) "
126,Can I use #0000 steel wool for final polish of water-based polyurethane?,"I'm finishing my first woodworking project â a tabletop that I hope to mount on a sit/stand desk mechanism.   I've stained and applied 4 coats of Varthane water-based polyurethane in matte finish. I applied each successive coat after lightly sanding between coats with 400 grit sandpaper and achieved a finish I'm pretty content with. I'm now on the final steps and have a couple questions...  I'd like to apply a final protective barrier and achieve an ultra-smooth feel to the hand. I've read about using #0000 steel wool and polishing with automotive wax or carnauba wax. However, I'm a bit conflicted with some people advising against steel wool on a water-based varnish. I've also read in other forums that steel wool is not a problem on water-based varnishes as long as it is used on the final coat and it has been thoroughly dried. Can I use #0000 steel wool as a final polishing step? If not, what are my alternatives? I've read mixed reviews on synthetic wools, do you recommend them? What course grit?  Any recommendations are welcome. Thank you so much in advance! "
127,"Considerations for cordless circular saw blades - effects of kerf, coating and geometry on performance?","I recently acquired a low-budget ($80) 18V cordless,  hand-held circular saw. The saw came with a low-budget 18-teeth ripping blade. I intend to use it mostly for cross-cutting  wood planks, and cutting thin (at most 18mm (2/3ââ)) plywood and laminated particleboard for making simple furniture: shelves, boxes etc. I might want to use it occasionally on other materials (plastic, aluminum), but wood and engineered wood are the main applications. Iâm aware of the limitations of this tool, and I can live with a bit of sanding, if I have to.  I am looking for an optimal cross-cut/general purpose blade in order to achieve the smoothest possible cuts given the limits of this machine. The tool is very small, the maximum blade diameter is 150mm (6ââ). Few manufacturers produce this blade size, so given my location and budget, my options seem to be limited to the following:  (kerf/blade thickness, no. of teeth, geometry+hook angle, ânon-stickâ coating, price (all dim. in mm))  More expensive: no1 (3.2/2.2, 48 teeth, ATB +15, coated, $45);   no2 (3.2/2.2, 36 teeth, ATB +15, coated, $42);  no3 (2.6/1.6, 36 teeth, ATB +10, coated, $43.5) thin kerf  Cheaper: no4 (2.4/1.4, 36 teeth, ATB +15, not coated, $21)  - thinner kerf, not coated;   no5, multi material (2.0/1.4, 42T, HLTCG -5, not coated, $27) â thin kerf, different geometry  My questions are the following:   As far as I understand, increasing number of teeth, smaller (or negative) hook angle and larger kerf all increase the load on the sawâs motor. Should I be wary of an overload if I choose the âsmoothestâ blade (i.e. full kerf, 48 teeth)? Which of the factors listed above is the most important with respect to motor load/potential burning of the workpiece (kerf, geometry, hook angle, or no. of teeth)? Does blade coating have a significant effect on performance (by reducing friction, which could be important given the low power of the tool)? Is this effect (and better materials) worth double the price? Does anyone have any experience with ATB (Alternate Top Bevel) vs HLTCG (High-Low Triple Chip Grind) geometry? Would the negative-angle HLTCG blade result in better cuts on laminated particleboard, plywood, etc.? Is HLTCG significantly worse for other wood applications (i.e. is it specialized to composites and plastics)? Would it significantly increase loads on the motor, or does the thinner kerf of the Multi Material blade compensate for the negative hook angle?   Thanks for your input, your help is most appreciated. "
128,Appropriate Lacquer to resist salt water,"I've made an aquarium stand out of solid Ash and now want to clear lacquer the wood to finish it off.

I intend to also spray the finish on and am looking to achieve a nice finish, what's the best process to accomplish this? Thanks "
129,How to stabilize a table with hairpin legs?,"I screwed these hairpin legs  [website]to a simple wood board to make a dining table, but the table is too unstable.

In summary, how to make a stable table with hairpin legs? "
130,Knots bleeding thru on the deck,"The knots on my treated lumber deck have been bleeding thru the solid color latex stain.  After scraping off the mounds of sap, I coated the knots with two coats of amber shellac. My question is: Can I just apply the solid color stain latex stain over the top of the shellacked areas??  If not, what is the proper surface preparation? Thanks ET "
131,Panel Flatness During Table Top Glue Up,"I recently attempted a panel glue up consisting of 7 2""x6""x6' planks of reclaimed yellow pine. The boards were planed flat on one side and edge jointed. All went well it seemed during the glue up (i.e., it was flat and tight along the seems). I glued it up in sections a couple of boards at a time over a couple of days. All went pretty well, then when I came back after the last section (3 boards), there was a pretty good bow running down the middle of the top - a hill on top, a valley on the underside running right down the middle. It was flat when I set up the last glue and clamps. Could the bow be because of over tightening the pipe clamps?  Glue up strategy was pipe clamps alternating on top and bottom every foot. I also used biscuits.   What else could have contributed to the bow? "
132,Why are bed slats not attached?,"Planning a wooden bed frame. I am considering why bed slats I've seen seem to always just rest loosely on top of the frame rather than join to both sides. I know wood expands and contracts with heat/humidity but since the ends of the bed are also expanding and contracting in the same direction, why would these need to be separate? Perhaps it's for easy replacement as they more likely break. Maybe it's due to the weight of the mattress and occupants? If I made then of similar strength to the header and footer rails, I would think these problems would go away. "
133,Why does an impact driver have some 'wobble'?,"I noticed how any impact I use has a little 'wobble' in the bit. Really noticeable in a long Philips or a spade bit. I own a Ryobi, but I have used Rigid, Bosch, and Dewalt. Every one with the same thing. Is this meant to be? Will it cause problems when driving screws into my projects? "
134,Smooth tree trunk cross section,"I have a big slab which is a cross section of a large tree trunk. The slab is about 10 inches thick and 3 feet in diameter, so it is large, heavy piece of wood. I cannot lift it. I moved to its current location by walking it. It took two men to load it into the car.  I want to smooth the top perfectly flat. The problem is that it is very rough cut and there are gashes by the chain saw. Trying to use a rasp to even it out would take forever.  Therefore I am thinking maybe to use a router. The problem is that I would need some kind of rail system to keep the router moving in a level plane over the surface. Also, what kind of bit would be used for doing something like this? Is there a better approach than using a router? If a router should be used, how can I move it X-Y and keep Z constant over a large surface? "
135,Gluing up using bench vise,I was trying to find some information online about using a vise along with dog holes instead of clamps for glue up.  I can't find a single reference to it.  Is this commonly done?  Can the vise pressure be supplemented with clamps?  Is there any reference showing glue up using face or end vises? 
136,which direction does wood expand?,"I know that wood expands due to seasonal changes in humidity and temperature, but that's the extent of my knowledge about it.   In which direction do wood boards expand? In the same direction as the grain? Perpendicular to the grain direction? Both? Does it matter if it's a quarter sawn board or not?  Thanks! "
137,Making wood filler from sawdust,"The piece I am currently working on does not need to be perfect in any way, I am actually going for a slightly rough look (due to many mistakes along the way) but I would like to hide some of the larger imperfections. I got lazy with some of my cuts and I now have a few odd gaps. I remember hearing a while ago that sawdust and wood glue can be used as a wood filler to fill in gaps and imperfections. I would buy proper wood filler but I would rather not spend the money and I am also curious if this technique is realistic.  Is this a method that can work and if so, how?  Also how might this effect finish the piece, if I was to stain the wood would the filler stand out and be very obvious? "
138,Cloth covered flexible ring or a bag clamp in a dust collector?,"I recently acquired a dust collector, and it came with two ways of mounting the chip collection bag, but didn't explain why I would want to use one over the other in the assembly instructions.  The two mounting options I have are a cloth covered flexible ring or a big metal bag clamp that resembles a giant hose clamp.  The flexible ring is supposed to have the top 6"" of bag folded over it, and sits inside an internal groove in the dust collector and is held in by spring force and friction.  The bag clamp goes around the outside of the dust collector, with the bag in between the outer diameter and the bag clamp.  Are there benefits and downsides to each method? I'm wondering if it's a convenience (clamp) vs performance (flexible ring) tradeoff. Does one provide a better seal?  Make/Model is Delta 50-767.  Manual (PDF) Page 13, Figures 14 and 15. "
139,Is this a self-drilling wood screw?,"I needed to attach two 2x4 as T-joint and was looking to buy self-drilling wood screws to do that. In HomeDepot, I found a box of screws labeled as 'self-cutting' and bought it. But, when I opened the box and looked at the tip of the screws, I found that they had gaps on the threads (like this one)     rather than having a drill bit. The threads are tapered on the tip but remained all the way upto the tip.   Can they self-drill? Or, do I need pre-drilling? In HomeDepot, I found that there were many self-drilling screws for metal sheet (for example, metal-to-metal or wood-to-metal) but coundn't find any for wood-to-wood attachment. Can I use those metal sheet self-drilling screws for wood-to-wood connection? "
140,Chlorine bleach on poplar,"While experimenting with stains and struggling with a moderately green piece of poplar, I found that I really like the results of:   Brush concentrated Clorox bleach, leave for 5 minutes then wipe. Let dry completely. Sand lightly with 220 then wipe lightly with mineral spirits to clean, let dry completely. Generous coat of minwax pre stain conditioner. Leave for 30 minutes without wiping excess (it all soaks in). Generous coat of Varathane golden pecan stain. Leave for 5 minutes then lightly wipe excess.   The conditioner makes minimal difference but the bleach really cleans up the greenish undertones and the color was great. It was almost the same as this stain on pine.  My question is: Clorox seems like a cruel thing to put on wood. It definitely changes the texture of poplar slightly. It feels ""dryer"" or something. Is doing this a mistake? What is the long term downside to bleaching poplar with chlorine bleach before staining it? (I brushed it on the surface, as opposed to outright soaking it, if that's significant. It seemed to have penetrated only about 1-2 mm.)  I have some oxalic acid coming too that I'm going to play with. Still it seems like it isn't the right thing to do. "
141,What should one consider when purchasing an intro turning chisel set?,"I'm a total beginner when it comes to turning, but am interested in doing more of it both to help augment my woodworking (e.g. everything from custom button plugs to chair legs etc) as well as to do some traditional turning projects (e.g. pepper mill and maybe some small bowls).  I am struggling to understand what the differences are between the variety of chisel sets that are out there.  I understand more or less the different tools that I want, but I do not understand what characteristics of those tools I should care about and how/why price of the tools are driven.  Several folks out there seem to suggest that something like this  [website]They both seem to be made of high speed steel (which I'm told is important and what I want).  They both appear to be similar length tools.  Is one more durable?  Is handle shape/material of any importance?  What are the other factors that I should care about when evaluating a turning chisel?  "
142,"Corner butt joint, longer top or longer sides?","When making butt joints for corners, say, for small little cabinets to hang on a wall (think medicine cabinet), structurally is there any difference between longer tops and longer sides (I'm using biscuits and glue, and I find I like using cleats attached to the inside top for hanging)?    I personally prefer the look of longer tops and bottoms especially if I intend to use the top surface as a shelf, but having longer sides is much easier for me to construct since all the horizontals are the same length, and gives a slightly easier order of assembly.  A lesser question: In addition to structural properties, is there any traditional/historical stylistic tendency for longer tops vs. sides?  I realize the butt joint is a boring joint but in my limited experience I find that I keep agonizing over which to choose.  "
143,Front and Leg vise,"It will probably have to wait until next summer but I am going to build my first woodworking bench soon.  I want to have at least one vise on it. I was thinking the front or leg vise. They both clamp in the same location.   Leg vise can be built from solely wood components and has a deep throat. It also is the largest of all bench vises from what I can tell. A ""con"" could be that a traditional leg vise relies on a parallel bar at the foot. Modern ones have different designs.    Front vise has a smaller throat and typically has metal for the track. The overall design itself is smaller as well.   I am hoping to use this to help with sawing dovetails. I understand that it is not the only way but I feel more comfortable with the boards in a vertical position. I would like this fact not to distract from the actual question of vise choice. Merely an attempt at providing context to the question.      I'm sure that I know the basic differences between the two but I want to be sure I am not overlooking any feature or potential draw back. I think both would work for what I am trying to do. What are the functional differences between a leg and front vise? What criteria might make me choose one over the other?  "
144,Space between assembly,"I'm designing wooden speakers with MDF using Sketchup.  How much space is taken up by the glue between two pieces? 1mm per side? Less?  I'm using biscuit joining and white wood glue.  Explanation with screenshot :  I have a back panel of 351x276 vertically, external size is 320 - 22 - 22 = 276mm, which is the ideal space to fit vertically the back panel.  But, after assembly, it takes more space  How much space would you plan to account for the glue?   "
145,Considerations when making my own threaded dowel for a vise,"After looking at the answers for this question I was inspired to make a Moxon vise for easy table top use. This will buy me time until I make my actual woodworking bench. The one I have in mind is similar to this one:    Image from Inthewoodshop.com  Some of the simpler designs involve a threaded wooden dowel, which is something I want to try out. The tool to use would be one just like this (but not necessarily this one):    Image from highlandwoodworking.com  If I am going to make threaded dowel for a vise what do I need to consider? I can think of two things:    Wood Something like a maple; at least a hardwood minimum Diameter Surely it needs to be of a fair size. Would 1 inch be sufficient? If it is too large, would there be a concern?  "
146,"Table saw technique, cross-cut dados on multiple boards","I bought a table saw recently and it's the most terrifying tool I own.  I want to cut a 5/8"" dado across four 5"" wide boards in identical positions, about 14"" from the reference edge. I have a 1/2"" stack so I'll have to make two passes. What is the safest technique for this?  It doesn't feel good to use the fence, one at a time, because it's difficult to keep the board flush to it given only 5"" contacts the fence with 14"" distance to the blade.  I could use the mitre slide but I'm not sure how to get consistent position for multiple cuts. Is there some magic jig I can cut or a good marking / measuring technique for the mitre slide? (I am thinking, maybe I can make an ""L"", laying on its side, with the long edge mounted to the slide and the short edge 14"" from the blade, but I foresee problems keeping the angles true and the short edge sturdy; I could make it out of scrap steel maybe but now it seems like a whole project of its own.)  Can I somehow load all the boards at once? I was thinking maybe I could temporarily mount them all to a piece of plywood or something then run the whole thing along the fence, maybe once to make all the edges flush then flip it around to cut the dados. But I don't want to put screw or brad holes in the boards and I'm not sure how to mount them otherwise.  How can I safely and accurately make these cuts? "
147,Why is this yellow colour coming through the finish,I made a coffee table out of pallet wood. If I had to guess there is at least 3 different kinds of wood here and I don't know for sure which they are.   The white you see is home made chalk paint made from drywall mud and white acrylic paint. It had about 2 coats of paint. To protect and finish I choose polycrylic.  Somehow one of the blocks stained the paint yellow. I saw one other block like this but it was not as defined. It reminds me of painting the walls of a former smokers house where the tar seeps through the paint.     I am still new at finishing and I should have realized that I was applying too much polycrylic as you can see the dripping. While that was bad it did show me something. If you see on the right hand side of the block the yellow colour does not go all the way up the block. There is a drip there that goes from white to yellow. That tells me the finish was not the source of the issue? Perhaps just exacerbated it? Most of the wood pictured has a coat of polycrylic on it and that is not a test coat.   I started looking more for the colour and I found one more block that would have been from the same pallet that had a little yellowing.   Everyone of those blocks you see had pith so it should be a fair amount of heartwood. Also the spots where you see a little bare wood was done on purpose prior to polycrylicing (If that is a verb).   Why did the finish turn yellow in those few places? I think it has something to do with the wood itself.    As an aside I just sanded down the finish and most of the paint in that area. The table was meant to look distressed anyway. Still curious what happened so I can try to prevent it or at least be aware of it.  
148,I was thinking of buying a router. I tried a router bit in my power drill. It didn't work,"I used the router bit in the following setup and moved the work piece.  Note this picture is faked but it gives a good idea.    The problem is that the resistance was enormous and if I forced it, it just chewed the wood up. It kind of destroyed my idea of how a router should be and I don't have an opportunity to try a real router before buying.  Question  I'd still like to buy a router but I'm no longer confident that it would cut a lengthwise slot in a piece of timber such as shown in the picture.  How come the router bit didn't work in the power drill?  What is so special about a router that would make it work better?  Should it do the job smoothly, cleanly and quickly with little pressure?  Is there a lot of difference in the effectiveness of a router by price? Why? "
149,Lacquer dries very slowly,"I have made a small jewelry box from steamed black walnut for my significant other. My original idea was to sand it down to 400 grit and finish with just oil (which I did, with two coats of IKEA ""Skydd"" mineral oil), but I liked the high gloss so much I decided to give a try to lacquer... and things went downhill from there.  The first thin coat of lacquer was absorved almost entirely by the end grain. Also, the lacquer was taking days get dry enough to touch (an alkyd resin-based lacquer premixed with naphtha as solvent, supposed to dry fully in 24 hours). At this point, I sort of panicked and applied 4 more generous coats using a brush in quick succession, barely waiting 48 hours between coats.  Now it's been a full week since the last coat was applied and the lacquer is still rubbery to touch, nowhere near hard enough for sanding. I only have a week or so left before the event the box was made for and given the progress so far, I doubt it will fully dry (but then it's my first time with lacquer, so I don't know).  Any ideas how can I save this project? I'm OK with removing the lacquer with paint thinner, but I'm not sure if that will damage the wood. Also, where did I go wrong with the finishing? "
150,Is there a reason not to glue a wooden bolt into its threads?,"I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of my new tapping set from Beall and one of the uses I was thinking about was creating a mallet--turn a head and then tap a hole and screw in a wooden handle (I have a couple other similar projects on the docket as well).  Now other than not being able to easily remove the handle (should I break it or want a different one), is there any other reason not to do it?  Even on the flip side, are there very good reasons to do it? (I'm thinking it won't come loose when in use!) "
151,"At what stage of basic furniture making should I ""finish"" the wood?","I have purchased wood in order to make some basic furniture:   One of these will be placed outside (simple table), One inside the bathroom, (basic chest of drawers) And another in the hall way (shoe rack).    I've already done some work, ie, cutting the wood to size, preparing parts for joining the pieces etc.  Currently I'm in the process of trying to find what materials I will need to finish the wood (and learn how to) for each of these items I'm building.  My question is:   When do I need to ""treat"" / finish the wood, ie, sand and apply these coatings? Is it before I join the pieces, or after once everything is assembled?  "
152,Table saw top treatment,"For years I've used Bostik TopCote (apparently now called GlideCote) to protect the cast iron top of my table saw. It has always worked very well: I have no rust on the top, and it provides a nice slick surface. But now my can is empty! Before I spend $20 on a new can, I'm thinking about other options.  Looking around my shop, I've got at least two cans of clear Briwax with little hope of ever using them up in my lifetime. I've heard of people using beeswax on cast iron, so that might be an option. Do I need to be concerned about wax applied to the table surface rubbing off on workpieces, possibly causing finishing problems? Does a wax coating last, and does it provide adequate protection against corrosion?  Are there any other protective coatings for iron that I should consider? "
153,How do I clean resin residue from router bits,"Routing chipboard and pine and other conifer woods a router bit of mine built up residue. I managed to clean some of it with acetone and mineral spirits but still there was left.      The bit looks and feels sharp, the edge is clean but around the edge there still is some residue.  Should I be concerned? How can I clean the rest of the residue? "
154,How to know when to apply more tung oil?,"I built a walnut shelf and finished it with 100%, grade A, straight from the nut, tung oil. I used just a single coat and was happy with the way it finished so ended things there.   That being said, I continued to take a clean rag to the shelf to wipe down the shelf and continued to be able to get a little oil on the rag up to ~4 or 5 days after oiling the board.   For a next project, I'm going to use the last bit of scrap walnut to make coasters.   Because of the expected abuse they'll take being coasters, I'm thinking it would be a good idea to apply multiple coats of tung oil.   The question is, when to apply subsequent coats? Am I right in assuming I should continue to wipe down the wood and then apply a subsequent coat only after the previous no longer leaves the rag brown?  "
155,Wood to be used for Christmas Colored Flame Yule Logs?,"What type of wood and its' thickness would be get the best results for making Christmas colored flame yule logs?  I would like to try and make colored flamed yule logs this year. What type of wood would get the maximum amount of absorption of the (chemical) mixture of colored solution into the wood? What would be the thickest circumference that would enable the colored flames last the longest?  Most internet sources suggest tightly bound newspaper, wood chips or pine cones. I would like to do the same using wood in the form of small logs, in order to make it resemble a real Christmas yule log for the fireplace. They may take up to a month to dry, prior to using.

156,"Can I use linseed oil and water-based polyurethane on opposing sides of a 1/2"" board?","I know that linseed oil and water-based polyurethane won't work together.  But I have 1/2"" poplar paneling that I am installing in my van and am hoping to get the best of both synthetic and natural properties.  I like that the linseed oil soaks into the wood and would help prevent splitting on hot days however it turns the wood more yellow than we'd like.  On the other hand, I heard that water-based polyurethane would keep the wood with the most natural look keeping it mostly white bright, although it might not prevent the wood from splitting as well as linseed oil.    I already applied a coat of linseed to one side of a few of the boards and looking at the ends, it looks like it penetrated halfway through the next morning.   i was thinking what if I applied linseed oil to the back of each board (they are 1' x 4 ft vertical panels) and applied water-based polyurethane to the front facing inside of the van - could I get the best of both worlds????   Let me know what you think!   Thanks! "
157,Need to cut a 1' hole through bookshelf-right tool?,"I'm converting an old entertainment unit into a huge cage for my ferrets and I'm trying to figure out how to cut a one foot hole through each end to thread and secure tubes leading up the the top where I'll build a run for them.   What tool do i need to cut through about a quarter inch of plywood? Pressed board? (Latter i think)   Also bonus question but unimportant (I'll Finegal my way through it otherwise) I'm using 1' high dryer tube for the tunnels from top to bottom-how would you secure it to the openings of the hole I'll eventually cut, up to a wire cage run on top? Like a sideways U leading from the top cage run to the bottom wood sleeping area.  "
158,"Finish options for oak chairs, outdoors + high UV","I have built four oak wine barrel chairs that will be outdoors in a dry, high-UV climate. I see other chairs in our climate that the poly finish cracks and doesn't last long.

Any suggestions on best finish for my situation? "
159,Does a bandsaw up 18 inches tall or smaller exist?,"I have a really, really small work space and I would like a bandsaw and I'm looking for something as small as possible. Even the Proxxon MBS 240 is a bit too large for my space.  Do I even have a chance of finding a bandsaw that would not be taller than 18 inches (450 mm)? Or maybe it isn't even produced by anyone? "
160,Hanging a picture frame ledge with a keyhole routed slot,I'm designing a picture frame ledge and trying to keep the design as minimalistic as possible. The concept is similar to the following Ikea ledge: Mosslanda.  I came up with the idea of using a keyhole router bit to create a rail to allow for easy hanging. This would require to drill some holes and use the screws to mount the ledge directly.     I'll be using a glued laminated birch board (18mm thick).  Is the structurally sound?  How can I calculate the maximal load of such a thing? 
161,"Finishing a beech desk top (Ikea Gerton), suitability of tung oil","I recently made a desk using a Gerton beech wood top from Ikea. Ikea recommends using their Behandla finishing oil in the instructions included with the top. I am a bit skeptical of this finish, however, (seems like BLO) and would like to use an alternative.  I will be using this as a computer desk and my top priorities for a finish are that it be at least somewhat water resistant (don't need to worry about using coasters) and food safe.    After doing a bit of research, it seems like pure/raw tung oil might do the trick.  My main questions are    Is this a good choice given my needs or should I consider an alternative? (I would like to keep the finish 'natural' looking/feeling)   As a side question, is BLO food safe? I have heard Ikea claims their Behandla finish is food safe, but the listed 'metal drying agents' make me skeptical...  If I go the pure tung oil route, do I need to cut it with something like mineral oil when applying (as some sites recommend) or is it fine to just put it on straight out of the can? Is pure tung oil the best choice, or can I go with something like polymerized tung and still be food safe?  "
162,White deposit in tung oil,What could this white deposit be in this little bottle of Tung oil? Does this affect the oil? Should I take any measure?   
163,Why don't we use cross cut discs for all cuts?,"Most circular saws, at least low and mid ends, come with low/medium quality rip cut discs. They work decent when doing rip cuts but show their limits when doing cross cuts. A lot of tear out on some of them.  There are available high quality cross cut blades.   What if one would use these for rip cuts too? Would this be a bad thing? (inefficient, dangerous etc) "
164,Cutting sawdust relief in sled,"I have a sled that I want to add a sawdust relief slot to:    Thatâs an unsurprising side view. Itâs about 24â wide. I want to cut a slot at the red thing. The shape doesnât really matter as long as one side of is flush with (or beyond) the fence. The size doesnât really matter either. However, I do not want to cut into the bottom of the fence itself, as I use this sled for very thin materials sometimes.  I feel like this is obvious but for some reason I canât think of an answer: Whatâs an easy way to cut this?   I donât really have any way to get in there with the router. The fence is too high for me to prop it up and cut a dado on the table saw and also thatâs super sketchy. I donât really have any hand saws that can get in there given the 24â width. The fence is taller than the flat part on my chisels. I canât remove the fence because itâs glued on to the base.   All I can think of is carefully, slowly, and painfully coming at it with a thick-ish cutting disk on a Dremel. Is there a better way to do this?  The fence is plywood, the base is mdf.  Like I said, this might be obvious, but Iâve been huffing xylene all day so I really have no idea. "
165,How to cut a double rabbet joint (that looks like two stair steps) for tablet holder?,"I am making a tablet holder. The tablet rests against a piece of plywood, and is surrounded on three sides by hardwood rails. The hard wood rails need to have a two step rabbet, one step for the plywood base, and another step for the tablet itself. .  In the first iteration of this build, I used a tablesaw to cut the rabbets. My tablesaw has a 3/8"" gap around the blade (i.e. no zero clearance insert). Making two rabbets requires four cuts, and making the last cut was particularly difficult because there was not a lot of wood left to ride against the table top and fence.  I am redoing this project for another tablet. How should I go about cutting this stair step pattern? I have a router and a few rabbet bits (some with bearings). Is there a safer and easier way to make this with another tool? "
166,How to treat floor-facing edge of OSB for a stool leg?,"I'm making a bar stool from OSB. I do know it's a very questionable material choice, but it fits my aesthetics, and I'm willing to try my chances.  I'm going to varnish and sand all people-facing edges , as suggested on DIY SE. I'm still concerned with the edge facing the floor:      How do I prevent chips from coming off the outer layers when the stool is shifted around?  What would be better(less labor and material cost, longer lasting) given the choices below?   Round the edge, so that no outer chips would be subject to lateral forces from friction with the floor. If I go this route can I avoid renting a router and do it with a sander? What's the radius I should be aiming at? Put on PVC edge banding. Just have few extra layers of varnish.  "
167,Are there such things as oversized screw threads?,"I've been dealing with a problem where standard screws keep getting pulled out of a wood frame. I know there are options, but it got me thinking:  Are there such things as screws that have ""oversized"" threadform? (if so, what are they called?)   From my research, I could get a little extra 'bite' by using sharp V threads. Most threads seem to be between .60-.75 pitch, but is there something on the scale of 1.5 pitch?   Is threading that large not practical because it would require so much force to drive?   Or would the material of the thread not be strong enough to add any practical gripping power? "
168,90 degree soft close lid support for 80lb lid?,"I bought a very large chest made of teak and mounted a 50"" LED TV to the inside of the lid so we could hide the it when it wasn't in use.  The lid (with the tv mounted) is about 80 lbs and 24"" from hinge to lip.  I want something that keeps the lid open at 90 degrees and keeps the lid from slamming when it closes.  The best thing I've found are a pair of these Stabilus gas springs but they can only handle 56lbs.  Is there a better product for this application?     "
169,Why does my workpiece become rough again after applying polyurethane varnish when it wasn't before?,"I am in the process of applying polyurethane varnish to a finished workpiece and have been sanding between coats as advised by the manufacturer instructions. I initially wondered why this was necessary until, after applying the first coat, I noticed that the wood was bumpy where it hadn't been previously.  Why does this happen, (am i doing something wrong?) and surely sanding between coats ruins the finish of the varnish?  Edit: I used this varnish: [website]"
170,Mortise and Tenon for shed wall framing,"I'm wanting to know if using M&amp;T joint on wall framing (for an outside shed) is a bad idea and or dangerous. I have a deck that I'm in the middle of tearing down, and I'm wanting to recycle the majority of the wood. Lastly my finances are rather tight so the less I have to buy the better.   The hopeful plan  I'd like to take the 2x12's that were the joists and rip them into 3 even pieces (roughly 3 9/16"") each. This would essentially give me a bunch of 2x4's. I'd then like to cut A 1 inch tenon into the vertical studs with a matching 1"" mortise on the top and bottom. Mentally, I think this will work as I've been told it was the old way of building walls. Below is a crude drawing I did in SketchUp. While drawing I realized the two outside studs can't go on the edge, so is there a way of still keeping the outside stud (maybe oriented differently) and if so how?   A little backstory  I've been following Paul Sellers for a little bit now absorbing his knowledge of how to use simple hand tools. But one thing that he either directly said or alluded to was to pay attention to the wood and work with it. I saw a documentary on Japanese woodworking and that got me thinking about how can I build things differently and ""work with the wood"" instead of against it. So that is why I am willing to spend the extra time to cut this all out for the framing. Now this isn't to say that I'm not going to use screws at all as I plan on using them to put the siding on, and I think I am going to need it for the roof (unless there is a technique for that too!) Anywho. Thoughts? "
171,How do I remove a stuck router bit from a plunge router?,"I am borrowing a friend's ""Skil 1823 Type 1 Plunge Router"", and I am having some trouble removing the router bit that was already in it. Everything online has said that removing the collet nut should loosen (if not entirely remove) the bit while being unscrewed.  I've tried using a gloved hand, pliers, etc, but I can't seem to even get the old bit to budge.    Am I missing something obvious?  How do I remove this old bit? How do I prevent the same thing from happening with my new bit?**    "
172,"Use 3/4"" wood for Adirondack chair?","For the last few years, we had some of those plastic $20 Adirondack chairs in the garden. Well, the sun got to them, and the plastic became brittle.. (my story, and I'm sticking to it!)  Now I want to build some replacements, and I need to sound out an idea; for the parts of the chairs that are duplicated, like the side rails and arms, I plan to use some seasoned redwood 2x4's I have, by profiling the 2x4 (as usual, more 1/5"" x 3.5"") in one piece, and then ripping down the middle to make two identical pieces.  Will this work? Will 3/4"" be thick enough for the side rails and arms of the chair anyway? "
173,Should I treat end-grain on garden table with wood glue?,"The Preface:  I'm building a table for the garden and did some research into how I might seal and protect the most vulnerable parts of the table. The end-grain. The wood I have available is old(30+ years) and very dry larch-wood.  Beside the steps one could take, that are already covered in various questions across this and other sites I stumbled upon a method that is called ""sizing"". I hope I spelled that right. The sealing of end-grain is covered in 'Do I need to seal the ends of hardwood fence boards?' and this here might be a duplicate to that question.  The Story:  While watching Steve Ramsey's channel I stumbled over his video about 'What You Need to Know About Glue'. He also covers gluing end-grain (starting at ~5:20) and suggests making a ""sizing""(at ~6:00), which is basically wood-glue mixed with some water to ""size"" the wood before the actual glue-up. To me it seems this sizing is just sealing up the end-grain pores with wood-glue. And the mixing with water is done so the thinner substance might penetrate deeper into the wood.  My thought now is that I will try to use this technique for the end-grain parts of my table (probably all of them) to close the pores and make it more durable.   To achieve that I would put masking tape around the edges of the wood and soak the end-grain with my ""sizing"". The masking tape would protect the surface of the wood from ugly glue-stains during the sizing. After all is dried up I would take off about half a millimeter (~1/64"") with the table-saw/miter-saw for a smooth end and start to apply the actual finish everywhere.  The Question(s):  In theory I think this method to be quite ingenious and am wondering why I haven't heard of it before. Or am I missing some fundamental problem with this here?   How far will this sizing penetrate into the end-grain? (Of course that answer will probably be dependent on the density and type of the wood) Will this help preventing/delaying rot? Will the masking tape prevent the other faces to get ugly glue stains? Is there any drawback with this method concerning the expansion and shrinkage of the wood? Which will probably be severe as  I plan to let the table sit outside all the time.  "
174,Can a large bandsaw side table be useful for rip cuts?,"I want to make furniture. Therefore, whether I'm cutting a roughly cut piece of plywood or cutting a ""solid wood"" piece made from a gluing up smaller boards, I will certainly need to make wood panels with final dimensions around:   Width: 12-24 inch Length: 12-36 inch   I have seen two popular approaches for cutting wood panels:    Table saw Hand-held saws (track saw, circular saw, jigsaw, hand saw)   These approaches have their strengths and weaknesses in regards to accuracy, repeatability, safety, and physical effort. The details are for another discussion.  However, it seems that the bandsaw has limited usefulness here due to its somewhat small cutting capacity (9-14 inch for models below [tex]4000 for a bandsaw with a 24"" cutting capacity, although I suppose a large table saw would have a similar price. Still, I wonder why bandsaws with a cutting capacity of 24"" and larger are not more common?   There seems to be a correlation between the cutting capacity of a bandsaw and the size of the wheels since the compact design puts the bandsaw's table spanning horizontally across the space between the upward and downward moving blades, see Figure 1 below. My question has to do with the proposed bandsaw design, shown on the right in figure 1, in which the table has been extended to the side and the fence is on the far side as well. Is there anything inadvisable about doing rip cuts on this proposed bandsaw design?   Figure 1: (Left) traditional bandsaw design, (Right) proposed bandsaw design  I have seen some YouTube videos showing bandsaw table extensions. In-flow or out-flow extension tables can support long pieces of wood, but they are not what I'm interested in. Most (but not all) of the bandsaw ""side"" table extensions that I have seen are somewhat small see this YouTube link. My question is whether there is anything problematic with ripping a panel on a large bandsaw side table while registering it against a fence that is also mounted on the side table? I'm primarily asking about rip cuts here, but I would also be interested in your thoughts about having mitre slots in this large bandsaw side for cross cutting.  My guess is that there must be something ""wrong"" with this idea or this would be a more common commercial tool. I appreciate your time and your thoughts. "
175,Removing multiple layers of paint on oak decorative door frames,"I'm making headway. I keep re-applying, scraping (plastic and steel wool), and wiping with mineral spirits. I have all low voc, etc., chemicals but how much can the little grooves in this wood really take?  Also, on the one flat side I stripped, it looks dull (I'm not sure if 'cloudy' would apply) even tho' I wiped it down with spirits nice. Is this normal?  The previous 1930's stain is showing thru, lighter in some places.  I'm psyched because it's gorgeous. I would like it darker. Do I have to strip THAT off or can I just go over it with stain.  Thank you.  Pls create better tags for me.  I'm new. "
176,Extending wood studs or adding wood to cover over the studs,"So the problem is this.  I bought a house and it has this super awesome movie room.   When I moved in, I took my stud finder out and it wasn't working on that side of the wall, but it was working on the other side.  I took the recessed power plug off the wall and looked inside to find the studs are actually 1 to 2 inches back.  The drywall is not flush with the studs...  I do not want to hang a 65 to 75 inch TV on drywall.  This seems like a recipe for disaster.    So the question is... How do I do this? Some ideas are...    extend the studs or possibly secure another 2 by 4 to the side of the studs that are already there, then redo that portion of the drywall  Cut out a rectangle of the drywall and attach a 2 by 4 to the front of the studs so it's like a ""T"".  If I can get the right size piece of wood then that could be flush with the wall and can be painted to match the black wall.  something that you guys think of   This needs to be able to support a 75 to 100 pound TV mounted to it.  This makes me nervous and I don't know what the best practices would be.  If I go with #2, should I glue it on, then add some nails or screws to attach it to the drywall better?  I can't clamp the 2 by 4 to the studs so I'm not sure how effective that would be.   "

178,Avoiding saw burn in hardwood crosscuts,"Blade rookie here. I have a 1.5HP table saw with a 10"" blade. The blades I have been using are fairly new higher tooth finishing blades, such as the Diablo 1060X. To avoid the friction burns when ripping and cross cutting 3/4"" birch, I started having to cut only an 1/8th"" deep at a time, raising the blade between passes. I'm looking for advice on which blades to help make my process more efficient, as I have several hundred cuts to make.  A lower tooth ripping blade (Diablo 1024X) sounds like it'll make rips cuts much quicker, and I'm led to believe that the edge will actually be quite smooth. I would love to have as close to finished edges as reasonably possible. This blade sounds like a no-brainer to try.  But I don't see any specialized crosscutting blades. What's my best bet to make these more efficient? With such a hard wood, would I always be expected to need to make multiple passes in a 3/4"" board to avoid burning?  Edit:  I'm cutting 200 6""x3""x3/4"" blocks of birch. Planning to rip ~7"" wide boards to get the 3"" wide dimension, then cross cutting to the 6"" using a sled. (Whenever I use my miter saw, even with a stop block, it ends up grabbing and moving the piece slightly at the start so the cut isn't perfect.)  Solved: I did multiple things at once... Got a new blade, aligned it to within 0.001 (it was 0.025 off), aligned my fence to within 0.001 (it was 0.020 off) and now have no issues cutting full height. "
179,Strategy for coating a built table with polyurethane?,I built a simple table. I stained each piece before final gluing and construction.    I am not sure how to polyurethane the table.  I am concerned about both getting an even coat that doesn't run and how to coat the entire thing at once (do I skip the bottom of the feet?)  Should I do different sections at a time?  All at once?  Brush on the top and spray on the legs?  Brush everywhere?   
180,Forstner Bits without Brad Point?,"I'm trying to drill holes most of the way through a block of wood to mount magnets which will be attracting metal through the solid face of the wood.  Because of how quickly magnetic attraction falls off, I want to leave a minimum of wood (less than 1/8""). I'm using forstner Bits with a drill press today, but my issue is that the Brad Point is long enough that without puncturing the face of the wood the magnets produce insufficient pull.  Since forstner Bits are edge guided, it seems like the brad point is unnecessary except for lining up where the hole goes. Are there versions of a forstner bit that don't have the brad point? If not, would I create a problem for myself if I ground off the tip on my bit?  "
181,Finish Baltic Birch plywood with water-based polyurethane finish,"So, I'm in the process of making a cabinet/working surface to store my tools/work on. My cabinet will look something like the one in the picture below if all goes well :P  Concerning the finish, this is what I have tested so far.    I sanded lightly with 240 grit, my plywood is A/B quality so it was almost smooth to begin with (If that's wrong please tell me)  Then I applied a water-based polyurethane finish, with no color, satin , diluted 10% with water with a synthetic brush. After about two hours I sanded lightly and applied another coat.   So the next day I see that the surface is kinda of smooth but I see some lines and I don't know if it is because of the sanding or the brush.  So questions:   Is it better to apply the finish with a synthetic brush, a lint free rag or a foam brush? Should I sand between applications with a 240 grit? How long should I wait between applications? Some say wait 2 hours and repeat, others say wait the whole 24 hours. How many coats should I apply? 4,5? Also I was thinking of applying at least 1 coat to the whole furniture just to seal everything. The top work surface will be a piece of solid wood, either beech or spruce, depending what if I like the availability/price. Should I apply the finish on that the same way?   Sorry for the long post   "
182,Protect wood furniture legs from damage,"I have wooden furniture (bed and more) with feet which look like this:    There are thin weak parts which get chipped away easily.  I have a vacuum cleaner like this one:    Which is old and with questionable navigation algorithms (it's 6 years old after all) which tends to scratch the furniture when it circles around it.  I'm going to put teflon tape the sides of the vacuum to make it smoother (after 6 years the plastic is scratched and rough), but I doubt it will be enough. See the tape:    How can I protect the wood to last longer and avoid chipping/scratching?  I thought about using office transparent tape, however I know from past experience that the glue will dry up in few years and the residues will be difficult to remove.  Which kind of transparent product can I use, in addition to the teflon tape on the vacuum, to protect the furniture?  The answer (or the comments) of course may comprise tips for restoring the damages that are already there, but the question is about future protection and not about restoration. "
183,Veneering over inlaid metal,"I'm making wall-mounted bottle openers with magnets below the opener to catch the bottle caps as they fall after they're removed.  The magnets are ""rare earth"" magnets with a metallic surface.  The front face will be veneered (as will the back for balance.)  I was planning on drilling a hole in the substrate before veneering and gluing the magnet in before veneering.  I am worried that the veneer will not bond to the magnet if I use a normal veneer glue (i.e. Titebond cold press or similar.)  Should I use a different type of glue for the veneering process?  Can I coat the inset magnet with something that will bond to both the metal surface and the veneer glue?  Should I bond a layer of veneer to the magnets with another type of glue (CA or epoxy) before inlaying them into the substrate?  The panels will be 4"" x 9"" and the magnets are 1 1/4"" in diameter.  I am using commercial veneer, thinner than 1/32"".  The substrate will be 3/4"" MDF. "
184,Help getting Delta fence accurate,"I bought a Delta 36-725 on Craigslist after seeing a lot of really positive reviews on it, especially about its fence. However, I can't get my fence to lock down accurately at all. When the fenced isn't locked down, it has a TON of play in it. Moving it side to side causes it to twist, making it really hard to accurately place it, especially when making small adjustments. When I do lock it down, it will be out of alignment one way or the other depending on which direction it was twisted.  Is that kind of play back and forth normal for this saw? Is something broken or not setup correctly?  Here's a video that might help explain what I'm talking about: [website]"
185,Can I leave indoor wooden furniture unfinished or will it grow mold?,"I purchased some furniture that has wooden elements to it that ended up being unfinished.  Should I be concerned about this?  During the more humid months, will these elements grow mold on them? For reference, I live in Massachusetts.  I would prefer to not have to finish these products, and am just trying to determine from individuals with more experience than myself if this is an issue.   "

187,Planer/jointer/thicknesser worth it?,"I have recently been using a table saw to rip cheap 2 X 4 pine for projects. However, it takes a long time to sand these down to a nice finish, and trying to keep them square is difficult.   I'm considering buying a cheap jointer/thickenesser. What are your experiences with them? Do you think it will greatly reduced the sanding needed and time? "
188,Removing Spilled Paint and Staining Table,"A clumsy contractor put a paint can on a table of mine (no stain, varnish, 100% fresh wood) and a ring of paint got left behind on the table. What is the best way to remove the paint so that I can stain the table and have it look nice? I'm not even sure what kind of wood the table is made from. It's definitely not oak. It's a white-ish wood with very faint grains visible. Maybe maple?  I was thinking of using paint stripper to get the paint off but I'm afraid that when I come back to stain, I'll see splotches. I'm hoping to avoid extreme sanding. "
189,How to cool hole saw,"I am currently trying to work on a project that involves piercing a lot of large-diameter (~38mm) holes in rather thick (~5cm) bamboo board sheets.   For that, I am using a hole saw. However, I ran into the problem of the wood starting to burn and the bit getting stuck (due to the thermal expansion?).   If I was drilling or routing metal, I would be cooling with a mix of oil and water at the ambient temperature.  What can I use to perform similar cooling in the context of working on wood? Would water be sufficient? Should I just make frequent pauses and let the drill bit cool in the air? "
190,How to Keep Frat Bench from Ricketing Side to Side.(Photos),"This is my first question in this community, so excuse me for any faux pas I make.   The slanted 72 inch boards are not screwed into anything, but I would like to add them to keep the bench strong side to side.  I don't want to screw into the back bottom joint as it already has 4 screws in it and anymore I feel would cause cracking.   Should I move the 72 in a bit and just get extra long screws to screw threw it slanted and then into the bottom board?   How might I do this without screwing into the same areas too much?   Thank you a ton     "

192,"unknown damage to Tru-Oil finish, please advise","First, I'll show you a pic of the damage, then I'll give you a short background to how this happened, then last I'll ask for advice.  The damage:    As you can see there are tiny specs in the Tru-Oil finish (one single application) on my black walnut board.   Background info:  Here's what happened.   I'm making a shelf with these black walnut boards and I did a very good job with the sanding, started with 60 grit (very rough sawn from my friend's saw mill) then 80, 120, and finally 220.   Then, I had to abandon the project for about a week and they sat in my garage (where I also worked on getting a riding lawnmower started). Then sanded them with 320 grit before wiping on a single layer of Tru-Oil. They looked really really great the next day.   My next step was to apply spar-urethane over them to protect from UV and water, but unfortunitally I became pre-occupied with something else and they sat on the garage for some more time, during which it rained extremely hard and some leaks in my roof formed and dripped water onto the floor next to where the boards where laying. Then yesterday I discovered the damage.  So.. it was either caused by water splashing onto the boards and ruining the Tru-Oil (they say it's water resistant but not water proof). Or something like WD40 got onto the boards in-between finish sanding and applying the Tru-Oil and that caused it to react this way. Or... ?  The question:  Do you think this is water damage? The effect of WD40 or similar on the wood before the finish was applied? Something else? I think it's water damage but I just want to cover all bases, and I'm surprised that Tru-Oil would do this.   And what should I do? Sand it smooth and start over, or apply a new coat of oil on top? I know that there's a noticeable difference in darkness and sheen from 1 coat to 2 coats of Tru-oil. And if I sand it off and start over, what grit should I start with?  Thanks! "
193,Wear out of wooden floor,"In a dance studio I have a flooring from engineered wood, with top layer ~3mm ash. After 2 years the heavily used spot looks like this:  While in the corner, where there's not much traffic, it looks as new:   I understand that the varnish is wearing off on the edge grain.  My questions are:     Should I be worried that uncovered wood would deteriorate fast, being rubbed off in a few years? How should I maintain the floor on a regular basis? Add some oil or wax when mopping it? I do like the aesthetics of the grain pattern on the surface, can I make it more prominent, applying some dark colouring maybe?   "
194,Using 1x4 instead of 2x4 for laminated workbench top?,"I'm getting into woodworking using hand tools. I'd like to make a 2'x4' or 2'x5' workbench for my apartment.  I'd rather not use power tools as the noise would be an issue, and using old hand tools is enjoyable to me.    I was considering laminating 2x4s for the bench top, but construction/framing 2x4s have rounded edges that I would rather not take the time and energy to plane by hand (no matter how much I enjoy using hand tools). I also don't want to deal with finding someone to run them through a planer.    So, could I just buy 1x4 stock that already has square edges and laminate those? Would there be any disadvantages compared to using 2x4s? "
195,Do I need to worry about incidental contact between a finish and its thinner / solvent once it's cured?,"This is probably most applicable for water-based finishes, but I suppose it could be generalized to all finishes.   Once a finish has dried / cured, do I need to worry about incidental contact between a finish and its thinner / solvent? I'm not talking about leaving a piece finished with water-based poly outside in the rain, of course, but rather near a shower or sink, for instance. Will that contact with water eventually eat away the finish? Would it depend on the type of finish and/or how many coats and/or how thick each coat was?  I doubt you'd have a similar situation with oil-based finishes outside the shop, but what if you spilled mineral spirits, for example? Would you need to worry about refinishing? "
196,Can you apply water based stain over oil based wood conditioner?,I put oil based wood conditioner on and but would rather used water based conditioner and stain.  I am able to put on water based stain over the oil based conditioner?  Or is there a way to remove the oil based conditioner?  Thank you. 
197,Can I enlarge this wood rack without beefing it up?,"I'm going to build this firewood rack, but I want to enlarge it and make it 8 feet wide and 54 inches high. It's all stock 2x4 material. Considering the increased load it's going to be carrying, will the two single bottom rails still suffice without sagging over the years? And how about the single middle support? Does that need to be two supports? This is going to be in a garage protected from weather, so I would expect it to last indefinitely.    "
198,Screw clearance hole question,Why must there be a clearance hole and pilot hole joining two pieces of material together? Why can't you drill a straight hole into them? 
199,Need help understanding workbench design and build process,"I recently asked a question here regarding the use of 1x4s rather than 2x4s for a laminated workbench top and got some helpful advice. I decided to go with 2x4s, and now it's time to build. Before I do, I'd like to run my general plan past this community to see how it sounds.  I plan on laminating 16 5' long 2x4s to make a 5x2' bench top.  I'll use a plane to skim the face of each board to help the gluing process, use my 6 5' long bar clamps to hold the glue-up together overnight, and then build the base.  For the base, I have 8 3' 2x4s to laminate in pairs for the legs, the depth of the legs being 3.5"" each and the width being 3"" each. I have enough material for two sets of pairs of laminated 2x4 stretchers, one at the top of the legs, to be tenoned into the leg mortises, and one at the bottom of the legs to be tenoned in.  Then I have enough for 4 sets of 2 laminated 5' 2x6s to run the length of the bench, also tenoned into the legs.   So, I'll end up with a frame that is 2'x5' with fairly stout legs and good bracing across and along the depth. Then I'd like to use dowels to attach the top, so it could be removed to be semi-portable. Those would be between the top and the stretchers on the left and right sides, either one on each side or a pair on each side.  Is there anything wrong with this design? Most designs I see have the top overlapping the base by a few inches on each side, especially when considering the length. Is this a requirement?  Edit: here's a quick sketch of my idea:   "
200,Why do screws usually work well without clearance holes?,"Why do screws so often work even without a clearance hole? It seems like in theory, the screw should always push the joint apart (bridging). But in my experience, screws more often seem to tighten the joint. How does this work? Is it because the screw strips the threads in the first piece of wood a little bit, so it works the same as though it had a clearance hole? "
201,Longterm protection for outdoor painted bird feeder (bird safe & environmentally friendly)?,"I'm custom building some bird feeders which will be sold for a charity. They need to be safe for birds, look decent for a while, preferably be environmentally friendly.   1) What are my options for longterm protection that won't turn yellow, peel the paint work in the short-term, but is considered environmentally friendly/safe for birds?

202,Cutting tight miter joints for a frame around an existing object,"I recently finished most of a practice project (a large lap desk). It looks like this so far:    I made a ton of mistakes but the only one I can't figure out how to fix next time is the frame around it, specifically gaps in the miter joints because the sides were not the correct length (not because the angles were significantly off). I ended up with massive gaps on two of the corners:    The piece consists of a 3/4"" thick panel made of joined boards, surrounded by a rabbeted, chamfered, mitered frame cut from 2x2s. The cross section of the frame looks like this, the green marks indicate the face that needs to match the length of the panel edges (I joined the green edge to the panel with biscuits):    Like this:    The process I went through to fit this frame was awful:   Cut frame pieces and make miter cut in one end of each. Place against panel lining up mitered end then pencil mark green and purple edges on the other end. Eyeballed mark against a marking I made on the table saw table where the edge of the blade was. Difficult because mark did not extend down to table (wide bottom was in way, and flipping edge upside down made mark impossible to see). Made cuts. Verified that table saw probably cut through green edge reference mark. Dry fit, pieces were too long. Tried to trim on table saw. Pieces became too short. Got frustrated, cut about 1/8"" off two sides of panel, re-routed chamfers. Used table saw fence to make short sides exactly 13.75"" long. Long sides exceeded capacity of table saw. Used square to draw perpendicular lines on long edges roughly 1/16"" from old edge, clamped a straight board to panel, used pattern bit in router to trim. Measured 13.75"" from cut on each short edge of frame. Made new mark. Dry fit long edges, made new marks. Use rafter square 45 degree edge, referenced to mark on green edge, to make cut markings on inner edges. Difficult because of gap between top and inner edge. Made a thing screwed to my miter slide so I could see where the edge was on the table saw. Clamped frame to slide lining up markings with edge of thing then made cuts. This was somewhat hampered by the chamfers already cut on the frame edges. I used one existing mitered cut and picked the one to mark and adjust in a way that made it so I didn't have to keep changing the angle on my slide. Verified that table saw probably cut through green edge reference mark. Long edges were too short. Gave up, glued everything together and crammed the corners full of grain filler. Gaps were too big to put glue on the mitered edges so I hacked it with half a biscuit and a chisel.   So, my question is: How could I have constructed this frame with no gaps? How can I create a tight mitered frame around a fixed size, pre-existing object?  I read Perfect miters every time and watched a video linked from there. I also read this trick. But I can't understand how I can apply any of this, because it all seems to detail how to get the angles right without caring about the final size of the frame. I also am having trouble understanding how the sleds described could be used here - I think I accomplished about the same thing in step 9 above.  It seems to me that the biggest challenge here is that my reference edge is actually in the center of my frame.  I do not know what good marking / measuring / cutting techniques are required to make this happen. I am frustrated because I keep trying to research this and hitting dead ends where people care about the precise angle but don't mind shrinking their frames by 1/16"" or so in the process. "
203,Applying shellac smoothly without a sprayer,"How can I apply a smooth coat of dewaxed shellac without a sprayer?  Whether I use a brush, sponge, or rag, I always end up with tiny raised beads of shellac at the borders of my previous brush stroke. This mostly happens between dips into the can. Trying to fade them down with brush strokes makes it worse.  What am I doing wrong and how can I avoid this?  It's difficult to sand when it dries and in all my sanding attempts I still end up reducing the beads to smooth but visible rough lines. I can cover with another coat but then I am back to square one.  It's obvious that it shouldn't be overbrushed, it even says that on the can. It tacks up so quickly that I have problems just keeping it smooth across brush strokes. I have tried thin coats, thick coats, fading the brush strokes, slopping it on and hoping it levels, waiting a bit and trying to buff it, quick second coat while still wet, all with poor results. I even tried just dumping it out of the can and quickly spreading it around (which sort of solved the problem but made some messy new problems...).  I have a good bit of experience with paint and everything in my bag of tricks is failing me.  The effect is much less pronounced for the first coat on a soft unfinished material, because it soaks in quickly, esp. things like poplar and MDF. But for the most part it always happens no matter where the coat is. "
204,Varathane applied over oil-based stain before it cured - fixes?,"I built a dining table and stained with my usual product - low VOC minwax in Provincial. I let the stain sit for 12 hours, but the humidity was really high and  I don't think it fully dried.  I applied a coat of Varathane the next morning, and it beaded up. Now, it's super tacky and when I scrape my fingernail over the wood, the stain squeezes up.   Do I have to strip the whole top? If so, any product recommendations?  "

206,Are there specific types of screws I should use for woodworking?,"I'm wondering what types of screws I should use for woodworking and what types I shouldn't be using as well.   For example, Are deck screws OK? What about a square head vs. Phillips? Does the type of metal/construction of the screw matter? "
207,Discoloration under label on cherry,"I have this piece of cherry (American) heartwood. It had a sticker on it. When I peeled it off there was a lighter area underneath. It is not residue from the sticker (I scrubbed it with xylene), the wood is discolored. I am not sure how deep it goes but I was unable to affect it with heavy sanding.    My question is: What caused that? Was it some chemical in the glue? The paper? Trapped moisture? No oxygen, or blocking sunlight?   I'm not concerned about getting rid of it (that piece lives in the scrap bin now) but I'm curious about the chemistry behind that discoration. "
208,What is the purpose of Maloof oil/wax and how is it different than regular paste wax?,"I'm finishing up a project and decided to use Sam Maloof Poly/Oil Finish as the primary finish.    I typically like to put paste wax on my work when I'm done -- I like the feel and I think it helps protect the wood under certain circumstances (e.g. water appears to bead up better on oil-finished wood with a paste wax compared to just oil finished wood).  I noticed that the Maloof oil/poly can suggests using Maloof Oil/Wax as a top coat.  I assumed that the oil/wax was just like the Liberon paste wax I've used, but I took a look at the MSDS and was pretty surprised.  It looks like it's basically just BLO+tung oil and a really small amount of wax.  Is this a common finish?  There seems to be so little wax that I'm curious if it has any effect at all.  Qualitatively what is the difference in a finish with using something like this (e.g. oil and a really small amount of wax) compared to paste wax?  Do they serve different purposes in the finishing world?   Edit:  On a related note this seems really easy to make. Am I wrong in thinking that I could just add 1 part BLO, 1 part tung, and some beeswax flakes into a glass jar and melt/mix it using a double boiler? "
209,Coping with uneven table saw table and inconsistent cut depth,"What is the best way to cope with a table saw that has an uneven table?  I noticed inconsistent cut depths with my table saw so did some test cuts on a piece of oak known to be straight and measured the depths. Cuts were like this:    I made the cuts in a random order to rule out the possibility of the blade height drifting. I also noticed no play in the blade position or angle with my hands.  Results were like this (leading and trailing edge depths measured about 0.25"" from respective edge, note x axis is mirrored wrt above picture, ""throat plate far edge"" is where the edge of the wood crosses the far edge of the throat plate):    The blade has angled teeth, and I measured to the center of the cut. I made the full set of measurements 3 times and found my results only varied by at most 0.0005"", so I believe the relative measurements to be accurate.  The first thing I discovered was that I did a poor initial job adjusting my throat plate height (as evidenced; it was too low), so I fixed that. However, I closely inspected the table with a square (a friend lent me a Starrett) and found that it is not completely flat. There are large, smooth, ever so slight bends and dips in it, and the bit to the right of the throat plate is a few hundredths of an inch higher than the left side. I am presuming this is the cause of my inconsistent cut depths. I also can feel with my fingers that the miter slide's rail is slightly higher than the table although I'm not sure how this affects things.  I noticed an identical trend with a piece of MDF and a piece of poplar as well (this is actually what prompted me to do this experiment) although I did not make a full measurement set on those.  What is the best way to cope with this (or are my expectations too high; the saw is a Ridgid R4513â )? I have not yet built any sleds. It seems like a sled with a nice flat base will solve the issue for cross cuts. I did read this great answer, however, I am still unsure what to do for non-through rip cuts, where the material is longer and I want to use the fence.     â  After reading grfrazee's answer, I contacted Ridgid and they claim a Â±0.016"" manufacturing tolerance; further inspection of the table appears to verify it is within their tolerance. So it seems my expectations may be too high for this particular saw. "
210,Cut-out from 18mm MDF,"I have a 400mm square piece of 18mm MDF. I need to take a 300mm by 300mm square of depth 10mm out of the middle of the piece of wood. Currently the only tool I really have is a Dremel, so I don't plan on doing it with that. Is it possible to cut out something like this with a router? If so which bit would I need? "
211,Determining flexibility of wood types from charts and tables,"If I'm looking for a type of wood that has very little flexibility (or one that has a lot), what wood metrics should I look for in tables / charts / lists to judge relative flexibility?  Is the Janka hardness scale a good indicator of flexibility as well or is dent resistance an independent thing?  By flexibility I mean e.g. how much will a shelf of a given thickness and grain orientation bend when a load is placed on it. I don't really care about max load or breaking point, just a way to compare wood types of the same thickness under the same load.   I'm just not sure what to look for. Most searches for flexibility yield hardness scale tables but I don't understand enough material science to know if this is what I'm looking for. "
212,Traditional woodworking marks,"A while ago I was watching this video and the guy casually mentioned some woodworking marks that I found to be really great.  I was trying to search for more of these today and found out they are sometimes called witness marks, among other things (I've seen layout, carpenter's, woodworking, witness, datum, and other terms used inconsistently to refer to these marks or various subsets of them).  I am now trying to find more about traditional, well-established marking techniques and symbols. It seems that it can be a fairly personal thing, for example in this book and this video of a guy sharing his grandfather's marking techniques, they use triangles pointing away from you, while the guy in the first video above uses triangles pointing towards you. Still, despite the personal touches, they all generally seem to be variations of a common theme.  The only marks I've really been consistent with up to this point are triangles facing towards me for alignment and a double squiggly line for the face side of a reference edge, both from that first video. I'll also be using the tally marks on joints now (I was just using triangles for that, too), since I watched the chiselandforge video.   My question is: No matter what you want to call them, can somebody share their knowledge of a full set of these marks? The chiselandforge link above covers a fair set, but for some reason this seems to be an ancient woodworking secret mysteriously absent from the internet (well, I couldn't find much). I'd like to know more.  As a sub question, which is actually what I was looking for to begin with: I'm also wondering if there's a common marking used to indicate an original piece in a series of copies (e.g. if I want to do the same thing to many boards, and I do my accurate measuring on one then copy it to the others, is there a traditional mark to keep track of the original). "
213,How do I use a cross-cut sled safely?,"This cross-cut sled is about as basic as it gets (the clamp is the stop block, base is 1/4"" MDF, walls are stacked plywood, sliders are 1/4"" plywood, all parts attached with glue):    It seems to have added a whole new level of danger to my table saw, with the blade right there in the middle of my workspace making through cuts with no guard, and the large surfaces I can push on with slots that the blade comes through.  How can I use this sled safely? What safety improvements can I make (or should I have made), how should I push it along, how should I remove cut pieces and load/position new boards, and what kind of new kickback dangers (or any new dangers really) should I be aware of? "
214,Finishing schedule for live edge walnut slab,"I'm working on a live edge walnut slab coffee table.  This is a photo of the bottom side of the table before any finish is applied sanded to 220 (for reference the holes are for threaded inserts that take a 1/4-20 bolt -- I machined metal legs that mate to the table):    I finished the bottom using Emmet's Good Stuff, which is a gel polyurethane oil based varnish.  I applied a few coats, scuff sanded, and then used steel wool to apply some wax.  I used some cotton rags to polish the wax by hand:    It's pretty hard to capture the grain/reflections with my iphone, but in general I liked the results. That stated I'd like something that pops the grain a bit more on the top side.  The Good Stuff contains ""synthetic oils"" (whatever that means) that do penetrate the wood nicely, but it doesn't have quite the pop I'm looking for.  Additionally the color of the wood doesn't quite match, the look I was hoping for seen in examples like:  Example 1  Example 2  I'm hoping to get a richer/darker tone in the heartwood while maintaining a nice contrast with the sap wood (it's fine by me if the sap wood darkens up a bit too so long as it maintains that nice contrast seen in the above examples).  I've been reading a ton about finishing and was hoping to get some feedback on the following finishing schedule for this piece:   1-2 coats of oil (either boiled linseed, tung, or something like a danish oil).  The idea of this step is to pop the grain more than the good stuff is capable of as well as possibly darken the color of the wood a bit. 1 coat of dewaxed shellac.  The idea here is to provide a sanding sealer, optionally use a darker shellac (maybe amber?) to help darken the wood as well (augmenting step 1), and provide an interface to other finishing products. (perhaps this step is unnecessary if the next step isn't needed?) Pore filler.  Not really sure about this step -- I've been reading a bunch about it/watching youtube videos and it's unclear to me if this will help accentuate the pores (which I would imagine would help pop the figure) after the first two steps in this process.  From what I understand I think I'd want to use an oil based pore filler.  I am under the impression that I should sand this stuff off so it just stays in the pores. (Maybe I can combine the first three steps into one step by wet sanding the oil and using the slurry as wood filler?) Few coats of Good Stuff to provide a nice hard durable finish on top. Rub out the good stuff with sand paper up to ~1200 grit to get a satin finish.   Any feedback on the above steps, combination thereof, and the proposed reasoning behind them would be helpful.  Perhaps there other other better ways to approach this as well.  A few notes: I'm doing this in a garage with minimal access to professional equipment so spraying isn't really an option for me.  I'm 100% an amateur/hobbyist so super expensive equipment probably isn't realistic (though I do have access to a tool library and would consider investment in low-medium cost tools).  -------  EDIT  -------  After trying several different permutations I finally finished the table.  I ended up making a test board of a piece I cut from the slab:  The combinations I tried were:   1 part Boiled linseed oil 1 part mineral spirits 1 part Boiled linseed oil 1 part mineral spirits second coat wet sanded with the grain Maloof oil (1/3 poly, 1/3 BLO, 1/3 tung) Maloof oil second coat wet sanded with grain Good stuff 1 part BLO 2 parts mineral spirits Tung oil 1lb dewaxed blonde shellac to test as a sanding sealer   I then top coated those with good stuff to see what the final effect would be.    The sample board below shows the work, but it's probably impossible to see any differences given the lighting and iphone camera.  Suffice it to say there was a notable difference between all options.  How much and who noticed is debatable, but if you looked closely there were lots of differences.  All the oil products definitely popped the grain much better than the good stuff.  Qualitatively I'd say that BLO darkened the wood (especially the sap wood) more than the tung oil.  Interestingly the 2 parts mineral spirits 1 part BLO came out darker than 1 part mineral spirits 1 part BLO.  Maybe the mineral spirits thinned it more so that it was able to penetrate deeper?  Wet sanding the second coat definitely did something to the pores.  I've read in a few places that it's debatable whether this technique actually fills the pores since you're wiping away after a few minutes anyway.  In any event those sections' pores were much more visible (e.g. darker) to a degree I didn't like.  The shellac absolutely sanded easier than the good stuff.  This was to be expected, but I was shocked at how much smoother of a surface I got from this.  In the end I decided that I liked what the BLO and tung did to the wood.  They both popped the grain and made it ""richer"", but in different ways.  Rather than picking/choosing/overthinking it I just mixed 1 part BLO 1 part tung and 2 parts mineral spirits.  That way I could tell myself I got the best of both worlds :)  I could have just used the maloof finish, but I didn't see much point of using the poly in the maloof finish since I was going to get a poly top coat from the good stuff anyway.  Also though the differences were slight I preferred the pure oil to the maloof.  I did use the dewaxed shellac as a sanding sealer, which I was happy with.  I got a much smoother surface than I think I would have if I used the good stuff, but who knows -- I'm sure it's possible to get a very smooth surface with the good stuff as well.  After that I used 4 coats of good stuff removing excess almost immediately.  I scuff sanded between coats.  Finally I applied neutral liberon black bison wax with steel wool and polished by hand with rags.  I'm really happy with the finished table.  I think it looks and feels great.  Compared to another larger table I did with just good stuff I think the grain pops a lot more due to the oil.  I get a much more ""3d"" look to the figure.  The oils appear to have definitely darkened the wood in a way that I like.  The wax finish over the good stuff leaves a really nice smooth surface, which I really like.  Obviously the number one driver for the look of the finished table is the wood itself.  That stated I could have probably done anything and it would have turned out nicely, but since I chose this route I'll say it was the best!   "
215,"What are the different grain directions, and how do they affect joint strength?","What are the differences between edge grain, face grain, and long grain (and why not throw end grain in there while we're at it)?  And which of these grain directions results in the strongest glue joints? "
216,Cherry wood for dining table - Strong enough or should I consider Walnut?,"I went lumber shopping for my first wood working project - Pedestal dining table (See picture)    I found that the prices vary wildly and am having a hard time choosing one because I don't know what is sufficient.  In my table, the cost of lumber for everything except for the table top are as follows:   Walnut  = 16 BF * [tex]184 Cherry  = 16 BF * [tex]101 Red Oak = 16 BF * [tex]77   Looks wise, I like all three. Walnut hits beyond my budget. My questions specifically are :   Is Cherry a good choice for a dining table?  How does it compare to Walnut in terms of strength or any other advantages I don't know of?  Any other suggestions on the design are welcome as well.  "
217,Can I turn my router table into a jointer?,"I would like to use my router table as a jointer since I can not afford the cost of a jointer itself. What modifications would I need to do to the router fence (maybe?) to make it work the best. Is there an easy way to set the bit to the right depth? (I was thinking that you would put a piece of wood on the body, then the blade would cut a little in, would that work?)  "
218,Is a long router bit safe?,There are some really long router bits from my second favorite router bit company that have straights with blades from 2 to 3 inches long.    Is that safe in any way?  Is it more of a thing where as a part of the bit dulls you move it down or up?  Can you use the whole thing (like for flattening a side of the board) and it will not bend?    I would love to get the bit for that purpose like the 2 inch for flattening the sides but I am not sure. 
219,Can you identify the screws used in my folding chairs,"I have several teak folding deck chairs to restore. Some screws in a sheath(?) are missing. I took a complete sample to a local, national brand tool and hardware store. The store did not stock it and had no advice on where to find it. I left without asking exactly what to call this multi-part screw as I continue my search.   See picture the pictures below    What am I looking for? "
220,Does MDF warp less than pineboards?,"Background  I am a very much a beginner, and I have been trying to make a long (3.6m) pelmet. (It is not a pelmet box - it goes from wall to wall, and hangs from the ceiling.)  Attempt #1 was with a single piece of pineboard that was delivered with a mild warp (mainly twist with a touch of cupping). I let it sit for a couple of weeks inside before  got around to painting it, but I didn't take any active measures to flatten it first - I thought it wouldn't be noticeable once it was mounted up high and painted the same colour as the walls and ceiling. I was very wrong, and think I have to abandon it and start again.  For Attempt #2, I am thinking of trying MDF instead.  MDF Stability  I've seen suggestions here that MDF is less likely to be warped (as long as it is kept dry):   How can I deal with wood from DIY stores that is crooked and may or may not be dry?      chipboard (aka particle board) and MDF are considered dimensionally stable and will not warp with changes in humidity   but I've also seen counter-examples:   How to flatten MDF board Is vertical storage of sheet goods causing my boards to warp?   Am I right in saying, if I buy some MDF from a hardware store, it is much more likely to be flat than ordering pineboard from a timberyard? "
221,Does MDF board dull tools quickly?,"There are many who say that MDF dulls cutting tools very quickly. But I do not think it does compared to many woods. I would think even pine is a harder material than MDF. How fast can it dull tools? Or does it do other wonders to a cutting tool because of the glue, like jamming it up? "
222,How do I drill greater than 7 inches in from the edge of my sheet of wood?,"From the drill press's supporting pipe to the drill bit tip measures 5"". I believe this limits me to drilling no farther than 5"" in from any given side of my MDF sheet. Unfortunately, I need to drill 7"" in from the edge of my MDF sheet.   Is there anyway to accomplish this with the drill press I currently own?  If not, are there alternatives to a drill press that can be used for accurate holes?  Or.. Is there a place that rents time on a drill press that could drill 7"" in from the side of a sheet of MDF?   The drill press I have access to:  "
223,Making a stone sieve out of wood,I would love to make a stone sieve out of wood. The best thing I can think of is to take a piece of wood and drill lots of holes in it. And I would be putting siding on of coarse. What size holes should I use? What could I do to prevent clogging of the soil if any? And maybe somebody has a blue print or a different and better way of making something like this.  
224,How do i create a really long box joint?,"The Sane Man's Approach  As I'm about to remove a wall I have to add a steel I-Beam as a post to support the ceiling. My plan is to cover all four sides so that it looks like a wooden post. Normally I would cut mitered angles and try to make the seams as unobtrusive as possible or just glue and brad nail boards together in place as there is only exposed long grain and I think that wouldn't look too bad either.     My Delusions Of Grandeur  While mulling this idea around in my head I came up with the idea of joining the boards with box joints. Although they wouldn't need any strength to speak of, I think this would give the post a nice look. I'm even considering using two or four different types of wood to maximize the effect.  There are a ton of guides, tutorials, discussions out there on how to make box joints with the table saw or a router table and some kind of jig. By now it feels like I watched and read ALL of them :). While being excellent for cutting box joints for their intended size and application, none of them suit me and my idea. The room is somewhere under three meters (ten feet) high and so would the boards be.  My Questions   Is the grain direction a problem for me? Box joints are usually cut into end-grain, I would cut them into long-grain. If I use different wood(species), would the joints explode all over my living room while they probably expand at different rates/times? What is the best tool to use? What would be the best jig to use? Is this completely loony or is there already an established way of doing this that I simply didn't find?  "
225,Should breadboard ends be quarter sawn or plain sawn?,"If I use quarter sawn boards for the breadboard ends, the battens are stable but weaker. If I use plain sawn boards, the battens are stronger but are themselves at risk of cupping.    Would one always be recommended over the other? "
226,Ikea Beech Table top conditioning,"Okay guys, I need your expert help. I bought a solid beech counter top that I'm using as my computer table.

227,Is stain an acceptable final finish?,"I am planning to put wood beams on my tall ceilings and I don't have much time to do both a stain AND a finish on the beams. If I just stain the beams, will this be acceptable? Or do I have to coat it with a clear finish as well? Or is there a better solution to stain the wood that will also keep it protected? Unlike furniture, these will not be touched very often, if ever, so I'm not worried about protecting them from dings.  NOTE: The wood beams will not be solid beams. I will be using solid wood planks and joining them with a special router bit. Also, the temperature that the stain/finish would be exposed to during the drying time may be around 45Â°F (~7Â°C).     "
228,Can I black dye gorilla glue and use it to fill cracks in wood instead of black epoxy?,"I am wondering if it would be possible to dye black gorilla glue and use it to fill cracks in wood instead of the well known black epoxy method?  Why? Because finding right epoxy and dealing with it is much harder than glue.  Concerns:  - what dye to use inside the glue to avoid colouring the rest of wood when sanding or waxing it - can gorilla glue sanding give decent results for small surfaces? like continuous matte surface?  - risks of affecting how coloured wax would stain the wood, if glue is black darkening the wood should avoid a high-contrast "
229,How should I fix a broken chair stringer?,"This part of the chair was damaged during shipping and I was wondering if it would be safe to glue together.     The part on the left is a leg and the horizontal bar on the right supports the front of seat. I would imagine that the broken joint supports a bit of weight. Would glue be sufficient to hold it together?  The tenon is stuck firmly inside the mortise, I don't think I can extract it. If I were to attempt to glue it back together would I apply glue on the entire side face of the leg or just the broken tenon?  Here is a side view:    I have very little woodworking experience, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Additional pictures:   [2 [3 "
230,Laminating 2x4s - brush on the glue?,"I laminated some 2x4s for workbench legs, and as you can see by the attached picture, there's a gap between two of the boards. I applied the glue in a zig zag line down the length of the boards and then a line along all 4 edges of the board's face.  I clamped the 3' long glue-up with 5 clamps that I tightened pretty securely. I'm wondering why this gap exists, and what I can do better next time, since I still have to glue up the entire top.  I did glue up all four legs at the same time, so will take the previous advice to do a pair at a time from this point forward.  I don't think this is a problem structurally, but maybe next time I should brush on the glue smoothly?  Maybe I should be planing these flatter to start with? Thanks.     "
231,Which additives increase shellac's heat resistance?,"I like shellac's color and ease of application, but the bottom of my laptop melts my table's finish. Yes, seriously.  I'm thinking to cross-link the finish (taking advantage of all the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups) by mixing it with a bit of epoxy or epoxy hardener (polyamine). (Note: shellac is pretty reactive, which is probably one reason it works as a primer. It will crosslink all by itself, if the heat is high enough.)  Do you know of anything else that can be added to shellac to make it cross-link or increase the heat tolerance? I don't like the idea of adding epoxy or hardener because it may have a very short pot life. I might also be able to try mixing it with lacquer. What additives would you try? "
232,Wooden bread dough proofing box -- high humidity,"I'm thinking about making a proofing box for bread dough. I will need high humidity, and perhaps even a heating element to keep water vaporized. I'm wondering how something like shop-grade birch plywood would fare under those conditions, with or without a finish.   I may be able to finish the inside with polyurethane, since the food won't come into contact with it, but I don't want to wait a month to have the fumes finally cure out if I can find a better solution.  My other option is a wood frame and plexiglass body, but that won't look nearly as nice. Are there any good options for humidity resistance for an application like this? Solid oak perhaps? "
233,Is cedar dangerous for your health when used in indoor furniture?,"I'm concerned about the health risks of using the cedar as indoor furniture. Had no idea about the toxicity of cedar before making a bed with my friend out of cedar from Home Depot. Apparently the fumes/oil are bad for you long term? Is there anything I can do to protect ourselves from this?  I did put one coat of wipe on Danish fruitwood oil on the bed, but thats about it. I also realised that the planks that the mattress sits on are also cedar and these were NOT sealed with anything, not even the danish oil. Should I perhaps seal those to be on the safe side. Its a very small bedroom with not much ventilation, so I want to be safe.  Additionally, I also read that using Danish oil on cedar anyway is a bad idea as doesn't fully cure? Can someone advise on the impact of this.  What does it ultimately mean if it does not fully cure. What impacts does that have? I've had the bed fully done and in use for about 7 months now.  It's a lovely bed, but I want to ensure I treat it properly to ensure any offgassing does not cause health concerns, we plan to have this bed a long time if possible.  So any suggestions on what I can do to make this safer, would be greatly appreciated.  Update 22/May/2017:  The bedhead is about 6ft high, which is basically panelling almost most of one side of the bedroom, as its a small bedroom. So theres a lot of Cedar in this small room.  The concern I had was around the plicatic acid contained in the Cedar. It also depends what Cedar, I know Western and Eastern are different. Mine was from Home Depot in BC, which I would assume is Western Cedar, as well, weâre in Western Canada, is that a good assumption? :P  And WRC is one to contain a lot of this acidâ¦  Iâm also new to Canada (coming from the UK) and Cedar is something I had not yet worked with before.  Most of the research was from google, Iâll include a few below, but it also includes the wood database page that someone else had quoted above.  Iâm still however wondering if its worth adding an extra coat of âsomethingâ as Cedar is traditionally used outdoor rather than indoor. Someone suggested Tung oil to me today, any thoughts on that? Iâm hoping I can do something that does not involve having to do it outside, as all I have is a balcony in my apartment.  [website][website][website]As per the 2nd link, Australian Red Cedar, has been banned as a furniture making timber, at the Canberra School of the Arts, in their Fine Furniture Workshop, as Aussie Red is carcinogenic. Not sure about whatever Cedar is over in Canada.  Again, thanks for all your comments. I really appreciate it and the efforts that you have gone to to look it up. My girlfriend will be moving in soon, and I want to make sure its all good to go. Anything I can do before then to finish off the bed is what is driving me to look into all this right now. From the googling, it has been shown dust, shavings or the wood can aggravate or even cause breathing problems, so I naturally came here to see what others more experienced than me thought about it, cos I donât want to end up causing Asthma or whatever breathing issues for me and my girlfriend. That wood database even mentioned a cancer in relation to Cedar, so it leaves me a bit clueless as what to think of the next step. "
234,How to build a window frame with hand tools?,"I'm interested in the process of building a traditional 1920s America window frame with only hand tools and was wondering if someone could explain the basic process by which the pieces are cut, joined, and styled (moulding plane?).

235,"Laminating 2"" red oak to make 4x4s?","I got a bunch of free wood today, as in 6 rough quarter-sawn(!) red oak boards, 2"" x 12"" x 9'. For free. (Yay!) The boards were stickered about a year ago. (The largest piece was 38"" x 4"" x 13'. It is becoming a bar top, I think.)  Now, I'm making a table, and the legs and a few other pieces are 3.75"" square. I could make all of the 4x4 pieces I need from two of the 12"" boards with plenty to spare.   Is there any problem or surprise waiting for me if I laminate the boards in this way? If laminating is the proper term when dealing with thick stock in this way. My plan is to run the boards trough the planer to get a flat side, rip it to the desired width - 3 pieces per big board - and glue the flat sides together. After the glue has set, run the finished board back through the planer, cut to length and move on with construction.   Thoughts? Is this the right approach? There were some boards of the right size, but they were already spoken for. And I'd rather not spend another $300 on lumber. Because I'm cheap.    "
236,Finishing on a crucifix,"I've made a crucifix for my partner, and am down to finishing it. (It's about nine inches, made to be hung on a wall.) It is maple, padauk and cherry. The corpus will either be copper or vermeil, if that's relevant. It has a couple coats of Danish oil on it (he likes the look), but is there a feeling that it needs a further finish - beeswax or the like?  I suppose my question really is: for a decorative piece that won't see much traffic, is a finish beyond Danish oil necessary or recommended? "
237,5000rpm vs 5500rpm circular saw,"Iâm looking to purchase a circular saw and Iâve narrowed it down to two, A Ryobi that is 1250w that spins at 5000 rpm and a Bosch saw that is 1400w that spins at 5500rpm, The question I am asking is does the extra 500 rpm make that much of a difference for the extra cost? And does anybody have experience with these two brands of saw? "
238,Using a Planer on wide but short stock,"I want to make a chess-board style end-grain cutting board. I only have a bandsaw, a Jointer and a Planer. The first step is easy: I cut strips of two wood species and joint and plane them so they are 40mmx40mm. I then glue them together to get a striped board. Now I need to crosscut that into strips again (each strip is then striped).  All the tutorials I found use a table saw for this, which creates a glueable surface. I don't have that.  I can do these cuts on the bandsaw, but after that, the strips need to be planed to create a gluable surface. I cannot just run them through the planer lengthwise, because that would be across the grain. I also cannot run them through the planer width-wise as they are too short (40mm).  Can I maybe clamp these strips together and run them through the planer as one piece? With F-Style clamps? "
239,"Connecting the MDF corners, so there's no gap","TL;DR  How do I connect the MDF sheets on the corners (in left-hand-side picture), so they align nicely, and there's no gap? As you can see in the sketch, the angles are not always multiples of 45 degrees.  Backstory:  One day I got bored, and wanted to play some Pac-Man. Playing it on PC didn't really feel right, so I decided to buy an arcade cabinet. After checking the prices on eBay, I made the best decision... ""$1,500 for a cabinet? I can build this myself!""  Needless to say, it's a great idea for someone with no prior woodworking experience...  Anyway, I am moving forward quite nicely, but I've stumbled upon a problem for which I can't seem to find a solution.  I am wondering how I can connect MDF sheets together, so that there isn't be a gap between them - basically, how can I cut them at an angle (and what tools would you recommend for that purpose?).  In the image I am attaching, you can see my rough sketch of arcade cabinet on the left. How am I to connect the top sheet and back sheet together? They join at a slight angle, leaving a visible corner gap, and I want to achieve the result on the right, where the joined pieces blend together seamlessly.   "
240,Didn't let wood dry between coats of stain & poly. How to correct?,"I attempted my first ever woodworking project this weekend and thought it was going smoothly until I realized I was supposed to let the minwax oil based stain dry for 4-6 hours between coats.   I had read the first steps in the directions that said to apply, wait 15 mins, wipe off excess and then immediately repeated with coat #2 and shortly after with the minwax polyurethane as well.   Now it's sat over night and an oily residue that can be wiped off easily has come to the surface in several spots. This is what made me re-read the directions and realize my HUGE mistake :(  Do I just let it continue to sit? Should I wipe it off? How do I correct this?! It's a huge farmhouse table built out of common board, whitewood &amp; douglas fir.   Thank you!!!  "
241,Should I keep cherry in the sun before finishing?,"I have some American Cherry boards. I planed and sanded them enough that I removed most (but not all) of the sun-darkened surface.  I'd like it to go back to a nice even dark color eventually. Should I leave it in the sun for a few days / weeks before finishing it or will it still react with UV under a finish (assuming no UV blocking finish) and darken again naturally?  Also, does the answer apply to all types of wood? "
242,How do I temporarily attach two pieces of wood together for machining?,"How do I temporarily attach two pieces of wood together, face to face, in a way that's strong enough that I can, say, run it through a saw, but that doesn't leave marks on the wood or get in the way of the tool?  For example, let's say I have a piece of wood with jagged edges and I want to temporarily stick it on another piece of wood with a straight edge so I can guide it along a table saw or router fence.   Clamps get in the way of the table, and are sometimes hard to position accurately. Wood glue is permanent. Screws and nails leave holes. Two sided tape is thick and squishy (has some play, no good esp. on a router), leaves residue.   How can I do this? I have this struggle a lot. "
243,"Correct ""piping"" (hosing) for adding a mini-cyclone to a shop vac","This is technically an engineering question rather than woodworking, but I guess chances are good that someone on here has experience with this, has already tried what works well, and thus can give a better practical answer.  I'm planning to upgrade my shop vac (Festool CTL26) with a small 6'' cyclone (ClearVue CV06, if that matters) and I'm inconclusive about what's best for the ""piping"". Space and mobility is, unluckily, somewhat of a factor here, so my solution needs to be something that can be tucked onto a systainer sitting on a shop vac rather than a collector with 150mm pipes, a 5HP blower and a 2.5 meter tall cyclone.  The idea behind the cyclone is of course to take away 90% of the dust before it even reaches the vac, which is supposed to both save money on filters and increase the vac's total filter efficiency.  In fact, it appears like someone else already had that exact idea and is selling almost exactly the build that I had envisioned (only with a cheaper cyclone). From the photo, they seem to connect with a 50mm or 2'' hose. Seeing how they're selling that, it probably has to ""work"". Somehow, at least. Also, I found some guy on Youtube who showed the same cyclone in action, and he just plugged the standard 27mm hose onto it (although he said it was 36mm). That, too, seemed to work, somehow.  Seeing how it makes almost zero difference both in price and handling, I would however like to use a combination that not just ""works somehow"" because some guy plugged in something that he had lying around in his shop, but something that works well (i.e. as good as you can get it, for the same money and with the same effort).  The vac has a ""native"" 50mm inlet (= ca. 2''), but comes with a 3.5 meter 27mm suction hose (which is quite long and thin, in my opinion). Optionally, you can buy 36mm and 50mm hoses (and of course, you can get any-diameter hoses and any-to-any adapters from generic manufacturers). My tools (router, plunge saw, etc.) commonly have 36mm suction (with one exception, which has 27mm).  Intuitively, if a vac has a 50mm inlet, I want to plug something that's 50mm in diameter into that, not anything smaller. But that may be a wrong intuition.  A smaller hose means higher airspeed within the hose (assuming the same flow volume), which is a good thing for a cyclone. Higher speed means more centrifugal force. EPA suggests in their particle matter paper that cyclone efficiency increases with smaller inlet duct area (conclusive, this gives a higher inlet duct velocity). They also say that efficiency increases with the ratio of the cyclone body diameter to gas exit diameter (not sure why that should be the case). The inlet and outlet diameters are given by the cyclone's build (2.25'', ca. 58mm), but I assume the hose that you attach to the outlet counts, too (a 27mm hose connected to a 58mm outlet via an adapter is really just a 27mm outlet if you're honest!).  Despite that, my guts tell me to choose a 50mm hose to connect vac and cyclone (seeing how a thicker hose will let the vac ""suck better, and more easily""), and a 36mm one going from the cyclone to the tool because that one has less weight and is slightly less stubborn than the 50mm one, but it loses only 1/5 as much pressure as the 27mm one and is the same diameter as the outlet on the tool. I also assume there's less opportunity for turbulences or acceleration-deceleration effects if the hose diameter isn't constantly changing (also, it seems nonsensical to plug a 50mm hose into a 36mm hole, or having a 36mm hole when you only plug a 27mm hose into it).  On the other hand, the ""rules"" given by EPA suggest that using a 27mm hose on both sides would be the ""most optimal"" thing to do.  Using the vac's technical specifications (3,900l/min; 24,000Pa) and hopefully correct values for air density and viscosity in an online calculator, I get (assuming a straight steel pipe 1 meter long)     27mm : v = 113.5 m/s = 6,811.5 m/min = 22,347 ft/min, Îp = 58.66mbar   36mm : v = 63.8m/s = 3,831.5 m/min = 12,570 ft/min, Îp = 12.61mbar   50mm : v = 33.1m/s = 1,986.2 m/min =  6,516 ft/min, Îp = 2.45mbar   -- all with turbulent flow (not like it matters, but it seems like you need a hose 1.5 meters in diameter to get laminar flow at these speeds?!)  EDIT: Meanwhile I've verified these numbers forwards and backwards three times with a pocket calculator, they seem indeed correct. Which is surprising, since even with the 50mm hose, I'm still well above the 4,000 ft/min recommended by the WOOD Magazine article mentioned in this somewhat related answer. Actual pressure loss on a twisting, ripped plastic hose will obviously be larger than on the assumed straight steel pipe.  But, purely from a flow-speed-at-muzzle perspective, there doesn't seem to be any real difference, I could just as well use the thickest hose to minimize pressure loss, and still be above the 4k figure.  Basically, the question that remains to be answered is inhowfar it makes a difference to the cyclone whether a smaller hose is used. I am still inclined to assume that a somewhat smaller hose on the ""tool side"" might be a benefit since air enters the vortex with higher velocity. However, according to the law of continuity, once inside the cyclone, flow speed should rapidly decelerate to accomodate for the cyclone's large diameter anyway.  Surely, this is something that someone else has already come across and tried out which one works best?  Images speak more than a thousand words, so here is what the vac looks like ""by default"":    ... and that's what I want to make of it, and what I wonder:   "
244,Can I repair this bent part in my thickness planer?,"I've just discovered a bent part in my thickness planer and I'm wondering if it's repairable.   The part is the slightly orange part, between the blades and the in-feed roller:    As well as having a visible kink in it, it now sits so low it blocks wood when trying to feed it through.

245,Covering particle board to prevent splinters and make easy to wipe,"I recently created a little counter / desk thing in my garage, and a shelf above it mounted to the wall.  It was never meant to be pretty, but I do have electronics on it (my laptop on the desk often times).  I realize there is going to be wood dust in my garage fairly often, and I think I can deal with that, but I feel like much of it is coming from the desk itself.  It's also difficult to wipe off with a sponge or rag.  I've thought about doing a clear finish or some sort of laminate.  I'm not familiar with laminates, much. I also considered a sheet or some fabric, but since my laptop (which gets quite hot) will be sitting on it, I want the vents under it to be as open as possible.     What would you recommend I cover it with? Laminate, clear finish, something else?   Are there different types of laminates? If so, what should I consider when purchasing one? Appearance is NOT important to me at all.  This is a garage counter top and my garage isn't particularly pretty to begin with   I basically just want to be able to wipe it off and prevent splintering / sawdust.  Thank you much! "
246,Should I orient the cupped sides toward each other when laminating boards?,"I'm making a replacement press plate for a small apple press using some edge glued oak boards from a hardware store. The board was flat as purchased, and after acclimating to my shop conditions remained flat until I cut out the required circles. As I cut I noticed them bending away from the board, revealing pre-existing stress in the wood.    My intention is to glue these together into one thick plate, with the grain orthogonal to each other. The press metal pressure spreaders will be orthogonal to the grain of the top piece. I'll be using titebond ii glue with deck screws.  Given the use case of these parts and the cupping present, how should I orient the faces?   Cupped sides both down, up, together, or apart? "
247,Durable sled base material,"I want to make a sled with t tracks in it for rips on my table saw. Ideally 1/2"" thick if material permits. Max 3/4"".  I want it to never warp or twist. I also want the edge to be durable since it will be sliding along my fence. I live in an area where humidity varies greatly daily.  The only choices I've considered so far are plywood, MDF, and delrin.  I see my plywood warp regularly. My MDF also temporarily warps on humid days, where one side dries back out faster, plus the edges of mdf seem to fray a bit with wear. Delrin is really expensive, $80 USD for a 2' x 1' x 1/2"" sheet.  What should I use? What cost effective and easily machinable material can I use for a warp-free, durable sled base? "
248,How do I prevent static on vacuum hoses?,"Whether sucking up large amounts of sawdust at once or when attached to a tool, static electricity always builds up on my shop vac hoses when the dust passes through. This leads to messes on the hose and other annoyances. It can make emptying the vacuum difficult too.  How do I stop this from happening?  Can I somehow ground the plastic hose to something? I don't understand electricity enough to know how to do this. "
249,How accurate does 'square' have to be in your project? What is acceptable?,"Please provide some context, some helpful hints, and other information if you can!  I have two projects that are making me think this:     When you make frames with a homemade jig, it is often the case that the jig is at 44.8Âº through the center of the 90Âº.  You can compensate with this by making one cut on one side, and the other cut on the other side.   No regular person can notice this 'error' because of how you compensate.   I am making a bed frame.  Think of an 'H' with a top bar on it.   When cutting the mortises on the top part to secure it to the two verticals (middle bar is already complete) I clamped the top bar to the completed 'H' to measure it was square.   Did the measure 6 times cut once thing, and somehow when going back to dry fit, the top part of the frame isn't 100% square.   Im measuring 62.75"" and 63.125"" .    Obviously I am a bit of a perfectionist, but when I frame a house, I can make a 40' wall vertically square and plumb to less than a eighth"" before securing.  So there has to be some acceptable tolerances depending on the circumstances.  Is there a formula? a percentage? something else?   So what is your tolerance in your area of work?   How do you handle errors?  Know any tricks? "
250,What size pilot hole should I drill for for a specific size of screw?,I am trying to install a safe using 8mm coach screws (legislation dictates this is the minimum required size) into Jarrah.  What size pilot holes should I drill? Is there a standard reference chart? I cannot find one. 
251,Can water based wood dyes be mixed to be more opaque?,"I'm working on building a Les Paul style guitar, with a figured maple top, and am just trying to figure out how to do the finish, to achieve a nice sunburst effect.  I lack the equipment and experience to do the finish with an airbrush and tinted lacquer, so I've set my sights on using water based wood dyes to rub on, and then coat with clear aerosol lacquer.  These are the dyes I purchased: [website]Now, these do a pretty great job, but the one thing they lack is that they are very transparent, which is great for the center of the guitar, but I'd rather have the color thicken up a bit around the edges and get more opaque, hiding the natural wood grain a little bit more.  The General Finishes brochure I had for these dyes stated that they could be mixed with a clear finish to create a ""toner"". I'm not entirely sure what they mean by ""toner"" in this case, but I was thinking perhaps this was would be what I was looking for.. But I also don't know which clear finish I would be able to mix it with if so.  The important detail is that whatever I do has to be safe to use the clear lacquer over top. I had thought maybe I could mix the dyes with a bit of polyurethane to do a second coat of color around the edges before the lacquer, but I read that this could cause issues as the lacquer shrinks over time and the poly does not, increasing my risk of chipping.  So I'm looking for some advice on any techniques I can use to get this more opaque coloring around the edges, without removing my ability to lacquer afterwards? Are these dyes even the best choice for me, or is there another better alternative that I can use? (without the need to get an airbrush setup going - or maybe I really do need to do that to get the best finish?) "
252,How to re-finish solid oak cabinets?,"I have solid oak kitchen/bath cabinets, build in 1990s, which are generally in a good shape but the finish is not so much. They are covered with some kind of a satin clear finish, applied very thinly, and apparently no stain. I have no idea what exactly the finish is.  I'd like to re-finish them, without fully stripping them first. Can it be done at all? Can I just wipe something like wipe-on polyurethane on them? "
253,How can I match gunstock oak with pine?,"I have gunstock oak flooring and would like to match a piece of pine furniture to it.  Any ideas how to achieve this?    I'm open to liquid or gel stains, but would like to avoid veneers as it's pretty large.  Where possible, I'd like to avoid buying lots of different stains and mixing them by trial and error.

254,"Special considerations for a very large, engraved food serving board","Somebody has asked me to make some large shaped food-serving boards, about 600mm/24"" across, engraved with a catering company name.  I've never taken anything like this on before and I have the following requirements I'm unsure of:   Needs to be food safe, durable and easy to clean. I know that beech is a good material to use as I have a beech chopping board at home, but would it make it even more durable / easy to clean by oiling the board e.g. with mineral oil? Is this still food safe etc? Is there anything else I need to watch out for with this? I have no problem in general with laminating timber up to give large/wide boards, but do I need to use a special glue for use with food? Given that they are such wide boards and will be getting washed/wet do I need to make any allowances to stop the boards from warping, twisting, cupping, joints separating etc? I can easily insert dowels, or biscuits, or use a finger joint block to give increased surface area. Would it be better to use a minimum amount of timber pieces e.g. 3 off 200 x 600mm boards glued up to make a large 600x600mm board, or will it be better to use a higher number of narrower boards which are 600mm long, or an even higher number of boards e.g. 50mm x 200mm with some end-to-end gluing? Presumably this may help with stability, How long can these be expected to last if being used once or twice a week just for serving food, without being used for any chopping?   As far as actually machining / engraving the boards I have that covered as I have access to a large 5-axis CNC router.  Many thanks. "
255,Epoxy resin and wood movement,"I am considering putting an epoxy resin finish on a table top for a nice thick and smooth finish (it will cover the side edges as well).   Will there still be wood movement after the epoxy has cured?   What will happen if there is wood movement?   Will it bow the table top or split the epoxy?   The wood is red cedar and it is only finished on the top side. However, I am considering putting a couple coats of lacquer on the underside to help seal the wood completely. The tabletop is approximately 42"" x 84"" x 1.25"". This is the epoxy resin kit I am considering using.   "
256,"Should I finish before, during, or after assembly?","I'm building some pretty basic bookshelves. I intend to assemble them with glue. I also intend to sand them, apply stain, shellac, and polyurethane.  Should I: Dry fit, glue, sand, finish? Or dry fit, sand, stain, glue, shellac, polyurethane? Or some other order? In your experience what order leads to the least amount of mistakes?  Sometimes when I finish after assembly it's hard to get in tight places, or e.g. apply polyurethane on vertical surfaces without it thickening at the bottom, etc. It is also hard to sand in corners. But if I finish first it interferes with glue and I sometimes damage the finish. I can't find a good technique. "
257,How do I chisel against the grain without splintering?,"I've been practicing chiseling lately. I had to cut a corner out of a 3/4"" thick piece of pine and I was feeling good so I gave it a shot. The position of the corner meant I had to cut against the grain direction:    I made knife lines and sawed most of the waste out down to about 1/16"". I tried paring out the long side with a 1/2"" chisel starting at the edge of the board and working in (that's the only way I could get at it). Immediately the wood splintered along the grain below the cut line and I ripped it out:    If I seemingly have no choice but to chisel against the grain, how can I create a smooth cut without splintering/splitting the wood? Or, was there another way I could have approached this cut? "
258,"How thin is too thin for a large dining table top? Is 11/16"" too thin to properly attach to the table base?","I am going to build an ""X"" base style 8 foot dining table and I am going to use material that is about 11/16"" thick for the top.  The table will have aprons and I will be using metal ""z"" clips to attach the top to the base. I am worried that the top will be so thin that it can't hold all the weight when the table is lifted by the top. I am using SPF softwood for the top.   Is it common to build large dining tables with 11/16"" - 3/4"" material? Will the table top be able to handle the weight of the attached base? "
259,How to join short boards to make a longer panel,"I'm pretty familiar with edge joining boards of the same width to make a panel (for a table top, cabinet door, or whatever) but I've never done a project where I also need to end join short boards, and I'm a little unsure of what order I should do the gluing in. Basically, I found several fairly short pieces of african rosewood at a great deal, and I'd like to make a desk top out of them. I'd like the desk to be 5 feet long, but most of the pieces of wood are 2.5-3 feet long.  Do I first need to end join each board to get the overall 5' that I want, then glue those as I would any other panel? Or should I glue different length boards to the width I want, with uneven ends, and then keep gluing those until I get the length I'm looking for?  For reference, this is what I'm talking about:   "
260,How brittle is carbide?,"I have Carbide grade tools like router bits, saw blades, etc. like everybody else. There are grades C2, C3 and C4, most of my tools are C3. They do say that it is brittle and if it hits the ground or something it shatters. I have dropped it a few times by accident but they never have broken before. Which makes me have the question as to how much it takes to break the carbide of the tools. Does it take a certain amount of pressure (like pounds or something) of impact for the carbide to shatter? Or is the cracking so small that I have no idea because it is so hard to see? "
261,Should I use aluminum and copper to make woodworking tools?,"I can make aluminum tools here at home. I can melt metal and anything like copper to 2000 F degrees. Would aluminum not be a good idea when it comes to tools? I want to make a thing for a lathe like a flat edge. But with it being aluminum would it keep its edge on wood? Would it bend? What if I used copper; would it still keep its edge or not and bend like aluminum? I am very curious as to what will happen, and if it is a good idea or not. If not why is it such a bad idea. I know it will more than likely not last as long as steel on wood but does anybody have a guess? "
262,Use Baby oil instead of mineral oil on cutting boards,"I use mineral oil when I make cutting boards because it makes it pop. But I have not been finding any. Would baby oil be a good or decent replacement? Is there any other oils that would work, maybe even better than mineral oil? "
263,Adding a 'juice collection' section on a cutting board,"I have a core box bit and I would like to add a trench if you will around the cutting board abot 3/4"" in. I do not think you can do it with a router table and i know it has to be done with the hand router. How should I do it? The best I could think of was having a frame around it but there bit would be much to far in, and if I did make it bigger then I only risk the cutting board going flying in some direction and hitting the frame. I could just do it and then cut the wood but I do not want to waste the wood like that. What is the best way to do this? "
264,How to fix splitting laminated wood piece?,"I have a piece of furniture (a kind of chair) that seems to be made of bent laminated rails (if that's the right term). In a couple of curves the outer layers began splitting apart, as can be seen in the photo.    What would be the best way to fix this problem and stop further splitting, considering that the bends are under stress and will be flexing when the chair is used? Epoxy resin may not be flexible enough when cured. Are there other types of glue that might be used here? "
265,Can you fill cracks in the side of a live edge slab,I have a couple of live edge slabs I was planning on making into live edge end tables but I'm wondering what to do with the cracks in the side - if anything can be done at all.

266,Stair treads do not look smooth after sanding and finishing,"I recently bought a house and decided to remove the carpet from the stairs and install hardwood instead. To save money, I decided to buy unfinished stair treads and risers and to finish them myself. This is my first time with woodworking, so please bear with me here.  After researching on the web, I bought sanding paper, oil-based stains and polyurethane, and started working.  My first and perhaps only problem is that despite sanding for a long time with an ROS, the wood just does not seem smooth. The density of the wood seems unequal and I can see small gaps along the grain in some areas. Those areas are smooth to the touch when I run my hand along the grain, but not across the grain. See below:    Giving up on sanding, I decided to apply stain on the surface. The areas with gaps absorb more stain, and it actually creates a good-looking color effect. However, we can clearly see that the darker areas are ""rougher"":    Applying 2 coats of oil-based poly over this does not really fix the problem. It looks like light reflects differently on the darker areas and it doesn't look very good when placed under the light.  Is all of this normal? Is it because of bad wood quality? Did I just not sand enough?   Thanks for your help.  Note: the wood used is a smaller piece just for testing purposes prior to finishing the actual stair treads. "
267,How to make bottom for a big drawer?,"I'm making a set of amateur under-bed ""drawers"" from scrap. Nothing fancy, just re-using materials from old closet. This is my first project of such scale.  There are intended to be 3 quite large drawers, 130 x 60 x 18cm on the inside. Walls are going to be made from veneered particle board (16mm thick), intended to be held together by 2 or 3 confirmat screws on each side. Bottoms are planned to be made from 3mm thick hardboard.  How do a I make bottom rigid enough in the case of such large drawers?  So far my plan is to:   add 2 narrow crossbeams on the bottom (something around 60 x 5 cm), effectively splitting large 130 x 60cm area into 3 smaller ones - 40 x 60 cm. Having crossbeams pop up from the bottom by 1cm does not worry me that much.         |----------------------| rear |      ||      ||      |  front      |      ||      ||      |      |----------------------|            crossbeams     add grooves along all the sides and crossbeams (using router with 4mm bit) and slide hardboard into them.    |     | |    _| |   |_   grooves on walls where hardboard slides into |_____|    If that plan sounds okay, what distance from the edge does the groove need to be and how deep can it go into 16mm thick particle board?  This is an example of what I want to achieve (construction-wise) and what to avoid (sag and breaking):   (taken from [website]"
268,Is it necessary to cover all veneered particle board ends?,"Visible/accessible edges are trivial - we cover them for pleasant looks, durability and to avoid getting splinters.  What are the benefits/needs of covering unseen ends of veneered particle boards used in home furniture?  Waterproofing seems to be legit case. Some say the ends should be covered to stop formaldehyde fumes from spreading, is it true? What are other possible/justified reasons to (not) cover veneered particle board ends? "
269,Reinforcing/repairing a soundboard,"So essentially I was making a bowed lyre (jouhikko/tagelharpa), which requires a thin spruce soundboard. I am going to make it by gluing three boards together as shown in this YouTube video:  [website]Instead of just hollowing out a chamber through all three planks and slapping a thin board on top and bottom, I decided to thin  the top board down to the required 4mm to make the playable soundboard that would connect with the rest of the frame. However, due to a number or factors (plank was warped, I foolishly chiseled along the grain), the board became too  thin in a number of places and even cracked through in one corner. So the question is: is it still salvageable? I was thinking of eliminating the broken corner by drilling a sound hole through it, which would also stop the crack from spreading, same with other thinned places. Another option would also be to apply a sawdust and PVA paste to the thinned places to fill them in and make them stronger (the soundboard has to support 20kg of string tension). However, I'm not sure any option is optimal at all. It might hold at first even without reinforcement, but sooner or later one of the chipped places will start a crack. Maybe adding as many thin cleats as possible could prevent this splitting? I understand that the question would be more suitable for luthiers, but the situation here is simply finding a way to consolidate a spruce board that is too thin by filling in the flaked-out gaps or any other suitable approach. The treatment and its ugliness do not matter, since the repair will be on the inside- only the integrity of the soundboard. Thank you!

270,Strategy for Restoring an Old Rocking Chair?,"I'm planning on restoring an old rocking chair that has anchors holding it vertically from the sides on horizontal beams, and the beams are air nailed from the bottom. Recently, one of the anchors failed, and the rest of the wooden beams underneath the chair have stress cracks in them. I'm thinking that the best way to repair this is to cut new wood beams that have the same dimensions as the ones I need to replace. The only thing is that the beams are air nailed into the frame. Would taking a chisel to the gap in between the rest of the frame and trying to separate the beams from the frame be a wise idea? I can foresee some damage resulting from this, but if the only damage is to the beams I have to replace, this may not be so bad I think. Is this a good strategy for repairing the rocking chair?

271,What depth and offset from edge my dado / groove in particle board should be?,"This is a follow-up on this question (How to make bottom for a big drawer)? I have also read this one (What are the minimum, maximum, and optimal depths for dadoes, grooves, and rabbets) and I'm not entirely convinced it can be applid to particle boards ""as is"".  I'm making a large drawer - 130 x 60 x 18cm (on the inside) with 3-4 muntins (cross beams) in the middle.

Should it be still 1/2 of the thickness (8mm) or less, given particl-y nature of the material? How much should I offset from the bottom edge? I reckon 1/2 of the thickness (8mm) should be minimum as well, does it need to be even more than that?   Sidenote: I'll be using router table with 6mm bit to cut the dados / grooves, if that is any relevance. "
272,Minimum time between coats of Danish Oil?,"I'm refinishing an old spinning wheel and have one coat of Danish Oil on the wheel.  I NEED the whole thing finished and assembled by saturday morning and was hoping to get three coats of oil on it in total.  Is it possible to do two coats of oil in one day? I'd planned to leave 24 hours to dry/cure before sanding lightly and adding each coat but it was raining yesterday (and I have to work outside due to space constraints) so I let inconvenience and laziness get the better of me and took a nap instead.  So, as far as I can see, my options are:    do one coat tonight and be happy with two coats. do two coats tonight (one as soon as I get home and another immediately before I head to bed?) do one coat tonight and one coat tomorrow and assemble the wheel a few hours later.   What is the minimum time required for each coat to cure/dry enough to put the next layer on? I REALLY want to avoid it getting tacky as I have heard that can be a problem with danish oil done badly.   FWIW, I'm using the specific product ""Watco"". "

One of the two leg types I was considering was 4 ""post"" legs (3""x3""x29"") attached to a 1"" x 3.5"" skirt with two lag bolts for each leg. The legs will be set 1' in from the ends and 10"" in from the edges.  Will I need some kind of brace for the center of the table? Or will just the skirt + 4 legs do fine?

274,Hand Saws for Timber Framing,"What saws were traditionally used for timber framing cuts in British practice? British-style backsaws don't seem to have cut depths any more than about 4"", so how did they cut long tenons? "
275,What frame saw can I use to mill small lumber?,"I am wanting to do some small milling projects. I have pieces of oak and alligator juniper that are between 6 and 14"" across that I would like to try and cut into boards. I know I can build my own frame saw with some 2x2's and hardwar, creating a rectangular frame that the saw blade sits within, but I also saw this type:   Source: [website]The thing I like about this design is that I don't have to pass the frame around the stock, because the blade sits at the far end of the frame and can be rotated to cut at any angle (at least the ones I'm looking at buying can). So I can set the piece down and work it horizontally if I like. Does anyone have experience with this type of saw? Will they work better than a rectangular frame saw with the blade completely enclosed?  "
276,End grain mitre joints for outside,"I'm making bird houses and I have been screwing the joints together. I have been drilling a pilot hole (2mm bit) and using 3mm X 30mm screws.   I hung one in my garden and noticed that a couple of joints appear to be coming apart slightly after around a month or so. The houses are finished with Cuprinol Shades outdoor paint and the wood is bare before I paint (no primer etc).  Is there a more effective way of joining end grain to prevent warping/movement? Would gluing the joints, using larger screws, a smaller pilot hole or priming the wood first help to prevent this? The joints are 30 and 45 degrees.  "
277,"Is the ""paper test"" actually relevant to sharpening chisels and planes?","It is pretty common to see references to the ""paper test"" for checking for sharpness of an edge -- the idea that you should be able to lightly rest the blade against the edge of a piece of paper and it should ""bite"" by itself and easily slice through the sheet with hardly any pressure. For example, out of the box a disposable safety razor blade will easily pass this test.  Now, I'm a beginner at woodworking and I've been trying to learn to sharpen tools -- I bought some inexpensive Dewalt chisels a long time ago and more recently a Mora whittling knife to practice sharpening with. (I've got a Stanley No 4 plane arriving soon from eBay, as well.) After a decent amount of practice (using DMT interrupted diamond stones up to Extra Fine or 3M microfinishing film on plate glass to 15u, stropped on chromium oxide on leather in both cases afterward), I'm able to get them to pass a lot of other common sharpness tests:   Shaving hair cleanly (everything from coarse leg hair to very fine knuckle hair) Edge catches on the surface of your thumbnail without sliding No light reflects off the edge itself, no visible burr, no chips or nicks under a loupe Visibly reflective/polished looking bevel surfaces near the edge Edge feeling very sharp to touch with the pad of the thumb, and I cannot feel a burr on either side Edge feeling extremely smooth (like glass) when drawing the tip of your fingernail along the blade And most importantly, when cutting wood they leave a nice smooth surface, especially when cutting with the grain.   Despite that, one thing I can never seem to do reliably is make them pass the ""paper test."" Usually I get intermittent results -- sometimes the paper buckles, sometimes it cuts ""alright"", but most often it cuts a short ways but then stops or jams. It's definitely not as impressive as I've seen proper razor blades do.  Normally I would just say the only thing that matters is how they cut wood -- but as a beginner I don't really know whether I'm experiencing more resistance than I should, or what the shavings should really look like when you try to shave end grain, and so on. In the absence of using ""properly sharp"" tools myself I really don't have a feel for what I should expect from a tactile perspective or an ""end result"" perspective.  So, my questions are:    Should I actually expect to be able to sharpen decent quality bench chisels, plane blades, whittling knives, etc. to the point they can pass the ""paper test"" when using the normal bevel angles? Or is this futile just because of the bevel angles and thicknesses of the tools involved, compared to razors which are comparatively thinner and with more acute bevel angles? For a while I was sure the dewalt chisels just had crappy steel or poor heat treatment, but, honestly, the Mora which should have decent steel/treatment has similar problems. Even if I could, is it a useful indicator for the tasks hand planes, bench chisels, whittling knives, etc perform? Am I missing out on a ""final level of sharpness"" or is an effortless paper-cutting edge on these tools just going to be demolished after cutting through a few inches of actual wood, even with good blade material?   It would be tremendously helpful to know whether I'm getting myself frustrated over something that is either impossible or unimportant.  UPDATE: After actually actually POLISHING the bevel of this chisel on the chromium oxide-on-leather -- say like 50x eight inch long passes on the bevel and 5-10x on the flat (instead of just a very light stropping), the results have improved dramatically. I'm able to take very thin shavings off of end grain and it looks pretty smooth. Fresh off honing it will pop some leg hair although it's not 100% -- I'm wondering if my arm hair is just too fine? -- and it also does significantly better on the paper test, although not perfectly.  Here's what it does to eastern white pine endgrain:   "
278,Using a sheet sander vs hand sanding,"I have just made a picture frame that is 30"" x 9"" and 2.5"" from the inside of the frame to the outside.   I was just given a sheet sander and I am looking to sand the frame so it has a smooth finish but I am hesitant on using the sheet sander as I have never used one before. Would it be worth while to use the sheet sander in this case or would hand sanding be a better option? I do have a wide selection of sand paper available to me: 150, 220, 320, 400 grit  I am not looking to remove a lot of material and that's another reason I am hesitant on using the sheet sander as I have the notion that ""power tools = a lot of material removal"", is this the case or not? As I am a beginner into wood working any advice or tips would be very much appreciated on how to properly sand the frame!  "
279,In whittling how do you make the v-like cut?,"I recently picked up whittling and have watched several videos on how to do it properly. There's one cut, I can't quite recall the name of, where you slant the knife and cut down on two opposing sides and cut out a ""v"" shape of sorts. I had a couple spots on my piece where this cut would be useful, but when I tried to do it, I couldn't.  I'm wondering, is there a certain way you have to go with the grain? I'm pretty sure I was. Was the wood too hard? Was I too weak to press into the wood? Exactly what happened was I held the wood in my left and right hands and with my right mostly attempted to press into the wood at a curved angle. In all the videos the knife goes down and makes the cut. But it was like tryingt to cut steel with a butter knife.  I understand this is an extradorinaly difficult question to be asking, but I'm honestly curious to know if there's any reason someone could give me as to why I couldn't make the cut? Could there have been a problem with the knife angle? Blade sharpness? Grain? Did I miss something? "
280,Is there a better way to join these two boards for a platform bed?,"I'm pretty sure I have a good idea of what I'll be doing for the rest of the bed. For those curious. I'm wanting to make my own version of the DWR American Modern bed. The two boards in question are the main support board, which will support the middle of the bed slats, and a 1x2 toe rest to hold the mattress. The lumber will be either poplar or maple (I still need to price wood, and budget is unfortunately a constraint).  I'm planning on a 1x4 for the center board. It is green in the image below.    I am planning on applying glue to the end-grain faces of the board and then butting it to the pink main boards. I think I'll then use a Kreg jig to secure it with at least two screws per side. I do have a biscuit joiner; would it be better to use that? It would be my preference to use it. I'm just hesitant about alignment.  For the toe rest, I can only think of one way to do it. It is the green rectangle in the image below.    The toe rest will be 1x2. I'm planning on drilling the underside with a doweling jig, and then using dowel centers to mark holes on the end of the pink board. Is there a better a way?  I'm hoping that I can get confirmation that my plans for joining the two boards will work, if not I'd like advice. Thanks in advance. "
281,Time between enamel and shellac,"I have painted a guitar with Behr Marquee Semi-gloss enamel (Water based).  According to their website:   Dry time : 1 Hr Re-coat time : 2 Hr Cure : 30 Days   I want to shine it with Bulls eye shellac.  My questions are:    Do I need to wait 30 days before applying shellac or can I do it after 2Hrs, or 24 Hrs? I need to sand brush lines from the painted surface. How soon can I start the final sanding before applying shellac?   "
282,Why aren't belt sanders with sanding frames available anywhere?,"I'm not sure if this question is a fit for Stack Exchange, but I'll try to make it fit.    I bought a Bosch 1274DVS 10 years ago and I was able to get an accessory 'guide'.  The guide was a frame that went around the belt sander to help prevent 'digging' into a large work piece and helping keep it level.  My dad would like a belt sander with this optional guide, but my model is no longer available and last year I was able to find 1 that had it as an option.  I cannot find any right now.  While this isn't how people primarily use the belt sanders, I wonder why this VERY useful accessory isn't more widely available?  Do people feel confident enough to sand a large cherry tabletop unguided?  or are there other tools that have replaced the need for this?  Edit: Right after writing this question, I found the guides are called 'sanding frames'... "
283,When it comes to checking in logs what should I expect?,"They started clearing old ash trees from the lot where I work. There was lots of nice wood there so I took a couple pieces. One in particular a piece of green ash (so I was told by the man cutting it down) about 17"" in diameter.  I put it in my mudroom outside (for I have no where else to put it really). I don't have the time or the tools right now that I want to process this.   Checking in on my wood (just to admire it I suppose) I noticed after the first day that a crack was appearing through the center of the log. I thought it was odd but wasn't really surprised as that is supposed to happen over time.    It has now been a week and and went to take another look and I was surprised this time to see a lot of radial checking? (I don't know if it has a real term.)    So I am knew to processing and milling logs but I would have thought that should have taken longer to happen. That and the checking pattern is not something I have seen before.   Potential contributing factors that I can think of:   Recently cut Stored outdoors but in enclosed space. Temperatures are around 0 degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit )     Is this what I should be expecting when working fresh green wood? Should I be working this the second it falls basically to stop this. I'm worried (probably more than I need to be, if any) that if I wait to long its going to crack even more and reduce the yield I can get from this.  "
284,Can I speed up stain drying with a hair dryer?,"Can I speed up stain drying with a hair dryer or a heat gun?  Is there any reason not to?  If it matters: In my case Minwax Wood Finish or Varathane brand, oil based, not gel, referring to all coats including first (that's as specific as I want to get for this question). And by ""drying"" I mean getting it to the point where I can gently handle it without marring the surface or sticking to it, e.g. flipping it over to get the other side, not having dust stick to it (being able to brush it off without wiping off stain) etc. "
285,Sanding the final coat of lacquer?,I have a lacquered table top with some minor dust specs sitting in the surface of the lacquer. I don't want to sand it down and reapply more lacquer. Can I use a super fine sand paper (what grain?) to get rid of the dust without causing any issues? The surface is a satin finish so it doesn't need to be crystal clear.  
286,Why can't I shake my can of polyurethane?,"I was going to ask this question after getting some misleading information from my can of poly, other questions and answers here and from my own experience.  What I never understood was why I could not shake the can? The instructions from Minwax's website don't really explain why, but state:     Stir MinwaxÂ® Fast-Drying Polyurethane before and during use to eliminate settling on the bottom of the can. Stir in such a manner as to rotate the product from the bottom to the top of the can. NEVER SHAKE   emphasis mine.  Barring spilling the product all over the place; what am I risking if I shake the can? "
287,How to prevent table saw blade vibration gouges?,"I'm very new to table saws, and am having trouble getting a clean cut. The blade cuts fine most of the time, but every once in a while something goes wrong and I'll get a big gouge in the wood.  Here is a picture of what I mean, done on the thinner edge of a 2x4:    I've measured the depth of the gouge, and it's 15 thou. That seems really extreme, especially considering how smooth and perfect the rest of the cut is. This kind of gouge makes fine furniture impossible.  I know the table saw is correctly aligned; that's the first thing I did when I got it. The fence is parallel to the blade, and the arbor has practically no run-out. A splitter was set-up behind the blade, and the blade I used was brand spanking new.  Here's a video of me making the cut shown earlier, so you can see my set-up and feed rate:  [website]Anyways, from what I can tell, the blade vibrated/wobbled a bit and that's what caused the gouge. I could probably reduce the chance of this happening by cutting in several passes, but when I tried that before I still got the occasional gouge. Any ideas on how I can fix this? "
288,Wood Stabilization on the Cheap,"I have a couple of burls I've harvested from some trees on my family's property that will make nice turnings and knife scales.  There are probably some voids in there and the wood is probably a little soft or prone to cracking if I try to machine it.  Commercial wood stabilization systems are pretty dang expensive.  We've had a couple questions on what stabilization is and stabilizing green wood (that one not really related to my question), but no questions on how to do it cheaply.  Is there a more homebrew (read: cheap) way to stabilize wood?  I'm talking about the system where you submerge the piece in resin, draw a vacuum, and bake the piece to set the resin.  I already have a toaster oven that would work for baking the pieces, and I assume the resin is an unavoidable cost.  What I'm missing is the vacuum chamber. "
289,Is there a average depth that works best for book shelf?,"I am planning on building a bookcase and some previous attempts have resulted in shelves that are too deep for most books.  Is there a average depth that would work best?  For example would a 9 inch deep shelf fit for most books and standard paper (8.5 x 11)?  Update1:  I walked around my existing book collection with a tape measure and determined that 9.5"" inches will work for a) paperbacks b) average size other books c) binders.  Update2:  Another possible option would be to query the Library of Congress (via API?) to see what the average/median dimensions are for books in the past 30 years.  Update3:  I went with a 9.5 inch deep bookcase.  This works well for most of my books and optimizes the usage of the 4'x8' sheet of plywood.  Note:  Cutting 4x8 sheets of 3/4"" plywood on a portable tablesaw is very challenging especially when the lumber yard's table saw is broken! "
290,When did people start using plywood rather than real hardwood?,It seems like old furniture is usually built using nice solid wood but recently (from my perspective) there has been a huge surge of plywood use even in handmade furniture. When did this start happening? When did technology become available to make plywood?  Here is an example of this trend Plywood Table 
291,"Poplar- how do I get the whites whiter, enhanced grain?","so I bought a poplar guitar body. In the photo it looked white with a lovely subtle grain and interesting knots.  i receive it and its green. BUT in a camera phone it looks white (auto light balance perhaps)  I want to have the lightest parts bright white, but enjance the grain and maybe keep some of the darker green/purple streaks.  What are your thoughts?  (Oh and finish it with a non-staining oil or whatever, maybe lightest shellac or danish oil?) "
292,How can I make precise corner or notch cuts on the edge of a board?,"I am planning my first cabinetry project, and having difficulty with some of the shapes in my design. I would like to have notches along the edge of some large boards. There are two types of notches:   At the bottom of a board for the sides of the cabinet, the corner is cut in for a recessed kick plate. This seems common, and is clearly used in my kitchen and bathroom cabinets. I don't understand how to get a precise cut that meets in an interior angle. Along the front, wide but relatively shallow notches. This will allow a board running horizontally to be recessed flush with the edge of the board, as a front for a shelf (in green). I would like this board to span multiple compartments and not simply butt up to the side of the vertical board. I haven't observed this in other designs, but seems reasonable yet presents similar problems to #1.     Are there names for these types of cuts? How can I accomplish them precisely?  I have used my jigsaw or chisel for similar cuts on other projects. While I wasn't aiming for high precision on those projects, it seems too sloppy to achieve the precision for cabinetry.  I have just purchased a good table saw and router, and am a complete novice with them. I have thought about standing the board on edge and cutting in to get a clean cut, using a dado or many passes for the edge notch, but that seems awkward and quite dangerous. This does seem plausible with a sled jig assuming the blade can cut deep enough, but I don't have any experience and making one seems like a significant task itself!  Using the router might help, but would leave a radius on the inside edge that I don't want.  If this is simply a bad design, what are better ways to accomplish the intent? "
293,What is the proper way to sharpen a round plug cutter,"I do not know how I should sharpen this bit. Do I sharpen what I have circled in black black with sand paper glued to a piece of wood?  Or should I put it in my drill and sand the outside? I can very easily see both ways working, but I do not want to go ahead and make a potential mistake.     P.S. Sorry for the poor image, used my computer camera to get a quick pick. "
294,Can overusing a trim router be bad?,"I have made a planer table that uses a sled on top to use my router as the planing device. After using it for a good 45 minutes to an hour, my $60 Performax router is getting very warm.   Do I need to give it a break? Will I regret for life not giving it a rest because it shall just fry up?   I ask this because normally I would give it a break but there are some days when I am busy and need stuff planed and would prefer not to stop if I do not need to.  "
295,Affixing a dowel to the bottom of a piece of board,"I'm creating a desk from a file cabinet with a piece of wood atop it. I want to place a 1.25"" dowel on the left side so that it is more stable, but I don't think running a screw through the top will suffice.   Is there a piece like this photo, either square or round   which I can glue to the board and then glue in the dowel???  I'm flummoxed. "
296,What length screw should I use for a computer desk,"I am completely new to wood working and am currently designing a computer desk.  I do not know what length screws to use and the distance between them and dowels. Any other advice would be gratefully received.   I am designing in Sketchup Plan on using 18mm plywood Using 6mm screws 3.5mm pilot hole With 6mm dowels   Thank you in advance  EDIT: Was asked to clarify my problem and to provide a picture-  What length screws do I need to use to build a computer desk? Also what distance should I have between screws and dowels for best strength?  I have added dimensions and labels to the image hope this helps.    There is nothing fixed in stone with the dimensions as yet. I am thinking of adding some drawers just under the top, and will be adding support to the shelves. The cylinder shapes on the bottom left are for making holes in the plan for screws and dowels "
297,Routing tight edges/corners,"I'm making a name sign and had a ""duh"" moment after I started routing the edges.    Is there any way - or perhaps another technique that someone could recommend - to get the routed edge in these tighter areas?  Would a chisel be appropriate here? Perhaps a different tool/technique completely?  Along the same lines: how about getting a sharper corner on the edge (see green circles in photo below)?  Btw, I'm using a Dewalt handheld router.       "
298,Building a table for aquarium,"About 6 months ago, I built an aquarium wood table (stand). to build it, I used pine wood 0.63"" sheets.  for 5-6 months it was great, though few days ago I noticed that the top sheet that the aquarium is sitting on it - getting bent. I can't understand what is causing this phenomenon! I was thinking maybe the material wasn't good or maybe there's too much pressure on this sheet, so I'm thinking of changing this top sheet to an oak 1"" sheet.  what do you think about this problem? how can I solve it? I attach pictures. thanks in advanced for advising,  links to video and pictures of the table:   Youtube Link to Table review Picture No.1 Picture No.2 Picture No.3 Picture No.4  "
299,What is the best drill bit for MDF?,"I want to drill holes in MDF of varying thicknesses, laid out to sub millimetre precision. In other words, I need the positioning of the center of the holes to be accurate to within a half millimetre (0.5mm or 0.02 inch) or better.  My problem is that I can't decide whether MDF is considered a wood or a grain free composite material. So would it be best to use brad point wood bits with centre punched holes as in woodwork, or HSS bits with pilot holes as in metalwork? Or anything else? "
300,What level of inaccuracy is considered tolerable for a miter saw?,"I have a brand new skil 12"" double bevel compound miter saw. The fence is aligned properly - It creates a perfect 90% angle with the blade when set to 0 degrees. however, if I set it to 45 degrees on either side, it is actually cutting 44 degrees, meaning I have to set it to ~46 degrees to get a perfect 45 degree cut.  This is the first miter saw I have purchased, and I would think that for most projects this small of error would not really matter, but in this case I am making a large picture frame so having the sum of corners be 360 degrees is necessary.  Are miter saws expected to make cuts to accuracy of less than a single degree? Is there some other variable that I have failed to consider that may be affecting this? "
301,Drilling a hole in end of spindle,"What's the best way to drill a hole in the end of a short spindle (maybe 8"")? Mine is already turned and does not look like it would be so easy to clamp to. Is there a jig I can make to hold the spindle steady at the drill press? "
302,How can I cut a partial groove in the center of a piece of wood without going through the ends?,"Background  I got a new table saw and I'm about to start on a couple of project that require me to make grooves. I found a good tutorial to cut grooves for drawers and cabinets.  Problem  Now I want to cut some grooves into a sort of frame but I will not have a false front to hide the end of the grooves like a drawer would have. I need to cut the grove into the board minus about 1"" on each end. See example below built in sketch-up.  After watching several tutorials about table saws I'm starting to think it might not be the right tool for the job (between kickback and cutting my fingers off).     Question  What is a safe way to make this cut with a table saw (some sort of jig perhaps?) Or is there a better tool to use for the job? "
303,Can I run a router bit over its max RPM?,"A lot of router bits say ""maximum speed X rpm"". What will happen if I run it faster? Will I die? Will a portal to another universe open? Will demonic creatures, neither man nor beast, burst forth from the bowels of hell and spread chaos and merciless destruction throughout the land as angels helplessly look down upon us and weep for our souls?  What if I have no choice but to run it faster, what precautions should I take and what technique should I use?  For example, I am looking at a 1/16"" slot cutter with a stated maximum RPM of 16000, but the variable speed range of my router is 20000 RPM to 30000 RPM. Can I still use the bit to make the cut? "
304,How to determine if a router bit is safe to use?,"I recently started using my router table and read both here and on the net about router safety. That covered using the tool itself. Now reading the question about exceeding bit RPM I realize I never considered precautions about router bits.   Then looking at the link from this answer it brings other criteria to light:        use of an inappropriate router bit (in this case, a bit with wings too large for the shank)   use of a bit with a shank not long enough to be properly grasped in the collet   not marking the tool with the maximum permissible speed   not balancing the tool before use.      Inset photo from aforementioned link and article           Router bitâs wings are too large for the shank     Hopefully the answer is not just in the question itself, but what do I need to know about router bits to ensure they are safe for use with my router?  To clarify when I say ""my"" I don't mean mine specifically.   A related query, stemming from the caption of the above image Router bitâs wings are too large for the shank, is how do I tell if a router bit was manufactured properly?  "
305,Supporting a workpiece during staining / finishing without damaging finish,"If I am staining or applying any type of finish to a piece, and have to turn it upside down at some point or set it on something to dry, what can I set it on that won't mark the finish?  A limited selection of failed strategies so far:   Setting on pointy edge of aluminum angles - marks finish; or pulls a line off if finish is still tacky Setting on pointy edge of wood triangles - same as above. Setting on wood spacers - spacers soak stain out of piece, worse depending on what type of wood the spacers are Cloth barrier - cloth soaks stain and finish out of piece, sticks to piece Wax paper barrier - somewhat ok, often still pulls bits off of tacky finish or stain or leaves scuffs on finish   Everything I've tried so far either rubs or soaks up the stain and/or finish on the piece.  Even when e.g. stain doesn't seem tacky, if I leave the piece on wooden spacers overnight when I come back in the morning their are inevitably lighter spots where the spacers were and stain on the spacers.  Short of an antigravity chamber or strong enough magnetic field for levitation of wood, how can I support a work-in-progress without damaging it? "
306,Why is my countersink bit making hexagonal holes?,"Every time I use my countersink bit, it creates a hexagonal hole.    I've tried a hand drill, an electric drill, drilling fast, drilling slow, soft pressure, firm pressure - virtually every time it will create a hexagonal hole. Of the 12 I drilled yesterday, only one was round, and that felt like it was due to that being an abnormally soft area in the wood.  Is it the design of the bit? I'm sure the one my dad used when I was a kid had many more vanes.  Or is it something I'm doing wrong?  Basically, how do I get a circular countersink?  SOLUTION:  Tried out some of the suggested solutions last night, from L-R is:   Countersink before hole Large standard drill bit Hand-turned countersink   Countersinking before drilling the whole is clearly the best, at least for the plywood I'm using. The hand-turned bit could potentially work with a bit more care too; the hole itself is nice and round. Maybe needs a sharper bit.    (Apologies for picture quality)  UPDATE: I had to do a couple more last night, but forgot to countersink first; the hand-turned technique worked really well in the painted plywood, although it took care to keep it centred. "
307,Will black walnut dull my carving tools,"I've recently been offered some black walnut lumber for free. As a wood carver who does all of his work by hand, I'm intrigued by getting the chance to work with black walnut, as it looks like a very beautiful wood (normally I just work with basswood).  The thing that does concern me though is the wood's hardness. I've never worked with it before, and was wondering if it would be a wood that could be worked by hand? And is it the type of wood that is going to dull my tools so that I'll need to resharpen them every few minutes if I do? "
308,What is the best finish for wood in a bathroom,"I have nearly finished making a small table which will be placed in a bathroom. I am concerned about protecting the wood in a humid/damp environment.  The bathroom can get quite humid while people are having showers etc, and in winter it can take some time to fully dry out. I want to avoid any mould growth or other damage from moisture.  The table is made from softwood - partly reclaimed pine from an old patio door, and partly non-specific softwood from a big DIY store. I want to keep a natural wood look, so no paint or opaque finishes. Ideally, I would go for something not too glossy - a silk or mid-sheen finish.  I have had good results with Danish oil before, but for this I want something more hard-wearing.  I see polyurethane varnish used as the default finish for a lot of things these days. However, I find that (where I live anyway) there's a wider range of non-poly varnishes available than polyurethane varnishes.  Specifically with regard to protection from moisture, what are the advantages or disadvantages of polyurethane or other kinds of varnish? Are there any differences between oil based and water based varnish? Are there any other kinds of finish that I should consider? "
309,Building a Cabin; only un-powered hand tools. Need advice,"Recently I had a crazy plan. And I need some advice about how to go about doing it.   I wanted to build a small garden shed, more kinda like a cabin actually.  So I started drawing it out, and listing the timber I would need. But then I started thinking... What if I would build it by just buying a bunch of logs, and do it the old fashioned way?   Note that I live in Belgium, all wood needs to be bought from a nearby mill.   Several reason why I want to attempt this, but that doesn't really matter.   First thing first, the design!    Info about the design: it is 6 meters in length en 3 meters across. Top beam also at 3meters height.   The first thing I want to try is hewing the beams myself. Few questions: - I read somewhere it is best to use fairly fresh cut threes for this, to make the hewing easier. But how long do I need to dry them afterwards before using? If I just seal and use them directly will I risk the whole thing cracking and becoming askew?  - which woods would be suitable for this? I need to buy the logs, and thought about asking some pine, because it will be cheaper then buying maple logs. But are all pine threes suitable for this? Or do I need to specifically ask for lariks or Douglas? Or is poplar, or something else worth the extra price?   I think that I will first try my hand at the hewing, and then see if I (we) am up to milling the rest by hand also.  Note that I want to only use hand tools, and no power tools. Hewing will be done by axe. Other milling would be done by saw and axe also. This might seem crazy (it probably is), but there are several reasons to work this way.   Any more advance on making this project work would be welcome! I have some woodworking experience, and a number of tools (mostly hand tools).   Thanks for all advice!  "
310,Acceptable wood moisture content for epoxy?,"I'm making some I-Beams with glued &amp; screwed 2x4s. I just got my lumber home and it's fresh and green. What is an acceptable moisture content for System Three general purpose epoxy? If there's a range of moisture tolerance between epoxies, would there be a more suitable choice? "
311,Hitachi Miter saw slows down and stops while cutting bamboo flooring,"I just bought a new Hitachi miter saw.  I replaced the 24 tooth blade that came with it, with a 60 tooth blade.    When I started cutting the bamboo planks the saw would stop spinning midway through the board.  I will pull the saw blade up and it will get to full speed again and then I will try to cut the bamboo again and the blade will stop.    If I repeatedly cut and stop and then let the blade speed up and then cut and stop and then let blade speed up about 7 or 8 times I can get the board all the way cut.  This takes a long time, and was wondering what might be wrong with my machine. Anyone have any ideas?  The bolt holding the blade is super tight.    I am using an Irwin blade instead of Hitachi.  Could that be the issue.  The holes on both the blades seem the same.    Is bamboo that hard?  It seems like something is wrong.   "
312,Two piece workbench top,"I've finally gotten close to finishing the workbench that the kind people here have given me input on (Need help understanding workbench design and build process).  I currently have two top slabs, each made up of eight glued-up/laminated 2x4s.  I am still thinking about attaching them to the frame with dowels.     Rather than gluing these two slabs together to form a giant slab, would it be acceptable to leave the top as two separate slabs, and attach each with a dowel on each side? The portability and lighter weight of two top slabs would be a benefit as the workbench may be moved occasionally. If that's okay, due to the fact that the frame is 24 inches deep and the slabs each ended up being around 11.75 inches deep after planing and gluing, is it okay to leave a gap in the middle?  I've seen some benches with a trough in between two slabs, but never with a gap. Is a .75"" dowel an acceptable size to use in a frame member that is only 1.5"" wide, leaving only .375"" on each side of the dowel?   After I plane and attach the top, should this be left unfinished or are there acceptable methods of finishing to make the cheap pine look a little nicer and/or provide durability?        "
313,Are there any special concerns when finishing ambrosia maple?,"""Ambrosia maple"" is, as I understand it, a form of spalting caused when insects burrow into the tree and introduce a fungus. It produces darker stains through the light-colored wood, roughly following the grain direction, ranging from a few isolated streaks to a chaos of overlapping ""brush strokes"". The holes are also present, of course, to add a bit more character.  It's often surprisingly inexpensive for a fancy wood, perhaps because the standard grading system considers it a flaw rather than a feature.  One of the local woodworking stores got a batch of this, and I picked out a few boards I liked for a project. (Blanket chest, so I'm leaning toward one or two splashes of pattern per side, possibly with a more chaotic/denser pattern on the lid.)  Question is, is there a recommended finishing technique that will best display the color and detail of the spalted patterns? Or should I just finish it as I would any maple project, going light on added color to let the contrast be seen? There's also the question of whether to fill the holes with colored epoxy or leave them.  Some of this, of course, will be a matter of taste. But if there are any known tricks or pitfalls... "
314,What wood is not good to use in a cutting board?,"I have heard that there is some wood that should not be used in a cutting board because it can be 'bad'. I am not sure what wood is not good, but I guess some wood is poisonous and stuff. I use woods like pine, black walnut, cherry, oak, red oak, cedar, maple, hickory, and sometimes aspen. Are any of these bad? And if they are why are they? What should I look out for when making a new cutting board? Thanks! "
315,DIY Kiln Dry Walnut Plan,"I have a small Kiln used for pottery. I use it to melt aluminum for casting. I was thinking about building an enclosed space (like plastic sheet walls), putting that kiln inside to dry some walnut slabs. Would have fans at one end (same end as the kiln) blowing towards the stacked and stickered wood. Prob then have the opposite end venting outside to get rid of the moisture.   My question: would this work better than air drying (better means faster)? What temp would I want the enclosure to reach to quickly dry walnut without limited side effects?  Or is this all just a stupid idea? "
316,Weight bearing for a loftbed and wood only joints,"I'm planning on making a loft bed, and I now got a plan and I'm working on the details.     The measurements I'm going for is 1700(start of the top beam)x1700x2100mm. The main beams are 98x98mm, middle beam 98x48mm and the crossbeams are 48x48mm. I will probably use pine for the beams and spruce for the rest to  save some money. What I'm wondering is if this will hold the weight that gets on a double bed. I looked at this and some other, but they where all single beds and as i understand 98x98mm should hold a single bed just fine. Will these plans hold a double bed and does anyone know of a ballpark of how much weight it can hold?  So next question, I must say I've fallen in love with the thought of just using wood for the joints, no glue or screws. So I looked about and wonder if a 3-way Miter joint will hold? I understand it will be much stronger if I use glue and reinforce with screws. I will also add a desk and shelves to the bed, but before I get ahead of myself I wanted to know if my main plan would work. I mention the desk since it opens up for the possibility to add support crossbeams on the legs if that should be needed. "
317,Can miter lock joints be made without a routing table?,"I'm planning to build a structure of about 1.2m x 1m x 0.5m (specifically it's a 1:6 doll house) in 12mm (half-inch) ply and don't want to use internal square-section to support the corners, because this will encroach into the interior space.    I'm considering using mitre lock joints but the information for this mitre lock bit states that it should only be used inverted.   However, I don't have a router table, nor do I have space to keep one if I bought it.   So I'd like to know if there is a technique for using this kind of mitre lock bit without a table, for example with some kind of jig.  I expect that a device like the WoodRat would be capable of doing this, but it takes up almost as much space as a roter table, so I'm somewhat reluctant to go that way.  Can mitre lock joints be made (in plywood) without a routing table?   How?    "
318,What are these wooden posts?,"I am starting a tinker group for kids.  I have seen these wooden posts pictured in a number of tinkering setups, since they have pre-drilled holes and can be connected relatively easily by young children.  But what are they?! Someone I know said they are used in furniture building?      Thanks so much for your help! "
319,Painting a kid's bed frame,"I'm going to be building a bed frame for my daughter and would like to paint it. I want the finish to be durable (no chipping, and be able take some abuse from toys being hit against it), so am wondering what the best procedure is. I saw this similar question but that didn't indicate if the built-ins would need to hold up to abuse from children.  The bed will probably be plywood and pine or poplar. My thought was to prime it, then put two or three (as needed for proper color coverage) coats of paint (most likely Sherwin Williams). Does it need more coats of paint, any polycrylic or similar sealant, sanding between? Would glossy be preferable to satin paint? Anything else I'm missing? "
320,Easiest way to make 5000 cuts'?,"I want to make about 200 bracelets using wooden ""beads"" which I will cut from 9mm x 9mm x 2400mm square stock. I have 15 of these totalling 36 meters in length. Once I have profiled the stock, how can I cut it easiest? I cannot use a bandsaw or circular saw, the only power saw I have available is a scroll saw, I have access to hand saws, however. I need to make 5000 3mm slices, preferably within a few hours. I am unsure on the wood, however its very cheap so I assume pine, as the stock is cut from a larger board. What would be the best method?  "
321,How to de-emphasize grain in red oak shelves,"I'm preparing to finish new red oak shelves I've built in my kitchen. I'm planning to apply a color stain and I'd like it to have a nice, even finish.  I'm going for a more uniform appearance, with grain showing of course, but I'd like to de-emphasize the grain as well as the old / new growth.  Does anyone have any process suggestions? The more I read about it, the more I'm frustrated by the options, and I'm thinking about things like sealer, washcoating, grain filler, etc.    If you can make recommendations (types of products, not brands) I'd appreciate it too. I've read good things about oil/varnish blend and about wiping varnish. Any thoughts about the difference, or recommendations on what types of products I can use to even out the finish?  Of course I'll make multiple samples of all the potential processes, so if there are multiple processes and products to try I'm all ears! Thanks! "
322,Is my orbital sander fixable?,"[previously asked in Home Improvement, perhaps better here?]  I have a Bosch PSS230 orbital sander (1990's vintage I think) which has served me very well until recently when it made a nasty noise and some whitish-grey powdery lumps dropped out of the bottom. Having had a look at it it looks like the lumps were the remnants of some sort of cement/rubber 'linkage' between the spindle and the eccentric cam outer bit, from the gap indicated by the red arrow marked on the image.    Just wondering if anyone here has had a similar problem, and whether there is a suitable material (silicone, acrylic...) with which I can rebuild it? "
323,Gluing boards from big-box stores,"An answer to a previous question of mine suggested gluing two boards bark-side to bark-side in order to compensate for possible cupping. I'll likely be buying the boards at a big-box store (Lowes) and am wondering if the boards are really suitable for gluing as purchased? Are the edges flat and true and square enough, or should I do some cutting beforehand? I have a table saw and router (with table), and have seen some interesting jigs on youtube to square up faces and such, but would prefer to avoid the extra work if I can. "
324,Using thick branches to make an end-grain cutting board?,"About 2 months ago my grandparents cut down 80% of an old cherry tree (topped it). There were some big branches/thin trunks that ended up in their massive compost piles (my grandad like his compost piles...) I might also end up with a bit of pear wood as well depending on if they still want to top their pear trees or not (and the branch sizes)- would there be a huge difference in how I should treat the wood between cherry/pear?  I was thinking about grabbing some of the thicker branches (~4""-6"" diameter) and attempting to work them into an end grain cutting board/butcher block.  I've read about branches having internal stresses and twisting/warping. Is this a problem if they are cut into small cubes as appropriate for an end grain cutting board?  Since the pieces will be small pre-glue, do I still need to let the wood cure for ~1yr? (I've read that green wood should be cured?) If so, should I leave it in long square sticks to cure, should I just leave it sitting in the compost pile for a year or should I cut it to cubes and then leave it to cure for a while? "
325,How to fix water damage to wooden table,"I have a wooden table, which I accidentally spilled water onto yesterday. I thought it would simply dry, but a couple of hours later I noticed that the water had pooled on the wood and the surface under the pool appeared discolored.  I dried it off and noticed that the gray discoloration was coming off, so I scrubbed all of the gray off, and afterward the color looked consistent. Unfortunately, a few hours later I found that the area under the pools now looks completely different from the rest of the table.   My guess is that I accidentally removed the stain from the wood. I know nothing about this topic though, so I wanted to ask the experts:  What do you think happened here? How can I fix it?  A picture of the current state of the table is attached. "
326,"What part of a cabinet is the ""carcass""?","What is a carcass (or carcase)?   Does the term have general usages in woodworking outside of cabinetry?    A cabinet, for example, consider the American style one on the right:    If I remove the doors, face frame, and shelf, am I left with the carcass? What about the back panel, is that part of it? Is it even less than that? Can I remove the top and bottom panels and just call the sides + back the carcass? Does the type of joinery used (e.g. detachable vs. permanent) affect it? "
327,How could I have designed this cabinet to avoid assembly and alignment problems?,"I built this wall-hanging cabinet with a door on the front that opens upwards (plain old hinges on exterior face, not installed yet) (there's space on the back for a cleat, not super apparent in images below):    It did not assemble well. It is not usable. It was assembled like so; consider the following drawing:     I built the side and door frames. Pocket hole joints used for frame components because I had to assemble to chamfer inner edges before finishing, but had to disassemble to insert the screens after finishing. I cut the three panels and glued them together, just butt joint. When gluing I clamped around the outside in line with the vertical panel and inserted spacers as well. I then glued the side frames on.   The frames are pine and the panels are 7/16"" ply.  Now, I had designed, measured, followed the rule of cutting to reality instead of design, dry fit and dry fit again, followed all the rules I've discovered (make all same-length cuts at once without adjusting settings, all that, etc), but still I ran into the following issues:   The top and bottom panels weren't glued at perfect right angles. I had to apply significant force to hold them true when gluing the sides on. Gaps, somehow things weren't flat any more when assembled:  Panels were too short vertically, and it was inconsistent (some corners looked OK, others were way off):  Biggest of all, the door, despite looking fine throughout the whole process, was somehow magically a good 1/8"" or so too wide at the end, and with gaps on the sides:  Also the top panel was bowed downwards in the center, mostly as a result of the forces applied to the edges trying to make it straight when gluing the sides on; problematic because the hinges need to go there:    Now, I think the frames (sides and door) came together well, and almost all of the problems were due to various issues with the panels. I shouldn't have even proceeded to glue it up to begin with after noticing that the panels weren't 90 degrees. I also didn't do that one final dry fit. I'm not sure where in the building and finishing process I lost material on the panels. The frames are sized consistently with each other.  I have since cut the sides off, removed the panel stubs, and refinished the sides, so I have a second chance at this. I now have the frames, assembled and finished, ready to go again.  So my question is: How could I have designed this differently from the start (particularly joining the panels to the frames) that could have both avoided all these problems and also lessen the tolerances that I needed to cut things to?  And how can I salvage it given that I have the sides detached again?   As far as salvaging goes: What I am thinking is rabbeting the top and bottom of the side frames, and cutting a slot in the side frames for the vertical, and also cutting a slot in the top and bottom panels for the vertical. Then the top and bottom will be flush, and any slop / inaccuracies in the back can be hidden in the slots. And I won't glue the panels to each other first, instead I'll glue the sides and panels all in one shot. My side frames probably aren't flat any more anyways due to sanding so even if I wanted to butt them against the panels I don't think it would work now. Does this seem reasonable? The minor downside is just aesthetic; it will make the side frames appear thinner than the door from the top and bottom, and you'll see the rabbets with the door open. The other alternative is biscuits, although the plywood feels a bit thin for that.  How would you have built this cabinet, from the start, to avoid the problems? "
328,What methods could I use to round the edge of a thick board?,"Let's say I want to round the edge of a long board, something like the front and back of the desk I attached.     What techniques can I use to achieve this? It's obviously too wide to use a router (unless you have a 12-inch round over...), and it's much too long to use a bandsaw. How could you do this? "

330,"Choosing a saber saw for long blades (12"" and 18""). What does the maximum length specified in a saw depend on?","Some saber saws specify their maximum cutting length -thickness of the block to cut- for wood (or metal, or tubes...). Most of them are in between 150 and 230 mm (6 to 9"").   I indeed want to buy a saber saw to use it with these blades. There you can choose 300 mm and 450mm (12 and 18"") blades.   I need that length to cut some very high density foam and cork (the foam is also similar in hardness to cork yoga blocks). But I can't see any saber saw that reaches that length in their maximum -I'm looking for the specifications for wood as they are always the longest they support.   Do I need a very special saber saw? Shall I keep looking for a higher maximum? Any suggestion about models or where to find it?   Many of them don't even specify this maximum. What does this maximum depend on?  "
331,Freestanding Fence Post Support Size,"I'm a complete newbie to woodwork - please bear with me!   I'm trying to build a free-standing fence or barrier that will sit on top of concrete similar to this picture:    The fence I want to build is a bit taller - 6-8ft. How wide does the ""feet"" of the fence have to be to keep it from falling over in the wind? I'm thinking about putting support braces in the photo like the picture - do they have to be on both sides of the fence and what size and height does the brace have to be? "
332,How to make your own spalted maple,"It is very hard to get spalted maple around my area (from Wisconsin) and I want to make my own, if possible, spalted maple. I do not know how you can make your own though, because it comes from  dead trees with fungus growing on the wood or something. But I am sure there is more to it. Is it as easy as buying maple wood, then letting it sit there? Would I cover it or leave it? How long would it take? Is the wood ""treated"" with something even if it says ""untreated""? In the end my simple question is, how can I make my own spalted maple? "
333,Proper bit selection for plunge router?,"I have a router with fixed and plunge bases, and a handful of bits. I have not yet used the plunge base, but I will need shallow plunged cuts for my next project. Can I use a bit I already have, or do I need to buy a new bit?  Specifically, I have this set from Rockler. I am considering the smallest bit for this task.   I know that you cannot plunge a bit unless it will cut across the bottom. I don't see many bits that are advertised as specifically made for plunging, although many others do appear to have a bladed surface on the bottom.  These bits don't have sharp blades all the way in, but the shape looks like they would still remove material from the center, then flatten the bottom as I move. Are these OK to plunge? Is there any risk of danger or damage in attempting a plunge with an incorrect bit?  I have found a video using a drill to remove the center material prior to plunging in with a ""standard straight bit"". Clearly it works in the video, but I'm wondering as well if there are limitations or specific safety issues that I should be aware of before attempting it myself. "
334,Will PVA glue add some thickness to two and more pieces of plywood?,"I have 5' x 5' sheets of baltic birch plywood having a thickness close to 3/4"" at 23/32"" so it's missing 1/32"".  I want to glue 4 pieces together using yellow PVA glue.  I'm currently designing a multi-station workbench with 3""x3"" legs (3/4 x 4 = 3"") but since the material is 23/32 the total thickness would be (without gluing) 23/32 x 4 = 92/32 = 2 7/8 so I'm missing 1/8 !  However does glue add some thickness between the 4 pieces? I'm counting on the fact that it would result in getting close to an overall thickness of 3""... am I right?  Thanks!  Update:  Trying to fit posts with rails, all of them consisting of 4 pieces joined together. Each piece, before being glued together, is cut with the necessary shape for either a mortise or tenon.  This match is easy:   This one I am not sure:  "
335,Load Bearing of Legs and Wood Movement on TV Console,"I'm a relative neophyte to woodworking and just sketched the first project I'm looking at approaching  My dual questions are:    are the 1 1/1 inch legs enough to support the structure as drawn? How does a woodworker calculate load bearing for legs, especially  I have read a bit about wood movement due to humidity in an all, whole wood project. Do I need to account for this in my project or is that more restricted to items like tables/will my the components of my piece move in unison. If so, how would I adjust for that so I don't get a split?   Thanks!    "
336,Is sealing wood with urethane or the like enough to avoid wood movement?,Will a solid wood table top still move if it is finished from all sides with polyurethane or some other water resistant finish?  Does that depend on temperature as well? Assuming temperature differences are big enough comparing to when wood was finished (furniture left outside for example).  Is that calling for trouble in case of incomplete seal or when finish gets inevitably breached by normal wear and wood starts to take up moisture again? 
337,Tasmanian Blackwood - hairline cracks?,"I'm a newbie to this community and appreciate being able to ask this question:  Is Blackwood suseptable to hairline cracking across the end grain of quartersawn wood ?  I'm building a solid body guitar from 2 x pieces of very dry Blackwood blanks and after routing the body shape, sanded the body edge with 80 grit at the advice of a cabinetmaker, with the view to move up in grit to 320.   After a few runs around the body I noticed some scratches where the 2 quartersawn blanks meet on the bottom end of the body.   So Ive tried sanding them out with 120, but after removing a good couple of mm, I am doubting these are scratches from the 80 grit. They seem to just keep going into the timber.   Is Blackwood susceptible to cracking across the end grain ? The photo shows the area, the hairline cracks runs at 90 degrees to the Blackwood grain.  Thank you, Don  "
338,"DIY Farmtable, Gap in table seams, biscuit joints did not hold","About a week ago I took the clamps off a table I am making. I used biscuits to join the boards lengthwise and Titebond III glue on the biscuits. When I took the clamps off the seams looked great. Now, a week later, the seam in the middle of the table has opened up about 1/16-1/8 in and you can see the biscuit. I've tried to squeeze it back shut, but no luck. Any ideas? What about wood filler that I sand off? Or should I slip a hand saw in the seam, cut the biscuits that can be seen and add glue along the butts off the boards?  Thanks- Steve "
339,Materials and finish for an office chair mat?,"I want to build a chair mat for the desk in my home office which has high pile carpet. It gets heavy use and I'm tired of buying a new plastic one every year or so. The last one I got was from Costco and supposedly super heavy-duty. Cost was around $100 US, but it hasn't quite lasted a full two years.   The dimensions needed are approximately 50""x60"", no more than Â¾"" think.  What would be good to use to construct it? I'm assuming wood will last much longer, but suspect using solid lumber might be too heavy, although I've read good things about bamboo and it's fairly light (even if not actually wood). That leaves plywood, possibly hardwood-veneered if it would make it last longer (or be advantageous in some other way beside looking nice).  Since appearance isn't high priority, perhaps putting some type of commercial flooring on top be worth the extra trouble? If not, what would be the pros and cons of various finishes? Being able to refinish it easily would be a plus. "
340,Will this setup severely reduce the CFM from my dust collector?,"Just picked up a Grizzly G8027, after previously using a small shop vac + dust deputy cyclone.  I am, possibly incorrectly, assuming that I should be using both together.  So I am considering running the 4"" hose from the dust collector into the cyclone, and then back out.  That means I go 4"" to 1.5"" and again from 1.5"" to 4"" to attach to my table saw, jointer, etc...  UPDATE - It turns out I could also use a 2.5"" fitting instead of 1.5"" fitting (shown here, it's a tapered end on the dust deputy).  Is that any better?  Or should I get a trash can separator lid off of amazon?  So my questions are:   Am I reducing my CFM by doing this? Do I even need the Dust Deputy?  From what I understand the cyclone is great to use in conjunction with a dust collector to minimize the dust that makes it into the Grizzly bag Bonus: You see the hose I have.  I need something sturdy that I can use coming out of the cyclone into the woodworking equipment (4"" ports), which will facility a lot of plugging in / out all of the time.  Any ideas?   In these photos, please disregard the terrible 4"" connection into the deputy, I'm trying to find the right adapters at the moment =).    "
341,Should I joint my workpieces first or cut them to rough size first?,"I'm looking to build a couple simple picture frames. I don't have a jointer or planer, so would use my table saw or split-fence router for those operations. Even with those tools, though, it seems that running an 8' board over the jointer would be a bit difficult. Is it a problem to cut the 8' board into more manageable lengths (2-3') before jointing / planing them? I figure I'll lose any grain continuity I might have had by going this route, but that's not a problem.  Given that I will be using a table saw to joint the faces of the boards, it would be much easier to rip them to rough width (~1.5-2"") beforehand as well. Would this pose any problems? Will I wind up with workpieces that are slightly different sizes by going this route?  "
342,Compensating Rabbet or dado in warped plywood,"I'm building some 3x3x16"" long L brackets out of 3/4"" plywood. I'm planning on using a simple butt joint with a single rabbet and screws to attach the two pieces together.   The strips are all bowed/warped slightly. About 1/8"" over the 16"" length.  In my specific case, Without the rabbet, I could just glue, clamp, and screw the two pieces together.   If I try to rabbet the warped plywood, I'm afraid the depth of the rabbet will vary with the warping of the wood and then yielding   This could work for the rabbet as long as there is room above the fence for clamps, but what about a dado?   This seemed to work for a rabbet:   Question: How can I rabbet or dado a warped plywood strip such that the depth into the wood is consistent? Convex side up or down? What if there's a veneer/finished side and there's no option to choose which side? "
343,Vise Alignment/Mounting,"I'm almost ready to mount a face vise on the workbench I built, and it didn't come with instructions, but I see it has holes to attach it into the bottom and/or the front of the workbench top.  The workbench top is approximately 3.5"" thick, and the faces of the vise are not that tall.      Should I attach it from below, screwing into the bottom of the workbench, allowing the threaded screw and rods to be visible if you look under the bench, and also screw the rear face into the front of the bench?  This would make the tops of the vise faces a couple inches below the top of the workbench.  Would I then add wooden jaw liners that are taller than the vise faces to end up with a clamping area that is flush with the bench top?  Or, should I attach it by drilling into the front face of the bench top to make holes for the screw and other two rods, and ignoring the bottom mounting holes, to get the vise faces flush with the top to begin with?  It seems like a drawback here would be that if I need to plane the bench top flat in the future, I would end up with a vise now mounted slightly above the top of the bench. "
344,Replacing a 1/2 dowel with a 3/4 dowel,"A number of years ago one of the legs on our sofa broke off. The dowel holding the foot to the framed snapped. Now that I've got my hobby, I'm looking to affix the leg. I've drilled out most of the dowel in the keg and sofa frame, but it occurred to me that my 3/4"" dowel rod might yield a stronger leg then the previous 1/2"" whatever they used (looks like poplar or pine).   The feet are 2"" square where they connect to the frame, and about 6"" long, tapering to 2/3"" square at the ground. Not 100% sure what species of wood for the frame, but it's definitely not pine. Best guess is maple or poplar.  Would drilling the larger hole compromise the foot or sofa frame? How ""deep"" into each piece do I need the dowel to go? "
345,Is it possible to make a combination tool?,"I've seen add-ons for turning a dremel rotary tool into a router or drill press, though I question the soundness of its use for large woodworking projects.   Would it be feasible to construct a rig to allow a heavier duty drill press to ""flip"" under the table and function as a router? Or to rotate 90Â° to the horizontal and operate as a lathe? "
346,How is this large and intricate piece made with such precision?,"I'm not a woodworker, but my dad is pretty handy and he has lots of woodworking tools and machinery so I'm familiar with the craft. I recently stumbled across this incredible piece online and I'm puzzled at how it was made. The only machine I know that that can cut with both such precision and intricacy would be a CNC mill/router. Are there any more conventional machines that could also be used to make a piece like this?  Lastly, you would need a really big block of wood to make such a large piece- nothing like I've ever seen at the Home Depot. Is there a formal name for the ""big block of wood"" that you would need? And where could you find one?  "
347,Using a table saw in an apartment room,"I've began woodworking as a hobby a few months ago and so far I've been using just a circular saw, and all the cuts were done in the balcony due to the insane amounts of sawdust that it produces.  I've recently acquired a contractor style table saw and would love to start using it, but it's gotten so hot outside that I think it could actually ruin the motor of the saw and let's just say it won't be easy for myself either.  Anyhow, we might have a ""free"" room in the apartment soon and I was wondering about dust. I was ""warned"" about tiny airborne particles that could potentially fill the entire apartment and kill us all. OK, I'm exaggerating a bit (I hope), but anyhow, assuming the door is always closed and it's got that rubber thing around it to block noise, is it still dangerous?  I have a shop vac, as far as dust collection is concerned. Still, lots of sawdust is expected to come out through the top, so it's not gonna be perfect.  What do you think? "

350,Raw/Pure Tung Oil finish - seeping issues,"PLEASE: IF responding to this post, do NOT reply unless you know the difference between Raw/Pure/Unadulterated Tung Oil, Polymerized Tung Oil, and what is marketed as ""Tung Oil Finish"" -- or tell me why Raw/Pure Tung Oil is bad, and other finished are better, or to sand everything off and use Poly or Varnish instead. I have used Raw/Pure Tung Oil (100% Pure Raw Tung Oil from Real Milk Paint company) MANY times with great success, and this is my first problem. I am mid-way through this project, and am only interested in replies from those with EXPERIENCE with Raw Tung Oil that address what I should do NOW to fix it.  I'm finishing a table with Acacia/Rubberwood butcher block type top and it seems that the large pores of the Acacia are giving me trouble.  I followed the usual steps I always do: flooding with 50/50 Tung/Citrus Solvent for the first application, 75/25 for the 2nd, and about 85/15 or 90/10 for the third.  The second and third coats I also wet-sanded the oil in using 0000 Steel Wool and then wiped the sludge away thoroughly.  Between each coat, I wiped all excess oil off and waited for at least 4 days in between each. It took much longer to dry than I've ever experienced. But I know each coat was DRY (not of course CURED) -- because between each, I sanded lightly with either 220 sandpaper or the Steel Wool, and the dust was a fine white powder - no gummy residue, indicating it was dry enough to add another coat.  (I live in FL, but I have the table inside where it is normally air-conditioned to 76 degrees, so the humidity is NOT high. To aid in the drying I turned the AC down to 72 so the air would be even drier.)  After each coat, I noticed that the oil was continually seeping out of the pores, so I was wiping it off about every 15-20 minutes for the first 8-12 hours, and then several times a day for the next 2-3 days. Again, I've never experienced this before, and I'm sure it has to do with the large pores of the Acacia.  Still, the first 2 coats went on fine and were completely dry before applying the next coat.  On the third application, I kept wiping and buffing as usual, and all was fine until the third morning when I checked it, oil had seeped out overnight and DRIED, so now there are dozens of tiny spots that are glossier than the rest of the table. They're not white -- just glossier than the rest of the table -- and you can only see them if you look at the table close to eye level in certain light, but the table is not as smooth where the dried oil is.   In an attempt to fix, I tried sanding with 0000 Steel Wool and then wiping down with pure Citrus Solvent - and then it was like a dam broke, and oil was seeping out of the pores all over! I was able to wipe that away, but the previously dried spots are still there - the steel wool and Citrus Solvent didn't touch them. Also, the Citrus Solvent seemed to dry out the rest of the table and make it duller.  On a small section of the table, I tried using a 3M white Final Finishing Pad (which is like a Scotchbrite ""scrubby"") and a bit of Tung to see if that would break up the dried spots, but that did nothing.  My plan was to do 1-2 more final coats, this time of 100% pure Tung - no Citrus Solvent. However, I don't want to do that until I know the best way to proceed.  Should I wait for several weeks to make sure the oil IN the pores is fully cured, and then sand and do a coat of pure Tung Oil, wet-sanding in various steps from medium to fine, to try to get rid of the spots?  Or, if I wait for it to thoroughly dry, and sand, and then just apply the pure Tung, will the Tung eventually build up so the rest of the table is as glossy as the spots, so it won't be noticed?   Or, if I wait for several weeks and apply Polymerized Tung -- which has a glossier finish -  will that bring the rest of the table to the level of gloss of the pores, making it uniform? I've never used Polymerized Tung before.  I really do not want to sand everything off and start over.  Any advice would be appreciated!  Many thanks, "

I also have all kinds of glue, I was able to recover some parts of the MDF that came loose (I have sawdust, I have access to scrap paper (for paper pulp), I have similar veneer, I have similar stain, and I have a few other relevant tools for the job.  Planned Approach   Fixing the MDF: I'm planning on mixing a glue/sawdust/wood-filler/mdf/sawdust mixture up, clamping the board in place, applying the glue, letting the glue dry, removing the clamps and board, and then sanding it down. Fixing the edge: If it looks good; I won't veneer it over. However, if it's bad, I'll sand it all down, and then apply new veneer. After the veneer's applied, I'll finish it. Reapplying the casters: For this step, I'll just put them further towards the front slightly, maybe an inch or two depending on what I need. This will be done to ensure the casters are secured.   Clarification on the question &amp; Answers I'd like  Clarification My main question is with regards in the wood filler used. The bottom panel of the cabinet is maybe 3/4"" thick, and of that 3/4"" maybe 1/8"" or 1/16"" is affected by the missing mdf. I want it to be smooth when I remove the clamped board, so that minimal wood filler sticks to it. I.E., when I remove the board I don't want to take any MDF with it.  Answers I'd like  Is there a specific kind of filler that would set well? If so, how much sawdust do I use?  Thank you friends! "
352,How to properly deburr a chisel,"I'm struggling getting my chisels as sharp as I want them to. For example, they ""catch"" on almost all woods and by no means cut any hairs from my arm.  I've bought the plans and built John Heinz's sharpening jig which took my sharpening to the next level and they are much sharper than before... but still not quite there.   The one part in the sharpening process that I'm struggling with is removing the burr. As I'm attempting to deburr one side, it twists and goes to the other. I flip the chisel and the burr twists to the other side again. I can't seem to completely remove it. Some people lay the chisel flat on the stone and push against the edge. Others pull. Others go sideways. They all claim their method yields great results (I can't seem to get rid of the damned thing).  Here's what I did (all with john heinz's jig):   Sand the backside flat with 110, 220, 400 grit. Change to DMT diamond stone and go at it with 600 (25Î¼) and 1200 (9Î¼) grit equivalent. Do the same thing with the primary bevel. Do the same thing with the secondary bevel.   Here's a pic with the before (right after I bought it) and after all this process. Note: the weird shape is due to the photo angle; the actual chisel is perfectly square.    Other people on this site insist that going to 8000 grit is required. Others say that 800 + honing is more than enough. I haven't tried honing my chisels still.  Is there anything that I'm doing wrong? "

358,"Build a grid out of vertical, thin wood bars","I want to create a grid out of thin wood bars (slats?), where the slats cross each other on the smaller side, like in this sketch:   I would install LEDs in this grid, so it doesn't need to carry any external weight and the wood slats can be pretty thin. The grid would have a height of about 3-5 cm (1-2 inch) and a length of 50cm (20 inch).  I was thinking about sawing in the slats half way so I can stick them into each other:   What is the best way to do this? I was thinking about using a saw blade that is wider than the slats are thick â so each time I would just have to saw in once and that would be it. Obviously I would need pretty thin wood slats in that case (a few millimeters of MDF maybe?). Is this possible? Feasible?

359,Best way to drill a concentric hole with a lathe,"I'm new to turning and recently decided to make some pepper mills.  Starting with squareish stock I roughed the pieces to round and then started drilling several concentric holes of different sizes using forstner bits on the lathe.  Somebody gave me the feedback that I should use the largest drill bit first and not to drill any pilot holes.  In other words if I need a 1.5"" through hole and a 2.5"" hole at 1"" depth then I should drill the 2.5"" hole first followed by the 1.5"" hole.  This flies in the face of everything I've been taught, but the explanation was that the forstner bits do better without large pilot hole (e.g. from another forstner bit).  In any event I was able to drill the holes into the work pieces, but as I did this I noticed that the drill bit appeared to be wobbling rather substantially (it looked like the work piece was ""pulling"" the bit such that it wasn't always inline with the axis of rotation.  I assume that this is because the drill bit didn't enter the piece perfectly inline with the axis of rotation though for the first ~1.5"" I couldn't tell and it looked good).  This was especially true when I used a drill bit extension to get the depth I needed (I started swapping in the extension only when I needed it rather than starting with it for deeper holes).  After I drilled the holes I used a cone/chuck to hold the piece in place for sanding/finishing.  On several pieces I noticed that the through holes were not concentric with the outer surface of the work piece.  In other words when I'd pull the spindle off the lathe I'd notice that the through hole appeared to be at a slight angle relative to the outer surface.  What's the best way to drill a hole that is ""perfectly"" concentric with the outer surface of a work piece on a lathe?  Is it better to drill first and then rough/round?  Should I in fact be using a pilot hole?  Am I not securing the piece in the chuck properly prior to drilling?   "

361,Is the wood worm active or not?,"I live in India [tamilnadu]. Recently we are building our new home with wooden frames for the windows and doors, but the wood being used contains strange markings. When asking the carpenter about it, he reported that they were the rings of the tree. Typically I don't trust him because it had small holes within them. The wood being used is country wood [African] which the carpenter bought for making the frames and doors. I've attached the photos taken around most of the places where I find them as bug active zones.  For my satisfaction, I went to many places to verify whether it's worm active or bug affected. Something like that. I got a 50/50 answer, half I consulted said it was active but half denied it.   Please do suggest, is it good to continue with this wood or else what would be the solution to render it? I'm grateful to have an answer.

362,How to clean and maintain my table saw top,"We obtained this very nice JET table saw a while back but the surface had gotten some water sitting on it and started to get a rust spot. Unfortunately,  someone got a bit overzealous and thought it would be a good idea to use a chemical rust remover. This did remove the rust mostly,  but it also seems to have damaged the surface. Perhaps there was a coating it removed.  Now it is discolored,  streaky, spotty, and seems to rust easier.     How can I safely clean and restore the surface? How can I maintain it?   EDIT:  This is it after a very quick use of Naval Jelly and SC Johnson Paste Wax (which I was only able to buff in, not able to let is sit and melt on due to temperature) as @popdan suggested:  "

364,Are systainer tool cases of different companies compatible with each other?,"My router came in a plastic tool box called a systainer.  It is made in a way that the bottom could interlock with the top. this means I could stack multiple of these boxes and lock them together for transport. I thought that this is a way to convince me to buy more tools from the same manufacturer.  But recently I noticed that the tool boxes of a professional carpenter from festo look similar and I wondered if they would be compatible with mine. In a store I that visited today I saw that tool boxes from hitachi had a suspiciously similar shape and locking system.  Are all these boxes in fact the same box system that different manufacturers use? Is this some kind of open standard like screw heads, bit diameters, etc.? Are the systainers from different brands compatible with each other? What other ""features"" does a systainer have? "

367,How can I finish a piece consisting of multiple species to yield an overall cohesive appearance?,"So a long time ago I inquired about a project regarding a board game table. Well, we planned it out, scouted the wood, bought it, cut it up, and now we're on assembly!   For the outer visible portion of the table I have this beautiful red oak.

Source  The one advantage that commercial parallel clamps have over these is that the clamp faces will always line up; with the Bellevue Woodshop design it is possible to rotate the moving piece so the faces don't line up.  My thought is to glue a small rectangular strip of wood under the pipe along its entire length, and cut a corresponding space (keyhole?) out of the moving part of the clamp. Is this a reasonable solution? Is there another way to prevent the clamp from twisting? Or should I reconsider trying to prevent this twisting? "

373,What's a good way to cut a board parallel to its face?,"I have some thick boards that I'd like to make thinner.  Generally I would thickness plane the board, but in this case I'd like to reduce the thickness of the board by about half (e.g. from 2"" thick to 1"" thick or 1"" thick to .5"" thick).  Thickness planning would be a real waste of material in this case.  Is there a good way to cut a board parallel to its face such that I end up with one board of a desired thickness and another board of the original thickness - saw blade width - desired thickness?  What kind of surface finish can I expect on the new face of the two resulting boards?  The boards in question are roughly 8"" wide.  I was thinking I could use a band saw with a fence, but this seems pretty sketchy since the blade isn't rigid.  Can you slowly raise the blade of a table saw and use a high fence to accomplish this (doesn't seem very safe)? "
374,How can I deal with wood from DIY stores that is crooked and may or may not be dry?,"I've been meaning to build a desk for a while now. I made a design with millimeter accuracy, but when I went to the home improvement store, I found that all the beams they had were crooked! Some more than others, but the only non-crooked wood they had was chipboard (particle board in the US), but it didn't come in any shape I needed.   So, back home I did some research on wood. It appears there are several different types, most importantly regularized or unregularized. Basically one is allowed to be crooked, the other isn't. I couldn't find any exact specifications though as to what qualifies as straight (surely, no beam is perfectly straight, right?).  Another important bit I stumbled over is that some regularized wood is not completely dried out: does that mean it could become crooked over time?  Then I looked into straightening the wood, but this doesn't seem to be a very viable option unless you're building a porch or something.   I went back to the store and asked if they had any regularized and dry wood. They didn't know what I was talking about. Just pointed me towards the piles of planks and beams and said it's really good wood!  TL;DR   If wood is ""regularized"" and not dried, could it become crooked over time? How can I tell if wood is completely dry or just sort of dry? If I were to find some unregularized wood that's reasonably straight, would it most likely stay that way? If I were to find a suitable shape of that wood that's made of chipboard, is that a viable option? I've only seen it in cheap furniture, mostly where a chip has broken off from what used to be a screw hole.  "

378,Bad technique vs inadequate equipment for beginner woodworker,"This may be a bit too broad for this site, but I hope that it's specific enough to stay. If not, I'll close it.  I started on a project this weekend, and some (most) cuts on the table saw did not go as well as I had hoped. The edges show burning, the cuts aren't straight or true, the wood didn't feed smoothly, and I could feel the table saw tipping a bit towards the end of a cut.   I was cutting 1/2"" and 3/4"" plywood (blondewood from Lowes), had Lowes make a few cuts to get it into more easily-managed sized pieces, and had my father-in-law helping to wrangle the wood during the cut. I ripped a 1/2"" off a 76"" long, 40"" wide piece of 1/2"" plywood, and cut a 40""x56"" piece of 3/4"" down to 35 1/2""x37 1/16"". My tablesaw is a 10"" Craftsman Evolv, which has a ~24""x18"" table, with the blade approx 10"" from one side and 14"" from the other.  So, my overall question is: is it poor technique leading to those problems or is my tablesaw not up to the job of ripping down larger pieces of wood?   Some related follow up questions: is it just that my blade needs a cleaning or sharpening? Or maybe I need a different blade (I'm using the stock 24T blade it came with)? Should I not even use the tablesaw for breaking down plywood, but a circular saw instead (I had similar burning problems previously with my circular saw)? I suspect that the tabletop is just too small to work with big pieces of wood, but short of buying more wood to try it, I'm not sure. "

380,How effective are different types of saw blades for various cuts and woods?,"There are different types of saw blades (e.g., rip, cross-cut, combo - based on number of teeth, edge, hook angle, etc) of saw blades for different types of cuts (rip, cross-cut, etc). How effective are these blades for each of the cuts?   There's a related question which gets into the difference between a rip and cross cut, but I'm more interested in the practicality of using a cross-cut blade for a rip cut, for instance, or how effective a combination blade is when cutting plywood. That question touches on this subject, but really only for a rip blade on a cross cut (which is bad).

However, some are cracked.  Some of the cracks are from being nailed through the (thin) top, which I won't do.  Others, though, have running cracks in the 'body', not apparently due to nailing.   I wouldn't use the cracked ones; but, I'm concerned that the cracking might indicate that all the boards are apt to crack, and shouldn't be trusted.  Also, would further splitting just/mostly be a result of nailing?  Because, I can pre-drill the nail holes.  Update: I used them.  No splitting.  In fact, it went a lot better in that regard than new finger-jointed clapboards - the old ones were very forgiving. "

I have the price list from my local hardwood dealer:  and there are several terms / abbreviations there: L/C, V/C, PS, RC, A-1, D-3, etc. Depending on the wood species, there's only 1 option to choose from (like Cherry), so if I want plywood with that veneer, I have to get that grade / quality / whatever, or go elsewhere. But, if I'm looking for e.g., Baltic Birch, I have 2 options (4B and 3B), or if I want regular Birch, I can choose B-2 V/C or A-1 L/C.  What do these terms / abbreviations mean, and when would I choose one over another? Are these standardized among hardwood dealers, or will they all have their own system?   "

I feel as if I've researched the names and techniques for what kind of gear system to implement, but I need the experience of someone with knowledge of the subject to help me finalize my decisions.   Here is my design:     My questions pertain to the gear and crank system.   1 -The shaft in the design is 56"" long. The shelf will hold approximately 30 pounds of equipment. What thickness should the shaft be?  2 - For mounting the shaft, I'm currently looking at these:  Hub City FB260URX1/2 Flange Block Mounted Bearing - *can't post more that 2 links yet...  I'm just looking for verification that this is appropraite for my needs.  3 - Based on my research, the gear system is called a Rack and Pinion, but I'm having trouble figuring out what specifically the size and type of gear I should buy. Can someone provide a reference of something that would work for this set up?  4- Lastly, I need advice on how to mount and secure the crank and gears to the shaft. Will some sort of locking collar work? Or do I need something else? I am currently looking at these: Climax Metal 1C-100 Steel One-Piece Clamping Collar - *can't post more that 2 links yet.  That's it for now. I'll edit if clarification is needed.  "
391,How should I go about restoring rusty clamps?,"I've inherited about thirty or so clamps that I'd like to restore. Except for some rust and a some missing plastic/rubber pads, they work great. The clamps include a bunch from Bessey and ShopFox that I'm especially fond of.   The biggest problem is the rust. So far, when I've used them I just put a spacer in between the work piece and the clamps, but I'd like to not have to do that. Additionally, I'm worried that the rust is going to continue to spread. And of course, there's the vanity aspect -- I'd like my tools to look as nice as they can.  These ShopFox clamps are a decently representative sample of what I'm facing:      My first instinct is to take the clamps apart, but they aren't built to be serviced. They seem to have some sort of rivet at the bottom of the bar that prevents the movable jaw from falling off. The smaller clamps also have a rivet holding the fixed jaw in place. The larger clamp in the picture doesn't have a rivet holding the fixed jaw; I'm not sure what is keeping it on or whether I can get it off.  I'd like to clean up the rust on the bars. For the smaller clamps, I could sand as much of what I can see easily enough without taking them apart. But I'm not sure if that would mess up the finish of the black bars? For the larger clamp, there are serrations on the bar, and I am not sure what I should do to remove the rust on that. Naval jelly? Something else?  My primary concern is the rust, but sometimes I go overboard on projects like this, and so I'm also wondering what kind of paint would be appropriate to touch up the jaws. I'm not sure I want to go that far. But on the other hand, once I've gone to the trouble, sometimes it's nice to go the whole way. Also, is it possible to buy replacement pads for the jaws, or am I out of luck on that? "
392,Setting up a new table saw blade,"I just got a new table saw blade (Freud 50 tooth combination, thin kerf) to use on my portable / contractor saw (blade was almost half the price of the saw!). Is there anything in particular I should do to the saw or blade before I begin cutting? I figure I need to check the angle and make sure it's perpendicular to the table, but anything else?  "
393,Can I stain damp plywood,"I managed to rescue some 3/8 interior grade birch plywood I had sitting outside from a surprise rain storm last night but not before it took some water. I had been planning on staining the pieces today.  Around here 12-18% emc is about normal. It is hard to tell if the wood is damp by feel because it is cool and humid today, but the edges exposed to the rain are at about 45%.  My question is: Do I care? The surface appears dry by look. Should I wait for this to all dry out another day or two or can I just go for staining it and trust it? I really want to get this done today.  Its a Minwax oil based stain, water seems to bead up on it while it's drying, so I guess has at least some sort of moisture trapping effect, could staining it while it's damp also affect the longevity? I plan on finishing it with helmsman spar urethane after staining. "
394,How to build a picture frame?,"As a first project I would like to build a picture frame. The picture frame I want to build is 24""w 1""d 21""h.   I do not have a table saw and for some unknown reason I am scared of them. So using a table saw is not an option for me at this point. I am planning to use a hand saw (with miter box) and router. I was hoping to be able to find 1â x 1â square dowel. Remove enough material with the router to be able to install the plexiglass.   Am I approaching this project the right way? Where can I find 1â x 1â square dowel (it would be nice if it was walnut). The frame in the picture below is walnut. What kind of finish did they apply?   The frame I would like to build would be similar to the one below. Thank you for your help/comments!   "
395,"Need a new router collet , or bit?","I use my router in the router planer. It has been through a lot of use and I use 2 different bits for planing. Both are 1/2 straight bits. Recently they will start to fall out if I went to fast, even if it wasn't working hard. But does necessarily mean the collet is shot because these were cheap bits off of ebay (did not want to use good bits for the job). By cheap I mean about $2. I was careful to make sure they did not explode in my face. Could the shanks be smaller than 1/4 like it clams.   Is it worth investing in a more expensive bit. Or thinking the other way is it the collect? I would not think it would wear but I may be wrong I guess. If it is and I can not find a new one, could I use a piece of paper around the shank of the bit to help get a better grasp? I really do not know what is happening. And I am tightening the bit as good as I can go, maybe a little to much. So anything would help right now, thanks. "
396,What does a cyclone for a shop vac do?,Some people add these cyclone things to there shop vac and is wondering what it does other than adding space and watching the wood go in circles. My best guess is it takes the bigger chips of wood and it falls in the cyclone but the dust goes to the vac. Or it somehow allows the shop vac to run longer? If there is benefits would it be a nice accessory to get? 
397,How do I carve an inset circle?,"I have a circular piece and wood and want to carve a circular 'inset' in the middle - roughly 1-2cm deep (so that there are 'raised' edges all around a 'depressed' middle). What tool would I use to accomplish this? Am I looking at using a dremel? Novice woodworker, so forgive a probably-obvious question.    In the above, the black section represents the area I would want to cut out. "
398,When to retreat linseed oil finished wood placed outdoors in moderate rainy climate,"We have a couple of wooden bee hives with metal roofs. We have treated the exterior faces of the hives with raw linseed oil, three coats. It has cured nicely, as far as I can tell.  What we're wondering about it is when we should retreat the wood.  Are there any telling signs to look for, like dryness of the surface, or discoloration of the wood?  Are there rough estimates for when (vertically placed) outdoors wood should be retreated?  This particular example is in Bergen, Norway - lots and lots of rain, quite humid climate. "
399,"Shelves inside cupboard, how to attach to legs?","My bathroom has a small cupboard/closet built into the wall, and I'd like to put some shelves inside it. Since I don't own the property, I'm thinking of building a free-standing set of shelves that fit exactly into the inside of the closet, so that I don't have to screw anything into the wall and can remove it easily when moving.   The footprint of the inside looks like this    I used the white stone texture for walls. The top and sides are walls, bottom is the part where the door is.  The whole thing looks like this    Again white stone is the (inwards facing) walls, and the wood texture is where I want the shelves to be. As you can see, halfway up the opening there is a horizontal board (I think it's meant as a laundry chute, but I don't use it for that), so there are actually two openings into one connected space. Because of this, I won't be able to construct the whole thing and place it in: I'll have to partially construct it and then assemble inside of the cupboard.  I made a sketch combining various ideas I had for a general design    I'm assuming I'll be able to find some kind of 1/4"" thick board for the shelves, and 3/8"" x 3/8"" square beams (this is the largest size I can easily hide behind the natural corners of the cupboard, but I can make it larger). I also left 1/16"" space between individual pieces to make it easier to model. The shelves are meant to be about 12"" high.  My question is, how do I actually attach the shelves to the posts in a way that it won't collapse easily? These will hold a few towels and toilet papers, so the combined load will be &lt;10 lbs, but I'd like to support a more reasonably weight like 20-40 lbs. I am planning to use the cheapest wood I can find at Home Depot.  My first idea was to use diagonal trusses    This picture shows two variants: I could attach the two top ends to each other with a bracket, with the shelf resting on them. Or I could put a horizontal beam and attach the trusses with L-brackets. The problem with the beam is that I'm not sure how to handle the intersection of the two beams at the corner (not shown here) - for example, if I use L-brackets, wouldn't the screws from the two edges bump into each other? Also, I'm worried cutting the diagonal corners will be challenging, since I don't have much equipment (I don't have a mitre box, so I'd be freehanding a dremel). In this version, the vertical posts would probably be single uninterrupted ~24"" long pieces.  Another idea I had was this diagonal beam assembly under the shelf    I would attach the two cross beams with T-brackets, and the ends of the beams would rest on top of the posts, I can put a dowel to keep the post from falling inwards. This should brace it enough and also support the shelf. I would still have to cut diagonal corners, but for this it doesn't have to be very precise and I could simply lay the crossbeams on the shelf itself and use it as a template/guide. I can't tell if this is actually a realistic construction, though. In this case the posts would actually be two pieces, so this would essentially be two separate single shelves stacked on top of each other.  I suppose another option is to just use back and side boards like in a freestanding shelf. That would probably be the easiest and most sturdy option, but I feel like since I'll be snug against 3 walls here, I might as well save some material.  What is the best solution in this case? "
400,Can I use a foam roller to spread contact cement for veneering,Iâm pretty terrible with a paint brush and have been practicing veneering.  I just tried a foam 4â roller and it worked well... so far.  I wonder if these are one time use or if they would âflakeâ off?  In all my searching no one recommends this method.  Menards doesnât have glue rollers...  so Iâm working with what I got  Is it okay for me to use a foam roller to spread contact cement for veneering? 
401,Joint all sides square?,"Can you use a jointer, using the fence, to plane all four sides of a wood piece, into four, plane, square and parallel to each other? I mean each side square to the adjacent and all sides parallel to non-adjacent sides.  Do you really need a thickness planer for this or using the square fence on the jointer would be enough? "
402,Adapting Old Craftsman Bench Grinder for CBN Wheels?,"I recently inherited a Craftsman model 397 bench grinder that runs and is in reasonable shape. Here's an image of the grinder with the wheels and guards removed.    I'd like to start using it for grinding chisels, plane blades and woodturning tools with most of my interest in the woodturning tools.   My main question is whether anyone has had success mounting CBN (cubic boron nitride) wheels on this older grinder? Do you think it's possible? The current wheels are 7"" and the grinder's got a 1/2"" arbor. I haven't seen many offerings for 7"" CBN. Do you think I could mount 6"" CBNs and have this configuration work for grinding gouges, etc.? I'd prefer a wider CBN wheel (say 1.5"") but it looks like I'd need to take the guards off on at least the outsides to accomodate the wider wheel.  The grinder runs in the 3500RPM range, but from what I've read, it's possible to patiently grind especially on CBN so as to not overheat the tools. "
403,What is the name of this metalwork for decorating furniture?,"I'd like to decorate a cabinet with metalwork, but I can't search for this item of metalwork because I have no idea what it's called.

405,How to hide base dados behind box joint corners,"I donât have any photos on me so hopefully I can describe this ok. Say I build a box like so:   Cut the four sides. Cut dado in bottom of each side, on table saw (I donât have another good way), which means they extend end-to-end. Join the four sides with box joints or dovetails, for aesthetics.   Now there is a problem. Because the slots in the sides are cut end-to-end, they knock out an exposed piece at the bottom of the corner joints, leaving conspicuous holes where the corners overlap the slots. Also, once the base is in place, the sides of the base are visible through these holes. Because there are dadoes in all four sides, there is no way to cut the joints to hide the holes.  How can I avoid this? Is there a trick? A different kind of corner joint? So far the only thing Iâve done is cut plugs to fit in the holes, but then the grain doesnât match up properly and they still look like a sloppy patch job (which they are).     "
406,Staining veneer in humid weather,"I am working in my garage in Wisconsin in August so needless to say itâs super muggy/humid.  Iâve veneered my speaker cabinet and Iâm getting ready to stain.  Should I bring in the cabinets and put them down my dehumidifier for a while before I bring them back up to stain? Iâm going to use wipe-on satin poly for my finish after staining.  Should I just aplomb that inside by the dehumidifier or would it be okay to take the cabinets in, have them sit in a dehumidifed area and then take them out for the poly coats?  What is the overall impact of high humidity on this process?  "
407,Purpleheart sustainability and environmental responsibility,"My local hardwood retailer has a ton of purpleheart for sale. It's gorgeous and I'd love to play with it.  (Ha.)  But, I've been told, and online research semi-confirms, that this stuff comes from rapidly disappearing rainforests. I don't want to contribute to that.  Are there other, sustainable sources for purpleheart? Is it not, in fact, endangered? Is there any way to verify that what I'm buying didn't involve the destruction of 10,000 different species of Things that can Move?  (TL;DR: How to responsibly buy hardwood without trashing the rest of the world.) "
408,How much extra thickness should I leave when rough milling green boards?,"When rough milling boards from a green log, is there a good rule of thumb or something to determine how much thicker I should slice them than my desired target thickness? Does it differ depending on the cut? I want to account for warping during drying but also minimize planing waste.  "
409,How to cross cut long board on a table saw,"Years ago I used a Bosch table saw for just about everything you could.  I just jumped back into woodworking. I bought the mist expensive saw I could find at my Home Depot, a $579 Heavy Duty Skilsaw table saw [website]It seems to be missing a really basic feature though.    I want to cross cut 1ft off a 10ft 2x4...basically the simplest cut imaginable. The old Bosch let you extend the table so you could support the board over 4ft or so. The Skilsaw lets you extend the table for the fence, but there's no support between the prongs like I had before.  Am I missing something in this table saw? Is there a name for this feature? Is this a common?  Edit: here is an example of what I am thinking of [website]"
410,Polyurethane a box (vertical sides),"I was originally going to use spray lacquer for my speaker cabinets which are essentially large cubes.  However, I've switched to brush on Poly.  Is it possible for me to apply the poly on the vertical surfaces?  If not, when will the poly be dry enough for me to turn the box so the poly surface will be vertical.    Example: Perhaps 1 side wait 30 minutes, turn and do another side?  At some point with that method, I'll need to rest the box on a poly'd side, how long would that side need to cure before resting the box on it's side while the newly poly'd side dries? "
411,Are brass plated screws sufficient to avoid black staining in oak? / Alternatives,"I am working on a desk picture frame made of white oak, and I have a hinge and some turn buttons that included brass plated screws in the package. (I am assuming they are plated because they are attracted strongly by magnets. I don't have any exact details about their materials.) I am aware that oak is especially susceptible to the tannins reacting with with iron to produce black staining. I would like the piece to last for a long time so I'd like to get some opinions on the matter.  Should I be concerned about using inexpensive brass plated screws from a tannin stain perspective? I have no idea what the plating thickness is or whether it would get rubbed off from friction during driving.  If brass plated is an issue, I would appreciate some advice on alternatives. The alternatives I am aware of are...   Solid brass - Weak/prone to snapping? I am mainly concerned if the recipient has to adjust the turn button pressure and it snaps in the hole, but I guess the threads would already be cut in the wood at that point. Silicon bronze - Seems tricky to get in #2 3/8"" size, and color doesn't match other hardware Stainless - Color doesn't match other hardware   Thanks! "
412,Mouth of a Plane,"I often read about planes that have adjustable mouths, that you can make smaller for finer shavings.  How does this work? Isn't the size of the shaving a function of how much the blade protrudes? It makes sense that a large mouth allows larger shavings to pass.. but why would making the mouth smaller help for finer shavings? "
413,How do you pick a joint?,"For a novice working on a design, picking a joint seems a very daunting task. There are many different kinds and it isn't easy to pick the most appropriate one. How to position the different elements, and where the main stress vectors lie is somewhat intuitive, but joints appear to have developed significantly over the centuries and there are many non-obvious innovations that a novice is unlikely to re-invent on his own. Moreover, the ""obvious"" solutions that would readily occur to a novice (like a butt joint with nails) are often regarded as inappropriate.  If you search for ""best joints to use"", often the results have a lot of joints that would require specialized tools one might not have access to. Worse, sometimes the best joint is the most complicated one, because it shows off the skill of the carpenter. Obviously not appropriate for someone seeking the path of least resistance.  Given a certain set of tools and known structural demands, how does one identify the best joint to use for a project? Is there some kind of flowchart or table? "
414,Pores on the face of an end grain chopping board,"I recently bought a Hevea chopping board which the manufacturer had annoyingly engraved their logo into, creating a small trap for food particles. It was pretty cheap so I figured I'd keep it and just sand down the logo.   It seems that in doing this I've opened some pores in the surface, which I'm concerned might be able to hide food contaminants. I was wondering if there is a way to close these pores? Did I simply take off the finishing, and what is a food safe way to finish a chopping board?  "
415,How to finish a section of log for outside?,"A tree surgeon just took down a sycamore that had been growing in my neighbour's garden (and probably underneath my house), and I kept a section of it to use to make a front door sign.   My current plan is to create a stencil of the house number, mark it on, and then carve out the number using my Dremel.   My question is: once this is done, what's the best way to finish the wood so that I can keep it outside?   Edit: for context, this will be essentially fully exposed to the elements. The idea is to put it next to my doorstep. I'm not too fussed about the colour from light brown to dark brown, so long as it's recognisable as wood.  Second edit: thanks for all the great comments so far, which are suggesting dealing with the drying problem first. However, assuming that I dry it out, what is the best way to finish it for outside?    Thanks in advance "
416,What types of food-safe finishes work best for protecting wood that will be outdoors?,"I am building some garden boxes out of Cedar.  I'd like to protect them so that the wood lasts longer, but I am concerned about certain finishes that might leach contaminants into the soil.  Is there a clear winner in this regard?  Are there finishes specifically designed with this in mind? "
417,Properly securing a ramp,"I'm building a 2'x2', 3 floor parking garage for my son.  I've built the core structure out of 1/2"" plywood, with dowels supporting it, and 3/16"" chalkboard-paper lined plywood glued on top of the plywood on each level (for eventually allowing parking spots to be drawn on and such).  The levels are about 6"" apart.  I created two cut-outs for the ramps (ie, cut out about a 8""x3"" section, both to leave room for the ramp and to be used for the ramp itself), but I'm working out now how to attach them properly.  What would be the best way in terms of surviving a three or four year old's level of play to attach them while still keeping it looking more or less like a parking garage?  My thoughts were either a hinge (like a door hinge) to attach to the top level and a smaller hinge on the bottom level, or to use a wooden triangle to screw it to.  The angle will be about 30 degrees or so (yes, probably unrealistic, but it seems about to match what other products use).  Is there a better option?  What should I keep in mind while doing this? "
418,Routing boards without burn,"It seems when I utilize routers, they always seem to burn the edge of the board at some point in the cut. I believe I am cutting at a relatively even speed (though this is obviously subjective). My router bits are fairly new (use wise), so should not be dull. I'm wondering what is the proper technique involved for using a router properly?  Some things I'm wondering are:   Should you see better results using a routing table instead of locking the board and using the router freehand? Old vs. new router bits Speed of the router (or power output), does it make a difference?   Anything else which might be pertinent? "
419,How to harden a steel chisel/blade?,"I wonder of some sharpening technique can reduce chisel efficiency, so maybe after giving the chisel a nice cut it worth re-hardening it so it will last a longer in time.  I know I can heat it and then put it in water/oil but I wonder if water must be cool, shall I re-heat a bit the blade after ?  Is there a standard procedure ? "
420,Is sanding along the grain important?,"I've heard from various sources that you must always sand in the direction of the grain.  Is this always true?  Does it depends on the sanding paper's grit, tool used or the wood being sanded?  What are the advantages of sanding along the grain? "
421,How can I minimize warp due to wood movement when gluing up a panel?,"I recently built a small 2' x 3' dresser top out of pine. It was within 1/8"" flat and level when I glued it up in the garage, but within a few weeks inside it had warped and buckled significantly. What techniques can I use to minimize the chance of this happening in    my next project?  Details on the project:   I planed several 2x4's down to 6/4 (1.25"") thickness, and jointed them with my router and a straight edge. I checked the moisture content at the beginning of the project, and all the boards seemed to be a consistent 12% throughout. I even measured the middle with my pin contact moisture meter when I crosscut the boards to the 3' lengths. I had a business trip partway through the project, and had to leave the unfinished table top sitting in the garage for two weeks. It was completely assembled/glued, but hadn't had stain or poly applied yet. When I got back, the warp had already occurred. I alternated grain orientation on most boards, but I mistakenly put two next to each other with the convex side of the rings facing upwards. The warp is worst here, but there's still a bit of a wave on other parts of the dresser top.   My thoughts for warp mitigation, and why I haven't tried them yet:   Use narrower boards? (Not much of an option, since I was working with 2x4's to start with.) Use hardwood? (I'm still a bit of an amateur, and I'd like to perfect my techniques with $10 worth of lumber, rather than wasting money on more expensive stock.) Use quarter sawn boards? (See above reason.)   So what am I missing? Which, if any, of the above options would be most effective to try first? Are there other techniques I can use to mitigate warp in my future panel glue ups? "
422,How to extend a routed rabbet to the inside corners of a cabinet door or other frame?,"I fixed up a cabinet in my bathroom, and made a bunch of cabinet doors for it. One of the cabinet doors, I made to have a frosted glass insert with some towels behind it. I used a router with a rabbeting bit with a bearing to create the rabbet to hold the glass in the frame. However, since the bit is round, it was unable to get tight into the corners. I then used a chisel to finish off the corners.  However, the result of the corners was not anywhere as close to as good a cut as the routed section. When I look at the doors in my kitchen with glass windows, professionally made, the cut is perfect including the corners.  Is there a particular technique that is better for making the glass doors? Should I have routed the rabbets prior to gluing up the pieces? Or do I just need to get better at chiseling?  I'm not sure how I could have assembled it different, as I would still have corners prior to assembly:  "
423,How much clearance/slop is allowable for a structurally sound PVA wood glue joint?,"When I am cutting structural joinery, mortise and tenon joints in this case, what is the maximum difference between the mortise dimensions and the tenon for a good glue joint if I am using standard PVA wood glue (also known as carpenter's glue or yellow glue, i.e. Tightbond etc.)?  At what point would I need to consider another type of adhesive or simply recutting the joint? "
424,How do I waterproof and secure a face frame on a wooden aquarium?,"I am attempting to build a wooden aquarium, using 1/4"" x 60"" x 18"" Lexan polycarbonate for the viewing side, and 3/4"" plywood for the main body construction.  I plan on using 1""x 2"" furring strips along the seams, secured with a combination of external screws and glue, as well as around the top as bracing and for future lid/cover support.   The face frame will be 1"" x 4"" poplar, again secured with wood glue and screws. All screws will be countersunk and puttied over for a paint finish. The interior will be waterproofed with a two part marine safe epoxy paint (Such as those available from Sweetwater or Pentair), but I am unsure of how to secure the polycarbonate .  I don't know if should route the inside of the frame (Possible weakness when filled with water), or secure with mirror mounting type brackets or make an interior routed frame to fit around the polycarbonate ? Also unsure if I would mount the polycarbonate and then paint/epoxy the edges, or paint first and then epoxy/mount? "
425,How can I prevent tearout of plywood when cutting it with a circular saw?,"Note: This question was closed as a duplicate because plywood and veneer both have similar issues when being cut with a circular saw. Hopefully the answers in both questions can help out.  When using a circular saw, I often find that I rip up the bottom edge of a sheet of plywood after cutting it. Usually my blade is a good 1/2 inch lower than the bottom of the plywood and I use a 24-tooth blade. Should I switch to a blade with finer teeth? Or should I change the blade height?   "
426,How can I minimize snipe while thickness planing?,"I usually notice a small amount of snipe on the ends of the boards I run through my thickness planer. It's not too deep, (&lt;1/32"" maybe?), and doesn't cover too much of the board length (&lt;4"" on either end), but it's noticeable if I inspect the boards closely enough.  I've heard lifting the far end of the board a little higher than the section in the planer helps reduce snipe, but so far I haven't been able to consistently get a board completely snipe free.  Just for background purposes, I'm using a DW735 with the infeed/outfeed tables installed.  Is there just a minimum amount of snipe that I can always expect to have? Or can it be completely eliminated? "
427,How can I store hand tools so they won't rust?,"I currently have a small set of hand tools, but do not use some very often. One hand saw that I own (stored on a shelf with my other tools in the basement) has rusted quite a bit on the blade, and I want to avoid that occurring with my other hand tools.  WD-40 seems to be not the best solution, because it stinks and often attracts dust. Is paste wax acceptable for use to prevent rust or corrosion? I'm planning on warming it up and passing it over the steel parts of the tool.  I've also heard that desiccators can be effective to dry out tool storage.  Can this be accomplished with silica gel packets? Should I also oil the tools in some way? "
428,How do I identify the appropriate size fastener for my application?,"I often find myself guessing based on what I have on hand. Are there some objective guidelines for how to select the proper size? I'm usually thinking about three attributes:   Length  Length is probably the easier dimension to eyeball, but I imagine there is some logic there I could be applying to be more consistent. Diameter  Diameter is more difficult. Generally the gripping strength is best achieved by increasing the depth of the hole (+ fastener length), meaning a long skinny screw will hold tighter than a fatty short one (provided we don't go to the extremes). My best guess is to use thicker screws when shear resilience is needed, where the weight of the workpiece or the way in which it is to be used will result in lateral force against the screws. But again, I always make my best guess. Thread Pitch/Depth  This one is easy at a high level. Harder woods need a narrower thread pitch, softer woods need a wider thread pitch (and deeper threads). Usually I only have two choices (sometimes fewer), but perhaps every type of wood has its ideal thread profile.   But really this all boils down to guestimation, which I already do. What about more objective metrics I could put on a cheat sheet somewhere in my shop (or better yet, something I could remember)? "
429,How do I ensure my drill is perfectly vertical before cutting a hole in my desk?,"I want to cut a hole in my desk (3/4"" furniture grade plywood with an oak veneer) to run cables through. I'll be using a hole saw and my cordless drill. Since this is going to be very visible, I want to be sure that the hole is perfectly vertical, and that I get it right on the first try.  How can I ensure that the drill is angled correctly? Should I even be trying this with a hand-held drill? If not, what tools should I think about using? "
430,"Can pressure-treated posts be restored, or better preserved?","The posts and rails shown are 20-year-old pressure-treated wood.  Is there any maintenance that could have prevented the posts from decaying through the exposed end grain?  Is there any restoration that can extend the service life of the existing wood?  E.g., I have heard of penetrating plasticizers that can shore up exterior wood.  Is 20 years about the expected service life of outdoor pressure-treated wood?   "
431,"When building an outdoor structure, should I use pressure-treated lumber or something like cedar?","I am building a pergola (~10'x10') on my patio (and plan to build a gazebo out in the yard), but before I build it, I want to make sure I'm using the best option for lumber.  Should I use pressure-treated lumber in such an application? Or is something like cedar better? Is there another alternative I should consider? "
432,What is the proper place of nails in woodworking?,"When is it appropriate to use nails to join wood?  Other than for rough framing, the only common accepted use I can think of is for tacking trim, but even there it doesn't quite feel right because invariably the nailguns aren't set properly so unless a good painter comes after them with wood filler each brad leaves a divot.  And for all I know ""real"" woodworkers rabbet and glue all their trim.  So is brad nailing still considered a good practice for trim?  And are there other permanent installations where nails are appropriate? "
433,Hand planing edge joined board without tearout,"I'm considering building a kitchen table. This would be my second. I plan on edge joining planks. Last time, despite using dowels for alignment, there were often ridges between adjoining boards. To make the surface even, I used a belt sander, then subsequently followed that up with about 900 hours of sanding (okay....slight exaggeration).   This time around, I plan on smoothing it with a hand plane then skipping to a 220 grit sandpaper. This will even out the bumps and create a smooth surface, but I'm worried about tear-out. I know that hand planing against the grain will generally produce tear-out, but with so many planks glued together (some, or many of which will change grain direction), how can I avoid tear-out? Am I doomed to hours of sanding? "
434,Are the staples used to tag wood at the DIY store saw safe?,"The current trend at my local DIY stores is to staple a tag to the butt of the wood for pricing.  I usually pull these out by sliding the tip of a screw driver between the wood and the staple and pulling it out, ""usually"" being the key word.   I rip a lot of wood to my required size, so once in while the staple is still in wood when it goes through the saw.  Are these staples made to be saw blade safe (like will not harm the blade or ME)?  If not, what is the best tool for removing price staples from the butt of the wood?  "
435,How to hand-sharpen a badly worn gouge?,"I picked up a couple of gouges at a local thrift shop. Some of them are in good order, but some of them are in bad shape and should've been sharpened long ago.  I've seen a couple of instruction videos on YouTube, but those feature nice clean gouges that just need a little touch up. Is sharpening a badly worn gouge doable by hand? Or should I either just toss them, or keep them around until I get my hands on mechanical means? "
436,What are some safe finishes for indoor projects likely to be chewed on by a young child or infant?,"I'm going to be putting together a crib for over the next few months for our first child.  I found a blog that mentions shellac.  Only, it doesn't exactly say that shellac is safe, only that it is safer than polyurethane.  My question is whether shellac is, in fact, safe and what are some other options?  I'm also curious about whether it is important to finish the crib at all.  What are the downsides to just leaving it as sanded lumber?  Is this just an aesthetic concern? "
437,What tools can I use to hollow out a bowl?,"I'm interested in creating two types of bowls.  The first is relatively straightforward - in design, at least - as it will just be a large salad bowl.  The second is going to mimic a bowl I was gifted recently that is more or less tear drop shaped.  My question is: how I would go about removing the inside (and outside for that matter) of the bowl?  Would this process be the same for a bowl that is not circular?  Bear in mind that you're speaking to a beginner here.  If possible, please provide the investment context, ie what are the low tech (cheap) and hi tech (expensive) tool options? "
438,How can I determine the load capacity of a simple bench?,"I'm new to woodworking and I'm in the planning phase of making a bench like the one pictured below. I'm planning on storing very heavy boxes on this and would also like to use it as a stool to reach high shelves.   Is there a standard practice in determining how much weight a bench can hold? Is there any quick estimation practices that usually give accurate results?   The bench will be made all out of Douglas-fir 2x4 studs, except for the four legs which will be Douglas-fir 4x4 posts. The only fasteners I plan on using are steel 2.5 in. common nails. How can I find the weight this bench can realistically hold?    "
439,Is it safe (for the animals) to use pressure treated wood for animal feeders and houses?,"I've been keen on taking pallets and other woods from supply stores so that I can up-cycle them into small woodworking projects like birdhouses, feeders and lately wine racks.   There were some fence sections that looks weathered enough that I though they would look good as birdhouses. When I cut into them I noticed the green stain that makes me think it was pressure treated wood.  Can I possibly use that for something like a birdhouse or bird feeder? I would not use it for anything like a food tray or something that would come into contact with food or edible plants. By extension, should I not use it for any applications.   It was an accident for me to pick that up in the first place since I don't even think I should burn it.   Can I use pressure treated wood for small projects that will be used by animals? "
440,Router bit speed as a function of wood hardness,"I understand why larger router bits should be operated at lower speeds and there are a multitude of router bit speed charts out there to help you choose the correct speed for any given bit.  It all revolves around (haha, see what I did there?) the rim speed of the bit and, from what I've been able to work out, it looks like most recommended rotational speeds equate to a rim speed of something between 100 km/h (60 mph) and 180 km/h (110 mph).  But then every article you read about this will state that the size of the bit is only one of the factors to determine the speed at which you want to run the router. Another important factor is the hardness of the wood. But, while every article gives you a chart to illustrate how bit size affects the speed, I have yet to see something illustrating how hardness of the wood affects the speed.  Yes, I get it, harder wood = slower speed, but how much? If the bit size speed chart tells me that the max speed for a bit is 20,000 RPM for instance, I'm presuming that is if you're cutting a soft pine. But if you're cutting African Blackwood or Ipe, you should use a slower speed but how much slower?  Any rules of thumb or charts for this perhaps? "
441,Custom Wood Shelf Brackets,"I'm looking to build some 24"" by 10"" oak shelves. They will be mounted to the wall using custom metal brackets. I was originally thinking of using a vise and a hammer, but want them to look good and am doing a few so want it to go easy. Could I use something like this to put a 90 degree bent in them? or am I missing something? Material is 1/8"" by 2"".   [website]Thanks "
442,Building a large dining table and wondering if my design is strong/structurally sound enough,"The table is 9' 6"" L Ã 36"" W Ã 29"" tall.    The frame and the legs will be 1 Â½"" T. Apron on the side is 2"" T, 1"" tapering to 1"" at the end. The legs are 4"" W at the top, tapering to 2"" at the bottom. Wood is white oak.  I'm planning on building sort of torsion box on the frame (+ some cauls or whatever they're called to keep the top from warping).    The legs-to-apron joints will be bridal, all others will be Festool Domino tenons (probably 10mm Ã 50mm).  Given a weight of 48lbs/ft3 for white oak, it seems the top will weigh in at about 170 lbs (!).  So, the question is: Do you think the frame is strong/solid enough to carry this weight? And do you think in general this will be a sturdy and wobble-free table? "
443,How do I choose a drill press?,"A drill press seems such an essential tool -- even outside of fine woodworking I have found need for it a great many times -- but as I dive into woodworking I see even more of a need for it. The precision, straightness of cut, and depth limiter will obviously give better results and make some near-impossible hand drill tasks easy. But how do I choose one?  Spindle travel seems very important. 2"" sounds tiny and 5"" sounds big. How much do I actually need, or what depths should I expect to want to reach. If I only drill through 3/4"" wood, any size is fine. (Right?) But a 2x4 could makes more travel useful.  Table size and adjustability seems very important. Big, tiltable, easy clamp spots, etc. would make it most easy to use with any workpiece. Right?  Bench vs floor standing also seems important, however I'm not sure I see many scenarios where floor standing space would actually matter for the workpiece... though maybe I'm short-sighted?  What else am I missing? "
444,Why is there a progressive reduction in oil for finish/maintenance? Is it necessary?,"For oil finishes, such as tung or linseed, it's common to see advice where you apply multiple coats early on, then fewer and fewer coats progressively.  For example, a common adage is: ""Once a day for a week, once a week for a month, once a month for a year, and once a year for life.""  I understand why you would want to do multiple coats early on (as a finish) and a few coats over the long run (for maintenance).  But what is the purpose of the intermediate phases, i.e., in the example above the once a week/once a month phases?  If it's simply to continue the finish, couldn't you just compact those into the finishing process (e.g., roughly once a day for three weeks), then swap to the maintenance phase? "
445,Wood splinters when using a rabbeting bit,"I'm using a rabbeting bit on a 1"" x 4"" red oak board.  When I cut at 1/4"" depth and 1/2"" width, it works fine. When I increase the depth of cut to 3/8"", the wood splinters.  Is this common? Is it typical to do two runs and if so are there any rules of thumb with how deep a cut you can make with a rabbeting bit? "
446,What steps should one take to avoid spalting when drying timber?,"I am interested in taking steps to ensure that some timber that I am drying does not develop spalting.  My specific scenario is as follows:   Recently felled Maple (1-2 months ago), Whole logs with bark retained on full circumference, Sizes from 1"" to 5"" diameter, Currently stacked with air gaps allowing circulation around all pieces, Stored in dry concrete basement with steady warm temperature, Goal is to dry logs/branches whole with bark for craft work.   Someone looked at this setup and told me that spalting was probably unavoidable in the larger peices, but I find that doubtful. Is it unavoidable? Have I done what I can do already?  The broader question here is what steps should one take to preclude spalting when drying wood? If my specific scenario helps provide context to answer that question, good.  "
447,What kind of wood blanks should a beginner use for bowl turning?,"I recently took a bowl turning class and want to build experience in a frugal way. From a quick online search, I see bowl blanks cost around [tex]30, depending on the wood.  What kind of wood blanks should I start out on, negating aesthetic qualities and focusing on dollar value? Should I be buying 6 x 6 x N stock and cutting it down? "
448,What techniques are there to find the optimal wood cutting list for a project?,"When I've designed a piece of furniture, I need to source the wood for it. The wood is often sold in plank form that I need to cut to length when it's too long and glue together when it's too narrow.  Is there a technique other than trial and error for working out the optimal number of planks to purchase and how to cut and glue them to make the ""sheets"" I need?  Alternatively, are there software utilities that do this for me?  EDIT: In my particular case, the supplier can provide the wood in specific dimentions (2.5m lengths of 150mm wide planks in the thickness I need). So I really just need to work out how many of those planks need gluing side-by-side to make the wide boards in such a way as to produce the least wasted wood. "
449,What hand tools might have been used historically to create a wooden train?,I am writing a novel set in 1850s Nevada. I would like to have the papa make his son a wooden train. Could he do this with a hand saw? What other hand tools would he need? 
450,Joint recommendation?,"(Yes, I'm building the ubiquitous farmhouse table. I blame the wife.)  What sort of joint would y'all recommend for this?     These are 4x4s. The angled piece is about 36"" long on each side, so about 46 before the mitered cuts on the end.   I've used M&amp;T just about everywhere else, but that's going to be a little difficult with the angles. I'm suspect that a butt join would separate at the top over time (though I could be wrong). Someone suggested dowels.   Suggestions?  "
451,Remove wax from wood grain,"I have a piece of walnut I finished with Danish oil then poly. After it cured I sanded it with high grit sandpaper then applied a small amount of wax and polished. I did the whole process on the bottom of the piece in order to test the finish. I didn't have any issues so I followed the same steps on the top. This time, however, it seems the wood grain was still somewhat exposed somehow and bits of wax remained in the grain. The white spots in the pictures are bits of wax.      I have tried many ways to remove the wax -   Wiping/scrubbing with mineral spirits on cotton cloth, shop towel Sanding with high grit sandpaper and mineral spirits Wiping/scrubbing with naptha on cotton cloth, shop towel Using a blow dryer to heat the wax and wipe away   None of these solutions really seemed to work. The most effective one seemed to be naptha, but it still could not remove all of the wax.  I have read that sanding this down to re-finish could actually worsen the issue because it will melt the wax into the wood?  Any ideas on how to resolve this issue? "
452,How do I avoid 'orange peel' when rubbing out acrylic lacquer?,"I'm relatively new to woodworking.  I just finished some desktops made from Eastern White Pine, and coated with 5-7 coats of post-catalyzed acrylic lacquer (Target Coatings EM-6000 + CL-1000) sprayed from a cheap HVLP sprayer.  After a week of cure time I used a series of Mirka Abralon silicon carbide Sanding Pads (grits 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000) soaked in soapy water, 3-4 slow passes over the entire top.  Then finished with Menzerna SF3500 using a foam finishing pad.  The resultant finish has a very nice glossy shine, but it also looks very orange peel.  After seeing this on my first project, I thought that this just meant that I needed to be more aggressive with my initial sanding.  So on my second desk I started with a 500 grit sanding pad before moving to the 1000, and I took a little more time than I did with the others.  I was surprised to see that the second project looked as orangy, if not more so, than the first.  Leaving me to wonder what's causing this and what step I'm missing in my finishing process.  I've never read of anyone needing to go rougher than 500 grit when rubbing out lacquer.  What's the proper way to deal with this?  Why (physically) does this happen?  Do I just need to take a lot more time with the 500 grit?  Too much water and/or soap?  My goal is to create a glasslike mirror gloss, like you see on a high-end car paint job or a guitar. "
453,Building a pergola on a new patio slab - wood quality,"I'd like a pergola with natural wood color and grain appearance.  I live near the west side of the Sierra Nevada, where drought and beetles have decimated the Ponderosa pines.  An acquaintance has access to logs that were cut and given away by the Forest Service; he has a small mill and will sell me lumber cut to my specs for half what the lumber yard charges. This wood has not been treated in any way.  So, is this a good route to go?  What would I need to do to keep this wood from warping? "
454,Do I need to add natural stain before applying polyurethane for natural finish?,I have an unfinished desk and want to keep the natural color of the wood but I want to protect it with a clear polyurethane finish.  I am wondering if I need to (or is it preferable to) add a clear or natural stain beforehand? Is there any benefit to doing that or will applying the polyurethane by itself have the same result if I don't stain first? 
455,What's a reliable measure of wood hardness?,"The terms hardwood and softwood are often used, but I struggle to find a reliable definition.  Is the wood's density sufficient as the distinguishing feature?  Is it the only one?  As oil is known to harden a wooden surface, is it possible to create a (in terms of density) hardwood-like surface on a piece of softwood? Is it even possible to get softwood that's harder than (relatively soft) hardwood this way?  Crucial edit  When I asked for hardwood and softwood, I had the German terms âHartholzâ and âWeichholzâ in mind. It turns out they do not translate one-to-one: In English, according to Wikipedia and ON5MF's answer, the distinction is made by the type of tree from which the wood is harvested. That corresponds to the German terms âLaubholzâ (wood from dicot angiosperm trees, = hardwood) and âNadelholzâ (wood from gymnosperm trees, = softwood). The differentiation in âHartholzâ and âWeichholzâ differs from that in a way that it takes the wood's âhardnessâ as the distinguishing feature, and I wondered how exactly this is measured and defined. So, additional question: Is there a similar differentiation in English?  tl;dr: How do you measure a wood's hardness? "
456,What cleaning products can be used on a wood piece coated with acrylic lacquer?,"I have finished several pieces of wood furniture with acrylic lacquer.  Some of them are getting fingerprints, dust, etc on them.  Besides using a simple duster, what product should be used to clean the lacquer surface?  Would Windex Multi-Surface Vinegar be effective and safe? "
457,"Voids, epoxy and staining compatibility","TL;DR: How do I fix this, and have it match the final color?    I'm getting ready to join some 10.5""-wide red oak for a table top, and one of the boards has a void on an edge, right in the middle (length-wise). It's a gorgeous piece otherwise, and I have a limited supply of these.   I saw a Wood Whisperer (love that guy!) video where he used a tinted epoxy to fill in a knot. That seems like a reasonable approach, but I'm not sure how that's going to work with the final stain / treatment that my wife insists on using. (It's some sort of tea-based mixture that gives a gray-ish weathered appearance. She's used it on some other pieces and it looks ok.)  So, the question!  Obviously, I can't stain epoxy.    Should I look for another way to fill the void? Should I remove the knot and patch the wood? It's a very irregular shape (duh), not too sure how that would work. How else can I stabilize this section? It's fine if I still see the knot after it's done, but I don't want a piece that's going to crumble or otherwise disintegrate over time.   Suggestions? Someone else said to replace the knotty section with a bowtie, but I'm not a huge fan of those. I'd love something that would match the grain. But, since this is on the outside edge of the table, I don't see how I could do that and have it either not obvious, or not ugly. "
458,Safety of commercial oil for cutting boards,"Recently I've asked in a couple of places about which oils should be used to finish cutting/butcher boards. Mineral oils were on the list as well as other types of products (tung oil, waxes, etc.). Another recommendation was ""Hard Top Oil"" by Borma Wachs (technical sheet). The abstract describes the product as:      [...] a mix of prestigious modified natural oils, [...]      Allows to obtain high transparency natural effect finishings on kitchen tops and furniture, even in case of direct contact with food      Complying to norm EN71-III â Safe for childrenâs toys (no release of potentially harmful hazardous substances)   My question is the following: Has anyone tried this product before (first time I hear about the company) ? Does the EN71-III standard guarantee safety when in direct contact with food ?  EN71 part 3 summary:     The EN 71 standard part 3 is focusing on studying the chemicals contained in the toy and the levels in which they are present. Since July 2013, the regulation has extended the metal restrictions and application scope to a wider range of toys. There are 19 metals restricted now. The limitation varies depending if it is:         Category I â in dry, brittle, powder-like or pliable toy material:  Solid materials which may leave residues on the hands.    Category II â in liquid or sticky toy material:  Fluid or viscous materials which can be ingested or have skin contact.    Category III â in scraped-off toy material:  Solid materials which can be ingested by biting, tooth scraping, sucking or licking.      "
459,What type of hardware is this,... that allows the steps to collapse and the support brace to pivot inwards so that the unit can lay flat? Some sort of bolt?       
460,Can a workbench survive outside in a shed with seasonal temperature variations?,"I live in south eastern Canada. Where I live we have relatively high humidity and temperatures from -40Â°C to +40Â°C. I more or less finished building my shed that I am going to use for my woodworking. I really want to make myself a woodworking bench that can live there.  My uncle is also a woodworker. He was given a nice finished workbench from a friend and he put it in his outdoor workshop which is not temperature controlled. We live near each other so the seasonal temperatures as virtually the same for us. Once a year had passed the bench was pulling itself apart, the ends of bench showed the most warping. From what I can tell it was laminated properly. It makes me wonder though....  Can I make a workbench of laminated wood (mostly ripped 2x10's) with the intention of leaving it out in the winter? Or is that just a disappointment waiting to happen?   I suppose I could use hardware to reinforce the lamination but wood would likely still warp. I can accept a little warping but I don't want there to be room to put my fingers between the boards.  "
461,Stanley Bailey frog adjustment problem,"I recently bought a vintage Stanley Bailey No. 4 (Type 19 I think, I am new these tools) and after lapping sole and frog surface and putting it back together I found that the iron is skewed and I have to put the lateral adjustment lever almost completely to the right to get even shavings.  Whatever I try to align the frog, either the iron is skewed vertically or not perpendicular to the throat. From the top it looks fine:    But when I put in the iron (lateral adjustment lever in the middle) it looks like this from below:    When I look at the bottom areas where the frog rests on the sole, they seem asymmetrical (I filed one of the inner edges, because I thought it was stuck on some paint). I added lines to make it more obvious.    And the side which has the smaller contact area in the picture above also seems to be fatter if I look on them from the front:    The iron is pretty square and flat. I also tried an different cutting iron from a No. 5 and the problem is the same.  Am doing something wrong or is this a defect of manufacturing? Is that possible or even common for Stanley Bailey planes (of some era)? And if so, how can I fix it? Should I try to file it down? I guess I would have to correct the upper contact area, too? "
462,Wide breadboard tenon length?,"I'm getting ready to attach breadboard ends to my table top. The top and ends are cut from 9.5"" x 1.5"" red oak. Purely for aesthetic reasons, the breadboards will also be 9.5"" wide (or deep, rather).  I've thought about either M&amp;T, or a continuous tenon with a single long mortise in the ends, with dowels through the bottom (draw bore with elongated slots in the tongue / tenon / whatever you want to call it in this case.)  Is this a reasonable approach for a 9.5"" piece that's basically hanging off in the ether? Is there any advantage to doing individual tenons on each board rather than a single long one ?  If so, what dimensions should I target for the tenon length? Assuming it's 1/2"" thick - 1/3rd of the board thickness - is 2"" deep enough?   Also, the articles &amp; videos I've read say to only glue the center board so that the rest can move within the groove as necessary. However, the top is made from four boards, so there's no ""center."" I assume that, if it's glued to one of the center boards, then the table will ""grow"" more relative to one end of the breadboard than the other.   So,   Are my plan and dimensions sound? Where should I glue this thing?   Thanks "
463,Are the wheels of a bandsaw exactly the nominal diameter?,"I recently bought a used bandsaw from a neighbor (AMT 14"" model 4113).  It needs new tires, but when I went to measure their width/thickness, I discovered that the wheels are only 13&nbsp;3/4"" in diameter (with the tires on).  Is this the typical size of a 14"" bandsaw's wheels?  If I buy 14"" tires, will they fit, or do I have to buy 13&nbsp;3/4"" tires? "
464,How should I set a hand plane down?,"I've heard conflicting anecdotal advice on how to put down a hand plane.     ""Don't put a hand plane down on its bottom; always put it on its side or you'll throw off the blade."" (source: Grandfather, who was a contractor for 50+ years)   and also     ""Don't put a hand plane down on its side; always put it on its bottom or you'll throw off the blade."" (random people on the Internet)   Is there a more correct way to set down a hand plane? What is the best way to store a hand plane? "
465,OSB chair finishing,"  I'm currently working on a boxed-shaped chair made out of OSB (oriented-strand board). I'll be using it as a chair, but the surface of it is very rough and has some splinters on it.  I don't think just sanding it is enough. Maybe I need more than just sanding it, like stain or varnish? But I'm a very new to woodworking and don't know how to smooth it.  Can you guys let me know what to do with this to make it smooth enough to sit on?  Thanks in advance! Cheers "
466,Minwax poly stain still sticky,"I'm new to this forum and new to woodworking as well...I'm renovating my daughter's bathroom and she wanted the cabinets stained darker. I thought that would be pretty simple (ð³ð©) and inexpensive so I agreed. So I scuffed up the cabinets and applied the poly in as thin a coat as I could. 13 hours later it's still tacky, and I'm afraid to sand or apply another coat, even though the can says you can apply more after 4-6 hours.  Is it still in that ""2 phase"" drying process I've read about? It looks great for the most part but has some strange little spots where the poly appears to have spread out and thinned. Any suggestions? "
467,Drop-in threaded hole for screw?,"I've got a work bench I built, and the top is 3/4"" MDF.  I have a lightweight drill press that I'd like to be able to fix to the top as needed.  My thought was to somehow have a couple of threaded holes in the top that I could then use to just temporarily bolt the drill press in place as needed.  But how would I do that? Basically, I want a couple of threaded holes for bolts to go in, but I'm not sure if that exists or what it's called to even search for it.  Any ideas what those are called? Or other ideas on how to do this? "
468,Which Acme thread class is best for homemade wood clamps?,"Lets say I wanted to make homemade wooden C-clamps. Is there any advantage to using a better grade of ACME thread than single start RH 2G? Will 3G or 4G buy me anything? What about multiple starts or 2C, 3C and 4C? "
469,In what cases is it useful to have more than one of the same tool?,"For the purposes of this question, please note that I am not asking for general advice on buying tools, but rather, I'm trying to identify the cases in which it may be practical and useful to have two or more of the same tool. One reason is to help new woodworkers avoid paralysis by analysis--it doesn't make sense to spend a significant amount of time agonizing over the purchase of some tools since you'll most likely want to keep at least two of the same tool in service at the same time anyway, for convenience or some other purpose.  The conventional wisdom when it comes to buying tools is that you should buy your last tool first, because you'll save a lot of money over endlessly upgrading. For example, many people start out with a cheap jobsite table saw and upgrade several times, finally ending up with a cabinet saw, when they could have just bought the cabinet saw from the start and saved a lot of money and frustration over time.  On the flip-side, it's far too easy to overanalyze a tool purchase. When I started building my tool collection, I spent an enormous amount of time agonizing over which tools to buy. For example, I could have just bought a set of chisels for [tex]60, or really nice chisels for $60+ apiece. I agonized over it for weeks before buying two nice chisels, but it wasn't until after I was given a cheaper set of chisels that I started actually using my chisels. In hindsight, I should have just bought the cheap chisels and upgraded as needed, because in the case of chisels it's good to have a nicer set for finer work and a cheaper set for ""banging around""--scraping glue, working reclaimed wood with embedded dirt and grit, etc.  In what cases is it useful to have more than one of the same tool (even, perhaps, the same exact tool), and why? And, on a related note, when is it advantageous to buy a cheap tool first and later buy a second (or third, or fourth...), possibly better, tool of the same type without rendering the first tool worthless? "
470,In what cases is it NOT useful to have more than one of the same tool?,"I want to take In what cases is it useful to have more than one of the same tool? and flip it around to find out what tools are NOT useful in multiples.  In other words, I'm now looking for cases in which a woodworker eventually might own two or more of a given tool, but keeping more than one of them is difficult to justify objectively because having more than one provides little or no practical benefit.  Unfortunately, this turns out to much more difficult than I had originally thought, because one most prove that there is NO situation in which the tool is useful in multiples. As it turns out, it's very difficult (or impossible, in many cases) to prove this objectively.  Instead of trying to create a list of tools that are not useful in multiples, what factors should I consider in order to determine whether or not I should limit myself to just one of a given tool? "
471,Having trouble securing the PVC pipe for a Washers Game,"I hope this question fits here.  I just didn't know where else to turn.  I'm definitely an amateur woodworker, but I recently tried to make a Washers Game.  The square seemed too easy, so I did the octagon.  It looks great.  However, I'm really having trouble securing the PVC pipe.  I used regular wood glue, then liquid nail, but both times, it became dislodged after a few washers hit it.  My next try will be to cut out a piece of plywood that will fit inside the PVC pipe, then screw that to the bottom and then glue the PVC pipe to the sides as well as the bottom of the plywood.  Is this the best way?  Any clue why the liquid nail didn't seem to be enough?  Am I missing something? "
472,What can cause a table saw to make this rattling/clacking noise?,"I've just put my used Powermatic 64 Artisan's Saw together. When the belt is attached to the motor, it makes a sound that seems like something is unbalanced. When the motor spins freely without the belt attached, the sound goes away.  I have uploaded a video to youtube demonstrating both of these sounds: [website]Is the sound that the saw makes under load of the belt (note: there is no blade in the saw yet) normal, or is there something I need to look into? If so, what? "
473,How can I design a large cherry table with no aprons?,"I am trying to build a cherry table.  I will be creating the top out of multiple 8/4 boards using standard techniques.  The table will be 42"" wide by at least 68"" long.  I have come up with the idea to not use aprons.    My question is how should I stiffen the table without having the aprons for support?  My ideas so far:   Use a router to create one or two grooves almost the entire length of the table (making sure that the groove is in only one piece of wood), then insert a ""spline"" along that length that will be 4/4 stock; basically a long mortise and tenon to attach an apron in the middle of the table.  I figure if I glue this in, it will strengthen the table length-wise and not cause problem due to wood movement because the groove will run with the grain.  I would probably do this several times because I don't want the ""apron"" to stick out from the bottom too much, so it would not be super thick Do the same grooves but instead epoxy in metal splines Don't do anything to strengthen it lengthwise, because 8/4 cherry over that length may just be strong enough? Attach wood strips across the grain using cleats to strengthen table across the width ??     I'm looking for any good suggestions/critiques here.  Googling has lead me to believe that nobody really does this, but I've seen huge tables with only the 4 legs for support, so I'm guessing it can be done. "
474,What is the normal end-of-life for a bandsaw blade?,I suppose there are two alternatives for the death of a bandsaw blade:   The blade breaks. The teeth get noticeably dull and the blade is discarded.   I have never experienced scenario #2 but I've broken a few blades on my bandsaw. Is this the normal way for them to go?  Does breaking a bandsaw blade indicate something such as too much/too little tension? 
475,What's the best way to remove varnish from recycled wood flooring?,"I've got a bunch of recycled hardwood flooring that I plan to use for shop projects and possibly nicer furniture.  How should I remove the varnish? Would it be preferable to use the thickness planer or rip it with the table saw? Or is it worth waiting to get a jointer?  I don't want to dull my planer blades when a carbide-toothed saw blade would hold up better, or vice versa. "
476,Can veneer be patched or do you have to peel it off and start over?,"When trying to refinish a piece of furniture, a lot of older pieces had/have veneer and more often than not (in my experience) the veneer is damaged and chipping around the edges.  Is there a good way to patch it other than stripping it all off and starting over?  Would you 'cut' shapes out that can be matched and patched? The one big piece I've done I chipped it all off and it was a cedar chest underneath so was pretty all by itself.  Most stuff I throw away because it isn't worth the effort but many can be worth it.  Especially if part of the veneer can be salvaged or patched.  What are the common recommendations? "
477,How should I orient a spline along a long edge join?,"I glued up a 4' long dresser top last night, and ended up using a 1/4"" spline to line up the two 12"" wide sub-panels into one 24"" wide one.  I was using pine quarter-sawn boards, and for the spline I just ripped a 1/4"" wide strip from the end of one of the panels, since I had made them a bit oversized. So the spline had the same grain direction as the panels, except the growth rings are rotated 90Â°. Unfortunately I didn't really think about spline grain direction while I was gluing it up.    Am I going to run into problems with my 3/4"" wide spline expanding enough to crack the center joint on my table?  In the future, is it critical that I manufacture a long spline for an edge join with grain perpendicular, like in the image below? It seems like a huge hassle, since I'd have to have a super wide board or use dozens of little spline chunks.    (Image Source) "
478,Is it sensible to use a router for cutting large dados?,I'm working on some landscaping projects with interlocking halved joints. The material is 100x50mm treated pine so my cuts are 50x50mm.  I'm currently achieving my cuts by clamping several lengths together and using multiple passes with a Skilsaw as if it was a dado. This is working but the cleanup with chisel and rasp is quite time consuming. I'm considering using a router to speed things up but I have some questions before I spend money on chunky bits:   Is a 50mm-deep cut practical and safe with a hand-held router? Is there such thing as a deep (50mm+) straight bit with a pattern-following bearing? This will impact the type of jig I'll need to build. Will this actually save me any time?   I've had a look around at wobble blades and stacked dado sets but I can't find any which will cut a 50mm wide swath. That and I don't have access to a saw bench. 
479,Is there a procedure or equation to calculate optimal height of a seat based on a given person?,"I have a really bad back, and I find that sitting on hard surfaces is preferable to soft surfaces.  I'd like to figure out what the optimal height is for a seat for me so that I am not cutting off circulation by having my legs dangle, or exacerbating the bad back condition by having my feet too positively engaged to the floor.  Is there a commonly accepted wisdom with regards to seating height?  Is there a universal standard or is it something that can be calculated based on the situation?  I would assume the ergonomics of a person varies by that person. "
480,What's the difference between a sheet sander and random orbit sander?,"I'm looking for a sander and as I browse through the various offerings I can see that most manufactures offer both a sheet sander and a random orbit sander.  Aside from the shape of the sanding surface, are there any functional differences between the two?  What scenarios does each type excel at? "
481,Why and when should I wear a dust mask?,"I'm a handy man with limited woodworking projects these days.  I mostly use a circular saw, jig saw, and orbital sander to make crude storage.  Sometimes I cut MDF, etc.  I've seen it mentioned several times on this site that you should wear a dust mask.  Then I saw this answer which said, ""Dust collection is not an excuse not to wear a mask.""     Why does it seem mandatory to wear a dust mask?   When is it not mandatory to wear a dust mask?   I work mostly outside with a breeze as my dust collection, am I ok?   Is wearing a dust mask more important when using certain tools?   The types of wood that you should wear a dust mask for has already been discussed.  I'm asking in particular about work environment, situation, and type of work. "
482,How can I reduce the gloss of a varnished piece of furniture?,"I have a piece of furniture with a glossy varnish finish. I like the existing color and grain pattern, but I would prefer it to be a matte finish.  How can I accomplish this?  Does rubbing out varnish ever cloud the grain and reduce the visibility?    My current plan is to just buff out the varnish with sandpaper in increasing grits. Will this technique work? "
483,What are the implications of using multiple polyurethane coats?,"What are the pros and cons of applying more coats of polyurethane?  I know with more coats the flaws are amplified, but doesn't more coats protect the wood better? "
484,"What is the minimum thickness of plywood needed to support an adult on a 38"" span?","I have in the past dispensed with a box spring and used 1/2"" plywood to almost completely cover the mattress base. The advantage is that the mattress has uniform support and never shows the dents from the slats.  The main disadvantage is that 1/2"" is rather heavy for taking off on a weekly basis to vacuum under the bed.  Would I get away with 3/8"", or even with 1/4"", plywood? My hunch is that 1/4"" is plenty of thickness to support an average-weight (150-200 lb.) adult. But it has to also support the weight of the adult standing, for otherwise a simple exercise like changing the ceiling lamps would crack the base.  Rephrasing and summarizing: what is the fir/spruce plywood thickness needed to support an individual on a span of 38"" (half the span of a King-sized bed)? "
485,Wood Finishing - Beginner,"This is my first time doing woodwork, and after tons of research online, here's what I've understand, but I'll still need a little bit of help. What I'm building is a small shelf to be put on top of my desk to organize things up.  So from what I understand, this is the process of finishing wood (excluding the sanding part). Stain, then apply finish. And the finish that I can choose from are shellac, polyurethane, lacquer and varnish. Now I'm confused on which to use as a beginner in woodworking. I've seen those wood clear coat paint in my local hardware store, does it work the same way as other finishes?  Oh and also from many furnitures I've seen before, there's ugly brush strokes on the finishes, is there anyway I can prevent it and have a smooth finish? "
486,"If I mill / surface my own wood, will it warp as bad as pre-milled / surfaced wood from the store?","Wood bought from the local home center does usually not have straight edges (usually kinked), and is often warped (bowing being most prevalent). I was surprised to see that at my local hardwood dealer, too (they sell pre-milled 1x and 2x boards).   The selection at the hardwood dealer was much better, with the warping much less pronounced, but it got me thinking. If the hardwood dealer can't get straight, flat boards with their presumably bigger and better machines, how flat and straight can I get them at home with a smaller jointer and planer? How long can I expect them to stay that way? Are some wood species more apt to warp than others (I was looking at poplar)? "
487,"When sharpening, how do I assess what grit to start on?","My question is about sharpening edge tools such as plane irons or chisels.  How do I establish, when looking at a tool, what grit to start the sharpening process on?   It's clearly always possible to start on a very coarse grit and work my way up to fine grits and stropping, but in some cases some of that work at the coarser end is unnecessary.   How do I figure out when it's OK (and a time saver) to start at, say, 400 grit or 1000 grit? "
488,Leaving counterbore holes unfinished on exterior projects,"I hope this is clear. So part of an outdoor project I'm working on has a thing like this:     Those are all 2x4's. The vertical piece on the left is joined with pocket holes, not shown, not relevant. The blue/gray areas are 3/8"" diameter counterbore holes, about 1.75"" depth. The red things are epoxy coated deck screws. All faces including the ends are finished. The very bottom piece is pressure-treated fir, finished with exterior grade primer + latex paint. The other two pieces (the vertical and the piece with the holes) are untreated fir, finished with oil-based stain + exterior grade spar urethane. The holes face up; water could theoretically sit in them. All the pieces shown in the diagram are flush and you're looking at the wide faces of the 2x4's; there's no secret depth component to that drawing aside from the holes being drilled on the centerline of the wood.   My problem is this: I did drill the counterbore holes before finishing, but I didn't really get any urethane down into the holes. I put the whole thing together, then it rained, then it occurred to me that rain can get into the counterbore holes, where it comes into contact with raw wood. I observed that the water beaded up just fine on the finished surfaces, but soaked into the wood in the holes.  Now, my questions are:   Do I really need to seal up these holes? As in, do I really need to? Of course we don't want water soaking into the wood but given the relative size of the hole, and the fact that it doesn't rain constantly (i.e. there's time to dry, except in the winter if snow piles on), will I truly regret not finishing the holes? For hole B, it's pretty easy to do regardless. I could fill it with putty, sanding the finish off the top a bit for the putty to bind, then refinish that area. So regardless of question #1 I'll probably still do hole B. For hole A, this is actually the one I'm more concerned about. There doesn't appear to be a gap between the vertical piece and the horizontal but I wouldn't trust it to be water tight. The problem is I really don't want to disassemble that corner to fill in the hole, so: Could it still be a problem? Is there another way to seal that up?   The way I figure is, even if water gets in there, it's such a small surface area that it will eventually even out through the surrounding wood and ultimately dry back out through the hole.  For deep counterbore holes on exterior projects exposed to rain, is the effect of not finishing the inside of the hole negligible in the long run? If not, what will happen? What can I expect to see in a few years? "
489,Protecting wooden plant pot from water damage,"I am building a large container for plants, made of pine. Considering that the inside will be in direct permanent contact with moist earth, what is an appropriate treatment to prevent wood deterioration? Would a heavy-duty varnish (e.g., spar varnish) be a good choice? "
490,How to use a router to cut a thick wood board,"Having purchased a trim router just recently, I'm practicing some simple woodworking.  At the moment, I have a 4 feet x 4 feet plywood board (3/4 inch thick) that I want to separate into 4 square pieces of 2 feet x 2 feet (approximately, plus or minus an inch-ish accountable to kerf).  Should I go for it with the router using a Straight bit like this one? If so, how do I cut so deep as the board thickness (3/4 inch)? "
491,No rear clearance spring assisted lid hinge system,"I'm building a bench/coatrack for my entryway, and I'd like the bench to have a flip top lid that stays open and possibly has a soft close (soft close not a deal breaker). I'd like the rear of the lid to be as close to the wall as possible, so I'm looking for a hinge system that will make the rear of the lid kick back as little as possible. Hinges like this will be a problem:  I'm thinking of using a system like this:    Can I use this hinge for the spring assisted part instead of the one pictured?   Also what kind of hinge is pictured in the solution I'm thinking of using (not the assisted hinge but the other one)? How much clearance will it need in back? Is there a better solution?  Thanks a million in advance "

I'm a beginner to diy home improvement so any small tips/steps would be extremely helpful! 
493,Half lap joints with Dremell 231 Shaper/Router Table,"I'm trying to make half lap joints using Dremell 231 Shaper/Router Table. I need to cut away 5 mm depth  40x40 mm from a 10 x 40 mm wood rood (450mm length)   However, I'm unable to keep a consistent depth, and straight margin.  What would be the appropriate technique to be used for that ? What other tools should I use ?  This is the ""router table"" I have:    Additional information: wood is beech.  I'm trying to make a frame that it's going to be embedded in a drywall, with a lip that will be flush with the drywall, so the joins need to be precise.    "
494,Flattening the face of a board without using a jointer,"I've seen a lot of jigs to do edge jointing on a table saw or router, including this question. I haven't seen much for flattening one of the faces, though. If the board is narrow (less than ~3""), I can run it on the freshly-jointed edge through my table saw and flatten and square the face that way. But what about wider boards? Hand planes would work, of course, but are there other methods using a table saw, router, and/or jigs like there are for edge jointing? "
495,What is snipe on a thickness planer?,I heard of something with snipe on a thickness planer. Is this something that they all will do? Is there a way to adjust the planer to keep that from happening? What techniques can be used to stop this on the piece that you are working on? Can this be a problem? 
496,Waterproofing Wood With Left Over Polyurethane (Aesthetics irrelevant to project),So I know the off-the-cuff answer is you cannot (or should not) use Indoor Rated Poly to weather proof wood as the sun's UV will discolor the wood and other issues visually. This wood though is being used to stack firewood and the way it looks doesn't matter at all. I have about 3/4 gallon of left over Poly and 3/4 Gallon wood stain. Both are indoor use. I'd rather just use those then go buy something new.   My question is can I just go ahead and stain/poly the wood and stack my firewood on top? Will it help? I'm using Douglass Fir wood.    I also have leftover exterior paint but I'd rather not paint the boards. Just a thought.  
497,How to attach a one inch thick table top to two A shaped frames that are two inches thick,"I have a nice desk top that is probably pine? that I want to turn into a desk. I bought two A shaped frames at IKEA to attach to the table top. I have no idea how to attach the table top to the frames without the screw or whatever I use to attach it showing through the desk top? Do i use a really long, heavy screw that can go through the A frame at an angle, but doesn't go all the way through the desk top? Please help; I am new to woodworking, etc.  You can see this type of desk at:  [website]"
498,How can I sanitize wood?,"What can I do to wood before and after finishing a project to ensure that it is very clean and as safe as possible?  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't eat off my work bench. Sometimes the wood might have been in my garage for awhile, or I might not remember the source (was that something I found on the side of the road in someone's garbage?) What can I do to ensure that that cutting board or spatula or anything else that might get used in the kitchen is safe to touch food?  This would apply not just to using a food safe finish, but the unfinished piece as well. "
499,What to look for when buying a thickness planer,"When purchasing a thickness planer, what are some features that are essential? Some nice-to-haves? Anything that is just fluff, especially for a beginner woodworker?  I see specs indicating the number of cutting heads / knives, the rotational speed, one- or two-speed, width, material thickness, and a whole lot more that's a bit overwhelming. Which of these are important? Is there a big difference between the ""portable"" or ""benchtop"" planers as compared to the big floor-standing models (I now know there is with table saws!)?  I don't have a jointer, so the ability to use a planer sled to flatten faces of boards would be nice - is that just a function of the size of the opening? "
500,How can I salvage the ura on my japanese plane blade?,"I bought a Japanese plane a few years ago, and didn't really spend a lot of time researching before I started using and sharpening it. Now that I have a little more time for woodworking again, I unpacked the plane and noticed that the flat part of the back (ura?) of the plane blade is very large compared to 'model' photos online. Additionally, when I try to flatten the back, the left-most and right-most part of the edge doesn't get sharpened, as the back must be a bit convex?  Can I fix these two issues somehow? While googling I found some references to 'tapping out' the blade but I'm not quite sure how to proceed or whether it can even fix my problem. Ideally I'd like a link to a comprehensive guide or similar.  Here's a photo of my blade (ignore the sharpie lines).   This is the back of a 'model' blade ([website]"
501,Carving long curved recess,"I'm trying to create a curved coffee table leg - I'll bandsaw the profile, but then I'd like to give the face (the face created by the wood exposed by the bandsaw cut) a long concave recess.

502,Top coat poly makes other sides rough,"We're restoring some old furniture - sofas with a lot of carving, whole wood book shelves, et al. We've stripped the old varnish and are redoing the job with poly. We did 2 coats of PU sealer and 2 coats of PU Matt, all with a spray gun. Most of the wood's teak stained with walnut, some of it is rose wood, so we're getting a nice dark brown.  For some reason, when spraying the top coat say onto one side of say the sofa's arms / legs or a shelf's side, the other finished sides pick up rough grey patches. The contractor reckons it's air from the spray gun that's causing that and says it's inevitable when using matt PU. We'll be trying again by covering the finished sides with paper and painter's tape, but we can't do this with the sofa's arms / legs as easily.  We also tried wet sanding with 1500 sandpaper - which removed the roughness, but left the grey patches - followed with 3m finesse it paste wax; it's too shiny for our liking and it raises the wood's grain, the grey patches / new scratches are now visible.  This is the brand of PU we're using: [website]Is this normal? If so how do we avoid these rough grey patches in the first place?     "
503,How should I protect dyed wood from interior UV light?,"I'm making a watch box that I will dye black with Tranfast wood dye. I'd like to follow up with clear glossy polyurethane. However, I don't know how to protect this finish because the dye's label warns of fading in UV light.   Does the UV light from fluorescent bulbs degrade dyes? If so, will annual polyurethane coatings protect against this damage, or do I need something stronger? "
504,Edge glued panels vs. plywood for furniture,"I'm in the process of designing a Murphy bed (wall bed) and most plans I've found so far recommend the use of 3/4 inch (19mm) thick plywood. While some like the look of plywood, I was considering some options closer to solid wood.  I live in Germany and edge glued solid wood panels are commonly sold in various sizes (though limited in breadth) and thicknesses.   When comparing equally thick birch plywood and edge glued birch wood panels, what should I take into consideration in terms of their different properties?  I was planning on using edge glued panels (cutting down 2000mm x 600 x 18mm panels) for the visible parts of the bed.  Update: The murphy bed I plan is based the following plan  Edge glued birch:  "
505,What type of hinge is this?,"I have a hinge and I'm having a bear of a time replacing it.  It's from an old Bakers box and it's the cabinet/tray hinge and has a peculiar shape.  It hangs down a bit so the door is actually lower than the hinge and it can create a seal.  Here is a link to what the bakers box looks like:  pic of bakers box  Here is a pic of the hinge.  It's about 1.5"" across and .75"" wide  Here is the side of the hinge   What is this hinge?  Any ideas where I can find a replacement? "
506,Lathe faceplate - ID and use,"I've bought a second-hand lathe to try woodturning. Question 1. What make is the lathe, in case I need spares?  there are no markings on it at all. About 1m long, cast iron hollow rectangular pylon at head end, twin round rails to which tailstock and tool support clamp. Twin square rails as a base. Motor on hinged plate so belt drive is self-tensioning (which is neat).It has a 3/4"" x 10tpi thread on the nose(?) to which I'd mount a chuck.   Q2. The faceplate that came with it has threaded holes on the radii....M6 thread fits them. I'm wondering, why threaded? "
507,Replacing hardware store 2xâs in plans with hardwood,"Iâm looking to build a bed soon. We both liked the farmhouse bed from Ana White, so wanted to go with that general design, but weâd like it to be made from hardwood.  I picked up a load of rough sawn cherry locally (air dried).  My question is about board thickness.  I already plan to laminate for the posts, but Iâm thinking of the side rails. Is 4/4 going to be strong enough (6â wide)? should I laminate boards for that, use additional support posts around the middle of the side rail, or should it be good?  The plan is to use mortise and tenon for the side rails to attach to the posts, and also will have ~2x3 board behind the side rails running the length as support for the slats that I can also attach to the posts.  Long term, Iâd like to place a hardwood dowel in the joint, but not until we buy our house, where it doesnât need to be taken apart again.  Thanks!  Edit: Link to inspiration plans [website]"
508,How do I fix this part of my desk?,"I got this desk from a friend that rescued it from the dump. There's a lot of rescue efforts that I'm putting into it. Not the least is fixing the finish that's totally gross.  I started scraping the finish off of one of the drawers - it went a lot better than the belt sander I took to the desktop.   One of the biggest problems for me is that the drawers on one side are pinched up against each other. At first I thought maybe I just had them put in the wrong sides or something but then I pulled the drawers out and started inspecting this desk closer and I discovered this:    I didn't need a straight edge to tell me that part was warped as all heck.  Here's some other shots of the affected part:        How do I fix something like this? I know there are a couple of nails holding it in place, and looks to be some wood glue. That block to the left of the leg is also some kind of runner/support that goes all the way to the back of the desk.  Should I use a hammer to knock it out? Pry bar?  Obviously I'd like to salvage as much of this as possible - I'm also not sure how I'd bend the wood back, and I'm pretty sure just flipping it would just cause some other issues. "
509,Submerge wood in a barrel to improve it - Is my wife right that this is a bad idea?,"I was about to submerge fresh pieces of wood of various types in our barrel filled with water - to let the saps come out and after some time get good wood. These pieces will be used for small objects, kitchen utensils, carvings etc. And some outdoors elements that to become durable against rain.  But then my wife told me not to do it, because this should be done in a stream of water. Like the lumbermill nearby, they have their logs lying in their water stream for a few years and it becomes very good wood. My wife says that if I do it in our barrel, the barrel will be full of the wood saps soon and when the water isn't refreshed this will attract things like bugs and rot, etc. It sounds sensible but neither of us is an expert on soaking wood, I never did it before. Where I live (The Netherlands) This was a common practice throughout the ages but nowadays it is done rarely, which is why it's hard for me to find resources on it.  For instance I couldn't find any info on a second question I have; I remember once hearing that the best watered wood is the oak that was lying on the deepest bottom of the lakes. I remember the reason for that was that the deepest parts of the water have the least amount of oxygen in it, so the watering process takes place anaerobically. This makes the best quality wood, better than watering in undeep water.  So I was wondering: perhaps if I close the lid of the barrel airtight, the process will be anaerobic aswell? And produce better wood? I'm hoping to find some people here who have experience with soaking wood to answer my questions. I also find very little information resources online, especially in English. I don't seem to find the official phrase for this in English (in dutch it's called ""gewaterd hout"" but when I search in English I can only wood people who soak their wood for the BBQ grill...)  So these are my questions:   Is it a good idea to use a barrel to soak wood? If so, is it a good idea to close the lid? And how much should the water/wood ratio at least be? Should I refresh the water once in a while?  "
510,Oiling Triggers on Power tools?,"The triggers on my green Bosch power tools are all extremely precise and they feel very lubricated. My Metabo drill on the other hand has a terrible trigger. It feels like plastic grinding on plastic. Fine control is impossible. Hence I use the Bosch drill for small screws. Is there way to fix this?  The Metabo is new and it's always been like this, so this is not a wear issue. Similar or same models at the store also have this problem, so it probably isn't a manufacturing defect.  See the video: Metabo trigger (YouTube). "
511,Vacuum pre-filter for large objects,"My vacuum setup currently consists of a 5hp shop vac (orange) with 2.5â hoses, a hepa filter, a cyclone pre-filter (dust deputy), and automatic power.   It works very well except the hose often clogs with large objects, particularly long thin slivers of material from the table saw or the occasional bit of masking tape. The problem points seem to be the joint with the cyclone filter and the outlet from the table saw, as well as inside the cyclone itself (when a very long object greater than the diameter of the filter tries to enter and hits the opposite wall). Once an object gets stuck, smaller things tend to get hung up on it until it becomes clogged enough for me to notice.  Is there a solution to this? I donât mind things getting hung up on the tool sides but the cyclone joint is kind of a pain. Is there some additional type of pre-filter system that can drop out extremely large objects that make it through the hose before they reach the cyclone, or some other solution? I canât really increase my hose diameter; I donât have the budget or the space for it and the majority of my tools (and the cyclone) are 2.5â or smaller anyways.  Iâd post pics but I donât have any right now. "
512,Rule of thumb for Power Tool Durability,"We all know the basic rule: If you use a tool rarely, buy a homeworker quality power tool or a cheap one. If you use a tool often, buy a pro or semi-professional power tool.  Allow me to summarize some european brands into four categories:   Cheap stuff: Lux Tools, Okay Power Homeworker Quality: Bosch green, Einhell red Semi-pro: Makita, Metabo, Bosch blue (The cheaper ones) Pro: Makita, Metabo, Bosch blue, DeWalt, Hilti   Personally I buy drills and stationary tools from the semi-pro category and tools for particular tasks that stay in the shelf most of the time (Belt Sanders, Handplaner, Plunge Router) are of homeworker quality (mostly Einhell). But that is just my personal opinion. I'm looking for numbers.  I've had these never ending discussions with my boss long time ago what would be more beneficial: Buying 10 Einhell red drills or 3 Makita drills for the same price.  Having more drills is great. One breaks? Theres a box over there filled with drills, get a new one. More people join to work? No problem, we have enough drills. The downsides would be more frequent visits to the store to fix or buy new drills and of course transportation and storage of a large number of power tools.  We've had a situation where were we required over a thousand screws for the floor of a terrace and we only had three screw drivers. One guy was drilling the holes, the other two were busy with the screws and the rest were just standing around pretending to be doing something intelligent.  I want to roughly narrow it down to how long each of the categories mentioned above will last. Hours (for any tool), charges (for battery tools), Number of screws (drills)... the variables don't really matter. As the title says I'm looking for a general rule of thumb if possible for all power tools. Also for large stationary tools: If your bandsaw dies and you don't have a big car you've got a problem.  Here is a rule of thumb I got from reading some different articles but I doubt the credibility of these numbers:   Cheap tools: 5 hours average operation time until failure Homeworker tools: 50 hours Semi-Pro tools: Somewhere inbetween I guess Pro tools: 1000 hours+  "
513,how to glue tiny pieces of wood,I'm making a wall-art thing from some laser cut veneers. I need to glue some small shapes onto a large backing board. The pieces are as small as around 7mm in diameter.  What would be the best glue for the job? I'm not sure if regular wood glue would be enough. Would some kind of contact adhesive work?  For some of the bigger pieces I'm thinking of using hot-melt glue. Is there a way to do fine work with a hot melt glue gun?  The piece will be varnished in the end but right now the wood doesn't have anything on it. And it will be indoors (hanging on a wall). 
514,Staining pine table top how can I get rid of this spot,How can I get rid of this spot? I sanded and thought I had gotten rid of it. I did not use mineral spirits before applying stain. Any idea on how to get this spot to darken? 
515,How do biscuits work?,"Oftentimes I see a video such as this one:  At 2:04 the maker is using a biscuit slot cutting machine on two different surfaces. He does not seem to take care to measure carefully and align the slots on each surface. I'm not singling this guy out at all; I see many videos from many countries, and none of the woodworkers I have seen using this technique have bothered as far as I can tell.   So do biscuit joiners not actually need to be perfectly aligned, the way dowels do? Or is there some trick that I'm not seeing? "
516,Does the edge profile of a tabletop really matter?,"I'm building a dining table and I try to follow the ""form follows function"" philosophy. I need to decide what type of edge to put on my table (round over, bullnose, ogee, beveled, etc). I know I at least want a slight round over to prevent edge splintering, but other than that do edge profiles even matter, from a functional perspective? Are they purely aesthetic, or do they affect the comfort of the guests? Is end grain affected? Some work better as drip edges? "
517,Repairing small crack in cutting board,Yesterday I noticed a small crack (about 2 cm long) in my cutting board. I'm not sure what happened since I frequently oil my board with mineral oil. Also note that the split is not on a glue line.   I then filled the gap with melted beeswax to prevent water getting inside the gap but isn't filling it with glue a better solution?  I've seen that many recommend titebond 3 for this kind of repair but I was thinking that epoxy may be a better option. I'm not worried about food safety since it's a small gap on the edge of the board and food won't usually get there.   Any suggestions? Thank you   
518,Sealing and reinforcing particle board,"I am making some picture frames from an old table. The table top is oak slats on top of particle board. Iâve sliced the table and trimmed the slices with walnut, and cut rabbets in the frames. Like this:        Prior to adding the trim, the slices are extremely fragile, as the oak slats are held in place only by a few nails (most now cut off) and some drops of very old glue. I dropped one 2 feet and it split into three pieces; they canât support their own weight if held by one end. The trim, however, takes care of this.  So the cross sections are:    Now, I need to:   Strengthen the particle board so it doesnât chip easily. Seal it so it doesnât expand and crumble so much in humidity or if it happens to get damp. Surface B needs to be able to hold the adhesive from gum tape, for mounting the contents of the frame. This means it needs to be a bit smoother (the rough surface of ldf doesnât provide much contact area), not fall apart when wet (gum tape is water activated), and not be weaker than the tape itself (tape does no good if it rips the surface itself off).   I can only really do stuff to surface A and B.   How can I seal, strengthen, and prep the particle board surfaces?  Shellac seems to make it less crumbly but isnât good enough. Polyurethane soaks right in and doesnât leave the surface smooth, although I suppose I could do tons of thick coats until it has a resin-filled appearance but that will take a long time and could get messy. The other thought I had was to just smear a thick layer of wood glue all over it, let it dry, and sand/route it flat.   I donât really want to trim the back if I donât have to because I donât want the frame to be thicker and also surface A would be difficult to cover.  What can I do? "
519,Can a bad mouth plane be saved?,"I recently bought a 10$ block plane just because it had a depth adjustment knob unlike the other block plane that I had.  I took it out of the box, carefully took out the blade and sharpened it using my oil stone as good as I could. Then I installed the blade and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't set the blade to protrude evenly across the width of the mouth. I had a similar issue with my other block plane which proved to be the blade not being square (the edge was not at perfectly 90 deg to the sides).   Looking more closely, HORROR! The mouth is bad. I mean the mouth is not square to the sides of the plane.  Should I try to repair it? If so, how would you recommend? Or should I try to take it back to the shop where I bought it?  Here's some pics:        Looks like this emoticon:      Update: I took it back to the store the next day and obtained a refund. Will get a Juuma next time (Juuma is Luban is WoodRiver is ...) "
520,When is it best to use kiln-dried vs. air-dried vs. green wood in a project?,"Kiln dried wood is usually recommended for woodworking projects since it's more stable than green and air dried lumber.  On the other hand, I've been told kiln dried wood is bad for lathe work, and in fact green wood is best for turning.  Air dried lumber seems to be considered workable but perhaps not ideal for anything.  Does this pretty much sum it up, or are there other applications such as carving in which a certain moisture level is ideal? Is there any case in which air-dried lumber is preferable over both kiln-dried and green wood? "
521,With a pneumatic nailer what is more important the quality of the nailer or the nails?,"I needed/wanted a small pneumatic nailer for assembling small wood construction. I purchased an inexpensive nailer and nails at the local discount store, and found the nails often jammed.  Within a few attempts the nailer became unusable from damage caused by nails jamming.  I went to DIY box store and bought a quality (I did some research first) nailer and quality nails. This works fine, and I am very happy with the results. But I wonder if I I really need to buy the expensive nailer and the expensive nails.    Was it the nailer or the nails that caused the issue?  Could I reliably use inexpensive nails in an expensive nailer, or can I reliably use expensive nails in an inexpensive nailer?  Do both the nailer and the nails need to be quality?  "
522,Correct Method to Nail Casing Corners,When installing casing trim around windows and door frames the corners are normally cut in a miter. Finish nails are normally used to fasten the adjoining casing pieces to the window/door frame and into the wall structure. My question is if additional nails should be used to nail the mitered corners of two trim pieces together and if so what is the proper method to apply the nails?  Along with this is the additional question as to whether the miter joint should also be glued with yellow woodworkers glue? 
523,"Evening reflectivity of a finish after ""finishing the finish""","I recently installed butcher block countertops in my kitchen. Several weeks ago, I put four coats of varnish on them, but (as always) they ended up with dust nibs. So yesterday, I wet sanded with 400 grit sandpaper (using mineral oil and water as a lubricant). That made the surface very smooth to the touch, but left an uneven sheen across the surface because the dust nibbed areas (i.e., the high points) were matte while the crevices were satin (the luster I chose for the finish). Normally, one would keep sanding until the sheen is even, but I figured I'd just add a top layer of finish thinned with mineral spirits (i.e., a wiping varnish). Theoretically, applying another layer of satin finish should make the sheen even.  Alas, it did not. Look at the picture below. Why has my top coat not evened out the finish? How can I even out the sheen?  A couple things I have considered.   Bump up the sheen to semi-gloss. The top coat was a different brand of varnish, so maybe the undercoat (the un-dust-nibbed part) was more shiny than the top (thinned) coat, which could cause this diversity of sheen.  Bump down the sheen to matte. Maybe dampening everything to the dust-nibbed sheen is the best way to go (for the opposite reasons stated in #1).  Keep adding coats. This is, after all, thinned varnish I'm applying. Maybe it will take several more coats to even the sheen.  Live with it :(   So...any ideas?   "
524,Using smooth dowel pegs,Commercially available dowel pegs come with a spiral groove around their outside surface. How important is this grooving?   This comes to bear in the case when using smooth dowel stock to make ones own dowel pegs. Should one always buy the commercial grooved pegs or are DIY smooth pegs just as good? 
525,What woods or wood materials are unsafe for use in animal cages?,"I want to build wooden toys/houses/things for caged pets, such as Degus, Hamsters, etc.  I'm aware that there are chemicals and glues used to make some wood products, such as MDF which make the dust created by cutting it somewhat toxic to human health.    How could I select an appropriate wood or wood material for my animal cage, considering that the animals may chew on them?  Are MDF and other plywoods safe, or do they contain toxins that may be dangerous for pets if they are ingested in small quantities? "
526,Optimum amount of hearing protection?,"Wood-working tools can be very loud.  Noise levels of 104 - 110 dB have been measured in real-world use.  (Theoretically, the noise levels are supposed to be measured one meter away from the source of the noise.  One meter is 3' 3 3/8"".)  There are a few forms of hearing protection available.  For example:   Squishy ear-plugs for putting in one's ear canals.  Typical earplugs are rated for about 32 dB of noise reduction. Headset-like earmuffs.  Typical earmuffs are rated for about 29 dB of noise protection.   Is it considered best practice to wear both ear-plugs and earmuffs when working with power tools?  Or does the combined noise reduction make it so hard to hear non-tool noise that you will not hear other potential dangers? "
527,How do I completely disassemble a hand plane to clean it and then reassemble it?,"I have a block plane that I picked up from Lowes a few months ago.  I took it apart recently to clean the blade but when I tried to put it back together I was unable to get consistent results when passing the plane over the wood.  There was significant tear-out, leading me to believe I may have put the blade in wrong?  I've looked for comprehensive instructions on how a plane is disassembled/reassembled but have not found a good canonical source of this information.  Can anyone provide some details in this regard? "
528,How does one measure stock for miter cuts?,"I have tried unsuccessfully to make picture frames on a few occasions.  I find that when I am trying to make a miter joint, I err on the side of caution and start ""long"" and trim my way down to square.  I feel like this is not the best way to execute a miter joint for a picture frame.    What is the proper way to measure for a miter joint?  Are you supposed to measure your stock from the outside of the miter (outer edge) or the inside corner of the miter?  Are there any helpful tips on this process to make it easier? "
529,Is green or steamed wood better for bending?,"Ignoring time &amp; space issues, focusing only on the strength &amp; durability of the wood after the bend has set, what is going to give better results?  We know from the answers at Other than speed does kiln drying have any advantage over natural aging? that natural aging has advantage in the quality of the end product.  In this case though we are intentionally altering the curvature of the wood.     Bending and storing green wood (frames, canes, keels, etc) in its final form Steaming naturally or kiln dried wood as above, for the short time it takes to dry.  "
530,Which woods work well with ammonia?,I love the traditional look of quarter sawn oak and the patina finish achieved by gassing the wood with ammonia. Are there other woods that react well by gassing with ammonia? If there are could you say what the effect is? 
531,Can I steam-bend a piece of wood with a free-floating end?,"I've been working on creating a wooden hockey stick. The blade of the hockey stick needs a slight curve and bend to it.  I have a small steam box set up and have created a vice with different-length teeth in it. After steaming the wood, I place it in the vice, close the teeth, and let it sit for a day or two. The curve created  by the teeth in the vice is much more exaggerated than I need, and when I remove it from the vice, the blade springs back a bit.  However, over time, the blade continues to straighten. After a week or so, it's almost to it's original straightness.  Most steam-bending applications that I've seen have both ends of the bent wood fixed so even though the wood wants to spring back, it can't.  Is it possible to steam-bend a piece of wood to have it remain bent without fixing both ends of the piece? Will all wood eventually straighten over time if left alone? "
532,Any tips on reconditioning/using an old benchtop jointer?,"I've got an old belt-driven  bench-size (jobsite?) jointer -- 6"" bed, infeed/outfeed tables each about 11"" long -- that I've been storing for a friend. Never got around to  getting it mounted with the motor and a belt installed and blades sharpened/adjusted... I'm presuming that, outside of the belt and size issues, tuning it up would be just like tuning a full-size unit.  The big plus, of course, is that I already have it on hand, and jointers aren't cheap. The minus is that it'll be a bit of a pain to make useful, and those short tables presumably limit the beast's accuracy.  So: Does anyone have enough experience with these small models to opine on whether it's worth the effort, or if I should continue to try to get by with planer/tablesaw jointing tricks until I'm ready to budget for another Serious Tool, and leave this as a museum piece? And if I do try to put it in use, are there any tricks to getting the most out of it?     "
533,110 vs 220 table saws and jointers,"Both my table saw and my jointer have the option to be run as either 110, or 220.  I am wondering (assuming I have my choice of plugin's in a shop) is one better than the other.  I've heard that 220 will actually use less energy and be easier on the motor.    If I can convert to 220, should I?  Is it more efficient and easier on the electric motors? "
534,Proper spacing between floor boards to allow expansion?,"I'm building a platform out of redwood to serve as the floor of a backyard playhouse. The wood comes from 2x4s that have been ripped to 3/4"" planks. The temperature will range from 30&deg;F to 115&deg;F with wide swings in humidity. Should I butt the boards up against each other or space them? If I space them, how much? "
535,"What do Kerf, Dado, Rabbet, Tenon and Mortise mean?","I'm looking for an explanation of the terms.  Dovetail I can pretend to understand, as it is what it is. But Kerf? Dado? Rabbet? Tenon and Mortise? There are of course many more but these are my current concern.  I know what a kerf is, but the name does not match common parlance and to my mind begs an explanation? "
536,Why don't most modern drill presses use some form of VFD instead of manual belt-changes to adjust speed?,"I was honestly surprised to see that most modern drill presses still use belts and pulleys (and the manual changing of them) to accomplish variable speeds. Does this design offer certain benefits that other less cumbersome methods don't? Or have drill press manufacturers just been slow to adopt newer technologies that could address this?  With all the LEDs and lasers that seem to be appearing on newer models, it strikes me as silly that they still sport a stack of pulleys and belts for part of its core function.  VFD explained at wikipedia. "
537,Do wood cuts matter for wands?,"I am having a wand made, and I wondered if wood cuts mattered.  I heard rift sawn wood is the best for strength in boards, but they only receive pressure from the surface.  A wand would only receive pressure on the long part and not the ends, but it would receive pressure from all around.  Is rift sawn still the strongest cut?  Does it matter?  Money is not an issue.  I care only about strength and durability over time. "
538,Finish for a wand,"I am having a wand made and I wondered what the best finish would be.  Money is not an issue, and neither is skill.  I do not care about the aesthetics (color/scrapes), but need it to not come off.  Im not going to be refinishing it.  It would not be exposed to sun often, but may be taken outside about once or twice a year.  Thus it would not experience much weather change because the house stays relatively the same temperature.  However, it would be exposed to humidity and wear from hands.  Can varnish wear off by rubbing?  I need the strongest finish for these specifications.  Any recommendations?  I would need a type (example: water polyurethane) not a brand. "
539,How can I make this faux inlay?,"I was looking for pallet inspired projects and I came along this picture of a small box. It has a nice clean inlay of a scorpion.    Image from LumberJocks  Many users on the forum, where this picture was posted, were very interested in how this was made. The OP eventually responded:     I masked, cut, and spray painted the scorpion on the second box. I use Krylon brand spray paint.   Wondering if I could get a couple of points cleared up in how this was done.    The lines look very defined. How might the mask / template been made? I would have expected the paint to bleed or something. The colour of the inlay looks non uniform. Is that just some creative sanding or is something more sinister at work?   Mostly I am curious as what I can do to get clean lines like that. Forgive me if this is very simple. It just seems more robust than a cardboard cutout.  "
540,Curved wood pealing away from table edge,"I've recently acquired an old oak table from my parents. I'm going to refinish it, but I have a problem to deal with first. I doubt I can describe it better than the pictures, so without further adieu...      This thin length of wood runs half way around the table, then there is a break for the leaves, then another length on the other side. I believe my father tried to mend this with wood glue and clamps a few times, so that might be what some of that gunk is. Does anyone have advice on how to remedy this? It is salvageable, or should I look to recreate it? Thanks in advance! "
541,Differences between hardwood and softwood?,what is the main differences between hardwood and softwood? since some books say it is just to do with presences of pores or not. so i was confused that which wood contains pores or not? 
542,"Finish raised the ""grain""?","I recently put together a stationary combination work bench and cabinets out of 5/8 particle board and 9/8 ""benchtop"" (which appears to just be thick particle board). I previously made a work table from the same ""benchtop"" and applied an oil-based polyurethane finish to it without issue. However I had some water-based polyurethane around that I wanted to use up, both in matte and satin finish, so I applied a coat of the water-based matte finish to my new tops.  To my surprise, the smooth face of the particle board became quite rough. Can I treat this like regular wood and just sand it back down before applying another coat of the water-based polyurethane, or do I need to try something else for my next coat?  The rough look of this combination work bench and cabinet is in this shot of the plans below, although I made a number of small changes on the fly and haven't updated the plans to match. The purple bits are intended to be slide-out drawers, and the teal bits are intended to be slide out shelves (that I'll probably mount at mixed heights), but I haven't built either of those yet.    Again, my question is about re-smoothing the ""benchtop"" particle board that the water-based polyurethane seems to have raised, whether another coat will cause more problems after I do so. (Or if I need to just cover it with a layer of hardboard.)  Also, I'm thinking of priming and possibly painting the rest of this cabinet; do I have to worry about raising the ""grain"" there? "
543,What is the old-school way of smoothing a curved surface?,"I have heard that the old-school way of creating a flat surface is to use a hand plane, and that if you use the right tools, you may not even have to sand because the surface is so smooth. Can I use a flat hand plane to smooth an flatten a curved surface? Is there a tool specifically for it?  The surface in mind is a U shaped stool top, so there is only a single curve, though I have to handle both the inside and the outside.  I know I can just sand it, and that's what I plan to do if I don't have an alternative. Is this the easiest/classical way of handling such a surface? "
544,Rough polyurethane job.,I applied poly after staining what I thought was a smooth surface pine board. Rough when first coat dried. Sanded it lightly and is fairly smooth. I want to apply another coat but dust is sticking to some semi rough spots. Afraid to sand further and get into stain. Should I keep going to completely smooth out? How do I remove dust b4 next coat of poly? 
545,Ridgid palm router microadjustment drift,"I had to surface some boards, and Woodworld is having classes this week so they can't get to it.  This seemed like a good opportunity to use some parts I had from a CNC build a few years ago, so I made an incredibly over-engineered router sled:    Which works amazingly well, except for when the microadjustment on the (Ridgid) palm router randomly drifts due to the vibration in the whole assembly when the router is running.  I can put some tape over the dial to (maybe) keep it from moving, but is there a better approach I'm missing here? Other than get a better router? (I have a PC 2 1/2 HP, but it seemed a little heavy for this, and I'd rather not have it semi-permanently anchored to the assembly.) "
546,Mitigating static shocks from a Festool router,I am using a Festool router with a 1-1/2 Amana straight bit to create breadboard tenons on a table top. This appears to be generating a lot of static electricity -- evidenced by the jolts I receive if my fingers get too close to the metal parts of the body.    Any thoughts on how to combat this? Aside from wrapping copper wire around the router and connecting it to an electrical ground? 
547,The Tools used on this cane?,"  What were the tools used to achieve what was done here? Namely the stripping off of all the bark that used to be over the white-ish parts. Note that the top portion is smooth and sort of transitions into a gradient that seems like it was carved by hand? I also would like to know how the bark was stripped away from the scarred wood so cleanly, I would assume this was not done by hand but I'm no good at this.   "
548,Uniform oak dying: attenuate the grain,"I am replacing a small section of oak flooring (I believe it's European oak) and am at the stage of colour matching.  I have found a dye which, after three applications, gives the correct colour. However, in the existing flooring, the grain doesn't stand out very much - the colour is quite uniform. Whereas when I dye the new wood the grain is much more accentuated.  Question: is there a way to lessen the darkening of the grain?  Would it work for me to apply a grain filler first? Or a sand sealer? Ideally I don't wish to alter the way the wood feels to the touch. "
549,How to stain hickory,"I have hickory cabinets that I bought with the intent of staining a moderately dark reddish brown to go with adjacent woodwork, but found that the wood isn't accepting the (regular oil-based) stain except in the softest parts of the grain; it just all wipes off leaving minimal color. Sanding a test surface with 80 grit (orbital sander) helped a little bit but not enough to get a result I like. Are there techniques to open the grain (maybe water?) and get it to accept the stain better? Or do I need to switch to dyes or something? "
550,"What is the clamping force of a ""T-bar"" sash clamp (or how can I work it out)?",I'm trying to compare some different types of clamps.   I have some of these: [website]and some of these: [website]in my workshop and I'd like to know which are best to use when requiring the highest possible clamping pressure. The site linked above shows the lever-arm clamps as having 8500N of clamping force but I can't find a value for a screw-operated sash clamp as shown in the second link. My gut says the screw clamp will have a higher strength but is there a general value for this type of clamp or can I calculate it somehow? 
551,"Is a natural edge actually natural, or is it a man-made feature?","In the past I've seen many beautiful pieces making use of a ""natural edge"", such as this: [website]The term natural edge seems to be applied to the very bumpy organic shape of the edge, which is different from live edge which refers to the slab going up to the bark or cambium layer.  I always assumed these went together, but now that I'm looking to give something like this a try and have been looking at live edge wood slabs to purchase, I've noticed that the edge seems relatively flat under the bark; or at least it doesn't have nearly as much variation as show in the photos.  Especially once the bark is peeled off with a draw knife.  Though I've only really looked at a few species of local trees.  Is there term live edge actually referencing a natural feature that some woods have?  Or is it a term that actually refers to an artificially chiseled edge made to look organic?  How does one create a table with a natural edge like this? "
552,Remove twist from plank without reducing thickness,"I have a 5/4"" x 8"" x 6' plank of cherry with a twist on one end. The twist is only about 18"" long. When you lay it on a flat surface the corner was raised about 1/4"". I tried soaking the board in my hot tube for about 3 hours, (about 130F water). Then I wrapped it in an old blanked, laid it on the garage floor, put a piece of plywood on top of it, and drove over it with the car. I left it there overnight (about 10 hours). This morning I removed the car, unwrapped it, and it's still twisted exactly the same! My next thought is I need hotter water, so I have to come up with a container to soak at least 18"" of the board in 212F water, and then try the car again. Any thoughts? Do I need to soak it for a longer time? Or let dry with the car on it for longer? It was still slightly wet when I removed the car this morning. "

Assuming I want to hog the deepest widest dado possible in one cut, what characteristics do I want? Put aside buy a bigger router arguments for this question. Assume relatively soft material like pine, cedar.    Is carbide going to perform better than HSS? Will a spiral bit perform better than a flat bit? Will an up cut spiral bit perform better than a downward or combination bit? Will a 3 flute straight bit perform better than a 2 flute bit?  "
554,countersinking screws,"I still don't understand about countersinking screws. I have been in lowes and home depot and have never seen packages that say countersinking screws.

555,"Wired my shop to 220v, can I buy table saws rated for 230-240v?","I just recently built a new shop. I had it wired for 110V and 220V. I have been thinking of upgrading to a better table saw and noticed a few that say they are 230V or 240V, does that mean I need to change my 220V? or will it still work on my 220V ? "
556,"Hitachi electric miter saw leaves a strange, slightly undulating non-square edge","I own a Hitachi C10FCE2 10-inch miter saw, it is my first miter saw. I'm a woodworking beginner but learning fast. I recently installed a ""Makita A-93681 10-Inch 80 Tooth Micro Polished Mitersaw Blade"" to replace the pretty crappy blade it came with.  I just noticed today while cutting some 3/4"" cherry for a box that the miter saw isn't cutting a flat edge, even though the edge seems to be square. I've calibrated all of my tools to an obsessive degree. I have several accurate engineer's squares, double squares and combo squares that all agree with each other, and they (plus a digital angle gauge) all agree that the miter saw blade is perfectly perpendicular to the back fence and the floor. I didn't really expect a discrepancy, so I hadn't been meticulously checking the resulting wood. Thus, I don't actually know whether this problem has always been here, or if it appeared some time down the line. I only bought it a few months ago, and the blade just a few weeks ago.  The ""problem"" I speak of is not that the cuts are off square in the traditional sense. A try square doesn't show significant deviation from square. However, when I place the two halves of a fresh-cut bit of wood together, they don't line up smoothly along the entire surface. There's sort of a gap there that is most prominent on one side. There's also some blade marks that are deeper than they should be, so much so that I can feel some parts of the end grain are a few thous higher than others.  I switched to my crosscut sled after noticing the problem and my ends are nice and square and flat again. Does anyone know what this is, if it can be fixed or if I need to dump the saw and/or the blade? Is it my technique, machine setup/calibration, a hardware fault or something else like I messed up installing the blade? If the blade is the culprit, I might still be in the return window for Amazon. If I had a shooting board I'd probably just clean up my ends, but until then I depend on a clean cut right off the saw.  FYI, all parts of the saw are tight with no play/wiggle where there shouldn't be. My technique is to push the wood against the back fence and down on the widest part of the saw bed, clamp the wood down, spin the saw up to speed, slowly drop the saw through the wood while applying light pressure down and back to keep it square, stop when it reaches bottom, wait for it to stop, then lift it.  I took some pictures of the gap and also the end grain, though the saw marks probably don't even show up in the pics.    Man I've spent way too many words describing this. "

558,How to neaten holes in plywood with hand tools?,"I'm making window apertures in 12mm plywood (it's birch-faced) for a doll's house.  I'd like the window and door holes to be neat.   I could use a router for this and then chisel the corners square, but I'd prefer a less noisy approach (I mostly only have time to work on this in the evenings and don't want to wake my kids up).  The edges of the plywood I've carefully squared with a No. 5 plane, and that has worked well, but of course that's not practical for small holes as the plane won't fit.  Would a rasp (then filing or sanding) do the job?   Or would it tear out the birch facing?   If yes for the rasp, what type would be a good choice (I don't own any, else I could have tried it out instead of asking). "
559,Glue for butcher's blocks,"I have made a chopping board for my kitchen out of some sort of hard dark wood. I don't know what it was. Because there was a crack in the product, I chiselled a slot down the crack and then glued a piece of wood into the slot, so that the crack was no longer there.   It works OK. Many months later the piece of wood is still firmly stuck into that slot. But whenever I wash the board with water and soap, the glue becomes visible, as though it is returning to its uncured state. A couple of questions:   Is this safe for food preparation area?  What kind of glue should I be using for this? "
560,"Can I spray ""brushing lacquer""?","At my local home improvement store, they only have spray cans of lacquer and brushing lacquer(Minwax clear brushing lacquer). I'm thinking it would be cheaper and faster if I could just use the quarts of brushing lacquer in an actual spray gun instead of buying a bunch of spray cans.  I am trying to get a thick coat of lacquer over stained wood panels.  What makes the lacquer for brushing instead of spraying? And is there any problems that might arise from using brushing lacquer directly in a spray gun? "
561,Making removable marks on walls for e.g. cabinet installation,"I'm building and installing various cabinets and shelving units around the house, and when it's time to install them, knowing the exact stud and cross-bracing locations is very helpful.  I have an electronic stud finder that works well enough. I often want to mark the stud locations with an easily removable mark because the mark location may not be hidden by the cabinet, so I've been using chalkboard chalk. The problem is, it's not easily visible on many painted surfaces.  I was thinking of using colored chalk, just regular Crayola kids chalk to create a more visible mark. Is that a sensible thing to do?  I was wondering:   Is there a more specialized chalk suitable for that job? Am I going to have trouble getting colored chalk off the kitchen or bedroom wall if it has flat paint? Is there some other standard way of marking stud locations with a removable mark?  "
562,How to make a box with rounded corners,"I've stumbled on this beautiful piece of design. And I'm wondering how they constructed the wooden part of the box. I have some questions:   Which type of wood they use, because the nerves are really parallel and straight? I see from the diagram that the corner pieces are made separately, and glued later. How do they cut them?   I'm assuming it's all CNC'ed. But it would be nice if somebody can tell, how they would make something like this, with just hand material tools (if possible). "
563,Antique Dowel Maker?,"I picked this up at a local 2nd hand store. It is 20""x2""x1/2"", cast iron. The holes go from 1/8"" to 3/4"" diameter. Years ago, I helped a friend put a post &amp; beam addition on his home. All Dovetail, scarf joints, etc., with homemade oak dowels. He made the dowels by taking split square pieces of seasoned oak and pounding them thru a large hole in a thick piece of metal he had made, shaving off the outer edges. He had holes decreasing in diameter until it was the 3/4"" he wanted. This looks like the same idea. But starting at 3/4"" and possibly ending at 1/8"", or whichever size was desired. Is this what I think or am I off base?   I added a profile shot to show it's thickness, this looks like old cast iron, I see no marks to identify the manufacturer, is this common to not have a manufacturer on the cast? Is there a way to figure out hold old this is? When did they stop making these out of cast iron?  Thanks for all of your feedback. "
564,Best way to mount bench vise for my particular bench?,"My bench has a 2x4 edge and if I line up the vise where the inner claw is flush so I can mount things vertically, then a little of the vise overhangs a little.

565,Triple bunk bed design safety and difficulty,"  pdf link to plan  I am planning to build this triple bunk this weekend. I plan to add âcleatsâ (not sure if this is the correct word) in the form of 2inx4inâs between the sections, on the inner side of the support posts. The bed frame will be resting on these cleats with the bed frame and the cleats glued and screwed into the long corner posts. Does this sound like satisfactory structural support if the bed were occupied by large adults? We are trying to avoid the bed frames becoming victim to a sheer force disaster and collapsing.   "
566,Stairs-stain color Jacobean Miniwax,"In middle of staining stair treads, the stain isnât dark enough and can see the wood putty underneath. Do I just go darker with next coat-different shade? Or do I need to re sand and use wood conditioner to even it out? "
567,How to mount mirror in wood frame that is not square?,"I am making a frame for a heavy antique mirror that is 54"" by 16"" by 1/4"" thick. Currently, I have glued up the frame. It consists of four lap jointed 2x4's.   After the glue had dried, the frame did not sit flat on the bench. When I held one corner down, the adjacent corner rose 5/8"" off the bench. This indicated the frame was not square, so I investigated further with winding sticks.   The frame is indeed out of square. It is twisted.  The next step in the in the build process is to use a router to cut a 1/4"" rabbet that will accept the mirror. This rabbet will be cut with an upcut bit spun by a plunge router with an edge guide.  Before I proceed with cutting the rabbet, should I fix the twist in the frame? I have identified several options, but as I have never dealt a work piece that is this far out of square, I am not sure what to do.  My options:   Do nothing, force the mirror to flex to adapt to the twisted frame. Use a router and jointing plane to remove material until the winding stick are parallel. Cut the rabbet deeper in the corners that are twisted up to accommodate the mirror.   What is the best option, is there an option that I have overlooked?  Edit:  I decided to proceed with this twisted work-piece. The next step was to cut a rabbet for the mirror to sit in. After cutting this rabbet, the frame was noticeably less twisted. Lots of material was removed, apparently some internal stresses in the wood were twisting the frame:    After cutting the rabbet, I gave the mirror a test fit. It looked pretty good. The mirror weights around 40 lbs, and after test fitting the mirror, I decided that the frame needed a brace. When gluing the brace, I warped the frame a little past level:    Checking again with the winding sticks, the frame looks like it's nearly perfect:   In retrospect, I definitely recommend trying to salvage a twisted glue up.

568,Applying finish over furniture repair wax,"I have a panel made from recycled lumber - there are a number of 10mm holes from some sort of fixtures in the woods previous life. These are not nail holes, but clean drilled out holes. I'm not wanting to end up with a rustic / reclaimed look so I want to hide these holes as much as possible. There are a number of holes surrounded by highly figured grain - cutting out patches to match would be very hard.  I have some furniture repair hard wax sticks that with some experimentation do an exceptionally good job of hiding the holes with minimal effort.  Can I apply a finish safely over top of these wax patches?  Intuitively I think poly wouldn't stick too well to the wax, so I'm leaning towards doing a shellac wash coat first.  Is there something else I should be considering?  I'm planning on doing a few test pieces first, but ideally would like to be sure that this is not only going be okay initially, but will also not flake off (or similar) a few years down the track. "
569,Are mortises with angled walls cut the same way as square mortises (handtools)?,"What are the usual steps to carve out a non-90degree mortise that will be married to a sliding wedge/key? Should the wedge be cut first?  When chiseling a usual mortise, plumb can be used as the reference. In tusk-tenons, the angle is generally kept low to prevent the wedge to slip out -- but much lower than the bevels on most chisels.  I've thought of different options to guide the carving, from a pilot drill hole, to a workpiece jig (that allows the chisel to be held plumb), or an angled guide block (against which the chisel can slide up and down), to altering the walls of a square mortise with a rasp. Can it be simpler than that?  Examples of angled mortises:    Note: Tusks for locking shelves, or tusks for locking moravian workbench legs.    There are ways to avoid the angled wall, but they're not what I'm looking for:   Folding wedges, which allows the usual mortising method, but gives a different look. In the second image (Moravian bench), it would be possible to use a router to make space in the center of the laminated tenon. Like an inlay plane.   Update: I've found video material online which describes one way to cut these mortises, and included links in this answer. "

571,Efficient paint removal from rough sawn wood,"I have some rough sawn timbers in my house that were painted over by the previous owner of the house1.  I believe the timbers are a softer wood like fir as they are more decorative than structural.  The three 4"" x 8"" x 18' timbers appear to have been painted over with a roller and there's some bits of ceiling spackle on them too.  They at least tried to do a quality job and made sure to paint the little nooks or notches in the wood.    The single 6"" x 8"" x 5' timber has a gawd-awful faux stone spray paint applied to it.  Both sets of timbers were stained fairly dark when they were originally put in place.  My goal at this point is to get rid of the paint.  I would be fine with the original dark stain that was in place, but it would be bonus points if I ended up with a lighter look.  I'm 99% certain that the paint is lead-free, but I haven't tested yet to verify.  I will do so prior to commencing work.  I have tried using some citrus based paint remover.  It's worked okay, but has left an orange tint on the test areas.  I'm hesitant to use a chemical based paint remover because of the fumes and the timbers are located inside.  I have also considered grinding via wire brush; sanding with a belt or orbital sander; and planing it with a hand plane.  All of these seem like time intensive operations and I'm a little worried about the mess from grinding or sanding.  What's the most effective way to remove the paint from these timbers? Or is it a lost cause and I should cover over them instead?  1Yes, I'm consoled by the fact that there's likely a special place in Hades for people like that. &lt; /jk>  "
572,What minimum amount of equipment is required to start turning bowls?,"I'm curious to know what is the simplest set-up to start bowl turning? Which tools should be high-quality and which can I skimp on? I'm not interested in being able to turn a large variety of bowls, I'm simply looking for a set-up where I can develop my bowl turning skills. "
573,How do you make nesting bowls from a single piece of wood?,"I've seen matching sets of turned bowls that fit inside each other almost like Russian dolls. I've also heard turners actually say the bowls were cut out from the same piece so they didn't waste a beautiful piece of wood to make just one bowl. How do you do this on a lathe, and is there a name for the technique? Do you need special tools or is there a way to do it with a normal set of lathe chisels? "
574,How do you prevent a turned workpiece from exploding while you're working on it on the lathe?,"I've seen some scary videos and ""after"" photos where someone was turning something on a lathe and the workpiece just exploded. How do I avoid this?  For example, in one exploding bowl video the turner comments that he made the bottom too thin which makes sense but he doesn't go into any detail about how thick it should have been. Is there a quick-and-dirty rule for estimating how thick the bottom and/or sides should be? He also mentions the wood was a little wet but I'm not sure if he's suggesting that was also part of the cause.  Is it common for things to explode on the lathe, and is it more due to operator error or just an understood hazard of turning wood?  If I can't do anything to completely prevent it, what rules of thumb can I follow to at least decrease the chances of my workpiece exploding on the lathe?  Also, is there a technical term for this (similar to the term ""kickback"" in relation to other tools), or is it just called exploding? "
575,Is there any such thing as sanding something *too* fine for finishing?,"I know you can get sandpaper in super-high grits, like 2000 grit and higher. I guess there's a point of diminishing returns for sanding wood projects, but is it possible to use too high a grit prior to applying the first coat of finish? If so, what problems can it cause, and do these problems apply to all types of finish and wood or just certain types or categories? "
576,What is the difference between a chisel bit and regular chain saw blade?,"I was at a saw shop the other day and someone asked for a chisel bit chain.  When I get a chain at the DIY store it comes in a box and the only choices are brand and size. The chain this customer got came off a roll, like a length of rope, the clerk took of a length went in the back and came back out with proper loop of chain for the saw.  What is a chisel bit chain? How does the roll of saw chain factor into it? "
577,How to straighten a warped board,"So you have a board removed from a pallet that, once removed, shows significant warping. Or perhaps you bought some lumber and you didn't notice an imperfection.   This is visible along the width of the board (curved) and the length of the board (bowed). Is it possible to try and straighten that board? This wood is already sub par to begin with since it was on a pallet in the first place.   The curve imperfection is usually lost when the board is assembled again to a project.  Perhaps this board is a lost cause and not worth the effort. Is it possible to try and fix a board with only one of those characteristics? Particularly the bowing as that is the harder one to hide depending on the span between screws and nature of the project.  "
578,How to sharpen a circular saw or mitre saw blade,"I got a mitre saw second hand and I am not sure how long it was in service for. I don't want to just buy a 12 inch blade as they can be expensive. Ultimately, I will have to purchase one at some point. The blade in question looks like it has over-sized tips that suggest I could go at them with a file.  Are there any reasons I should not do this? Such as efficiency or more importantly safety concerns?  If I can do this, is there any technique for going around the blade?  The question How do I know it&#39;s time to replace my circular saw blade? will tell me if my blade is truly dull.  "
579,"Recycling ""pre-loved"" lumber -- techniques?","(This may be multiple related questions;  assistance in breaking it up would be welcome if so.)  Many woodworkers have learned that a surprising amount of lumber, including some surprisingly good/interesting material, can be had cheap or free by deconstructing unwanted furniture and  shipping pallets, rescuing it from house renovations, and the like. What are the best ways to prep this for reuse? What unusual sources are there? (I know some folks have gotten expensive woods cheap by spotting something on eBay worth more as wood than as constructed object.)  What's the line between ""worth repairing"" and ""worth scavenging"" and ""not worth the effort""?  I can start with a few observations/questions:  Obviously, going over it with a small metal detector to make sure there are no fasteners remaining to damage your tools is a good starting point. Lead paint is an obvious hazard to watch out for, as are termites. Pressure treatment can be a health risk. What else needs to be avoided?  Removing previous finish -- I've been told that paint is damaging to planer blades, and some folks just take a ""veneer"" layer off at the bandsaw to deal with it or keep an old set of planer blades around for this task. Do varnishes present the same risks? (I have a small stack of solid-oak flooring that could become picture frames or drawer components if I can clean it up without losing too much...)  What else does the aspiring upcycler need to know? "
580,"Joining an irregular, detachable modesty panel together and to an irregular shaped desk","I've built an irregularly-shaped desk with irregular, five-sided cabinets. It now needs a modesty panel, but because of the unique angles and circumstances, I'm stumped as to how to attach such a panel within the design requirements.  The challenges:   Because this is fine furniture, there can't be any visible fasteners on the outside of the desk. Fasteners on the inside must be concealed and tasteful. The final piece will be stained, not painted, any patching and filling will show. Due to the size of the finished desk, it needs to be able to be disassembled into smaller pieces for moving if necessary. That means that the two cabinets, the top surface and the modesty panel must be able to separate and re-attach in a non-destructive way. (ie. no glue or screws where the wood will wear out and not hold after repeated screwing and unscrewing.) The modesty panel needs enough structural integrity to not fall apart when it is separate from the desk. There should be some way to attach cables to the modesty panel, like a cable tray. The modesty panel has three panels, each joined at very slight (5-11 degree) angles.     Here's a top view with the desk top removed:    The three panels of the modesty panel as well as the cabinets are built with 3/4"" birch plywood. The two inner joints can be attached permanently, but the ends that attach to the cabinets have to be detachable.  Questions:   What type of fastener would be best to join the panels to each other where a permanent connection is needed, keeping in mind that it 3/4 plywood joined end to end, the angles are slight, and no fasteners can be visible? What type of fastener would be best to join the panels to the cabinets where a removable connection is needed, keeping in mind that it is 3/4 plywood joined end to face at a slight angle?   My though is that a cable management tray of some kind might be the solution to add more structural integrity and create more surface area, but I'm still not sure how it would all attach together. Hopefully someone has some clever fastener or joining trick that might work here. "
581,How is it possible to let wood reach equilibrium moisture content?,"I am trying to reconcile the following 3 points but cannot:   It is extremely important to let wood sit for a while in the environment it is intended to be used in before using it for a project so that it reaches equilibrium moisture content (EMC) with the environment. Evidence: This advice comes up time and time again here, in forums, in articles, everywhere.  It is impossible to do so where I live, where the EMC has varied from 2.8% to 29.1% on an almost daily basis over the last 2 years. Evidence: See below. Building furniture from wood apparently works anyways. Evidence: I live in NYC. There are 15 million people here with furniture that isn't constantly tearing itself apart.   How can an extremely important requirement for well-built furniture be apparently impossible, yet well-built furniture exists anyways? One of the three points above must be false. It is either:   Not  that important, or Entirely possible, or Nobody's furniture in NYC lasts longer than a year or two before warping itself to pieces.   Which is it? What am I missing here? In such a wildly changing environment, how is it actually possible to let wood reach its EMC, or is the advice misguided, and does it not actually matter?    Sources for point 2 above:   Hourly weather records for Jan 2014 thru Jan 2016 for NYC, source Weather Underground. The Hailwood-Horrobin equation for calculating EMC from temperature and relative humidity, via CSGNetwork.com's EMC calculator.   Here is the calculated EMC according to the above data for a typical 10-day period in my area, showing a highly varying range from about 6% to 23% even over the course of single days:    Here is the calculated EMC (hourly) over the past 2 years, showing very little correlation between EMC and season, a high noise distribution between 2.8 and 29.1:    Here is temperature (C) and relative humidity (%) just for completeness over the same 2-year period. There are clear seasonal variations of course but within a day / week it varies greatly:      Here is my weather and calculated EMC data (uncompressed).  How can I make all this make sense? Evidence suggests that the advice to ""let wood sit for a few weeks or months to reach equilibrium with the environment"" is not actually correct (because it appears impossible - what would the target MC be?), but I have to assume I am missing a key point because of my inexperience.  As the question and answers are evolving I am becoming clearer on what I am confused about: My assumption is not that the wood's MC changes quickly, it's that in the presence of a highly varying environment I question if it changes too slowly to ever really reach EMC, at least in the conventional ""weeks"" or ""months"" suggested resting times. Also I question conventional accepted wisdom regarding season and location (I am gathering more data on these lines as I type this, however). It is given, to me, that live wood has a high MC and needs to be dried; what is really not clear to me after looking at answers and data is if it actually matters that wood rests near its final location, and how much a couple of weeks or months really makes a difference. By all traditional experience, it does, but by the very limited observations I have made so far, it does not seem to.    The question ends here. The following section contains misc. data related to comments.  Seasonal temperature / humidity / EMC statistics for past 2 years (21,457 samples) (full results).

From this I learn two things:   The tighter range of seasonal EMC averages (12.4-13.1%) and medians (10.5-11.9%) suggest a reasonable target EMC. This is good news. There is no statistically significant difference in my area's relative humidity and EMC per season (or even monthly, really). This leads to other questions outside the scope of the original version of this post.   This raises some additional questions for reflection: Most notably 1) is a ""few weeks"" or a ""few months"" really enough time to let wood sit, and 2) that season doesn't matter contradicts some accepted experience, although this may be unique to my location.

It's located in a basement shop and I'm wondering how to best preserve the machine. I haven't turned it on in over a year, and I want to now protected it since I don't know when I'll next use it.   Is it a good idea to cover the machine? Can covering it cause problems (i.e. trap moisture) How can I protected against rust? Does the motor need to be run? If so, how long and how often?  "
583,Is it better to let the tool run or stop in-between cuts?,"When I started woodworking, I used to setup my tool, do a cut, stop my tool, re-position my piece (or take another one), start my tool, do another cut, stop, etc.  Today, I find myself leaving the tool run in-between cuts a lot more than I used too.  It's more time efficient, but is it more dangerous?  Is it better on the motor?  All it in all, is there a preferred method of working with stationary power tools such as table saws, jointers, router tables, drill presses, etc. "
584,Measurements on a Try Square,"The measurements on a try square start at the far end of the blade. Why? Wouldn't it be better to have two measurements starting at the 90 degree angles like a framing square? Or was a try square never intended for measuring, just trying? The lip on the stock is so handy though. "
585,Can I use polycarbonate sheets in a candle holder?,"I'm making a candle holder out of wood (yes, that's the tenuous link to this forum; I cannot find an answer anywhere else!) and I would like to know if it's feasible to use polycarbonate sheets instead of glass.  I'd ideally like to use glass, but it's damn near impossible here in the UK to buy the stuff:  the big DIY stores don't do and the online places charge a fortune for delivery.  My main concerns, in order of importance are:   Will the polycarbonate sheets catch alight and burn my house down? If they don't spontaneously combust, will they deform or 'white-over' with time?   My research has shown that polycarbonate has a fire rating of 1, which means it can be used in schools and hospitals, so I'm assume that item 1. will not happen.  But I'm guessing that if the sheets are close to the candle flame, that item 2. will happen over time.  Has anyone any experience using polycarbonate near naked flames? "
586,Can I chamfer/bevel the top of a post with a router?,"I have a 110mm square laminated pine post.  I want to put a 45 degree bevel on the top of the post, around all four edges.  I don't have a mitre saw, but I do have a plunge router and a 45 degree chamfer bit.  Working on a scrap section of post, and chamfering from the sides of the post, not the top (that is, I rest the router base on the side of the post, bevel that edge of the top and then turn the post onto a different face) I've found that I can't keep the router level -- not enough of the router base is on the post.  Is there some jig or trick I should be using? Or is a plunge router an unsuitable tool for this job? "
587,Wood with Smooth Texture,"Note: I do not have much experience with woodworking.  How is that wood can have a smooth texture with multiple ""rings""? (I heard that trees the same number of concentric circle as their ""age"")  So how do producers make it wood so that it does not only have concentric circles, but smooth continous ones?  Image of the side of desk (the darkened top is just a shadow, the white is a piece of metal - I do not know why it is there):    I have taken a closer look with my eye (not on the image, but the physical desk) and do not see any discontinuities (no visible straight lines where multiple boards could be connected / glued together) "
588,Type and thickness of ply for converting van,"I'm converting a (high roof, LWB) panel van into a camper, and want to use ply both for walls/ceiling/floor and for furniture.  What type (hardwood/softwood) and thicknesses should I use for:   The walls   9mm soft (or 12mm so I could hang things off it if I decided to)?  The ceiling   Maybe 6mm or 9mm of soft? I really don't know.  The floor   12mm of soft?  A bed   12mm hard? Or is that overkill? Should I have it thicker for the slats than the support?  A kitchen unit (sink &amp; two hobs &amp; maybe a microwave)   6mm? Don't know about type    My guesses might be totally off-base, I'm pretty new to woodworking and really know very little about what sort ply is appropriate for what function. Basically I want to keep cost and weight down without keeping them so far down that the wood will bow or break. If it's relevant, I'm hoping to have a wood burner in there (obviously not sitting directly on ply), so there might be fairly quick temperature variance. "
589,Is there any way to join/seal large exterior mitre joints such as on a bay window sill so that they don't open up?,"As per the title, I work at a conservatory manufacturer and as such we often have large bits of hardwood (up to around 56x220mm section) which need to be joined with a mitre, such that the larger face is sitting on brickwork.  Typically we cut the mitres accurately, machine worktop bolts into the undersides and sometimes dowels or biscuits for locating the pieces together correctly on site. We seal the end-grain of the pieces with a purpose-made end-grain sealer, then paint with water-based microporous paint.  Whenever I go out to site to a job which has been installed for ~6 months or more, the sills and any other large mitred joins have typically opened up. I don't think that the pieces of timber overall have moved, I think it's more to do with across-grain shrinkage of the timber(?). I also see the same on pieces which other people have supplied, installed and finished such as internal window boards/sills.  Is there some way of joining them, some kind of sealant I can use etc. which will stop this from happening?  Note I have seen this question: End grain mitre joints for outside but I believe my question is a bit different because it's specifically dealing with very large section sizes. "
590,How to learn woodworking,"I've recently got into the woodworking. So, basically I have to learn from A to Z. I don't know things about woodworking safety too.  Now I have two options:   Go to the woodworker, pay up the money and learn from him. Learn through Youtube.   First one seems more proper way and more safe, but I'm a student so  I'm in a budget. Second one seems more inappropriate but I can save the money.  Which one do you guys recommend me to do? How did you guys learn the woodworking? "
591,Emmets Good Stuff,"How do I avoid streaks or elevated lines when I wipe off the Good Stuff? Should it be thinned somehow so that the gel will settle onto an even plane? I do not have a problem with the initial coat as it mainly gets absorbed by the wood, but coats 2, 3 and 4 usually are not smooth. I've sanded with 400 which does remove some of the elevated areas but not completely.  Would applying paste wav using 000 steel wool help smooth out the finish? This is being applied to a desk for my son. "
592,Will gluing thin planks to cut out curved chair leg be strong?,"I'm making an armchair for a child. I want the back leg to be straight-vertical at the seat level but kick back down the floor, and lean back at the, erm, back. Much like every other rear chair leg in the universe.  My problem is I only have planed 45Ã22mm stock to hand. I actually have a lot of this lying around from a previous miscalculation. So my thought process has so far gone:   It's too thick to bend. (Isn't it? I've never tried steam bending before but remember I'm a homegamer) I could resaw it down and do a bent lamination. But it'd be easiest âif a little wastefulâ to just glue a pile of this together on their 45mm faces and cutting two legs out of the pack. Here's my  skilful depiction of how that'd look.   That last option does mean that the bit of wood that touches the floor, will likely be one or two planks away from the main load. I know yellow glue is good stuff but is this a good idea?  Or should I just go and spend the Â£2 it'd cost to get a bit of rough-sawn timber in the right size? "
593,I calculated the recommended number of clamps required for my table top and the answer seems insane,"According to the article in fine woodworking on gluing up joints:   The formula for number of clamps required is (square inches of glued joint x PSI for the wood in question) divided by PSI of the clamp you are using.  I am gluing up a desktop made of 2x2's of different hardwoods (red oak, cherry, walnut, maple and poplar.  According to the article, the required gluing pressure averages about 350 psi, so for my project (6' long joints on 2x2 which are actually 1-13/16 squared) comes to:    (72"" x 1.81) x 350 = 45,675 divided by ~1000 (pressure exerted by 3/4"" pipe clamp.   ] That works out to 45 3/4 inch bar clamps for a 6' length!  This means I need a clamp every 1.6""!  That seems really nutso.  Is it accurate?  Do I really need basically as many clamps as I can fit on the board for the full 6' length? "
594,How do I apply Minwax Polyshades Espresso stain over two coats of Polyshades Pecan stain to darken a bit?,"I'm trying to apply Minwax Polyshades espresso stain after having applied a coat of Minwax Polyshades pecan to solid pine wood. I pre-conditioned the wood and applied two coats of the pecan. I'm using an old t-shirt to apply the stain as I find it works best to prevent blotching and air bubbles.  Now, I'm trying to darken the wood tone a bit in general but especially along the edges and the knots. It doesn't seem to be working for some reason, and I'm wondering if it's because Minwax Polyshades includes the polyurethane finish and so my third coat of espresso stain is not able to adhere to the wood.  I tried sanding one edge to the bare wood, but the espresso stain still had trouble adhering for some reason:     Do I need to apply multiple stains of espresso? Or perhaps sand more before applying the espresso? Or is this all I can get with a product like Polyshades that includes the polyurethane finish?  Thanks for any help! "
595,"Are ""brass"" wood screws liable to be fake, or am I just using them too roughly?","I bought some ""brass"" wood screws yesterday at a local hardware store and they were bending and breaking off in the hole. I compared them to some brass screws I had ordered from Fastenal, a commercial supplier, last year and the hardware screws were lighter in color.  Brass screws are supposed to be made of ""high brass"", 65% copper, 35% zinc. Is there a chance I have a substandard screw with too much zinc in it, or am just being paranoid and the lighter color is because the screws are newer?  Is there a way to check the screws to see if they have the right composition? "
596,Pyrography criteria to justify changing tools with different woods?,"I have been using a binding-post interchangeable-tip pen (as seen in the third image here [website]In a discussion with a fellow pyrographer, it came up that their system of choice was a simple soldering iron (never tinned or used for anything other than wood however), and unlike so much of the literature and instructions out there, they claimed with this type of pen, they NEVER have to touch hot pen to wood.  Thus shading in their work is exceptional.  I have enjoyed making my own tips, but the relatively small gauge wire (even the thick gauges feel like they cool in the air so rapidly they can't burn from a distance).    I am considering out a iron-pen system, like the one shown here (specifically because it has a few interchangeable tips, and I feel this would still be a plus over a soldering iron dedicated for wood burning)  [website]Long story short, I would like to ask for some advice or brief stories of your experience regarding a few observations and determining whether different equipment would help improve this:   With the thin wires of the razertip system, the pen requires contact with the hardwood with smooth deliberate motion (technique and reading of the wood is vital here and requires time, patience, concentration, and focus as if the pen isn't lifted in time the grain can ignite (with a flash) leaving a blob.)  This is common and there is lots of material out there about techniques and better woods to use to avoid this, but I would like to focus on whether an iron-style pen which is not in contact with the wood will make the wood less sensitive to this problem. I have been told, iron style pens (without touching the wood) generate faster, more even burns to a larger surface area compared to pens with thin wires.  Is this true, or have our discussions not given enough credit to the wood we are using?  Based on photographs of my friends work, I know for sure we aren't likely using comparable woods as there is never a discernible grain on their work.  I tend to burn on a lot of pine, poplar, maple, and red oak.  The grain and changing density/wetness on red oak can be a real pain!, but all the more satisfying with a well done end product.     No affiliations to Razertip, Lee Valley, or Veritas.  Just trying to provide as much relevant information as possible to get the best advice from the pros and gurus out there. "
597,What am I doing wrong when making lap joints with my stacked dado set?,"I'm trying to cut some lap joints on a table saw using my stacked dado set. But the depth of the cut is inconsistent from pass to pass.  Here's a picture of what I'm getting:    It seems like I'm getting somewhere between 1/32"" to 1/16"" variation on each pass; it's difficult to tell for sure because the depth of the cut is potentially variable on each pass.  What could be causing this inconsistency?  Some things I've considered:   Perhaps the saw blade is actually oscillating up and down as it makes the cuts. Is this a thing that happens in table saws sometimes? If so, what do I do to fix it? Maybe the wood is actually riding up over the blade? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me, as that is more like what happens in a climbing cut. I tried several things to get a more consistent joint, including making sure the pressure was as even as I could get it on each pass, and it helped a little but still had a lot of variation between passes. Maybe the board itself has inconsistencies in height, causing it to engage the cut at different angles? That doesn't make a lot of sense either, because the cuts seem fairly consistent through a single cut. They only seem to vary between cuts. But I did try planing the board before cutting the joint to see if that helped with consistency. It didn't seem to make any difference. Maybe my expectations are off and this is just what I should expect to get out of a stacked dado set?   At the end of the day, I have several questions that are all intertwined:   This seems to be a lot more variation than I can use as-is in a lap joint. If I were to glue it up like this, my gut tells me I'd be compromising the strength of the joint. Is this true? What is causing this problem? How do I fix it?   UPDATE  LeeG suggested that accumulating sawdust might be the problem. I made several changes to my setup, and it seems to have done the trick. I replaced the fence I'd been using with a much straighter board, and I cut a rabbet at its base for dust relief. I made sure to keep the surface of the table saw as free from sawdust as I could between each pass. The changes seem to have worked. The cuts are much more consistent between passes now. "
598,Does clear oil based polyurethane exist?,"Is there such a thing as a truly clear oil based polyurethane? I know they yellow over time, but don't they also apply amber? "
599,Is there such a thing as the same stain as wood color?,"I want to protect the wood with stain, but I do not want it to become a different color.  Is it possible to find a stain that is the same color as the wood?  If I were to find such a stain, would the wood still become a different color slightly because of all of the existing shades? "
600,How challenging is it to sand a stained oak floor?,"I am about to do a little touching up of a stained oak floor.    I am concerned that sanding the floor with a machine would be infeasible because it means that the stain would be gone from some parts more than others, and then it will be necessary to do a heavy sanding, staining from scratch, and apply multiple polyurethane coats.  In your experience, is it possible to do local touching up of such a floor, perhaps by a tedious but more gentle hand sanding? Or is it just a job that has to be done for the entire area? "
601,"Drilling a straight, centered hole down square-cross-section bar stock?","I'm trying to drill a centered, straight hole in a piece without a big drill press and a bunch of clamps and brackets, which seems to be the usual way to do it. I can manage straight, but centered is eluding me.  I'm very new to working wood and I'm working on an umbrella swift for my partner to wind yarn on. Part of this involves an axle (in this case, simple dowel) and a couple of square-sided blocks that rotate around it. A bit of friction is actively desirable, so this isn't even going to get a sheave bearing, let alone anything fancier.  I'm having a lot of trouble drilling a straight, centered hole down the square stock, and tend to get a hole that's off center and/or not straight.  With a basic drill guide (collar style) I can get it pretty straight, but setting the work piece perfectly perpendicular is tricky since the edges from where it's cut off the bar stock aren't quite square after hand-sawing. (Maybe I should be using a mitre box?). I'm dealing with this by mounting it in a vise and measuring it carefully before tightening.  Getting the hole centered is just not working though. I drill a small pilot hole with a 2-bit, but it still tends to wander half a mil off center once it bites and starts drilling. I suspect it might be because of the soft pine I'm working with and the fact that I'm drilling down the line of the grain, not across it, but I don't have much choice about that. Widening the hole tends to make the situation worse, as the bit again tends to wander before biting properly.  If I go straight to the 12mm spade bit for the full width cut it tends to wander more, rather than less.  I'm also getting a hole that's usually not quite round - slightly distorted on three sides. Is this because I'm drilling with the grain?  Please forgive my ignorance. I've been hunting around for info, but mostly finding things focused on drilling down the center of round stock like dowel, where you can spin the stock in a drill and use a fixed bit. That's not an option here.  (I suspect this is like those programming questions I get on SO, where someone wants to know ""how to build a dynamic website with PostgreSQL"", where the answer is ""let me write a book"" or ""where do I start""... but I'm hoping there are just a few simple tricks I'm missing here.)

602,"Crosscutting 18"" diameter logs by hand","I tried my hand at crosscutting a beefy 18"" log with a relatively low tooth-per-inch bowsaw today. I eventually made it all the way through, but not without cutting V-slices into the wood to give the blade breathing room and prevent it from constantly jamming, especially as I got into the heartwood. I should also mention that it took me forever.  Am I missing something here? I wonder if I used the right tool or if I should have been hammering in wedges or something. Should I have just used an axe?  (Hand-tool related answers only please â not interested in using chainsaws for various reasons.)  More details: The log I was cutting was green. The bow saw has no set and was brand new. "
603,"oak has vinegar smell, action needed?","As I was planing a board of oak, I noticed an acidic vinegar-y smell emanating from the newly exposed surface and the shavings.  I read this might be due to natural acids present in the tree. I didn't cut the tree down, rather I have purchased the board, already surfaced on 4 sides. I'm not sure if it's received any treatment - The label (from the big orange store) simply said ""oak"".  I don't mind the scent, but:   Is it a sign that i should let it dry off a bit more? If it was indeed acid causing this, would I need to neutralize it before applying certain finishes?   Some pics:   &nbsp;   Left: end grain; image covers 1/2"" of the board's width (fullsize -- woodworkers with trypophobia: beware).  Right: Face of same board; scale unknown (fullsize).

604,Protective clothing for circular saws?,"What protective clothing (upper body, lower body, and footwear) should I wear for circular saws?  Regarding lower body, I read that chainsaw Kevlar chaps stop safety-spec-conforming gas-powered (but not electric) chainsaws by using fibers to jam them. Will this prevent battery-powered circular saw kickback from cutting through? Or if a blade falls out during use, will it prevent that from cutting through? Or buy enough time to let go of the trigger and be unscathed? Are there better alternatives? Many of these chaps have open crotches, so will a regular sports hard cup prevent it from cutting through? Nutshellz make bullet-resistant ballistic Kevlar cups. Do these help against circular saws though? Itâs marketed to baseball players and law enforcement. "
605,Can breadboard ends hold together a tabletop without glue?,"I'm in the planning stages of building a simple workbench, and I'm a bit stuck on the bench top itself.  One of my goals for this bench is to be able to disassemble it as much as possible, to make it easier to get into and out of places where having a bench would be handy. Most of the plans I've seen involve laminating boards together to create the bench surface, which I'd like to avoid as it becomes a rather large block that can't further disassembled.  Would it be feasible to use breadboard ends to hold together a bench top made of 2x4s set on end?  It would look something like this (the picture shows it at 1 ft wide, this may end up being wider):   The weight of the bench top itself would be resting on another couple of 2x4s sitting inside what's basically a large dado cut in the bottom, anchored with through mortise:   This should trap all but the outer two 2x4s, which would be captured by the breadboard ends.  Is this a viable way to hold together a workbench top? "
606,Can you use smaller dimensions of hardwood than softwood and have the same strength?,"I am planning on building some furniture which has to support 2 aquariums.  I have found many examples online of a simple design which uses 2x4s constructional softwood to build a box for the aquarium to sit on.    I am wondering if I picked a hardwood to build it, if I would be able to use smaller dimensions of the wood for the same strength?   For example, if I used maple could I achieve the same strength using 1x3s?  Update  The aquariums are going to be 300 litre 120cm x 50cm x 50cm (48"" x 20"" x 20"").  So lets round up and say a live weight of 400kg per tank.  I was thinking of using this design:  [website][website]The key parts are:   Going to put ply on the back and the top Weight is supported by the timbers not the screws 8 legs in total (two in each corner)  "
607,Endgrain screw withdrawal force,"The engineering toolbox has a screw withdrawal strength calculator but it assumes the screws are perpendicular to the grain.  I could not find a calculator for screws installed parallel to the grain, but I did find a nice meta-analysis of endgrain withdrawal force research for nails.  Based on the most conservative numbers there plus my blind assumption that the endgrain-to-sidegrain strength ratios for screws would be similar to nails, does it make sense to say, as a rule of thumb, that screws in the endgrain would have 0.5 the withdrawal force of screws in the sidegrain? Does this match peoplesâ experience?  If not, is there a calculator or formula to determine endgrain withdrawal force given the screw diameter and density of the wood? "
608,Is Titebond All Purpose White Glue just a diluted version of the Quick & Thick?,"Not technically a woodworking question, but a question about woodworking products...  I am looking for an affordable white glue to use making cardboard furniture. I'd be bonding cardboard to itself and paper. All of the videos I've seen have shown people using a pva glue that they've thinned with water and painted on with a brush, sort of a home-made decoupage glue. An 8oz bottle of All Purpose White Glue is [tex]4. Can I just mix the Quick &amp; Thick with water and save myself a ton of money??  "
609,Bandsaw guides: Blocks vs. Roller bearings,"Some bandsaws, mine included, have guide blocks to help prevent the blade from deflecting. Guide blocks look like this:    Image credit: Rockler  Other bandsaws use roller bearings instead. They look like this:    Image credit: Rockler  It seems to me the roller bearings are the superior choice and would have several advantages:   They will rotate as the saw blade moves, keeping the blade cooler, and thus the blade will last longer. They should not wear as much over time They should be quieter   Is there anything guide blocks are better at than roller bearings? Is there a reason to prefer guide blocks in some situations, but roller bearings in others?   EDITED TO ADD:  jdv gets to the crux of the question in the comments. Is there a situation where blocks outperform bearings (or vice versa, really) where it affects the cut? Or blade life? Are there other factors I'm not thinking of? Obviously in either case, you need to have a properly tuned band saw. Are there perhaps cases where you can't tune one as well as the other -- for example, do guide bearings work better for wider blades? "
610,Am I selecting the correct drill bit for this job?,"I'm new to woodworking so hopefully this question falls within this exchanges guidelines, please advise if not.  I'm trying to drill the screw below into plywood as shown in the photo:   There will be a block of wood in the slot in the above photo that I worry will split if I don't drill a pilot hole first. The only issue is that my drill bit is not long enough to make it all the way through. As shown below:   So I realized that I need to buy a new drill bit but I am struggling even to do that. My drill (shown below) seems to only accept hex shaped drill bits which drastically limits my selection.   These are the screws I'm trying to drill, they are 12 x 3 inches long, shown below:   Why are the screws listed as size 12 but all drill bits are listed as fractions as shown here? How am I supposed to know what size is correct? And moreover, how can I tell if the length of the bits are at least 3 inches none of the packaging seems to list length, only the size as a fraction. :    To complicate matters, I want the screw to be perfectly flush so I believe I need a countersink to do that properly, I've been looking at the countersinks below I can't tell if the bits are at least 3 inches or whether the width is correct.   I am totally overwhelmed at this point - which drill bit should I be using? "
611,Oiling and sanding,Would it make sense to apply linseed oil before sanding and then sand the piece and then eventually apply the oil again? In order to create less airborne sawdust. Or it wouldn't make much difference? 
612,Making table leg slightly longer,"After a mistake, I ended up with a table leg that's about 1/16"" (1.6mm) shorter than the other ones, on the top. I'm probably going to trim all other legs by a commensurate amount, because that seems like the straightforward thing to do.  But, is there another more creative way of fixing this?   I have offcuts with matching grain, and I could graft something on top, accounting for the mortises. I could maybe glue a block of endgrain-to-endgrain and then saw+plane it down to the correct line. Can it be turned into a feature? Maybe with some sort of mitred cap around the top of the leg.     I don't think it warrants redoing the leg (the design is complex. it has two intersecting mortises, and lower leg is tapered on two sides, shaker-style). But I might resort to that if I make more mistakes of the sort! "
613,Does construction lumber ever dry to 6-9% MC?,"Iâm building a small dining table for a friend and using 2Ã8 SPF boards for the tabletop. They have have been sitting in my climate controlled basement for about 10 weeks now and Iâm measuring MC of 11-14% still. Just for fun, I measured the 2Ã6s that were used to frame our basement walls (our house is 5 years old) and they came in at 10-12%. I have some maple and walnut in the same basement that are registering at 7-9% after about a year.  Does construction lumber stay inherently wetter than other hardwoods, even after acclimating? What MC would you feel comfortable using construction lumber for simple furniture? This wonât be precision work by any means, but Iâm most concerned about potential warping!  Thanks! "
614,Attaching t-slotted channel to the underside of a desk top,"I have a Jarvis adjustable desk frame and an Ikea Gerton table top (1.125â³ thick). I also have a CPU holder that I intend to mount under the desk. It's meant to be mounted flush under the desk, but I need to offset it about 2â³ to clear the Jarvis frame.  I first thought of just using some hangar bolts, but I'm a bit concerned about the stress on the wood/screw interface. The offset might allow the heavy CPU to sway a bit, wiggling the screws with leverage and weakening the connection over time.  So I'm thinking of using T-slotted aluminum channel to span the gap. At the bottom, it can be bolted to the CPU holder. At the top, I'm not quite sure. It has to be held tight to prevent wobbling. Are there wood screws with heads that fit securely in the slots of the channel? Or is there some kind of bracket to screw into the desktop and bolt into the channel? "

But when I went to do the other side this weekend.. The stain is much darker.. Even though I am using the same can? What should I do to lighten it up? What could have caused it to be so different? 
616,Use a fence with a router bit with a bearing?,"I was putting a roundover on some pieces and used my router table. The table has a fence, and the 1/8"" roundover bit I used had a bearing on the bottom (top with the router installed in the table). I didn't bother setting my fence very accurately, just got it within 1/4"" or so. My father-in-law asked a couple times if I was sure I didn't want to set my fence properly. I figured the bearing would keep the bit from cutting too deep, and went ahead with the cut with the fence not flush.  Was I making a dangerous cut or otherwise operating the router in an unsafe manner? Is it preferred to use a fence instead of the bit's bearing? "
617,Convert a minimalist bench design into a desk,"I saw this tutorial and I really want to build it for a workspace area at my job. The measurements of this bench were 16â³ high x 40â³ long x 13.5â³ deep, but I'd like to make a table that's 29"" high x 107"" long x 20"" deep. The tutorial bench is built using a modified box joint with interlocking 2""x4"" pieces that are glued together with liquid nails. Each of the 2""x4"" pieces have a little bit removed on the 2"" side to create a square look with a table saw.  Are any structural concerns with making the table this long? Would the table need to be reinforced underneath with hidden brackets? How much weight should it be able to hold?  I appreciate your help! "
618,Wood Staining is blotchy and black...HELP!,"I've searched and searched but I cannot find anything on the internet that looks close to my bad stain job, so here's the low down: I'm finishing my dining room tabletop and chair seats. I'm using oil based wood stain in dark walnut. I've sanded them all down. I don't know the wood type because I bought the table second hand. I've attempted two chair seats and they both have turned out like the picture I've attached...what am I doing wrong? Do I need wood conditioner? Should I use gel stain instead? I'm so lost! Any help is much appreciated. :) here is the after staining:  Here is the before:  "

Is it worth [tex]200 for a 20-ton press? "
620,Fixing a door's edge properly,"I have a corner hutch with a typical top half which has the top half glass and the bottom have a set of solid doors. Here's a pic:    I did some restoration on this a few years ago and saved it from getting painted by the previous owner (who'd do that to wood, right?) While this job was not a perfect restoration or anything, I did get it back to the point where the wood showed and the stain was fairly even. It took me quite a while to get it back into shape.   One of the things which has always bugged me is, the doors at the bottom have some damage on them which is mainly on the inside, so isn't readily seen. What Is there a specific way in which I should try to repair them? Is there a way to patch them, or do I need to replace the wood? Here are a pictures of the damage:     "

622,How can I tell if my green wood is dry enough?,"I understand different woods age at different rates and the chosen drying process itself is a factor.  How can you tell if green wood, in general, has aged enough? Is there a visual aid? Do you make test holes and measure the moisture in some way?  I could see this being closed as too broad but there must some basic guidelines to consider.  "
623,Planning for wood movement in drawers,"I'm a big fan on making my own drawers and wooden drawer slides (much cheaper and less mental math than installing hardware, IMO). I tend to use this type of construction where the drawer bottom sits (and slides) on runners (see image below). When I first started building these sorts of drawers, I cut the drawers about 1/8 in less than the distance from bottom runner to top runner to ensure that the drawer fit. The problem was that the drawers would tip whenever I opened them. So I began modifying my design to allow a smaller gap. Now I'm at the point where I cut the drawers sides to the exact same size as the drawer opening, then run a handplane past it a couple times to get a tight fit that slides easily. The end result is that my drawers, even when fully extended, open parallel to the floor without tipping (like they used to when I used a 1/8 in gap).     I've seen other websites recommend this sort of snug-fit construction (can't recall where off the top of my head). But I'm wondering if there will be seasonal movement problems? I just build these drawers in the last few months (I have a garage, aka, COLD workshop). Will I have problems in the summer when wood expands? I know wood expands across the grain, so it seems I should have problems. If I refit the drawers in the summer, won't they then be too loose during the winter? How do I combat these seasonal changes in drawer sizes? "
624,What kind of wood dust is toxic/dangerous and requires usage of dust mask?,"I have a dust mask but I wonder if it is worth wearing when working on pine wood. I do wear it when working a piece of oak or beech.  Would you consider cutting some wood species without a mask safe? Do you use a mask with every wood species? How long does dangerous dust stay in the air?  Also, is a mask still necessary when using a central dust collector? "

626,Advice for setting screws in dense wood,"The Janka Hardness Test provides a scale for the hardness of woods. Toward the higher end, wood can be particularly difficult to drive screws into and even a pilot hole may not be adequate. Is there a good method for firmly setting screws into a work-piece without snapping the head?  Approximately where on the scale would these extra measures become necessary? "
627,How do I shop for lumber to use in home wood working projects?,"When I took wood working as a student, I learned to finish rough wood - cut it to rough size, joint it, plane it, rip and cross/cut on a table saw, etc.   As much as I'd love to own large versions of all these machines, it's not practical for the size of my home shop.  I looked around at my local home improvement store and none of the dimensional lumber was of the quality I'd want to use in a project like building children's furniture or enclosures for electronics projects - nothing looked straight or flat.  What should I expect when purchasing lumber to use in home wood working projects? Do most home wood workers buy rough material and use smaller machines to finish their wood, or should I expect to find a supplier who provides higher quality cut and finished lumber? "

629,How to make dish drainer board from plywood shelf,"I'm making a shelf above my kitchen sink with intention of putting glasses there to dry off.  How can I treat plywood surface to make it into drainer board? The sink and the shelf are inside oblique corner, so I can't just buy a dish rack.  I'm looking for something like this:  Whats' the necessary slope and the width of drain cuts? "
630,Can I use a grommet(eyelet) in OSB sheet as structural element? Which size?,"I'm planning on rigging a shelf which is 18 mm sheet of OSB.  Can I just pass a cable through a grommet -protected hole in the board? Would it hold?  The sheet is 1.5 * 1.2 meters, how much space from the edge do I have to leave for each of the four points of rigging?   -- I want the cables to be slightly non vertical, so that the shelf would be more stable laterally.  Specifically what kind of grommet would I need. Or should I call it hollow rivet.  I know I'm constrained by the radius of wire bending to be 10 times the wire diameter.  What's the required diameter of the rivet to hold reliably in the board. Does it need to go through whole thickness of the board, or would, say 10 mm be enough? Would threads on the rivet(making it hollow screw) be beneficial? What's the diameter of outer flange required to hold the grommet from being pushed into the board.  The shelf is supposed to hold 50kg overall(not necessarily evenly distributed), that makes ~250N of horizontal force pushing the grommet laterally. And up to 400N of force vertically. "
631,Can I use OSB in place of timber as structural element,"In few answers I've been advised to reinforce OSB shelf with wooden beam for rigidity over time. Hence 3 interconnected questions:   Isn't OSB supposed to be more stable to elements comparing to wood? Isn't that what's all the adhesive in it is for. Tables give me tensile strength of OSB few times smaller than wood. Can I replace 18mm x 36mm wooden beam safely with 2* 50mm strips of 22mm OSB screwed and/or glued together? That'd give me 50x44 ""beam"" section -- should be quite enough. Should OSB surface and edges  be treated if I plan indoor use with no proximity of water. For it's tensile characteristics to remain same over time.  "
632,Are active charcoal air filters effective against finishing fumes?,"I do my woodworking in a small basement, with medium-poor air circulation. I will probably end up buying an air filter (I'm looking at the Jet AFS-500) anyway, since it seems like a good idea for the dust my dust extraction misses.    I see that that many of these systems allow the installation of active-charcoal filters, and I'm wondering if using such a filter will allow me to safely apply finishes in my basement workshop (brush or wipe, not spray)?  Are there any common finishing products which produce fumes that would not be handled by such a filter? "
633,How to start a cut when using router templates,"I have a template and a router, and am told I need a plunge bit. If I put the template on top of the wood, how do I start the hole? Do I cut a hole in the wood to have a starting point then follow the pattern?  "
634,What drove the design for the traditional tang?,"My terminology might be off as I am basing it on the image below    Many traditional bits and tools used the tang style end. I am trying to figure out why that was the standard at the time. Was it power tools that changed the game and allowed the cylindrical and hex tang styles? I would have assumed those much easier to manufacture, given their uniformity, then that of the tapered tang you see above.   One obvious thing solved by the tang is that you don't risk the bit coming out of the tool when you are pulling out of the work. Was that the problem that couldn't be fixed until the advent of modern power tools?  I could understand that just using a cylindrical tang, like you see on modern drill bits, would be difficult. Possibly due to a tools ability to bite the bit. Or is this something like Beta and VHS where one format just won out over the other where the product itself was not the ultimate determining factor. "
635,How to mount a router plate in a cabinet top?,"I plan on installing a router plate in a custom cabinet top for my shop. I can either route the edges to the depth of the plate to create a recess for a flush table top/plate surface or use plate leveling screws.       I am a bit concerned about the leveling plate screws staying firmly attached to the underside of MDF board with the stress from the router operating and only having support at the corners, whereas the recess ledge design will provide uniform support. The leveling screws will offer finer tuned height adjustment to match the cabinet top surface but I wonder just how much finesse is needed. I have read of people adjusting the top late alignment to several thousandths of an inch and wonder if that is necessary or merely obsessive?  It seems that gluing some thin cardboard or other material to the underside of the plate would also serve as adequate shims. IF you have a router cabinet, what has been your experience been?  BTW do you screw down the plate or simply let it rest in the top cutout? "
636,"securing 3/8"" plywood to studs","I am getting ready to put 3/8"" plywood up in my shop for the walls.  I was going to borrow my dad's pneumatic stapler but I forgot it.  What I do have is a 16 gauge nailer that takes nails from 1"" to 2"".  (While this might fit better in DIY, I'm here and its for my woodshop!)   What I want to know is will 16 gauge nails do an adequate job holding the plywood on my walls?  If so what length would be best and what kind of coverage would be needed?  I was thinking 1.5"" about every 8"" on the studs. As a bonus, there is a cement block around the base and the plywood will actually be able to rest on the blocks.   "
637,Planing thin stock without the aid of bench dogs,"At this point I do not have a bench that will support dogs. However even if I did I would have an issue planing the faces of my thin 3/8"" wood. The bench dogs I have seen have a clearance of exactly 3/8"".  I am very eager to use my hand-planes but I don't have the setup for it. I have a cheap work table, with plastic ""bench dogs"", that would be perfect to use but the dogs are too tall so I cannot use the plane with them getting in the way or damaged.   What I have tried...  Using the aforementioned work table, I had placed other wood below the work piece, to prop it up, but could not get a tight fit so everything just moved around.   What I have considered...  I have seen jigs where you would screw pieces of wood at opposite ends of the work piece and use wedges to tighten. Given the wood I am using I would have to have stops with shorter wood. Planing the stops is fine, since it is scrap anyway, but I don't how to secure them without damaging the plane (screws would be recessed but with the wood that thin I would expect the plane to break the wood).   What I have been doing  For now I have been placing the board on the floor and using a belt sander with my foot as the stop. I am able to do about 80% of a face this way since I don't want sand my feet. What I then do is turn the board ( not flip over ) and finish the other 20% which would not longer be obstructed by my foot. This has lead to inconsistent sanding on occasion.     That being said ... Is there a jig /suggestion of what I can do so that I can hand plane the face of a pallet board that is only about 3/8"" high? I am currently looking for a solution without the aid of bench dogs (since I am not capable of supporting them) but will answers supplemented by them would be fine.) "
638,How to repair missing chunk of wood from cabinet door?,"I have a nice wood cabinet that lost a small chunk of wood from the front door in a recent move. (Photos below.) Naturally, that chunk of wood was on the exterior where it's plainly visible and where the lower hinge attaches, thereby rendering the door inoperable.   The missing piece is thin, about 1/4 inch deep at most. All I can think to do is replace the missing piece with wood filler, sand and stain, and drill new holes for the hinge screws.   And then hope for the best and pray everyone is very gentle with that door. It seems unlikely to me that wood filler will hold well because it's a surface repair and therefore wouldn't stand up under the strain of being attached to a hinge.  Are there other options? How can I repair this piece?  Exterior view showing the missing piece:    Interior view:   "
639,How do I remove pencil and lumber crayon marks non-abrasively?,"I'm building a small project out of 1/4"" Baltic birch plywood. I marked up the boards with lumber crayons and then wrote cut marks and part identifications with a pencil.  I did most of my sanding with 120 grit to remove the marks and then did a light pass with 150 grit.  It wasn't until I noticed that my once tight-fitting dados were now loose that I realized that I almost sanded through the top layer of the plywood in my efforts to remove the marks.  Are there any non-abrasive, wood-safe ways to remove these marks?  If not, how do most woodworkers deal with this on veneered surfaces? "
640,How can you make a square without a square?,"There are many tutorials on making a square to check that corners are 90 degrees, but they all require you to use a square to check.   So how can you make a square, without using a square? How were they originally made if the accuracy needed to be right, but modern methods of measurement and manufacture were not available?  I'm just starting out with woodworking, and as I don't have a project I want to complete as yet, I'm interested in making many of the tools I'd use as part of the learning process (mallets, squares, marker gauge, etc.).  Budget is very tight, but I don't mind incremental steps to the end goal, such as making a just-about-good-enough bench on which to build a better one. I've been watching a lot of Paul Sellers Youtube videos and they have spurred me on.  "

I'm planning on doing a lot of soldering and building on it, but I also want to be able to do homework and writing as well. If the surface has dings in it, it'll be a pain to write on.  I would prefer some kind of laminate but I'm afraid it will be melted if I have a soldering accident.  What is a good, durable surface for a desktop that won't melt or ding easily?  I'd prefer something that I could get for under 50 USD or so for the area specified.  Is there some kind of wood that would be OK for this application?  I have some basic woodworking tools (miter, table saw) and determination so I don't think available tools will be an issue.   Thanks for your help.  Edit: Eventually I've decided on an easily removable and tile-able system of tempered hardboard held in place by gravity and a small edge of the desk.  This way I can easily swap out sections by lifting it off and replacing. "

643,How does Frank Klausz achieve a >90 turn with a turning saw without cleanup when cutting dovetails?,"Frank Klausz, in his video titled ""Dovetails for Drawers - The European way"" takes two minutes to show how he makes his ""3-minute dovetails"". When cutting the tails, he uses what looks to be a custom turning saw, and achieves speedy and clean sharp turns.  In my limited experience with coping saws, sharp turns are difficult to execute, and will frustrate the blade into a bind, or cause the blade to break altogether.   Klausz' longer, taller saw blade appears to rotate (you can witness a lot of twist), but also strangely appears to leave sharp corners (not rounded) with no waste. It is mystifying. The tail cleanup is obviated completely. The pins (which were cut first) are just hammered in, to a convincing effect.  Skill aside, can this be reproduced? Preferably in the Americas, with readily available coping tools?    Also: This image was taken from the european drawer video. But he does it again (although with a comedic attitude) in a different video on just the quick dovetails, while playing piano. "
644,Outdoor teak table and chairs options,"I have acquired a ~10 year old Westminster (do they use grade A teak?) teak table and chairs and am now looking to restore to a high quality, starting with the table. I've had a look online for the answer but most advice assumes the teak is unstained.  The table has been previously stained on the upper side. I don't know if teak oil or sealant has been applied - is there a way of finding out?  The table is unstained underneath and has some mildew that seems to come off easily.  From my research the options I see are as follows:  1) Clean with bleach/soap/water mix and soft bristle brush. Apply more stain. This is the easiest solution. Would this have any negative effects other than the appearance of the wood not being the natural one?  2) Sand to remove the stain and restore the natural colour. Then apply a sealant  to maintain the colour. Do I need to do anything different with the sanding because of the stain? Does sanding the stain out damage the wood?  3) After cleaning, sand to remove badly applied stain and built up dirt but with no intention to completely remove the stain since this is apparently very difficult. Apply more stain. Is this better than 1) given I will re-apply stain?  Which of these options do you recommend or are there others I haven't considered? "
645,Polycrylic on Red Oak,"I am building a table out of red oak. After I sanded it smooth, I stained it with minwax dark walnut (oil based) by using a stain sponge. I would wipe on the stain let it sit for 10 minutes and then I would wipe it off. I repeated that 2 times. It started seeping back up to the surface. I gave it 48 hours (wiping off the excess periodically) and after the 48 hours it stopped. I started to apply polycrylic finish and so far after 5 coats spots of the long grain is still rather bumpy and looks like tiny bubbles surfaced (some look like the pop i cant tell they are so small) and dry causing just the long grain to be rough. This doesn't occur anywhere else but on the long dark grain parts. Do I keep sanding and applying top coats until I have a smooth finish? Will this ever stop?   UPDATE - After doing some research I moved my table indoors where it is warmer (garage temp is around 45 degrees) to help it dry. Now I am seeing ""bleed back"" or stain seeping back to the surface again through the clear coat!! What do I do?   "
646,How to flatten out a wavy panel?,"So I have created a door panel that has a herringbone design using 1"" x 6"" thin black walnut panels. I went through and filled small cracks with a glue / sawdust mix and then sanded it down as normal with a random orbital sander. It looks great when looking at it but feeling it, I can feel where I wasn't as even at the spots that had the putty. I want to of course correct this before applying finish.  What are some effective ways to take out these ""wavy"" spots? The random orbital seems to take forever even with a 60 grit so was hoping for something easier. Would a wide belt sander do a better job at leveling these out?  "
647,Blotchy clear coat water based poly on natural finish,Iâm doing a refinishing project  for someone and Iâve ran into quite an issue. The color of the wood is not coming out evenly.

Iâve had to resand a good portion of this already. i am afraid if it doing the same thing. I am not applying heavy and you can clearly see the color difference from any angle. It seems to be the wood color. Like the wood isnât taking the clearcoat the same. I can possibly sand it down anymore. Please help cuz Iâm at a loss in how to fix this?

649,Strength of oak versus maple,"I am planning to build a heavy duty work bench from a custom end grain butcher block table. The maker offers five different woods: maple, oak, cherry, walnut, and industrial maple.  I know that oak is stronger than maple, but will it make a difference? How much stronger is it?  Note that this table will be used for metal working (heavy hammering) and supporting heavy, cast iron machine tools, like arbor presses, so it's got to be very strong and rigid.  Also, what about walnut, its a lot more expensive. Would it have any advantages? Harder than maple maybe? "

654,"Table saw blade wobbles, don't think it's the arbor","So I'm never really had great cuts with this saw but never looked into why. Recently I tried to cut some 8/4 and it didn't want to move through the blade so I cleaned the blade, waxed the table and it still burns or binds. It appears the blade is wobbling so I recorded these videos in the hopes I can get some help fixing this issue.  I looked up how to check this on youtube, hopefully I'm doing it right. Using the dial indicator I first checked with nothing on the arbor and it appears to be ok, about 0.001in during the full rotation. I put the blade back on and it jumps up to about 0.011in which seems pretty high. I don't think it's the blade as this is the second blade I tried but I'm not sure what else it could be.

655,Choice of sanding sealer to avoid blotching (shellac vs cellulose),"I am working on a table that is made out of maple. I would like to apply a stain but maple is a timber that is prone to blotching so am considering using a sanding sealer before staining to reduce the potential for blotching.  In the past I have used shellac as a prelude to wax finishes but I am worried about how it might react with a final finish of varnish or lacquer (i.e. not wax or oil). I understand how shellac works and where it comes from, and although I have heard of cellulose and acrylic sanding sealers I have never used them.  Focussing on cellulose SS, I am guessing that it works like shellac but it is cellulose that is deposited in the wood instead of lac-bug resins. This sounds fine given what wood is made of (and my experience of hardening tissue paper with cellulose thinners as a young lad making model aeroplanes). Is this correct?  I've been led to believe that standard shellac is good under wax or oil based finishes but, if you want to use a varnish or lacquer then you are best using de-waxed shellac. But what about cellulose SS in particular? What is cellulose SS safe under and are there any pros or cons vs shellac? "
656,Furniture name for waist-high floor-sitting shelf cabinet thing,"I'm working on this thing (60"" wide x 41.75"" high [elbow height] x 14"" deep) (shelves on left and right are adjustable, I might ditch the little border thing on top):    It's purpose is general storage near an entry way, the top will primarily be used for mail, documents, etc. The large space is for storage baskets.  When I try to tell people what I'm making, I find that I'm saying ""it's this shelf sort of table-y storage thing on the floor, or something, or... whatever, let's talk about something else"".  Now, I've seen furniture like this before. Cabinets that sit on the floor with shelves and stuff and a waist/elbow high top. My question is, what are these called? I want to say ""I am building a _______.""  I went through Wikipedia's list of furniture types but I couldn't find it. There are ""entertainment centers"", but that's not actually what this is for, and it's a little high even if I were going to put entertainment stuff on it. It's kind of like a sideboard, maybe? It's not a dresser, there's no drawers.  I'm sure this has a name I just don't know what it is. "
657,Homemade belt sander belts (3X18),"I got the idea of looking to see what it cost to make homemade sandpaper belts for my belt sander would be. For me less than a [tex]30 for 20-25 Yards of sandpaper (roll) and [tex]2.50 and cheap is $1.50 (cheap ones are not to fun...). I have seen a little video on this which is the reason I say epoxy. This person did a 1/2"" over lap after filing the sand and then clued with epoxy. Clamping the epoxy is very flexible but I would not know what epoxy to use. And if epoxy is a good choice. Note: Roll on sanding paper is on a cloth like my current belts. So my questions being,  Q1) What glue would be best (Or Cloth tape?)?  Q2) Is 1/2"" overlap ideal?  Q3) thinking a 20 degree cuts for the joint.  Can not think of anything else but anything on making these would be great. People do it and stuff, but I can not find how to do it!  "
658,Advice on repairing a broken bed,We recently moved and a bed was not put back together properly (wrong screws were used). As a result one of the boards split where a screw joins the long side board to a leg. You can see the split and screw hole at the top of the picture below. The board split cleanly and the other part (not pictured) is one complete piece.  I'm not experienced in wood working and have done only small repairs before. Can I just (clamp and) glue the two parts back together? Will it hold? Do I need any additional braces or supports? Any tips on making it look nice if braces are needed?   
659,What determines carving tools/chisels quality?,"I wish to get into wood carving I just don't know where to start and what I should be looking for when looking for a set of carving tools.   What determines the quality of one set over another? Yes, I understand some sets come with more tools and that can be the reason behind a price difference but then I see some sets with no more than 1-2 extra tools that have extremely varied prices.   In other areas of woodworking tools I can see why one brand would cost more than another because of quality, manufacturing, and material differences but when it comes to carving tools the only one I see applying is material differences but even then I don't believe that would account for the degree of the price differences.  QUESTIONS  What are the quality characteristics used to define quality:    durability? hardness of the metal? resistance to corrosion? ergonomics?   Which are typically most important to new woodworkers?  Any info anyone can offer is gladly appreciated. "

661,Can anyone Identify what this item is and what its used for?,"Another of the unusual items I have discovered during the cataloging of my mothers stuff. Not sure what it is or whats its for. Makers name I believe is Hill Bros or it could be Mill Bros. Its difficult to see as the first letter and the beginning of the address seems to have been worn away in use. So I guess its held at this point whilst being used. There are no other markings either on the brass body nor the steel movable piece. Its very simply made with the brass part measuring 8"" long X 1/4 "" thick. The steel part is 9"" long  x !/8"" thick with no graduations, movable and lockable via the thumb screw. The ends of the steel piece are shaped but not sharpened as would be if used as a scribe. Interesting find! Has anyone any idea what it is and what it is used for?    Possibly some kind of depth finder?   "
662,Best method to attach an edge board to an end-table top board,"I'm making a end-table topper out of 1 3/8"" butcher block for over the top of a subwoofer.  I posted a question about how to route out the center of a board.  It was determined that although it is possible to route out the interior of the massive board, attaching an edge board would be the path of least resistance to create the end table top.       Given the scope of my prior question, I decided to open a new one.  Which is the standard practice of attaching the edge board?  Which might be the most cohesive with butcher block?  Would glue or nails or both be better?  If nails and/or glue, what kinds?     "
663,Painting & finishing Baltic Birch,"I've started a DIY speaker project based on some components from PureAudioProjects.  So far, I have fabricated modular speaker baffles from Baltic Birch (they attach to a frame, albeit a bit different from that depicted in the photos below).  I hope to finish the Baltic Birch to replicate, as much as possible, the kind of glossy lacquer like finishes in the attached images.    At this point I have Baltic Birch, un-edged.   I have the constraint of living in a New York apartment.  While I have space to work and assemble things, I don't have a place to use spay equipment.    I'll need to apply primer and finishes by hand.  How do I get as close to the desired finish as possible? If I sand the plywoods edges, can I get away without edging the baffles?  Any suggestions on sanding process (edges and faces) appreciated.  This post, Will painting the edges of plywood hide the layers?, probably answers the edge question, but I'd think Baltic Birch makes a more forgiving edge then typical plywood.  I generally understand the process of priming, sanding, and painting; but specific recommendations for what:    grit of sand paper to use at what stage of the process as well as specific primers and paint and application suggestions   much appreciated.  Perhaps a satin finish would prove more forgiving, so I'll happily consider that.  Again, any guidance welcome.    re:     Your question has been identified as a possible duplicate of another   question. If the answers there do not address your problem, please   edit to explain in detail the parts of your question that are unique.   I have a number of constraints affecting the materials with which I have to work and where I have to work (all discussed in the original post) that the suggested answer does not address.  I hope to get answers or guidance that help me achieve a result as close as possible to the desired result (see images) with what and where I have to work.  That said, the suggested ""possible duplicate"" certainly helps (and is really interesting!), it just doesn't fully answer the problem. "
664,"What are the minimum, maximum, and optimal depths for dadoes, grooves, and rabbets?","I kind of assume that dadoes, grooves, rabbets / rebates should be no deeper than half the thickness of the material. So, in 3/4"" stock, dadoes should be no deeper than 3/8"". Anything deeper would compromise the integrity of the wood. Is that correct?  And, going the other way, is there a minimum depth of a dado before it's either not adding any strength, or not assisting with alignment? Maybe 1/8"" or 1/16""?  Finally, is there an optimum depth of dadoes? In some of the youtube videos I've seen, it seems that 1/4"" dadoes are fairly common in 3/4"" material. Is that because it gives the optimum strength, or is just easier / faster to cut, or something else? Does it depend on the thicknesses of the pieces being joined? "
665,Is (pure raw cold-pressed) tung oil food-safe (for cooking utensils)?,"I want to try soaking wooden spoons and such (things which will come into prolonged contact with hot food) in tung oil. My local supplier says it is pure, raw and cold pressed and does not contain any chemical additives. They say it will take 3 weeks to dry, but I would not mind waiting some more, maybe months before using the kitchen utensils.  Will this get me food safe wooden utensils or does tung oil stay harmful even if fully cured? (Is it enough to let it cure for a month or so?)  Is it a good idea to add a small amount of orange oil (food safety)?  meta: Is this the wrong stack community? pro wood workers should know about the chemical properties of oil, right? :) "
666,Orbital sander papers coming off,"I'm own a Black&amp;Decker orbital sander (can be found here, using hook and loop papers), which is generally a good tool except for the fact that the sanding papers fall off before their sand becomes unusable.  I tried using different paper brands, but same result - paper usually comes off way before it becomes not-sandy. Anything I'm missing? Or do I need a better sander/papers? "
667,Replacing small drill bits without buying new sets (or preventing breaks),"It seems that every few months, I've broken all my pilot hole drill bits because they're so easy to break (and so frequently used). So, every few months, I buy a whole new pack of drill bits and throw away everything in the pack above 1/8 inch or so (since my bigger drill bits are still in working condition). And then again, I attempt to drill gently, but inevitably, several months later, all my small drill bits break.    Does anyone else have this problem? If so, what are potential solutions. Perhaps...   Is there a place that you know of that sells only the small drill bits (preferably the ones with a 1/4 in hex chuck)? I hate to keep tossing the bigger bits. Has anyone found a method of drilling through hardwoods that won't break drill bits over time? Anything else that I'm missing?  "

Anyhow, my question is given I have to make 5000 of these small products, what would be the best/most efficient/productive method of drilling 15,000 30mm holes? And also what drill piece would you recommend? "
669,Considerations using lumber stored outside,I don't have a shop. My reclaimed wood and what little lumber I have are stored in my shed which doubles as workshop and yard storage. As such it is subject to winter and while it is protected from the elements it is affected by temperature.   Should I not build anything with these materials while they are cold? I might be building very simple cabinets in my mudroom for storage in the near future. Don't want temperature to be a factor that will warp the design.  Bring the materials indoors to give them time to warm up to room temperature before assembly possibly? 
670,Making biscuits cuts by hand,"A good answer from my question on joinery talked about using a biscuit joiner. While this is a great idea a biscuit joiner is not in my top 5 of tools to acquire. I do have a variety of, recently inherited, hand tools that may do the job.    The poster mentions in passing that this can be done by hand. Googling this has either   Led me astray with cooking suggestions.  Showed me how to actually make the biscuits Use the power tool itself   Does anyone have tips or suggestions on how to make biscuit cuts by hand? "
671,What is the best way to remove nails from pallets?,What is the easiest and best way to remove nails from old pallets so as to not damage the wood?

672,How and when should I sharpen my router bits?,"I recently got a router and a set of Freud carbide router bits. I had a friend tell me that he sharpens his bits after every use. So I have a few closely related questions:   How often should I sharpen my router bits? Is it really necessary to do it after every time I use them? What tool do I use? I could see a generic sharpening stone being difficult to use with complex bit shapes. As a follow up to what sharpening tool, can you describe a safe and effective technique for using it?  "
673,Unobtrusive ways to protect plywood corners?,"I'm building a bunch of cabinets out of 3/4"" plywood.  The corners are beveled so there's no ugly plywood ""end grain"" showing in the joints.  While the joint looks fantastic, I'm concerned that the thin plywood veneer will dent and deform easily on this corner.  Since it's veneered plywood, I also can't round the corner at all to discourage denting.  What is the best way to protect this corner?  Will varnish or some other sort of finish help?  Perhaps one of those clear plastic ""sheet rock corner"" protectors?  Or, am I overreacting, and just need to accept that dents will happen? "
674,"What are the different uses for plain sawn (flat sawn), rift sawn, and quarter sawn boards?","When shopping for lumber, how do you identify each type of board, and what are some examples of when you would choose to use each one?  In other words, what are the visual and physical characteristics that may make a board desirable or undesirable in certain types of projects (or even different parts of the same project), and once one selects a type of board for a project, how would that person go about identifying the correct type of board when looking through stacks at a store or hardwood dealer?  Note: for the purposes of this question, I am not interested in the different cut patterns that can be used to mill a log into the various ""cuts"" of lumber as discussed in What are the common cut patterns used to mill a log into boards?, because I purchase my lumber already-milled and do not mill my own logs.

675,"Kanna setup: blade/mouth width, osae-bo bending","I'm in the process of setting up my first kanna. I'm facing two problems:   The blade is wider than the mouth, it overlaps the mimi and chips get stuck there (see picture). What is the correct way to remedy this? I would like to avoid grinding the blade to make it narrower.      The osae-bÅ is bending when I hammer the chip-breaker to its proper position. I assume this is problematic. How shall I proceed? Do I need to file down or bend the mimi of the chip-breaker?    "
676,Garage work bench compound miter saw position,"I'm planning a garage work bench, watching a lot of YouTube for inspiration. I have noticed a common theme - a lot of people sink their miter saw below bench level which I plan to do, but have seen people position the saw slap bang in the middle of the bench.  I hope I'm missing something very obvious but given a finite width of workshop does that not limit the size of the timber you're cutting? Lets say the workshop is 4m wide, saw positioned at 2m you only ever end up with a max length of 2m?  Why do people position the saw in the middle why not at one end with a small overlap on the short side "
677,Can I put more than one extractor on a dust collection system?,"I'm about to install a proper dust extraction kit in my workshop. I've been wheeling my dust extractor or vac around to each of the powertools but I've got some pipes, junctions and gates that I'm going to route around the shop to allow me to leave my extractor in the corner (before I move it to an external lean-to).  But occasionally âeven in a small shopâ a 1.5HP extractor isn't enough. It's possible I might want two lines open at once when routing or planing. That's going to cause some pretty sluggish air, even down at 2Â½"".  But something occurred to me this morning. Why can't I just add my vac to the line? I could easily spur in a t-juction at the same end as my extractor. I could even add another extractor one day.  So my question is, can you gang up multiple vacuums in parallel? My vac and extractor have completely opposite airflow profiles so do I have to consider CFMs and static pressures?  And for the sake of thinking this through, what about putting the two suction devices at opposite ends? Without any real thought, I think that'd just cause a big blockage in the middle but maybe the different profiles mean it'd actually work much better. "
678,How can a bit brace handle be replaced?,"I have an old bit brace that I would like to restore as much as possible. But the handle is ""badly injured"". As shown in the picture, it has diminished over time through hard use and it has  a long crack.    The handle seems to be holding fine for now because of the ""old tool, good quality materials"" thing; but I would like to use it and I get the feeling that it will inevitably break after a little hard use.  Is it possible to change the handle and how? How did they put the handle there in the first place? "
679,Differences Between Bolts Used in T Track?,"I use a T track router bit that is meant to create a path for 1/4"" hex bolts in wood. Its a really nice feature to have for DIY projects, but occasionally, the hex bolt rotates and causes friction when moving. I know that some people use toilet bolts (Although, I'm not sure where they get them, or if there is a significant price difference, or their TPI for that matter) What are the differences between toilet bolts and how they interact in a T track? Do toilet bolts typically slide better? Are they harder to get in different sizes? What are some differences between them? Are there other kinds of bolts usually used in T tracks? "

681,Was there paint under the stain I stripped off?,I'm striping an old headboard for a bead frame with the intention of re-staining it.  As I am working I noticed that the consistency and color of the stuff I'm stripping from the large flat surfaces is different from that of the the stuff coming off of the curved embellishments and details.  Also the wood looks much different there too.  I'm pretty sure there is some kind of facing of nicer looking wood on the large surfaces.  So my question is: I this paint under the stain?  If it's not paint what is it?  When I go to stain it again how should I go about getting a nice looking result as there was before? 
682,PVA wood glue grades and usage,"I've recently looked up some info on PVA wood glue and found the following:  [website]  These gradings are part of the European standard BS EN 204 governing the classification of wood glues for non-structural applications.      There are 4 main types of durability grading, running from D1 to D4. The differences between these are listed below:      D1 = Interior areas, where the temperature only occasionally exceeds 50Â°C for a short time and the moisture content of the wood is 15% maximum      D2 = Interior areas, with occasional short term exposure to running or condensed water and/or to occasional high humidity, provided the moisture content of the wood does not exceed 18%      D3 = Interior areas, with frequent short-term exposure to running or condensed water and/or heavy exposure to high humidity. Exterior areas not exposed to weather      D4 = Interior areas with frequent long-term exposure to running or condensed water. Exterior areas exposed to weather   (BS EN 204 is a British/European standard.)  My question is: For painted exterior joinery (hardwood, with microporous water-based ""breathable"" paint), exposed to weather (windows and doors etc.) would D3 be acceptable, or must D4 classification be used?  I know it says that D4 must be used if exposed to weather, but presumably the paint protects the glue such that it is not directly exposed? On the other hand, the paint is breathable and so technically the glue joints ARE exposed to humidity. "
683,Questions around designing and building an indoor climbing frame,"As the winter is coming, we're planning with my wife to build a simple, indoor climbing frame for our small children and ourselves.  We're also thinking of doing it ourselves as we can't afford to pay a lot for someone to do it for us. I'm not a wood working pro by any means, but I have and am reasonably comfortable with jigsaw, drill, sander, etc.  We've been doing some research and thinking, and I think we have a reasonable design which should be 1) easy to build, 2) low cost, 3) stable enough.  As context, our house is a timber frame building where all internal walls and ceilings are made of plasterboard, so anchoring is out of question, but we do plan to at least secure the frame to the walls.  Without further ado, here are our current sketches:      So the idea is to have 4 vertical poles in the 4 corners and 4 support beams in a rectangular shape on the top. The rope ladder and climbing net will be suspended from the top beams.  Since I don't think I'd be able to do some proper wood joints, I was searching around and found some three way metal connectors:    From: [website]So the idea with these is that the beams would slot in, but the whole frame would be height adjustable as the pole bit has holes on both ends.  My first question would be, how are these called? I only found this US based site, but I'd like to buy them in the UK.  As for the timber, I was thinking of getting 75mm*75mm poles in 2.4m length, like these for example: [website]So the second questions is, would this construction be solid enough to hold a light adult (I'm ~70kg)?  Thanks in advance for any comments / help! "
684,Winter and my tools,"It is getting cold here in Wisconsin, winter is coming. I have always taken in my battery tools.

685,Coping Saw Angles,"Iâm remodeling a couple of rooms and coping the baseboard joints.  For the most itâs going well, especially after getting new blades for the coping saw!  The problem is the fireplace walls are not set at 90 degree angles, they are 122 degrees.  So, if I am going to cope the joint, how I calculate which angle to make the miter cut?  Is it as simple as 61 degrees, half of 122?  After a miter cut is made, what is angle for back cut with coping saw?  For example, a 90 degree corner would be a 45 degree miter and then a back cut of just more than 90 degrees from the face of baseboard.  What would it be for at 122 degrees? "
686,finish for a very large pine dining table --- is beeswax crazy?,"I am an enthusiastic but novice wood worker, and this is my first large project. The table is made of pine boards (and possibly some fir? I've been doing several projects lately and I'm not 100% sure which 2x4s ended up going into this table). I know I want to stain it a deep brown (I have some miniwax dark walnut stain ready to use), but I'm having trouble deciding how to finish it. Here are my concerns:   The surface of the table is roughly 8x4 feet, and I'm worried about being able to get an even coat over the whole thing fast enough if I use a relatively quick drying finish like water- or oil-based poly. I've used water-based poly finish with good results before, but on much smaller projects.  I don't have a dedicated work room or garage. Whatever finish I use will be applied right in the dining room of our rather small apartment. I'm concerned about dust getting in the finish since I can't control the space well --- there's a cat and husband in the mix who will be tramping back and forth, scattering debris. :) Also because I'll be working inside our home, I'm concerned about noxious fumes while it dries. There's a couple warm days coming up in the forecast so I'll be able to open the windows, but still...    I've used beeswax mixed with food-grade mineral oil as a sort of finish before and really liked the way it looked. It was for some baby toys I made for a friend of mine, so I wanted a finish that would be safe even while being sucked/chewed/etc. I have a fair amount left over, so I was wondering if it would be crazy to just use that for the table. It would take the time pressure off the application since it doesn't dry like poly finishes, and there's no concern about fumes.   I know wax and oil finishes don't last, so I would need to ""refinish"" the table with it again every year or so, but that doesn't bother me. I've also read that wax and oil don't provide the same level of protection as other kinds of finish, but I'm not exactly sure what that means in terms of consequences for my table --- I made it ""rustic"" looking on purpose so we wouldn't worry about scrapes and such. It will see heavy use. There's a good chance it will have hot dishes placed on it, as well as the inevitable wine and coffee spills, sticky bits of food, etc. Will the reduced ""protection"" afforded by wax and oil mean we can't keep the table clean?   What are the downsides of using a beeswax and oil ""finish"" on a dining table, if I'm not very worried about preventing cosmetic damage, or having to reapply it annually? If you think beeswax and oil would be a bad choice, what other finish would you recommend, given my concerns above? "
687,Designing and Building a Through-Leg Table,"A popular, modern style of table has the legs going through the table top, so that the end grain of the leg is exposed. Of course, the problem with this design immediately becomes the expansion and contraction of the table top, which would push and pull against the legs. An example of this style is the ""Big Sur"" dining table at Crate and Barrel. Other manufacturers make similar looking tables, which is apparently a variation of a ""Parsons table"" design. I've found one other discussion of the style on the web, and people were convinced manufacturers were using cleverly disguised plywood. I have seen the Big Sur table in person, and I can tell you with complete certainty that the tabletop is solid wood.   Looking under the table, there are kerfs approximately 5 inches apart, which I assume are to allow for expansion. The bottom of the tabletop is reinforced with metal brackets screwed into place. I assume this is to strengthen the tabletop due to the weakness introduced by the kerfs. The kerfs do not go all the way through the tabletop, so I assume expansion would still be a problem. Additionally, there is a 1/8"" gap between the table top and the legs, which I assume is there to allow for additional expansion, but would probably also harbor food crumbs.  I have never heard of kerfing the bottom of a tabletop before. Is this a thing? Am I interpreting the design correctly? My wife and I, who rarely agree on anything, both like the aesthetics of the table. I've talked about custom building one but I'm having second thoughts. Is the table stable or is it just a bad design?   "
688,Finishing a wooden piece by oiling instead of varnish/paint/lacquer,I have just been making my first guitar over the last few days from scratch and I have just gotten to the point of needing a finish for it.

690,DIY woodshop cabinets,Not sure how you want me to re-word my question.

Where can I look to find plans for constructing a cabinet frame from scratch? 
691,Flip-Cart for Wood Planer - Best Hardware and Construction,"I built something that is essentially this:   And it has beaten itself to death, almost falling apart. The original cart, like the one in picture, is 2x4 construction, uses allthread to spin on, and door-slide-locks to secure the tool up or down.  My questions are:  1) What is a good hardware for the pivot mechanism of the flip cart?  2) What is a good securing hardware with less play and perhaps more robust in general? (the slide-locks were jangly over time)  3) Any good ideas on making a heavier-duty cart? Like the one in the picture, mine used 2x lumber and is racking to the point of falling over. "
692,Is there a collection of good reference signage for saw blade types?,"I participate and organize within a makerspace. Though I read up on woodworking and have some familiarity, I don't always remember details myself as woodworking isn't my main focus. This seems to be an issue for other members of our space too.   One of our top problems is people using the wrong blade type for the wrong cutting action due to lack of experience and taking a best guess or thinking they know when they have misremembered. (such as rip-cut blades vs cross-cut blades)  I would like to have reference materials to hang on the wall as a quick guide to remind people of different types of blades, show what they look like, and their various uses.   Is there a collection or resource for some good graphical guides or signs that can be hung up as a quick reference for types of saw blades?  Do people have such graphics they can post here? "
693,Removing silicone lubricant spray from painted timber finished with water-based paint,"I make windows and doors, and a great way to make sure that they open and close smoothly is to use silicone lubricant spray on the rubber weatherseals. While silicone lube is fine to use on painted surfaces, it does affect any repainting - the paint can't adhere to the silicone and causes ""fish-eyes"" or ""pinholes"" in the paint.  We use a water-based, micro-porous exterior paint. I've asked our supplier and they said:     That is a bit tricky, as we donât want to use any solvent chemicals to remove the silicone, as it could remove some of the top coat too. We donât mention any specific product in our maintenance guide, but we do recommend cleaning the surface with soapy (fairy) warm water to remove the environmental debris building up in the joints and on horizontal surfaces. This could partially remove the silicone lube, but it may still leave behind traces which will cause pin holes if recoated.    Does anybody have any good techniques for removing silicone? I'm thinking of telling customers to clean with soapy water, lightly sand and then clean again. Would that do it?  Of course I could stop using silicone spray but the stuff works miracles on sticking doors etc. so ideally I'd find a solution.  I'm also open to suggestions of alternative lubricants I could use which would achieve the same thing (not damaging paintwork or rubbers whilst being effective) but not affect paint and/or be easier to clean off fully.  Edit: Just to be absolutely clear, silicone lube has been sprayed on fully finished joinery (water-based paint), and I want to know how best to clean it off when repainting (which is required every few years as a maintenance operation).

694,"How to flatten 1/8"" Baltic Birch Plywood for laser cutting?","I use a laser cutter for some woodworking projects.   1/8"" (3mm) baltic birch seems to be the standard wood for doing projects with this. But when I buy this wood, it is often somewhat warped and doesn't lay evenly in the cut bed.  I buy this at Woodcraft if it matters. Here is a link for the product I typically purchase.  I have considered just stacking heavy things on it against the ground to flatten.  How can I flatten this thin wood back out?  Are there any tricks to storing such wood so that it stays flat? "

696,Why are keyed drill chucks still available for modern tools?,"Barring support for older tools why are keyed chucks still manufactured? Hopefully not just in my own ignorance but I view keyless chucks as just a useful equivalent without being tethered to the need for a key.   A recent question I asked had a link to [website]They both look beautifully manufactured but why bother getting a keyed chuck? Is it a matter of what the tool supports? Seems unlikely, to me, since I would have expected both chucks to be similar in design, in that respect, to be attachable to the same tools.  Either save me from my ignorance or enlighten me as to what I am missing by favoring keyless? "

698,"Using a coping saw with 1/4"" wood sheets","I was trying to make a dollhouse by hand. I bought some ~1/4"" thick plywood and a coping saw at a box store. I paid about $15 for the tool.  When I got home, I tried cutting out the pattern with the coping saw, but it worked me to death and got stuck a lot. I turned the blade both ways but didn't get much improvement.  I eventually used the power tools (band saw, scroll saw).  Was I doing something wrong with the hand coping saw?   Was this the wrong tool for the job? "

Many many people seem to have shops without air filtration systems and don't complain, though I have poor ventilation in my shop in general. Even so, only MDF tends to mess up the air quality noticeably.  Can I expect an improved weekend shop experience from installing an air filtration system?   At what point does such a system make sense as far as time spent in the shop?  What specific benefits can I expect? "

701,How to fix a 2x4 table that is too heavy for its own good?,"I made a table by gluing 2x4's together on the long side (4"" side). This resulted in a table of abnormal weight. Now the table is sagging in the middle.   Overall table dimensions are 31""X50"".  Can I fix this table by flipping it over and attaching the legs on bottom to make the bottom the new top - thus letting gravity do the work?  Would additional bracing be ideal?  Is there a chance this will tear itself apart?     "
702,How do I prevent big box stores from cutting badly on a panel saw?,"I have had several incidents where I ask for a sheet of 4x8 wood to be cut down into more manageable sizes at a big box store on a panel saw and the result was less than favorable. The resulting pieces were out of square and, of lesser issue, cut other than close to indicated sizes.   I have even marked the wood for them before, and am then left with the awkward situation of them still not doing it correctly.  Is there a trick to these panel saws that the employee's aren't aware of?  Has anyone had good luck with getting fairly accurate and square cuts at a big box store? What steps did you take?  "
703,What are the steps in building a shooting board?,"Now that I know what a shooting board is I want to make one. I see several videos on youtube on how to make one, but what should I be watching for and keep in mind?  What are the steps in building a shooting board? "
704,"Are there any differences between jigsaws, sabre saws, or scroll saws?","From what I was taught, a scroll saw is a table top saw, with a thin blade used for scrolling work.  Though I've also heard these tools referred to as jigsaws.    Manufacturers also offer portable saws, which are designed for making similar intricate cuts.  These tools seem to be know as either jigsaws, or sabre (saber) saws.      To muddy the waters further, scrolling sabre saws are also available.    Are there any differences between sabre and jig saws, or are they all the same? Does the blade being used in the tool make a difference?  "
705,What are the advantages of band-saws with multiple speeds?,"I'm currently thinking about buying a band-saw.  While searching in my price range, I found that some models offer a single speed, others 2 and some even 3 speeds.  I'm fairly new to band-saws and I wonder what's the purpose of multiple speed.  Is it a useful feature?  When should I change speed?  I'm planning on doing mostly re-sawing and a bit of curves.  I currently have no plans for metalworking. "
706,Lumber size standards outside the US?,"America does more ""stick-built"" construction than some countries, since we retained more of our forests longer (old-growth forests are a vanishing breed, but we haven't yet killed off the softwoods). So it's been important for us to have standardized construction-lumber sizes... which are misleadingly land inconsistently labelled but which are still based on inches and feet.  Elsewhere things have gone somewhat differently. For example,  the UK has lost almost all its woodlands, which may be part of the reason folks there are now more likely to build in brick. And they were smart enough to go metric long ago.  Hence my question: are there standard construction-lumber sizes outside the US, and what are they? Or is the US exporting enough pine that our pseudo-2x4's and 4'x8' plywood have become international standards despite the inconvenience?  (I'm explicitly neither assuming there are international standards, nor that there aren't, because I simply don't know. If this starts turning into a complicated/long list, of course it can be pulled to community wiki or wherever... but let's see if there are more than three or so sets of data before assuming that's needed.)  EDIT:  I guess the question I was really trying to ask was whether the metric universe had standardized a set of common off-the-shelf dimensions across countries that would serve as an equivalent of the American sizes for purposes of plan dimensions -- if an American shed is mostly 2x4's on 16"" centers with 1/4"" 4'x8' sheathing (some of those being real measurements and some nominal), is there a well-accepted set of metric dimensions would replace those elsewhere to build the equivalent shed, and are those subject to the same kind of inconsistency?  An answer of ""almost; there are three such systems battling for dominance and they are..."" or ""not really, everyone has their own set of numbers influenced by their own historical construction practices"" or ""actually, there IS an international standard known as..."" would then qualify as a clearly acceptable answer.  As I say, the real question is whether we can translate something between metric and American in any reasonable way, or if we just have to count on everyone making their own adjustments.  (Let's see, in stones/furlongs/fortnights that would be...) "
707,Sharpening grits -- naming and selection,"Independent of all the different kinds of surface one can use to shape, clean, and sharpen tools -- and perhaps independent of whether said surface is motorized or not -- I have to admit to being a bit lost as to what grades of abrasive exist in what media which should be used for what part of the task, and so on. ""Fine"" and ""extra fine"" seem to be defined differently for every manufacturer or medium, and not all of them give numeric values on the abrasive scale which might make them comparable... and I'm not certain whether 600-grit diamond is really equivalent to 600-grit wet/dry sandpaper on a surface plate and how either compares to any of the natural stones which are referred to only by name..  Is there a table, or rule of thumb, somewhere that would clarify this? Is it really just ""go by the numbers and stop when you're satisfied with the edge""?  (Life was simpler when all I had was a jackknife and a generic pocket stone. Now that I can afford to make decisions, especially between different but equally valid choices,  I sometimes get lost in them!) "
708,Is Frank Howarth's homemade table saw splitter safe?,"Frank Howarth made a splitter by creating a zero clearance insert, and then extending the kerf all the way through the back of the insert, towards the back of the table saw. He then glued thin strips of wood inside the kerf behind the blade.    I plan to create a zero clearance insert for my Powermatic 64, and also want to add a splitter. Frank's method would kill two birds with one stone.  Is Frank's design safe?  Note, there is no possibility of attaching a riving knife for my particular saw, which would be better than a statically mounted splitter. "
709,Smell Longevity of Eastern Red Cedar,"I had a question about the longevity of the cedar smell when building with it. We have an armoire at our river cabin, it's 30+ years old and while you don't really smell anything when it's closed, opening it drowns you in a good cedar smell.   I don't know if it's eastern red cedar or not, because it was purchased, but I do have access to a lot of raw eastern red cedar. I want to know how long that smell will last under normal use of indoor items and if there is anything you can do to preserve it or bring it out if it fades.  I think the outside of the armoire is polyurethaned to prevent wear. I think they left the inside untreated so you'd have that smell. While it's 30 years old, it doesn't see normal use. It's bedroom storage for things you don't use very often, but need to keep semi-protected. I'm sure that is the reason it still smells so strongly of cedar. If I were to build a piece from it, leaving some of it raw, how long would you reasonably think the smell would last? I'm sure it fades at some point, but would a light sanding expose more of the ""smelling"" surface? By normal use, I mean something you'd use regularly in your house, such as a dresser, a mens valet, a liquor cabinet, etc... Thanks for the help. "
710,What advantages do F-style clamps offer for gluing up a thick laminate?,"I was reading the ""How to Make a Bandsaw Box"" by the Drunken Woodworker, and I noticed he used a ton of F-style clamps for the initial glue up. Later he uses some Bessey K-Bodies for re-gluing the drawer back together.    My question is, why use so many F-style clamps rather than just 3-4 parallel bar clamps that would cover the entire surface?  Side note: I glued some 2-3/4"" x 5-1/4"" pieces together a few nights ago, and had a bit of trouble getting them to stay lined up while I tightened my K-Body style clamps on them. Would the F-style clamps have been easier to achieve a good alignment? "
711,What factors are considered when grading softwood,"If I just want some cheap material for a project, I often consider using softwood (meant for framing and construction uses) dimensional lumber. In case I pass by a Home Depot store and I have to pick up some scraps by the side of the road, what grade are those scraps? What kind of grades of lumber do contractors usually throw away?  Do they generally stock No. 2 or No. 3 grade lumber? Do they even carry No. 1? Is a stud always a No. 2?  Without relying on the lumber to be graded and labeled correctly, what factors can I look for to estimate the grade myself? Is it absence of knots, or just general appearance? "
712,How can I taper a slightly misaligned board with a handheld power planer?,"Is there a method or technique for tapering a board with a handheld power planer? I have an assembly that's got one board butted up against another board at each end, kind of in an ""H"" configuration. The cross piece of the H is 1/16-1/8"" proud at one end, but flush at the other.    (Sketch courtesy of Damon)  Without disassembling the whole thing, I'd like to plane it flush. However, powered planers generally only have two parallel shoes, not one that can be angled up or down. How can I achieve a smooth taper?  Or is there a better tool for this job that's relatively inexpensive?  The project that generated this question is a king bed frame constructed of raw 2x6 boards lagged together. I'm planning on adding stained ""finish boards"" screwed in from the back when I get the chance. "
713,Is a climbing cut on a table-saw ever justified?,"Having seen the expression ""climbing-cut"" used in several questions on routers and once in comments about table-saws, it finally registered on me that I didn't know what the heck a climbing cut is.  As far as I can tell, with a router, a climbing cut occurs when the cut occurs as the cutting edge of the bit enters the cutting path, whereas the normal way to rout is with the bit doing its work as it leaves the cutting path.  On a table-saw, a climbing cut is when the wood is introduced to the blade as the teeth are coming upward rather than downward as we normally would cut wood.  That is, the wood is introduced from the rear of the saw instead of the front.  Here I am calling the position where the operator normally stands (probably near the on/off switch) the front.  So, basically, it seems that a climbing cut is one that's made backwards.   Does it ever make sense to use a climbing cut on a table-saw?  If so what are the safety precautions that should be followed? "
714,Do auger bits have advantages?,While not the focus of the question I wanted to point out that when it comes to drill presses I almost always see forstner bits suggested here at WW (for good reason of course).    Much to my surprise in this answer from Graphus he suggested using auger bits instead. He mentions that depth of cut and price are key factors in choosing auger bits. Albeit a drill press was not the tool he suggested but I was still surprised.  Understandably spade bits would be at the bottom of choice but when it comes to making holes in wood what criteria would make me choose auger bits over something like a forstner? The latter I have come to understand are superior.  Maybe they are but only under certain conditions?   It is possible those are the answers and that maybe forstner bits should only be used in drill presses. If nothing else this can be a place for that answer.   
715,Wood expansion vs. steel,"I am contemplating a design for a tabletop which would be made up of a series of oak strips, bolted from end to end using long threaded rod. It might be approx 10' (3 m) long. Using several rods, perhaps about 1' (30 cm) apart.  The wood strips would run perpendicular to the long direction of the table.  My concern is that with seasonal expansion &amp; contraction, would this be stable? It would be OK if the top changed size somewhat (like many) but are the steel rods likely to cause cupping or splitting etc.?  Thanks! "
716,Wood floor movement mechanism,"I'd like to understand why wood movement in a floor necessitates large expansion gaps around the outside of the room. I'm not asking why wood as a material undergoes changes due to moisture - I'm interested in how the floor system as a whole actually behaves once installed.  Take for example common wood-strip flooring such as 3/4 oak. Here's a diagram showing a typical recommended installation along a wall parallel to the floorboards:    How is it possible that the entire floor could ever move by approx 3/4"" at the walls without being totally destroyed? Nails would be torn out, boards split, etc. if the floor moved that much, no? So is the gap really useful?  Thanks!    (What I would have thought was: given the way boards like this are nailed, the tongues would remain in place relative to the floor, the grooves would slide around, and the floor as a whole would not move at all. Gaps would just open and close between individual strips.) "
717,Should I use Full Overlay or Half Overlay hinges?,"I want to install two doors on this cabinet using European (concealed) hinges. They will be installed on a Frameless structure made of 18mm panels on the outside and a 27mm panel on the inside that is shared by one door and on the other side by drawers (see diagrams).  I understand that if two doors share the same panel, they use Half Overlay hinges (as per Rocker website). However, in this case, the door will not be sharing the interior panel. On the other side, there are shelves (in this case) and drawers in another case. Furthermore, the interior panel is thicker (27mm vs 18mm) than the exterior panel.  Should I still use half overlay hinges? Or use Full overlay as the door on the outside?  Hope the diagrams explain.  Thanks,      See this question for a description of the difference between full and half overlay hinges. "
718,Reinforcing chipboard,"I'm not a woodworker of any kind but I am building a desk from a laminate kitchen worktop measuring 3000x600x38mm (L x W x T) but I only want the legs on the side. I don't want to have to put an additional two legs in the centre. How could I reinforce the chipboard without adding more legs? Could I just put a 30x30x3000mm (W x H x L) piece of angle iron on the back edge? I want to eliminate the chance of the centre dropping over time or even immediately. It's not going to be holding a lot of weight near the centre: just a monitor, keyboard and mouse in the centre.  However on either side there are going to be 3d printers but as they are near the legs there shouldn't be an issue with bowing.  This is the sort of piece I am thinking of buying, and it looks like this in section:  "
719,How to fix wood pieces on corks,"I would like to fix self-made wooden pieces on top of the following reusable corks:    Their description can be found here (where I bought them and where the picture comes from).  The pieces to fix can be of any shape: spheres, cubes, cones, cylindres, polyhedrons, etc... are painted and may come from different types of wood. They are decorative, and are not bigger than twice the size of the cork.  Should I simply use a wood glue? With this method, it seems a bit difficult to solidly fix a sphere without putting a lot of glue.  Are there alternative ways? Ideally, the method should be aesthetic and solid enough to resists a bottle opening.  "

721,How to account for wood movement in a curved chest lid,"I have found various guides and plans for building a box or chest with a curved (coopered) lid that involve gluing the sides of the lid to the slats forming the top, which are themselves glued together. Here are some examples: one, two  Does this method allow for enough seasonal movement to prevent the lid from coming apart, deforming, or otherwise getting messed up? If not, is there a better way to build this type of lid that does?  I imagine that one possibility is to keep the slats separate and leave gaps between them, but I prefer to avoid this since I want a smooth continuous surface on the lid. "
722,Table Saw without ability to lower blade,"I recently received a secondhand saw, a black and decker 9442, and from what I can tell there is no way to adjust the blade height.  All I see is a tilt lever to make angle adjustments.  Am I missing something?  From this web shot of the saw it seems to have a lowered blade so Iâm a bit confused...  If this is so, what are my options for using this machine safely?  Iâve read about using 7 1/4 circular saw blades on a table saw and thought it might be my only option apart from having a larger 10â blade exposed all the time. "
723,"base for ""standing table"" strong enough?","    Hi, I'm trying to raise my work desk to use as a standing desk to help with back pain and concentration as cheaply as possible with minimal cutting. I'd like for it to last at least a year.  Expecting load to be around 60 lbs + occasionally resting an arm on.  In the diagram, the pieces color coded the same are the same in dimension. The vertical white blocks are 3.5 inches in thickness in x-y. The horizontal pieces are 1.5 x 3.5. I'm planning to stick a few nails in the ends. The cyan rectangle on top is the footprint of my desk with wheels removed.  I'm most concerned with lateral movement at the moment. I'll have 2 monitors on top with 1 being my work monitor(lcd tablet) which I really don't need breaking on me due to failure in the base :D   My rational is that the red blocks being directly on top keeps me from having to worry about joints breaking loose from the weight of the set up. The green blocks adding stability going  downward and between the thick blocks in case weight shifts forward and backward(green/red blocks facing forward and backwards). The pink blocks...I'm not too sure of but it seems like it could help with lateral stability by making an overall wider base and dispersing any lateral shift between the 2 thick blocks??   I don't know what kind of wood it is. Hurricane Michael gifted me with lots of free wood from my destroyed garage. haha I'm pretty sure it's still strong enough for this use though    Am I on the right track? Thank you "
724,Arm for heavy TV,"I have a TV here which weighs around 15 kg. It fits perfectly into the alcove next to my chimney breast, but that's not a convenient viewing angle. So what I want to do is build an arm which attaches to the wall and can swing out and let me use it, and also swing right back in to allow the TV screen to tuck back out of the way.   So I designed this thing here. It's essentially two frames inside eachother. The inner frame is designed to transfer the weight of the TV to the left-hand side, which is attached by hinges to the outermost frame. That's why the bottom-most part of the innermost frame is at that angle. I believe that will transfer the weight in the expected direction.   Then the outer frame is the same, but in reverse. It transfers the weight from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, where it will attach in the same way, by hinges, to a post that's firmly bolted to the wall.    I put half dovetailed lap joints in all corners except the one with an acute angle. That's because that joint will experience more of a compressive force, so a bridle joint will probably fit okay there. And I think they're easier to cut so that's why I chose it. And the halfdovetaillapjoints are for joints which I think will be more pulled apart at, than pushed together by the weight of the TV. The idea is to glue and clamp these joints. I possibly will not need to use screws.  The whole thing will be made from 1.5""x1.5"" pine.  Is this design going to work as I think it will? That is, will the weight be transferred in the manner that I expect? "
725,Gradual upgrade of dust collection ducting,"My question is simmilar to Will this setup severely reduce the CFM from my dust collector?  I have 2"" ducting for a shop vac and a small dust deputy. I want to upgrade to a dust collector and 4"" piping, but since it is my hobby i have limited time so need to approach in stages. I was thinking of mounting the collector first and hooking it up to existing 2"" piping and then slowly replace piping with larger diameter.   I know all the differences between HVLP and LVHP, my question is more along the of am i risking damage to the collector motor itself? "
726,End-grain cutting block surface smoothness,"I bought a cherry and walnut cutting block from an amateur woodworker. Inspecting the surface, there are these little pits in the wood, which are possibly table saw or planer marks that weren't sanded out. The cherry seems to have these pits more often than the walnut, but I'm not totally sure if it is a wood defect or a result of leaving machine marks.  Is the appropriate next step to try to hand sand or to use an orbital sander? Or would I have to do something more drastic?   "
727,Easy drawer joints for plywood,"I'm trying to build square shelving out of 15mm (5/8"") plywood without using screws, so no pocket holes either. I'm trying to drop screws, I feel like it's much easier to do repetitive work with a table saw than with a power drill (I actually use four drills so that I can make the sink hole, shank hole, pilot hole and drive the screws readily â haven't found a sink drill that matches the shank hole I need, it'd need to be thicker, so I do these separately) and also much easier to align the pieces later when I'm using dadoes or similar joinery.  Tried tongue and dado and it broke during assembly, as expected â so many people claimed it worked for them on forums, so I gave it a go, I've got a kerfmaker and it's really easy to make dadoes with it. I guess it would work with solid wood, but not plywood.  I can't do box joints because my table saw will not accept dado stacks and also dado stacks are really hard to find in my country.  I've done rabbets, but I don't really trust them without screws. Is this silly? What other easy joinery options are there that can be used with plywood for things like square shelving and drawers, that can be made with a table saw?   "

729,Food Stain on Polycrylic Cabinet,"I just finished painting my cabinets white and to finish it off, I put three coats of polycrylic on top to make them more durable. I placed the cabinet doors back on yesterday. Today, while making a berry smoothie for breakfast I splattered some on the cabinet door, but didn't notice it for a couple of hours. When I did, I went to wipe it off, but it left a stain on my white door that will not come off.  Three questions:   1) Is there anything I can do that will remove the stain without harming the polycrylic?  2) How did this happen? I figured polycrylic would wipe right off.  3) What should I do now to make sure future messes won't stain the cabinets? "
730,How do I get the blade-guard out of the way for a plunge cut with a Dewalt circular saw?,"I am using the circular saw seen below, and I would like to make a plunge cut, and I can't figure out how to do it. The bladeguard is in the way, and although I can pull it back manually with the black lever seen at left under the XR logo, that requires one of my hands to remain occupied holding it back, which is not desirable-- I need both hands to guide the saw, personally.  How is this done? Am I missing something? It seems very odd that there isn't an obvious way to do this.   "
731,"How to achieve a rounded edge on a thick panel of solid, hard wood","I am trying to make a corner shelf that would match some existing pieces of furniture. I cannot understand how the edge was made, or more precisely, how I could achieve something similar.  The round part of the edge is around 2 inch high, way too much even for 1/2 inch shank router bits. Here's how an existing (not corner shelf) shelf looks like:    This is solid wood (hard wood), mass-produced, stained and lacquered. The other parts of the profile look like I can tackle them but the round, large part is out of my imagination.  How could one achieve this, and not necessarily on a straight portion (i.e. I dream of making the corner shelf as a quarter of a circle:    .. only with an edge profile that would match the ""Louis Philipe"" shelf above.  Is this feasible with DIY tools or only industrial ones? If feasible, how? "
732,"4'x8' length cut - circular saw, table saw, or panel saw?","I'm a complete amateur trying to turn an old 14 wide x 22 long single car garage into a wood shop.  Nobody in my immediate family or friends does any serious woodworking, but I do have some family members/friends who have been in other trades for decades and are pretty handy, so I'm learning by researching and getting advice from them.  Lately I've been finding myself needing to cut full 4' x 8' plywood panels lengthwise down the middle for shelves or other things.  I'm the type that usually likes to research myself silly to find the best possible solution before committing to something.  In this case, it seemed to me that the answers online were pointing to a panel saw, though that may just be because I started from the perspective of ""What do places like Home Depot do?"" And I remembered they have large panel saws for things like this, and it seemed fitting since the word ""panel"" is in the name, it's obviously for cutting panels.  Note  I'm working on a serious budget, so I'm trying to avoid spending 1k+ or even more on a pre-made aluminum frame panel saw.  I looked around and saw that some folks have in fact built their own, such as this youtube video, or there are apparently kits you can buy such as here, or here.  Though upon suggesting the idea of building a panel saw for this purpose, I was met with pretty strong resistance from 2 people, who both suggested their own solutions.  Options  1) Table Saw    One family friend suggested that a panel saw is too large and unwieldy, requiring 16 feet to push a panel fully through, or otherwise too difficult/a hassle to make, and I should instead use my existing 4x8 workbench, modify it to the height of a table saw he could lend, and buy some infeed rollers and push a full 4x8 panel through a table saw, outfeeding onto my workbench.  He at first convinced me, but upon further reading and thinking I realized some points:   Safety - On many woodworking sites/forums, I see many members claim that attempting to maneuver a 4x8 panel through a table saw could be pretty dangerous, and that table saws are best for smaller boards/panels. Practicality - It seems to me that this method would still require at least 16 linear feet of space, probably realistically more like 18-20, but would be even more unwieldy than a panel saw since the board would be horizontal rather than vertical. Additionally, this solution almost certainly would not work for also cutting an 8 ft piece width wise, so I'd ultimately have to use 2 different solutions. Quality - I have never used a table saw once in my life, but I imagine it might be hard to hold and maintain a 4x8 panel steady and straight against a fence, so I don't imagine getting high quality cuts perfecty every time would be easy with this method.   2) Circular Saw    This is my current method. Another family member of mine essentially suggested I should continue with my current solution, which is propping up the plywood sheet above my workbench with 2x4, clamping down, setting up a guide board, and using a circular saw along the length, though he suggested I should lower my workbench height to make this easier. (Currently, my workbench height is approx 40 inches.  Would lowering to 36 really make this much easier?)  My thoughts on this were:   Safety - Seems fairly safe, as long as boards are securely clamped, and the saw is handled securely. Practicality - Practical in that it fits into the footprint of my workbench, but the entire reason I'm searching for another solution is because in my opinion, it's a pain to prop up a plywood sheet and clamp it down, tack on a guide board, and then struggle to securely hold a circular saw halfway across (2 ft) while cutting down the middle of the panel. Additionally, in cases where I need to first cut along the length, and then go back and cut across the width, I have to adjust and turn the 2x4 tracks underneath and the guide board every time.  Since I used 8ft board lengthwise, the boards are too long going the other way so I have to swap them out. Quality - Quality seems to be good, as long the guide is setup properly.   3) Panel Saw    This is what places like Home Depot have setup for customers to use.  Assuming I can build a safe, reliable panel saw for fairly cheap, it seemed to me this would be the best option. Note - I do not count having to put in time and effort to build a panel saw as a negative of this option, because in fact I'm trying to build as many projects as I can, though I would count expense as a negative.   Safety - If the panel saw is sturdy, including the supports, the saw carriage, and the saw carriage rods, then it seemed to me this would be the safest of the 3 options.  The saw is fixed rigid, can only move in 1 axis, and is always facing away from the operator. Practicality - Very easy to use.  Just plop in the panel, adjust to position, and slide panel through saw (or saw across panel). Quality - Again, the saw is rigid, and if the bottom track support for the panel is perfectly inline with the blade, then the quality should be top notch and consistenly repeatable, correct? One good point brought up was if I'm trying to turn the saw 90 degrees and cut horizontally, isn't the top of the panel going to weigh down and bind up the blade?   Other Thoughts - I had the idea of making a panel saw with traveling x and y axes, in order to deal with the issue of needing 16 feet of space, though this idea was lumped into the bag of ""too difficult"".  So ultimately, the question is what is the best method to make the most difficult 4x8 panel cuts (which seems to me to be lengthwise, down the middle), with respect to the 3 qualities I've brought up: safety, practicality, and quality? Am I right in thinking the panel saw is the answer to that question, or am I being naive and is one of the other suggestions made to be a better solution? "
733,What is the best way to transport (ply)wood on the roof of a vehicle?,"I just bought an SUV, so I can now transport boards much more easily than in my sedan. However, the SUV is not big enough to fit 4x8' or 5x5' sheet goods, even with the 2nd and 3rd row seats folded down. I may be able to tilt the sheet goods, but that still may not fit.   I do have roof racks, so thought that might be a better way to go. I worry about wind getting under the sheet goods and lifting them, though, especially since my hardwood dealer is ~20 miles away via highways.   Is there a good way to tie sheet goods to an SUV roof rack, that would prevent them from lifting up from wind? Or is there a jig I can build to more safely transport wood on the roof rack?  "
734,Tips for Simple Inlay of Brass into Walnut,"I'm wanting to try building a simple clock like   (Image credit - www.aliexpress.com)  My question is about the brass inlays. From what I've found on the web, the process is drill perfectly circular holes for the inlays, glue in the small pieces of brass rod (tapping in so they are just proud of the wood) and sanding smooth.  First question about this is does brass sand away with regular sandpaper (say 120 grit) or does it require something special?   Also, what is the best tool for cutting brass? Will a hacksaw cut it?   Is there a particular place to find brass suitable for inlay? I found some options by searching for brass rod on the big ecommerce site, but I wasn't sure if that was a good option or not.   Any tips would be greatly appreciated.  "
735,Ideas for converting dining table to adjustable height coffee table,"I have an old 3'x5' dining table sitting in the garage. I think it would be perfect to go in our den as a large coffee table so my wife can do her huge 3000 piece puzzles up there.    The legs are detachable, so it should be easy to just chop off the bottoms to get to coffee table height.  What I'd really like to do is have the height be adjustable so it can go between coffee table, mid-height for board games etc in front of a shortish couch, and up to dining table height.   I know a thing or two about metal work, but almost nothing about woodwork, so I'm hoping for something fairly simple. I don't need the height adjustment to be continuous or even particularly easy.  My thought was to:    chop off the bottom ~6"" of each leg and then cut that in half.  drill a hole in the ends of each piece attach the pieces together with threaded rod   Then adjusting the table height would involve screwing the bottom sections on or off one at a time. As a bonus I should be able to use that to level the top too.  Questions:    Is this a sensible way to do things? The legs are straight vertical, so there shouldn't really be any horizontal forces on anything.   Can I just use a drill press for the center holes, or do I need to remind myself how to use a lathe? Any rule of thumb for picking the rod (material, thickness, threading) What's the best way to attach the rod? I was thinking to tap the wood itself, then glue the rod into the bottom pieces.  Would something like a nut make more sense? If so, how do I attach the nut? (epoxy?) Is there a completely different better way to do this?  "
736,Is it a problem if my countersink bit is slightly larger than it needs to be?,"I just want the ability to countersink (occasional use) and I have 6-7-8mm head screws and I'm buying a single 8.3mm countersink bit (Makita HSS P-73542 3 flute). But what's stopping me from not drilling with it all the way, just stop when the hole reaches ~6mm diameter for example? Officially, does the countersink bit need to reach its ""max"" diamater, THEN (by pushing it more) make a tiny half-mm straight ""wall"" for the side of the screw head? If that tiny wall is needed or I need more precision I guess I could even finish it with a 6mm normal wood drill bit, no? "
737,How can I properly sharpen my knives with power tools?,"I have drawers full of knives and blades that have never been as sharp as when they came from the factory.  I have some whetstones, Lansky sharpeners, and leather strops.  I have tried to use those but eventually realized that I'm as likely to make an edge worse as I am to improve it.  In large part this is because:   I can't maintain a proper and constant angle of attack while working a curved blade across a series of stones by hand. I don't know which step to use or for how long, given a blade's condition.   Meanwhile, I have benches full of power tools: Bench grinders, belt sanders, drill press.  I believe I can hold a reasonably constant angle while dragging a blade once or twice across a tool that's doing the work for me.  As I understand it, there are only three steps to producing a perfect edge:   Sharpen:  In this step the blade is run against the grit to grind a new edge.  Perhaps two grits (usually 100 and 400) are used in this step.  (Optionally, one might grind a relief angle that's more shallow than the cutting edge angle, but it's the latter one that has to be maintained going forward.) Hone: Here the blade is run with the grit to knock off burrs and nudge dings back in line.  Power honing is done with finer grits, but not sure how fine. Strop/polish: Once again the blade is run with the grit to smooth the edge.  You know you're done when the edge is as shiny as a mirror.   With this in mind I began searching for sharpening wheels preloaded with an appropriate compound for each step.  Instead I've found a smorgasbord of wheels ranging from glass to paper, and separate polishing compounds of widely varying composition, many of which users report needing to supplement with oil and wax.  Great.  Am I missing a shortcut around selecting and loading the power sharpening tools?  Now, suppose I manage to find or prepare a line of 3 or 4 powered wheels.  I pick up a knife.  How do I know which step to start at?  And how do I know when I'm ready to move it to the next step?  I know that if I do it right then at the end I have a blade that will catch and slice cleanly through a loose sheet of newsprint.  But is there a foolproof way to get there without grinding away undue amounts of time and metal? "

739,"How can I strengthen my 3/4"" Plywood Bunk Bed Plan?","I'm working on a plywood bunk bed for our two 4 year olds. Obviously I need it to look cool, but more importantly not collapse on their impressionable skulls.  I plan on using 3/4 plywood (.706 or so) with 3/8"" dowels and some pocket screws (as well as titebond). I don't want to over or under engineer it.  The width and depth allow for about 1/2"" on each side of the mattresses. I'm most concerned about   racking left to right and back to front enough support across the top long spans of 3/4"" to prevent collapsing.   I'm planning on possibly using corner glue/screw blocks (triangle shaped) to prevent affecting the mattress at all and 1.5"" x 1.5"" slat supports on both the uppers and lowers.  My question is, am I missing something that could strength the whole assembly? Will what I have planned be good enough? Is there a connector I'm overlooking. Didn't want to user metal 90 degree connectors because of the sharp edges but I could put them out of reach for the children.  White dots are 3/8"" dowels, and green lines are pocket screws (starting in grey piece)    Interior shows 1.5""x1.5"" slat supports, 1.5""x1.5"" corner and mid span supports, and potentials 1.5""x1.5"" triangle shaped glue/screw block. The upper bunk is similar.   "

742,Is this resin & nail hole a Bad Thing for a chopping board?,"I've turned a recycled piece of canadian oregon &amp; a recylced piece of australian messmate into an end-grain chopping board.  However, I've got minor concerns about two items on the end product that I was hoping for some help with...   There is something which I think is sap/resin. Is this a bad thing? I understand that somebody might - whilst cutting into the board - cut into the resin. Is that bad? Is it poisonous?  The boards used to have nails in them. They've all been pulled out now, but is it bad that they used to have nails in them? I mean, if the nails had been rusty - as an example - would any leftover embedded rust be something that is bad to have on the board?   Note that in the above picture, that is the side of the board, and it isn't finished yet... Still need to plane down the top of the board and trim up the sides.   Thanks! "

744,Stain not adhering to wood,"I purchased a table from a reputable furniture store and received it about 2 weeks ago.  Everything seemed OK with the table upon receipt.  However, on 11/1, I noticed the ""stains"" (or lack of stain) and clear buildup of what appears to be glue on the table.  I am certain nothing was spilled on the table; we only used a damp cloth to clean it.  Customer service is saying that it is a result of spilled glue or spilled nail polish remover after we received it.    Is this a case where the glue was not completely sanded at the manufacturer and the stain did not adhere to the wood?  Or does this seem more like a spilled glue/ solvent after delivery?       "

746,Rocking horse without a band/scroll saw or belt sander,"Is there any way to create a simple rocking horse without a band saw or scroll saw or belt sander, and not spending days whittling/hand-sawing rough pieces?  I have a miter saw, table saw, drill press, and a ton of hand tools (mostly for traditional bow-making), and wanted to make 3 rocking horses for some of my younger nieces. The recurring them is that I need a band-saw for the ""rounded"" pieces at the bottom. I'd do it with a hand saw, but I'd like these to look semi-professional without having to spend days hand-carving/sanding the rolling feet portion of the horse.  Is there an economical alternative to a stationary band saw or scroll saw, or some plans that allow me to get buy without? All of the quality bench-mounted saws and sanders are very expensive, from my searches through Amazon and Lowes.  Thank you. "
747,How should I polish and finish this table top stained with Minwax Polyshades?,"I built a dining tabletop out of pine and stained it three times with Minwax Polyshades Pecan and a fourth time with Minwax Polyshades Espresso. The fourth coat was just to get the rough looking appearance on the wood.   Now I'm trying to figure out what, if anything, to apply as a polish to give a smooth texture and some sheen.  Note that Minwax Polyshades stain already includes polyurethane in the stain, so I already have that level of protection.   Should I just use fine steel wool now to create a smooth surface and bring out the existing sheen? Or can I apply something else such as paste wax to help with additional protection and add some more sheen? I'm unsure what the best option is here, given that this is for a dining room table and that I'd like for it to hold up against spilled food and drinks.  Thanks for any insight!   "
748,How to finish paint/poly removal from a guitar body,"I've been working on stripping the paint from one of my guitar bodies. It had a fairly thick polyurethane finish so I stripped it with my heat gun and sanded off the majority of the rest with my mouse sander.   So my question are how can I remove the scorch marks and how can i remove the remaining poly in the hard-to-reach places? Is there something I can strip this with or will I just need elbow grease and sandpaper?  I've sanded the hell out of most of the scorch marks and they just won't shift completely.   Just as an extra, I'm planning on round routing the edges over so it has a nice less sharp edge, and then finishing with finishing oil. Not going to varnish or poly this again. I like the natural finish.     I am partially tempted to just go with the scorched look, I'm even wondering about doing the whole body on purpose. But I rather like the clean lump of wood look. I do want to remove the last bits of poly though.   Any advice and suggestions please.  "

751,Are there any non obvious (specifically structural) concerns to building a walk-in wardrobe,"So, I'm pretty new to woodwork but ambitious.  I have an ugly wardrobe space I want to turn into a walk in.  So the plan is to pull down the plasterboard wall, create a new one at the end of the sloping roof and put a door in it.  Et voila, walk in.  That part should be pretty straight forward, find the studs, build a frame, attach some plasterboard:-    Using this space, I want to build loads of storage.  I would like to know if there's anything I'm overlooking before pulling down walls.  firstly, there'll be a space where the wall was, what's the best way of covering that on the roof end? A thin layer of ply, replace the whole inside roof?!:-    Secondly, I have a storage plan (see last image, although that inside left board needs moved out and obviously the drawers &amp; cupboard on the right wont be hollow).  I figure some MDF (or something of better quality if I can figure that out).  What is the best way to support all of these?  Is it the same with the wall?  Find studs and build support beams that I fix to?      I've did a fair amount of online research but support beams never seem to be mentioned and I can't see how it would all be stable on it's own. Are there any concerns I've missed?    I'll also be throwing low heat lights up in all compartments and on the flat roof part at the top but that's not too complicated.  Ventalation is another concern but probably beyond the scope of a Woodworking site. "
752,Problems adjusting block plane,"I have an Irwin-Record 9Â½ block plane which I bought new a year or so ago and have been using and occasionally sharpening the blade on an oilstone. Now the blade-depth adjustment has reached the end of its travel.   When I adjust the blade depth wheel to the other end (fully retracted blade) and move the blade to the next position, the blade protrudes too far - about 1mm depth of cut. The only way to make this work seems to be to grind down the blade significantly which doesn't seem right.   left = before, right = after  What might be wrong and how can I fix it?    Update following scanny's answer:  Using a vernier caliper, the travel of the fine-adjust tooths without blade installed seems to be about 3mm. The spacing between front edges of all but one of the slots in the blade is about 4mm, so this looks like a design flaw. Maybe Irwin (or their far-away 3rd-party manufacturer) substituted a blade design to save costs somehow?  In fact, looking at it, only the first couple of slots can be used before the end of the long slot in the blade hits the lateral adjuster.     Older Record blades and the current Ray Iles replacements only have grooves on the rear rather than through-slots and they may have been more finely spaced. I only have this photo to go by:    If the long slot in this blade is the same length as that in my Irwin-Record blade (34.3mm), the adjustment grooves are spaced 3mm (centre to centre) and so are a better match to the fine adjustment travel.    Using a dial indicator (as suggested) I measured the travel of the blade installed in the plane when moving the adjustment wheel from top (deepest blade position) to bottom (highest blade position) I measured a total movement of only 1.95mm - say 2mm. This is less than the 3mm travel in adjuster tooths which I measured when the blade was not in place.   (Plane is clamped down, subdial of indicator shows just under 2mm movement = 2 rotations of main dial for full travel of plane's adjustment wheel. Click for larger image)  This is partly because at the top position, the pivot arm hits the underside of the blade before the adjustment wheel reaches the top of it's screw. There's also a large vertical clearance gap between the adjustment wheel and the edges of the corresponding slot in the pivot lever in which the wheel sits - so part of the wheel's travel doesn't move the lever, until the wheel reaches the other side of the clearance gap.  Given the spacing of the adjustment slots is 4mm, I can't see how this blade can be moved to the adjacent slot and positioned ready for use without grinding the blade down by 1 or 2 mm.   "
753,Using Tung Oil and Polyurethane on Maple?,"I am getting close to completing a desk I am building. This has been a very ambitious project for me as this is the first time I have ever built any furniture (shelving not counted) and this is a height-adjustable sit/stand desk.  I am at a point where I want to start finishing the wood (which is Maple). I have access to a ton of Tung oil my dad picked up for dirt cheap. I also have some polyurethane. I want to seal the wood from water and give it a nice finish. My thoughts were I would use a few layers of Tung oil and then a layer or two of polyurethane.  I was talking to my dad today and he suggested that I use one or the other, but not both because tung oil is actually a finishing product and will seal the wood for me.  Is this true? Or does my original plan make sense? I am also open to suggestions. I believe he said he even had a bunch of linseed oil I could use. "

Can they get a surface as smooth as a traditional plane?  "
756,Workbench better against or away from the wall?,A few days ago I asked for opinions about my ideas for construction of a workbench that would be mounted against a wall. I now have another question. I have seen many different videos of great woodworkers and the vast majority of them have freestanding workbenches either near the middle of the room or far enough away from the wall that they can fit comfortably between the two. Would having a wall-mounted workbench obstruct my maneuverability enough to have a negative affect on my work? It has also occurred to me that I could use much more wall space for storage of my tools if I were to move the bench away from the wall. Any comments or suggestions?  
757,To Resin or Not To Resin (Cracked Gum Wood),"I have the slab shown in the pics below.  During the drying/curing process it developed many micro cracks a few larger (some through-slab) cracks.  These cracks exist on both the main surfaces and on the live edge itself (one or two with some minor instability...should enough pressure be applied).  I've worked on one slab before this so I am a novice as of yet.  I love the character the cracks add to the slab and am curious about two things w.r.t. using 105/205 West System resin as to fill cracks on it:  1) Will filling cracks with resin visually add or detract?   2) Would filling with 105/205 West resin add any real strength?  I just bought the slab and while it seems thoroughly dried, I'm uncertain as to whether new cracks will inevitably form due to the type of wood that it is.  3) How does one fill the live-edge side of the slab with resin while avoiding bleeding of the resin into the wood surrounding the cracks?  The bleeding normally of course needs heavy sanding to remove, but I'm afraid of this heavy sanding due to concerns of destroying the feel/look of the live edge.  4) General thoughts on how best to approach this slab to bring out its full beauty/potential?  Note: I've investigated this similar SO post, but the answer seems rather unhelpful as far as how to best manage edge-resin-fills: Can you fill cracks in the side of a live edge slab  Thanks!     "
758,deciphering different grits of diamond-plated sharpening stones,"I recently purchased two diamond sharpening stones from amazon. One of them was a medium grit (600) and the other was a fine grit (1200). They arrived in the mail about a week ago. When I unboxed them I noticed that neither one was labeled for its specific grit, and to the touch, they both feel exactly the same.... How do I figure out which is which? I haven't used them yet... Would I be better suited just giving them both try and see which one puts a finer polish on my chisels? I guess that should tell me, but any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. By the way, they are not the DMX diamond sharpening stones, they were the ""Ultra Sharp II Diamond Stone Kit - Medium and Extra Fine"". In fact, I am actually looking at the product on Amazon right now, and the one's in their picture clearly are easy to tell apart just by looking at them.... Do you think they might have sent me two stones with the same grit by mistake?   "
759,Air Nails or Staples?,"I have an air nailer/stapler capable of shooting, obviously, nails or staples. I've been using the nailer functionality quite often, to good effect, but I'm curious as to why someone would use the stapler function instead.

Can the stapler function be used instead of a traditional stapler for certain uses (Boxes (On a low enough pressure), or for anchoring wires to projects?) "
760,Stopping a table saw by turning off at the outlet,"I have the much-maligned Makita MLT100 table saw. For all its faults, after a fair amount of fettling I've got it working fine.  However I've taken to stopping the saw by turning off the switch at the wall. This has a few advantages:   It turns off the shop vac connected to the same outlet. It triggers the safety cutout plug I use (so simply switching back on doesn't actually turn on the power). It means I lean AWAY from the saw to stop it, rather than bending down and in TOWARDS THE SPINNING BLADE OF DEATH to turn it off. I have three young children around, and it's a 3-step process to start the saw:   Turn on outlet. Turn on safety breaker (at which point the shop vac will come on, as it was switched on all along). Start saw using green button on the saw itself.    I've found that the green/red power switch on the saw itself appears to turn itself off when power is cut (this makes sense - in the case of power coming back after a power cut, you wouldn't want your table saw starting itself back up!), and the brake still kicks in as normal.  Question is - is there any potential for trouble using this method? Either a danger I've not thought of, or damage to the equipment I haven't considered? "
761,Fixing mistake: Filling the gap in a breadboard end on tabletop,"I am building a pine desk/table (with handtools, so far) with a breadboard end design. One end piece does not sit flush with the tabletop everywhere along the entire width of the panel (32"" or so). Out of impatience, I gave up on tweaking the shoulders to get the perfect fit along both (cosmetic) shoulders of the tabletop (top/under).    Now that it's closed up, the gap is noticeable. I also feel that debris will get lodged there. But maybe not.  I'd like to cover that gap. Is making a clean groove with a plough plane and placing an inlay between the top and breadboard end a technically feasible option at this point? What about inserting wedges, or running some sort of bead?  I see using filler is recommended in other similar questions, but it is reported to crack within a year or two, as the panel narrows/widens.   The plan is to finish it with oil, and I wonder how much of the gap will be covered by the finish.  How to avoid in the future?  I have a chance to fix the problem on the other side of the table, as I haven't closed up the other end yet -- I'm including an image of the construction (same as the one that's closed).  To close them, I have a 2""-wide strip of glue only on the center tenon, and 3/8"" dowels. The dowels going through the non-center tenons can slide in elongated holes.  The only tools I have at my disposal for this, are a skillsaw (and jig) and handtools/planes (handsaws, paring chisels, bench #4, #5, block, and rabbet). I've tried using my rabbet plane as a shoulder plane along the width of the table to make the wall truly square, but running perpendicular to the grain creates tearout along the cosmetic shoulder of the table -- so I feel i'm trading one problem for another.      Edit  I gave up on fixing the long edge gap, and will leave it as is (for now). However, after cutting the horns of my breadboard ends on either side of the table, my subpar chiselling of the mortise haunch became extremely obvious -- and I decided it was worth it to try the ""thick shaving method"" there.  I handsawed off the horns a few mm over on each side -- to allow for some error. Some decide to leave longer breadboard ends to create a design element/feature out of them, or decide to enclose the haunch completely, but I wanted them flush and I wanted to be able to see the haunch. Anticipating some end grain planing, I pared the corners of the horns off with a chisel to prevent breakout.   (larger)  As I got closer to being flush, I switched to sanding. And I started to notice how bad the gaps were, with the dust accumulating in the gaps, (in the image, the white sand dust outlines the gap around the haunch):   (larger)  I couldn't produce shavings/sliver thick enough with the plane, so I produced them by paring with a chisel on a spare piece of wood, and adjusted the thickness of the created thin wedge with sandpaper. I applied glue only the breadboard-end side, wedged the shim into the gap, trimmed it and sanded it flush.  I believe I could have glued just the haunch side instead, but the fibers would have needed to be oriented the other way, and it's easier to wedge in parallel with the breadboard end grain.   (larger)  In retrospect I should have switched from the plane to the sanding block sooner, because the last few runs with the plane pulled some fibres out around the edge, as can be seen in the upper lip of the mortise, in the form of little ""craters"". It would have also looked better if I'd picked wedges that matched the end grain zebra pattern, but it was quite a puzzle already -- again, more patience would have helped.  Edit 2: It's been a few months already, and I'm noticing that the table width of the top shrinks and expands by about 1/16"" on each side of the table (average width of 30""), varying with indoor humidity. The glued wedges are holding up so far. This was expected from the start, but the breadboard end length is not always flush with the table. I like to think of it as a built-in *digital hygrometer feature . I sanded the horns flush around the holiday season, so it might be the gift that keeps on giving, depending on how the finish affects it.  *digital, as in: you can read it by passing your digits over it.

762,"What's a quick, easy home-made honing guide?","   What's a quick, easy, home-made honing guide for sharpening blades for e.g. a plane?   I'm thinking for a 25 degree surface, just cut a block of wood to 25 degrees on a mitre-saw and then screw the plane blade flat to it with the blade end just proud.

763,Framing Nail/Nailer Angles/Types?,"I'm somewhat curious about framing nailer angles &amp; framing nails. I see that they come in a variety of angles, and the nails that they fire tend to be different as well. I've also heard that despite this, there isn't much difference between framing nailers aside from how close you can fit the gun into a frame due to the angle of the magazine. I've also observed that there are several nail types, each with a different nail-nail attachment method (Such as paper, or plastic connectors between them). From my observations, I think that the paper stays with the nail when it is shot, and prevents water intrusion into the wood target, whereas the plastic just fragments on launch and impact.  What are the differences between framing nailer angles, and their magazine nail types, and what different applications are they used for? When should one type be used over the other? "

765,"To prepare SPF (spruce/pine/fir) tabletop before a finish: should I use scraping, planing, or sanding?","My tabletop is made of selected SPF boards and has been planed with a handplane. I've added breadboard ends to each end. I'm preparing the surface for a finish, and trying to avoid sanding altogether, using a combination of planes and/or scrapers. I can obtain a sufficiently smooth and reflexive surface with just planing on individual boards of the same material.  I was hoping I'd be able to do a final pass with only a card scraper over the surface to remove irregularities, remaining visible glue, remaining pencil marks, and remaining little bits of tearout around knots, but my scraping makes the glassy surface I had from just planing look more dull -- i am losing some sheen.  I could maybe re-plane the entire surface one last time, but planing has been made difficult at this point with the addition of breadboard ends, orthogonal to the grain direction of the main panel. To a lesser degree, this is also true of the possible grain-direction reversal at the boundary of each board of the main panel (i.e. I don't think I considered grain direction when assembling my panel).  On softwoods (i.e. woods with low-density fiber), in practice, can card scrapers (once sharpened properly) be used to achieving a surface comparable in smoothness and reflection to that obtained by planing (i.e. well-tuned bench plane)? Can card scrapers achieve high gloss also on softwood endgrain?  Or should I just give up the blades, and sand it like it's 1999. "
766,How do I know if the wood I picked up on Craigslist is treated?,"I picked up some cheap wood that someone was getting rid of. He said it was used for a deck, and I can see it is painted red. How do I know if it is treated? (Also, anyone know what kind of wood it is?)  The wood in question is the small block sitting on top of oak veneer plywood. "
767,How do I calculate the weight threshold for plywood boxes/cabinet carcasses?,"How do I calculate the weight threshold for cabinet carcasses based on the dimensions, material (e.g., plywood, mdf), and material thickness?  Has someone already worked out a nice formula that I can use? "
768,How can I use tea to replicate the look of ammonia fumed wood?,"A comment by dfife on the Q&amp;A Which woods work well with ammonia? says:     You can also soak any piece of wood in tea (or something else high in tannins) and give it a higher degree of tannins. I've done this quite successfully with pine and poplar.   I would like to try this, but have some questions about the process:   How long should I soak the wood for? Does the length of time vary by species or by how strongly the tea has been brewed? Will the wood warp as it dries, and if so, how can I minimize that? Does the color change as the wood dries? If so, how much, and does the grain become more or less emphasized?  "
769,How to make proper pilot holes,This is related to the question about Replacing small drill bits without buying new sets (or preventing breaks) but I wanted to expand on this.  I think I'm just using cheap bits and much like the OP in the above question I am going through them like balsa wood. I also find that when I make pilot holes and countersinks that my wood is still prone to splitting. That and my bits are burning in hardwood (oak I think) so something is wrong there.   Should I always be using brad point bits on wood? It is what they are for is it not? How do I know how big my pilot hole should be? In general I try to use a bit the same size as the shaft of the screw I'm using (width without the threads to be precise).   How can I make better pilot holes. I've seen videos where you clip the end of a nail and use that but that seems more of a kludge than a solution. Worst case this could be a dupe of the other question. 
770,How long does it take tung oil to cure?,"Depending on what you're reading, tung oil cures in a day     I use Minwax tung oil on all my turningings. Two Coats ussually. After the   second coat, I buff with the Beall Buffing system, Ussually about 6 to 24   hours after applying last coat of tung oil.   a few days:     ... tung oil is too difficult for most people to use by itself as a   finish. You apply tung oil just like linseed oil or oil/varnish blend,   but you have to sand tung oil after every coat, not just after the   first, and it takes five to seven coats, allowing two to three days   drying time between each, to achieve a smooth, attractive sheen.   or several weeks:     Depends... true 100% pure tung oil needs about 2 weeks to cure... why do they sell this stuff as a finish?    What's the real story behind tung oil curing time? Â How long do I have to wait between coats? "
771,Wood identification,"I've been working with some wood that I was given, but I don't know what type of wood it is. It's a light coloured wood similar to pine, but it has a greenish tint in parts of it. It's got small black streaks inside the wood that look like they might be small knots.   While it would be great to identify the wood in question it would be better if I could go through a process to identify it myself. Is it really just a case of being told what different woods are and learning slowly over time or is there a way I can narrow it down myself? I've tried looking on www.wood-database.com but there are just so many woods on there and they all start to look the same to me after a while.   Is there a good list, maybe, of the ten most common types of wood that I'm likely to see (for England)? If I could learn that, I'm sure I'd be able to identify most of the wood I'm likely to see. "
772,Should I attempt to stain to all of the trim in a room (floor to ceiling)?,"I have a dining room with some nice oak wainscoting, ceiling trim and faux beams.  There are also four windows, and two doors. All with trim.  I have stripped off all of the paint applied by prior owners and done an extensive amount of sanding to prepare the wood.   I would like to use a dark walnut stain on everything, but I'm not sure of the logistics of the endeavor.   Is it doable for a homeowner?  Can I break it up into smaller tasks, or do I need to stain everything all at once? "
773,Proper sequence of acclimating wood for building,"I have heard it said that one should always acclimate wood to one's woodshop before milling the lumber (so it can adjust to humidity and stabilize it's size). I've also heard that cutting/milling lumber releases the internal tension of the wood and that a woodworker should make rough cuts, then let the wood sit again before tackling the final project.   Does anyone know of a good rule of thumb for the number of days wood should acclimate and under what stages? Assuming the wood has already been properly dried, what would be the proper sequence of steps?  I'm guessing it should be something like this: After purchasing the lumber, let it sit in your shop for xx number of days. Then, rough cut all pieces and let sit for another xx days. Subsequently, mill and cut to final width then let sit in the environment it will reside for another xx days, then glue up.   Any thoughts? "
774,Does pressure treated lumber need to reach a proper moisture content before use?,"I'm planning on building a garden bench for the outdoors. I opted for Pressure treated pine (I'll be staining it a cedar color) because it was cheaper than cedar, way cheaper than white oak and mahogony, and way way cheaper than teak. I wasn't thinking when I made my decision (nor when I loaded the wood from the lumber yard), but when I brought it home, I noticed that the wood was very wet from the chemicals they used to pressure-treat it. Given what I know about moisture content, my immediate thought was that I'd have to wait a year before this lumber is ready to work with. Is this true? Will it take a year or more to get back to the proper moisture content? Or should I not even worry about it (i.e., the nature of the chemicals won't make it move)?   I know that people build with PT lumber all the time without worrying about moisture content, but these tend to be non-furniture applications.   A related question--if I can use this before it's fully dried, will regular wood-glue (e.g., Tightbond III) work? If not, will epoxy?  Thanks! "
775,"What does ""stickering wood"" mean?","I have seen the term ""stickering wood"" mentioned on a few other sites, but no one seems inclined to define what it means.  Is this where you pile wood in stacks with sticks between the boards to allow airflow? Is this a labeling method where you place a sticker on a grouped set of boards? "
776,Does circular saw diameter bear on anything but maximum cut depth?,"Assuming we're talking about sliding miter saws, or table saws, does one select a blade diameter purely to maximize the potential depth of cut?  Or are there other benefits to larger blade diameters for even shallower cuts?  I'm actually thinking larger blades might be slightly detrimental to shallower cuts because a larger radius puts more blade surface area in contact with the piece being cut, but maybe that's only a problem if the piece isn't perfectly supported/fed (and so can flex in against the blade). "
777,Tiny core bits for broken screws,I have on several occasions broken screw heads in pieces where I can't readily access or cut into the joint they're securing.  Is there such a thing as a tiny core drill bit for cutting around what's left of the fastener so I can remove the rest of the wood piece it was securing?  Or is there any other technique for dealing with this situation when I can't cut the wood piece loose from behind using a reciprocating saw and can't just tear the piece free? 
778,What could cause a lathe to have low torque and only develop approximately half its rated RPM?,"My Jet 1642 lathe is only developing about 500 RPM instead of the 1200 it should in low range.  It also has significantly less torque, making it difficult to turn anything even with a light touch &amp; sharp tools.  It has a 3 phase inverter, and I suspect one of the phase legs have failed.  Is it possible that the inverter is contaminated with fine dust?  I turn a lot of tropical hardwoods and frequently sand to a very high grit and wonder if the silica common in them could somehow be interfering with the inverter circuitry.  Since the lathe is long since out of warranty, I'm considering opening it up and blowing it out with compressed air to see if that helps and possibly cleaning the circuit board with alcohol.  Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, how were you able to resolve it?  Update:  It's now three years later, the lathe is behaving completely normally and I've done nothing beyond cleaning it really well.  I suspect it may have been water intrusion since the lathe sits right up against my garage door.  I have put in a plywood panel to prevent direct spray, but that's really just a guess as to what the actual problem might have been. "
779,Can clamps be too tight?,"When gluing pieces together, I've always used an abundance of clamps and tightened them with all my might. Is it possible to tighten them too much? At some point, could I squeeze out so much glue that the joint becomes weaker?  I can see how tightening too much can cause warping or damage to the wood. Here, I'm mostly curious about the effect the tightness has on the performance of the glue. "
780,Is there a 'best' way to sharpen an edged tool like a chisel?,There are a bewildering variety of sharpening methods out there and many opinions as to which might be the best.  Is there a best way?  What are some good references on the subject?

In paragraph five of this answer to a tear out question, Bowlturner says:  ""Sharper gouges are more likely to cut the fibers instead of pulling them out and causing this problem. It took me a while to figure these things out.""  What does a torn fiber look like compared to cut fiber?  Are there other ways to know if fiber is tearing instead of cutting? "
783,Are ratchet straps suitable for clamping glued boards together for a table?,I'm thinking of making a very large slab for a table. But I don't have enough pole clamps or long enough poles.

785,How do I cut a 45 degree bevel on a table saw with consistent dimensions?,"I tried making consistent 45 degree bevels to create a cube. Cutting all edges of 6 perfect squares on the table saw with blade tilted. I also used a guide. But, regardless, there were slight variations in each piece making for an imperfect cube.

787,What is a hardware attachment for dowel rods that allow for running wire through the ends?,"I made this tensegrity cube using dowel rods and eye screws. The eye screws were hard to install and didn't work well due to twisting and coming loose. I'm imagining a cap like hardware for dowels that allow you to attach other things. In this case running wire through them. Do such ""caps"" exist?  What is a hardware attachment for dowels rods that allow for running wire through the ends?   "
788,Can a picture frame be made from wood molding from a DIY/Big Box store?,"I want to make a picture frame while avoiding the routing involved to inset the picture, glass, and supporting backer into the back of the frame. The wood trim and molding at big box stores looks a lot like picture frames. Is there a suitable type of trim/molding for making picture frames easily?  Can a picture frame be made from wood molding from a DIY/Big Box store? "
789,What is aircraft plywood? What is it used for?,"I was looking at boomerangs and ran across the term ""aircraft plywood"". Going further they just seem to be talking about spruce as in ""spruce goose"".  Does the term ""aircraft plywood"" have any special significance, use, or connotation for woodworkers. Is it of a higher quality than regular spruce?  What is aircraft plywood? What is it used for? "
790,Is a different type of screw preferred for screwing into softwood vs hardwood?,"I'm good at accidentally splitting wood. I'm also flummoxed by the variety of screws available for wood working projects. Not wanting to ""screw up"" some nice hardwood:  Is a different type of screw preferred for screwing into softwood vs hardwood?  Does pitch or thread to shank ratio matter? "
791,How to sharpen a planer knife the right way?,"I've been trying to sharpen plane blades and jointer knives for a long time now but never was able to get a really sharp edge. I see most people can achieve this, some can cut a paper by using the paper's weight against the blade, others can shave hair out of their hands with the blade.   I really follow a simple process in sharpening, I have a stone with coarse/fine sides and I have a honing guide. I've been using this one from veritas for the jointer knive so the blade edge is touching the stone at the right angle. I do the coarse side first to remove any dents in the blade and them move to the fine side. I've tried doing this for:   The length of the blade And a microbevel   Both didn't give me the required result, in one instance the blade was so blunt that it showed burn marks while planing the surface.  This is giving me a lot of grief as I have the same problem with sharpening hand plane blades, what I want to know is:   What am I doing wrong? Is a stone with coarse/fine surfaces enough for what I am doing? How much sharpness is good enough? What do you do for testing the sharpness of your blade?  "
792,Is working with MDF going to kill me?,"MDF is pretty cool stuff. Been around for a fair amount of time now. Stuff is used lots now and days. Dimensionally stable and cost effective for a great deal of projects. Problem is that MDF is made with formaldehyde right? and that the chemical has been classified as a known carcinogen.   Looking up an article on MDF safety I ran into The deadly secret of DIY's dream material which contains such information like:\     At this month's TUC conference Roy Lockett, deputy general secretary of Bectu, said: 'MDF is the asbestos of the Nineties. It is carcinogenic. It causes lesions. It damages the eyes, the skin, the lungs and the heart. It is vile and pernicious.'   Then I watch this video where buddy is making a couple of hundred mdf boxes. There was a (exaggeration alert) tonne of MDF boxes made. You see him cutting all these boxes and I have to wonder what that is going to be doing to his health.     Is working MDF bad for your health? Why is it so widely used if there are health concerns? Should I avoid its use? "
793,Trying to identify this antique woodworking tool,I am trying to find out what this vintage woodworkng tool is called. It holds a small file. It seems to be cast iron. It does have screws to open &amp; change files. Any ideas? PAT. Jan. ? 1891  No makers marks.  
794,Removing Paint from Rough/Coarse Surfaced Beams,"We are about to move into a new house, that has some very nice coarse/rough beams on the interior (A lot of them). They have been painted though, and I'm looking for a method to remove the paint, and let the natural wood stand out instead. I'm looking for some inexpensive DIY methods that might I could do by myself. I read about using some of the following methods, but didn't find any information as to how it would work on a rough/coarse wood surface.   Methylene-chloride paint remover: Don't know how difficult that would be to remove the pain on the rough surface inside a house Dry ice blasting: I know it's very expensive to rent and do, but is it worth it? Sandblasting: Not too familiar with this method Any other inexpensive methods?   I have attached a not so great picture but hopefully that gives the idea of what the beam looks like.   "
795,Filling gaps/seams in a new cherry tabletop,"I've created a tabletop for a desk. It's made of 4/4 cherry boards of different lengths and widths that I've laminated together on the edges. This was then glued onto a plywood top.   I've never made a tabletop before, only had a few bar clamps, and ended up with some visible gaps and seams that I wants to fill. A couple are where boards meet edge to edge, while a couple others are where boards meet end to end.   The cherry just had a rough sanding so far and is still unfinished. I plan to coat it with a simple polyurethane.   Before I finish it, however, I want to fill those seams and gaps with something that will roughly match the wood and will accept the polyurethane.   Help? Do I use a mix of wood glue and cherry wood dust? Should I just fill with wood filler? What's the best way? Thanks!  "
796,How do I prevent stain from being removed during sanding?,"I am refinishing an old Remington 870 stock birch stock. I stained it with a dark cherry colored stain, and then began to apply Hope's 100% tung oil. I had read to wait at least a day before sanding and applying the next coat, though that seems to be a short period of time. However, when I sanded the stock, much of the stain I had applied was removed along with the tung oil (if I recall correctly, I was using 340 grit paper, and I had cut the first application of oil about 50% with mineral spirits).   I decided to restain the whole stock, and ended up staining it several times, letting it dry and wiping down with mineral spirits to remove the tackiness between each coat (I know that multiple coats are generally advised against, but the birch wasn't accepting the stain evenly and this helped me get a fairly even, nice stain). The stock is now fully dry (wiped the access stain off a day or two later with the help of mineral spirits, and then let dry for a week).   My question is: is there a way to properly apply tung oil to the stained wood without removing the stain during the sanding process? Do I simply need to wait longer for it to dry, not sand between the first couple of coats, use a finer grit sandpaper, or what?  Bonus question: This being my first woodworking project, my sanding left something to be desired. There are very minor sanding marks in the wood that I didn't notice before staining. They are mostly in the same direction of the grain of the wood, but a few of the swirls I didn't match perfectly. Is there anything I can do to fix this without removing the stain and starting over? It doesn't bother me very much, but I would feel unacceptably lazy if I didn't even make an effort to fix it.     "
797,Is all fine grit count sandpaper called wet/dry?,"I need to start getting into sharpening and honing so naturally one of the ways I could go would be to get some sandpaper in the 500 + grit count range. (That decision is based off a great video I saw from Paul Sellers that suggest this being a more economical method when starting out. )  At most home improvement stores, in the sections where I normally find sandpaper, the highest grit count I will come across is around 320. However, in automotive sections I find the higher grit counts I am looking for which is usually up to 2000! They are advertised as wet/dry paper.   So is all the very fine/high grit count paper actually wet/dry sandpaper? Is wet/dry just a gimmick of terms? If I find anything with the right grit count does it matter what kind of paper it is (assuming there are multiple kinds)?  "
798,Interior or Exterior stain for garage steps and shelves?,"So obviously with an outside patio you'd use exterior stain, and a bedroom desk you'd use interior stain. But I have no idea what type of stain to use for wood that's located in the garage?  The garage steps and shelves don't get much of any direct sunlight. They will definitely get dust/dirt/mud/grass/snow/water from time to time. The temperature of the garage varies from 15 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit.  Is it safe/OK to use exterior stain for these even though I doubt it's recommended? Is it OK to use interior stain for these, even though they will likely receive much more abuse than indoor furniture?   I do plan on using sealer/finish as well. Maybe I'll use the all in one kind of stain or do stain then sealer/finish. What do you suggest?    "
799,Can I apply water-based polyurethane over an oil based stain?,"I recently finished a dresser top in a very light gray oil based stain. Afterwards I applied a water based matte poly, because I didn't want any yellow tint to show on the light gray color (see this question).  Should I have used a different combination? So far so good, but am I likely to have problems with poly adhesion in the future because I mismatched the base types of the stain and poly? "
800,Spraying Shellac,"In the link in this article, the author mentions spraying shellac.  Is there any thing I should know before trying this out. Should I have a particular cut? Is there any tell tale signs I am using too much or too little air? I assume I need to clean the gun properly after use.  I am also not sure how I should mount the piece in my 'spray booth'. "
801,What criteria would want me to bevel my chisel in a certain way,"In my continuing attempts to learn all the things another question stemmed from watching a chisel sharpening video from Paul Sellers. When sharpening his new chisel (he explained that he does this to all his chisels) he removed the hard angled bevel and created a smooth convex bevel on his chisel. You can sort of see from the picture below.    I don't think I missed an explanation as to why he chose to put that bevel beyond personal preference. I understand that chisels and plane irons can have different degrees of hard bevels but I don't see that being compared to a convex bevel.   What are some practical reasons to put a convex bevel over maintaining the original hard angle that, in most cases, is already present? Or perhaps even making a concave bevel?  I feel this question could apply to plane irons as well.  "
802,Filling pores on a turned bowl while remaining foodsafe/organic?,"I recently received some really helpful answers to a previous question I had that exposed a big gap in my understanding of turning.  This answer mentions ""filling the pores"" of a walnut bowl as a solution (the only solution?) to the roughness that can be felt on the two end-grain sides of the bowl, even after sanding from 100 to 600 and finishing with 0000 steel wool.  I finish all my bowls in organic foodsafe beeswax and mineral oil, and for (perhaps stubborn) aesthetic reasons, I'd really like to avoid acrylic, poly, or other non-natural, non-foodsafe sealers.  Is this impossible? What are the best ways to make a fully smooth bowl while keeping it foodsafe and organic?  Thanks in advance for any tips you can provide! "
803,"How can I chamfer thick (1.5"") material?","I'd like to add a 22.5 degree chamfer to thick (1.5""+) material.  In the past I've done small chamfers on a router table with a chamfer bit.  Unfortunately I can't seem to find any chamfer bits that are big enough to cut 1.5"".  What's a good way to go about this.  I suppose it doesn't have to be exactly 22.5 degrees (for aesthetic purposes only), but I do want it repeatable and uniform (e.g. 20 degrees along the entire edge is fine).  Is there a way to use a shorter router bit that I'm not seeing?  Are there other tools for the job?  Should I start with a short chamfer and start planing the material down?  Edit:  The work piece is a 1.5"" tall cylinder with outer diameter of 10"" and inner diameter of 6"" (e.g. 2"" wall thickness).  I'd like to chamfer both the inside and outside edges.  Edit2:  I decided to ""cheat"".  A friend has a CNC router so I just ran it on that.  Took forever and had a few gcode errors, but came out well enough. "
804,How can I prevent outdoor cedar projects from losing their color?,"I love the look of natural cedar for outdoor projects. I built a small garden fence a few years ago, and made the mistake of leaving it unfinished. It's completely gray/silver now.  I'm planning on using a leftover cedar 4x4 to make a mailbox post in the near future. Is there a top coat I can apply that will help the wood maintain its natural color, or at least slow the graying process? Would something with a UV inhibitor be the best option, like a deck sealer? "
805,how can I make a cedar tree round into an outdoor table?,"How can I turn a large western cedar tree round into a low table?    I now have a large western cedar tree round.  It's from a 100-ish year old cedar tree that a neighbor cut down.  My wife would like me to turn this into a table for a covered outdoor area.  I don't need a fancy finish on this.  It is something that will sit outdoors in a covered area under a deck between two chairs in the shade next to our garden.  Think iced tea or cold beer.  It's big, hard to move and freshly cut.  Roughly 4' in diameter and around a foot thick.  I hesitate to call this woodworking, it is more in the direction of creating long lasting, workable for a lumber-jack, outdoor furniture.   How should I deal with this?  What are the steps and the products that I will need?  1) I don't want it to check.  Can I prevent this?  I don't need to keep the bark.  How long must it sit and dry before I finish the top?  2) I will clean it up and make the top surface flat and less rough.  I would like to preserve the cedar color, instead of letting it go gray on top.  What can I use for this?    3) It has some center rot which I currently imagine I can drill out, inserting a butterfly or other shaped plug made from another smaller log from the same tree.  What should I do with the center rot?  4) I could finish the top with something and think that I will want to seal the butterfly plug in the drilled out rot area with something.  What would work well here?  I am planning on using 7"" or 8"" diameter tree rounds to make stubby little legs for this.  I don't imagine that I will attach the legs.  They will each stand on their own and I will just use the tabletop's weight to keep them in place.  I might gouge out an indentation for each leg on the underside of the table.   Help me make my wife proud! "
806,How can I keep a cedar tree round from checking?,"I want to turn a large western cedar tree round into a low table for a covered outdoor area.    My tree round is from a 100-ish year old western cedar tree that a neighbor recently cut down.  It's big, hard to move and freshly cut, a month ago. It's roughly 4 feet in diameter and around a foot thick.  Is there some way that I can prevent it from checking/cracking.  Probably more realistically, are there ways that I can limit the cracking as it dries?   How long must it dry before I can put a finish on the top?    I don't need to keep the bark.    Related Question...    and Original Post too long... "

809,Trouble identifiying a gauge,"I have made another trip to my grandfather's shed and I found some more tools that I am very interested to have and use (like the adze I got!). I have been watching enough episodes of The Woodwright's Shop to know that I found a scratcher gauge.   Also with it was what appeared to be a pair of mortise gauges. One is pictured below. Good guess is that it is homemade so there's nothing to look up. I say ""appeared"" because all the mortise gauges I have seen both scratchers are on the same post with one of the ""nails"" being adjustable.    My problem with this is that: If you were to use this for a mortise you would have lines protruding the mortise area which could be seen.  Am I wrong about what this is? If I am right would you just use this like a regular mortise gauge? "
810,Dry Spar Varnish in Oven? Or other methods to speed drying,"We are making some wooden craft items as Christmas gifts.  They are small items (wood disks about 3/4"" thick and 4"" in diameter) that we've put two coats of spar varnish on.  The second coat of varnish (applied about 72 hours ago) seems to still be a bit soft / tacky (especially when two items are stacked / touching each other), and I'd like them to be fully cured and hard before shipping.  (I will wrap them individually in bubble wrap or similar when packed for shipping).  They have been drying in relatively low humidity (Colorado), inside at approximately 70F.  I'd like to speed the full-cure drying time of these items.  Is it safe to ""bake"" these in an oven? Our oven's lowest temperature is 170 F, which seems like it could be a bit hot.

812,Replacing top on particleboard desk with solid wood - allow for movement? Bad idea?,"I have a (now-discontinued) Jonas desk from Ikea that is several years old:   The desktop has gotten kind of worn and is a little small for my current needs, so I've been considering replacing it with a larger solid wood surface, like this Ikea countertop.  The desk is made of particleboard, and the original desktop is attached with cam lock fasteners. The cam screws go into the bottom of the desktop and engage with cam nuts in the drawer unit and side support. (General illustration of fasteners below, not indicative of how they're actually used in my desk.)    My first thought was that I could simply screw the cam screws into the solid wood countertop and attach it to the drawers and side support the same way as the original desktop. However, it then occurred to me that I might need to account for the solid wood expanding and contracting with changes in humidity (as I understand, this isn't really a concern with particleboard).  Am I right to be concerned with wood movement? If so, how can I best attach the countertop in a way that allows it to move without damage? I've read about various ways to fasten a tabletop, but some of them don't seem appropriate - for example, anything that would require me to cut a groove in the particleboard doesn't seem like a good idea. (In general, I'm not sure what kinds of fasteners I can expect to work reliably in particleboard.)  Or would this project be inadvisable for any other reason? Is it just not worth the trouble? "
813,Choices of contrasting wood for laminated table mat,"I am planning to make some (probably about 20) table mats by laminating some contrasting-colour strips.   The idea is to end up with a mat that looks like this:    The mat as a whole will be 289mm by 207mm by 9mm.   The dark strips are 5mm (as are the lighter wood strips in between).   My questions are:   Most importantly, what would be good woods for a table mat?   I don't want them to distort with age, or in reaction to things that normally happen to table mats (mild heat, wiping with damp cloths). Should I choose a contrasting wood for the dark strips, or just stain some strips?   I'd like to put a food-safe finish (not sure what I should use though) on all the mats, so I don't want a situation where the finish for the mat as a whole smears the dark stain over the lighter wood.   Edit: to clarify, I'm not planning on veneering.  The laminating I'm talking about doing is only in the left-to-right direction, to form the stripes. "
814,Panel Glue up Question,"I apologize for this elementary question, but I'm just getting started with woodworking. I'm working on my first panel glue up - made of 1x6 walnut. I'm wondering how ""square"" the edges of the planks have to be in order to get a seamless joint. I'm asking because I bought the wood rough sawn and bought a nice track saw to straight-line the edges. I don't have a jointer so I was hoping by buying a nice track saw that I could get joint ready edges off the saw. What I'm seeing is that saw must be riding ever so slightly crooked in the track because when I check the edges of the planks with a combination square, there is a very tiny sliver of light I can see on one side of the edge. It's really a sliver as I have to shine a light behind it to see it. The edge is consistent throughout the length of the board. Is this sort of thing normal and considered to be within the tolerance of a nice track saw? Will planks that are just ever so slightly out of square pull together with clamps?   Since I've never done this before, I'm not sure if I'm being too much of a perfectionist or if there really is cause for concern.  I think this might be happening because the weight of the saw wants to ""fall off the edge"" on the side of the saw making the cut. I might be able to resolve this by figuring out how to get a more stable base to work from as I was trying to use the garage floor which isn't the easiest to work from.   Thank you for any insight and/or suggestions.  "
815,"Choosing a saw for oak worktop, considering future usefulness","I've got a few cuts to make on some (large) offcuts of 40mm oak worktop. They are all straight, each cut up to 60cm long, from one side of the piece to the other. while this is technically within spec for my jigsaw, there's no way it's up to the job: the top of the cut may look straight but on a board this thick the back wanders all over the place, even if it take it very gently. It would also take forever even with a new blade.   So a shopping trip is in order. I'm a bit short on space, and don't want to spend a fortune on something that will be used rarely at best. I'm considering either:   a sabre (reciprocating) saw, which is compact and likely to be quite useful in the future (e.g. with a coarse tree-trimming blade). It might even replace the tired old jigsaw.  a circular saw. I haven't needed to use one in 20 years so it's likely to end up sitting in a box for quite some time. I regard it as mainly useful for wood-based  sheet material, and not the thin stuff. That doesn't leave much that I actually do.    In theory I could replace/upgrade the jigsaw, but it's fine on thin sheet material and in not convinced a new one would be so much better. I'm not adverse to hiring something, if there's a much better way that's bulky or expensive.   In any case I assume I'd set up a guide fence.   So: is one of my ideas much better for the job in question (straight cuts on 40mm oak)? Which is more generally useful in the future? Or have I missed an important consideration?  "
816,Building new router table by re purposing components of an off shelf router table-need advice,"I have this router table [website]I am building a router table top from a piece of high density MDF from Home Depot. The size is 2'x4'  I need help with positioning the fence, the router plate and the tracks, and selecting the right type of track   The router plate: should I put it in the middle (A) in the picture or in one of the other (B,C,D) positions. Please explain your recommedation Should I run the fence along the length of the table (as depicted) or should it be the other way?    3 For the traversal track in the figure (always parallel with the fence, what type of track should I use ? U slot or T track?     Update: the longitudinal rails could also support a fine tuning/high precision fence push mechanism based on something like in the 2nd picture below. I will update the diagram to show that     Here is what inspired me    Update 2: The size of the table is somehow dictated by the supporting frame which I grabbed from PrincessAuto here in Canada for $50. It can take up to 100lb. The table is foldable so the space does not become an issue and the table is designed (not shown here) to be able to remove the existing top and replace it with a different one with different functionality. I have no idea how big will the pieces of wood be for my probects but as I mentioned above I will mostly need this for cutting slots and making joits needed for all sort of custom storage units that I will need in different places in my house. The size will vary from full size shelves (floor to ceiling) to small box joints and picture frames. Slots for T tracks for various jigs that I might want to make will be another application.   Update3: OK here is a better concept and use of the table area    Update4: I have rotated the picture and positioned the saw as recommended in the second answer  Update5: here is the fence idea that I am inclined to implement. The pictures are not very clear  "
817,"Problem with ""Bubbles"" in Table Finish","I'm in the final stages of trying to build my first dining room table - a Christmas gift for my wife. All has gone pretty well until this last coat of Arm-R-Seal (Satin). It's the 5th coat, and now, it looks as if the finish has nimbs/bumbs/bubbles in it. Previous coats didn't have this problem and of course it shows up on the final coat.   Note, I used an old cotton T-Shirt folded up to wipe on the finish.   Here is what the finish looks like now.    My two main questions are...    What do I do to correct this problem? Is it salvageable?  What went wrong on this last coat?  "
818,How long does it take for the odor to go away after applying varnish?,"I recently refinished our dining room table using Minwax stain and urethane. My question is why hasn't this overpowering smell gone away? Its been two weeks now and I can't stand the smell yet. Its beautiful, the stain and varnish worked like magic, but the smell. How long should it take for the smell to go away? "
819,How do I strip Arm-R-Seal?,I'm looking for some good methods for removing Arm-R-Seal Satin from a dining table as I had some problems with bubbles in part of the finish. Not sure what else to do other than remove it and start again? Is sanding the best approach or do I need to use some sort of chemical stripper? 
820,How do I stop the table I built from wobbling/shaking side to side?,"I got a wood cut and bought adjustable table legs, secured the legs to the wood, but the table wobbles/shakes horribly side to side, and sometimes even the other way when i even only write something slowly on it.  The things i tried so far to fix it:   Leveling the legs.  Putting cork slices under the legs.  wrapping fishing line between the crossing legs. (not all around the all legs)   It only stops shaking a little bit if i lean the table to something standing still but i don't want to use it that way, also i don't want to fix the table to the wall.  If i am not wrong i need to add braces to the table, but i don't know how to do it. Should they be installed only between the legs, or also secured to the bottom of the table too?  The legs are not wooden also have no places to add anything onto it. How can i add these braces and where can i find braces with a desired length?  The way the legs secured to the table, and the added fishing line.      Table dimensions : 104 x 54 cm.    Thanks in advance. "
821,Does a route table sag if you do not leave the router attached to it?,"I am slowly putting together an absolute beginner workshop (too much to call it so) without trying to invest too much money since I am doing woodworking for fun and some practical needs around the house. The scope of my work will be some floor to ceiling custom shelves, picture frames, small boxes, smaller shelves, a shoe box and some other things that will not be big in size. Probably the shelves will be the only big thing that I will ever build. I am also planning to build a deck and a pergola but these are not really woodworking.  Having the above said I am considering building a router table and I have questions around choosing the right material for the table top.  My question is this: would a router table top sag if the router will not be permanently attached to it ? I am considering using high density MDF for the top.   I have seen builds where MDF was used and then laminate applied to it. While I might consider this I have doubts regarding my ability to obtain an absolutely plane surface after applying the laminate.   I would be OK to have to build another table top every two or three years (I do not expect my projects to take me longer than that)  One more question: if I go the laminate way, do I apply the laminate before or after I cut my slots for my t-tracks, the router insert opening and the miter slot ?

822,Why did my flush trim bit chew up my work piece?,"I tried to do something like the first picture in this article and it was a disaster.  I was working with 3/4"" maple and bit dug in, chewed it to pieces, and eventually broke the piece in half.  I have a fresh, sharp bit, a powerful router, and I was moving the right way past the bit.  What did I do wrong?  Should the router be on high speed or low?  What else affects my chance of success?  It looked something like this:   "
823,What is causing this poor refinishing result and how do I fix it?,"I followed the procedure of stripping, sanding, staining and then polyurethaning the top of two antique, about 75 years, dressers. The one came out beautifully. The other has questionable results.   There was an area of the one dresser that had what I believed was water damage. It is unknown if my conjecture is correct, but that would be the most logical answer. I got the old varnish off with citra strip. The area of the suspected water damage was discernable but not egregious. I then sanded the top to a silky smooth texture. Due to the age of the dresser I suspected that there was a veneer on the top so I used 150 then 220. Both sanding steps were on the easy does it scale. The tops were silky when done.   I stained both twice for 10 mins each time to get correct color. When I applied the Minwax Fast Drying Polyurethane Clear Satin to the one dresser it seemed to almost 'bead like water' in the area of the former stain. When dry, there was a textural difference in that area. I was hoping that it would self correct with the light sanding and the application of a second coat. It only got worse.   I am obviously going to remove the poly and try again. What could be causing this problem? Can it be prevented from happening again? Also, in between all the steps, I used tacky cloth to ensure that the tops were free of debris. "
824,What wood/finish would hold up to use in a video game controller?,"A while back, I went on a spree of replacing handles with wood in some tools/toys I had, since I quite liked the feel. In the past couple years, I've picked up competitive gaming, and would like the comfort of wood in my controller, if possible.   However, compared to my previous projects, this would be handled much more extensively, and would require much smaller parts for buttons/stick caps, so I don't trust my judgment on what a reasonable choice of wood and finish would be.   I've worked with redwood in the past, and it seems like it would hold up well for the grips both from past experience and from some articles I've found.   For the buttons and stick caps, I'm guessing that no wood I choose will be able to have the fine detail necessary while still maintaining the strength required, and that I'll need to instead make the structural portion out of metal or plastic, and add wood caps. Given that, at that point, fine detail is the main issue, I was thinking basswood.  I've never used a finish, since longevity was never really a concern. Having the feeling of wood is rather the point of the project, but from my research, that seems at odds with decent protection from wear/hand oils.   Do redwood and basswood seem like reasonable choices for this project?   Are there any finishes that wouldn't feel like varnish, but would also protect the wood from frequent handling? "
825,What is this type of sail boat hull construction?,"I am very slightly familiar withdifferent type of sail boat/yach hull construction. But this examples one on the pictures below are something that I do not quite understand.  First pic:  This I find puzzling. First it appears there are some bulkheads. Longitudinal ""stringers"" are fixed to them. I presume their only purpose is to define the hull shape, sort of like a spline. On this ""stringers"" the vertical frames are attached. This I presume will stay as structure of the boat. And i guess on top of this frames comes the planking. Andthen another assumption from me: inner bulkheads and ""stringers"" are removed so only frames and plankig remain? Am I correct or wrong. Actually I would like this thing explained to me.   William Fife 8m Defender:  This looks very similar but on closer inspection I think longitudinal stringer are actual pieces of final planking. But i might be wrong.  This might be the same boat with planking.   So, at least the first pic shows the type of construction I do not understand. What is it? "
826,Substituting Walnut for Hickory in a bow saw,"I'm planning on building a version of the Gramercy Tools bow saw. According to their research, Hickory is a good substitute for the European Beech wood classically used in such saws, since it is both flexible and tough.  On looking into the properties of various woods, I discovered that Walnut might be a superior substitute to Hickory - its stiffness and strength lies right between European Beech and Hickory, but its hardness is lower (and thus easier to work) and its density is significantly below both of them (making for a lighter saw).  Is there something I'm overlooking?   Is the lower Janka hardness of the Walnut going to pose a problem?   Or is that purely a cosmetic matter (being more prone to nicks and dings) that is outweighed by the other benefits I mentioned? "
827,What's the best approach to cutting dry walnut with a hand saw?,"so, it may seem impractical to cut really hard woods with hand tools, but i know it can be done with the right tools...i generally assume for really tough woods and cross-cuts it's best to use a bow saw. I'm cutting through some thick walnut vertically, and the bow saw has already gone half way through, but the blade is now damaged and it's proving a total hassel to try and knock out the pin that holds the blade in place, i've got it part of the way out with a hammer and knife but it doesn't appear like it was meant to take it out and replace (saw companies: why not just hold it in with a normal phillips head screw?!)  before i go out and buy anything else, i just wanted to ask you all, if you hypothetically wanted to cut through dry walnut with a hand saw, what would you do? the normal hand saw i have seems to work but it cuts so damn slow and i know it's gonna ruin the blades like the other one.  "
828,Painting the edges of a cutout (inner and outer edges),"Is there a special technique that anyone can recommend for painting inner and outer edges of a cutout (say, from a jigsaw or something).  I've thrown together an example in Tinkercad:    I'm planning on having 2 colors, the blue on top and orange along the text.  My actual design will be exposing inner and outer edges of text.  I've done this before with masking tape, spray paint, and a helluva lot of patience (and usually end up doing it about 4 times before I'm happy with it).  I feel like there's gotta be a better way, an ancient woodworking secret that I have yet to be taught, oh masters of wood.  Even if I went the tape / spray paint route, which would be a better part to do first?  The orange or the blue?  Does it matter?  Any tips?   Thanks :)  EDIT: in case it matters, this is about an 16"" long sign, about 8"" tall.  Several kinda sharp corners on the lettering.  Wood is a 3/4"" board (I think alder?).  EDIT: One (probably important) detail I forgot to mention is the edge will be routed.  The bevel will be blue. "
829,Using raw beeswax for cutting board finish,I am finishing up an end-grain butcher block cutting board (my first attempt) for my parents Christmas gift. Thus far I've finished it with mineral oil that I've been soaking into the pores. My last coat didn't soak in as much so I wiped away the excess and it looks good.   I've also heard tell of people finishing it off with a beeswax finish. I have a friend that is a bee keeper who took some time to render me some fresh beeswax. I'm not sure what's the best way to use this as part of my finishing process. That's my question.   My best thought is to simply cut off a small chunk and warm it in my hands till it's pliable. Then simply rub it all over the board. Finish it off by buffing it with a clean cloth. Any other good ideas? Is this a good approach?   The cutting board so far:   The raw beeswax:   
830,Worried about movement in a floating shelf style mantel shelf,"I'd like to replace our mantel shelf over the holidays. The plan is to have something that looks like a large beam but is constructed like a floating shelf (box). Haven't picked the exact variety yet, but right now I think it will be cherry but I have some questions about wood movement.    If I simply rip 3 sides and 45 degrees and make a box with caps on the end, am I asking for trouble as the wood expands? If I were to make the box out of plywood and then glue thinner (say 1/4 inch) cherry to the plywood box, is that less likely to move?   Here's an example of the style of box  "
831,Embedding/Inlaying a gem into wood,I am making a couple of purpleheart earrings. I want to embed an amethyst gem into each one. I have a couple of concerns though. The wood is so dark that I feel it will make the gem seem dark once it's embedded. How can I address this?  Should I cut a hole all the way through the wood to let light into the gem? And how should I secure the gem? I'm thinking epoxy right now but depending on if I need to drill a hole all the way through I'm not sure if I should fill in the hole on the backside completely with epoxy or leave it open.   This is what I have so far. The one on the right shows what I would like the finished product to look like.  
832,Table Saw Bevel Maths?,"I'm looking to make Triangular &amp; Hexagonal shelves, but I'm getting confused by some of the maths involved for the bevels. To make a hexagon I need a 120 degree angle, but I need 2 pieces to make that angle, so I do: 120/2 = 60 degrees each.    So I would think that I can set my bevel gauge to 60 degrees on my table saw (Hypothetically, I'm aware that my bevel doesn't go that far and that I can use a jig to hold the workpeice vertically to do the complement of 30 degrees, effectively making it 60 degrees)  I'm having similar issues for the equilateral triangle shelves. I've seen people cut their straight stock at a 30 degree bevel and wind up with angles that don't look right, such as:    Here, you see that the shelf is not assembled at the edges, and is instead on the face. This doesn't look right to me, and seems to imply that the person didn't know how to cut the angles properly. I've seen proper bevels cut and they look really nice, even at non 90 degree bevels, such as this one from Foureyes:    How can I resolve these issues? What bevel should I cut my straight stock on, so that I can make these shapes?  EDIT 0: In general, if I want to cut a 30 degree angle in Cartesian space, do I set my bevel gauge to 30 degrees?  EDIT 1: Stranger yet, I've seen the hexagons be cut at a 30 degree bevel by this video ([website]"

Here's a fly around of the bench if that helps [website]Sorry if this is a stupid question. I tried the sagulator, but it didn't have pressure treated as an option.  UPDATE  So I realized this design had two fatal flaws regardless of the weight on the seat.   There is no real horizontal shear support for the base Having a long flat base as this does, will not sit well on an unlevel surface like my yard.   Here is what I ended up with. This thing could support an elephant!!  "
834,Fixing small knot hole in pine -- compatible with oil finish,"I wish to patch/fill a knot hole in a pine panel at a jointed edge. The hole is only a few mm deep. I don't think doing a sawdust + epoxy/shellac/glue filler will sit well with an oil finish, and I've managed to do without it this far -- so I'm considering trying a special patch.  What is the best way to make a dutch patch containing a knot (or even better, a semi-circular knot!), without the branch loosening out of the patch as I cut it?    It's knotty pine, so having just that one filled might look odd, hence why I'd prefer a ""knotted"" patch over a sawdust fill:    *Edit -- Fixed it. Reporting on results *  Following advice in the answers and comments, I've accepted to use non-wood products into the table. I figured that in the worst case, I could still do the patch. But I am quite satisfied with the results.  Materials:   A small tube of ""Dark Umber"" artist oil paint bought at local craft store. A ""syringe"" of clear 5-minute epoxy bought at the local hardware store   Steps:   In clean plastic container add, in one corner, a dab of (yet unmixed) epoxy, and in another, a smaller dab of paint. Using a toothpick, stir gradually more and more of the pigment until desired color is obtained. Create a gradient (mess) of colors to pick from. (full res)   Mix in fine sawdust from a scraping session, which yields a more matte and opaque result. Without sawdust, the cured epoxy is very vitrous and transparent. You can also obtain opaque epoxy without sawdust by using more pigment. Use the toothpick as an applicator on the work piece. Disturb as little as possible what is already filled when adding more. I accidentally created mini air bubbles when trying to ""pack"" more in. (full res)   Waited 16h (the recommended full-cure time on the product), and removed most of the cured excess with a sharp chisel. Then card-scraped the rest. I'm pleased with the results. (full res)    Note: The addition of oil-based pigment to an epoxy resin reduces the final hardness of the cured epoxy. This might be important to consider when using epoxy as an adhesive bond between two objects -- but it doesn't matter as much when used as a filler. In fact, the cured epoxy obtained is much harder than the surrounding wood -- can't sink or scratch it with fingernails.

835,Building a kitchen table to hold a fishtank,"I have a fishtank with the following dimensions:  Length: 4 ft Depth: 1 ft Height: 1.5ft Total volume: 170l   The tank is fairly hefty glass, and has a flat base (Which means the weight will be evenly distributed across the base, rather than just around the edges).  I want to build a work surface in my kitchen that will hold the fish tank on top (and maybe also have space in front of it to eat breakfast). It will need to be fairly tall to accommodate this. The dimensions I was thinking are:  Length: about the same as the tank, with a slight overlap - i.e. 4ft Height: 3ft Depth: 1.5ft (so tank + 6 inches) or perhaps a little more   I want to be able to fit my bins under the table, and sit at it - hence the height. This height also matches that of the other worktops in my kitchen, so it works well.  I want this to be free-standing - i.e. not attached to the wall. There's a radiator behind it (not ideal for the tank really, but that's the only spare space we have).  Now, I have watched this video: [website]The weight of the tank + water is over 200kg. The video suggests x4 for a live load, so I'm coming up to 1000kg of load all-in. How should I allow for that in my design? I don't want the horizontal supports on the bottom of the front edge, as we need potentially to be able to sit with our legs under it. The other three edges can have them though. Obviously I won't clad the front edge either What kind of wood / thickness of wood would be appropriate for the legs / supports?   Thank you for any and all advice you can give me for this project. "

837,"After stripping paint and applying wood stain, item is looking very blotchy... now what?","I am in the process of restoring an item of furniture that had been painted black, back to a wood finish.  I started off by stripping off the paint with Citri-strip and sanding  it until it felt smooth. At this point parts of the wood had a pale greenish hue and others did not, but I proceeded, just hoping it would be covered by the stain.  I started with Minwax Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner and followed it with a basic Minwax stain (yellow can). After the first coat I could tell it really wasn't absorbing evenly-- some areas were very, VERY dark while others looked more like what I'd expect after a first coat of stain. Apparently fairly dependent on how the wood grain had been cut on each piece. I could tell that a second coat would likely only make it worse.   I don't know what kind of wood this item is made out of but it is rather soft, and I don't know exactly what kind of paint had been on it either-- some kind of fairly hard enamel. It originally had a pecan-toned wood finish but was painted at some point in the 1970s.  My question is what should I do now to get a second chance at an even finish? My first reaction was to start sanding it down again to try to sand through the stain but I can tell it will take a lot of sanding to get through it. Should I just keep on sanding? Could I try chemically stripping it again? Once I get it back down to bare wood, what should I seal it with before staining so that this doesn't happen again? The Minwax pre-stain seems to have been inadequate for this wood.  Also, any idea as to why parts of the wood might have looked greenish? My best guess was that it was a byproduct of the paint, but I don't know. "

840,Is there another name for these heavy duty cam-style clamps?,"I have a Porter Cable dovetail jig that has clamps for holding the boards. (Other brands have similar clamps.) These have wide bars supported only at the ends, so there is room for a wide board to pass through. The clamp is actuated by a lever, with cams on a tube that spans the clamping bar.  The description refers to them as ""Heavy Duty Cam-Style Clamps"".    I am designing a CNC router, and would like to have a similar clamp on the end of the table holding the board upright within cutting reach. I have not been able to find kits or parts to replicate this type of clamp. Searching for ""Cam Style Clamps"" or variations finds many clamps of other types that are not suitable.  Is there a specific name for this type of clamp that is distinct from other cam-actuated clamps?

As I will likely have this bench for the rest of my life, I do not mind spending a little more on the wood. So, after looking at the current availability and pricing at my local lumber yard, I narrowed my choices down to the following, ordered by my preference:   Black Cherry Red Oak American Ash Douglas Fir Southern Yellow Pine   I chose these as they are available and are also not too hard so I can minimize damage to any piece I'm working on if it drops onto the top. The hardest in the list is the ash, just barely over the red oak. The softest being the fir, with the yellow pine a tad harder. The cherry is in the sweet spot, both in aesthetics and hardness.   Originally, I had planned to make the whole thing out of yellow pine, as it is the cheapest. However, my local lumber yard currently has good prices on 8/4 S2S cherry, so my preference is to build the bulk of the top out of cherry and use ash for the areas where the dog holes and vises will be, plus maybe an ash strip down the middle. I don't want the bench to be too heavy so I am considering making the top 3 1/2 - 4"" thick.  I'm curious to hear any comments or concerns this design. Specifically, would there be any issues gluing cherry and ash together? Would it be more stable over time if the laminate top was made from a single species? Also, is 3 1/2"" thick enough for dog holes and holdfasts? "
842,"A beginner's question about sanding, stain, and polyurethane for a SMOOTH finish","I'm doing to hobby pieces using 3/4"" pine ply.  On my faces, I've sanded with 80, then 120, then finish with 220 using random orbit sander.  To the touch, it's very very smooth. I'll give it a good wipe down to get rid of all the dust.  I'm staining with some red mahogany using a stain rag. I let it sit about 12 hours. It still feels pretty smooth.  I then will add, one coat at a time, oil based polyurethane.   When that dries, its gritty ... even after the 3-4 coat.  I'm looking for a REALLY smooth and glossy finish.   How do I achieve this? I thought one wasn't supposed to sand after a poly coat. Do I need to sand in between poly coats?  OR ... should I be using a different finish? I'd like it to be sealed so if a drink or something is placed on it, the wood will be safe.  Any help is appreciated! "
843,Lumber crayon versus crayola...what's the difference?,"I recently heard of lumber crayons that are used for marking pieces on boards, particularly rough sawn boards. I'm about to embark on a new project using rough lumber and wanted to gauge how many boards I need. The best way I can think of is to draw it out with a lumber crayon.  But, I'm a cheapo fella, and lazy to boot. I don't feel like going to the local Lowes Depot to buy a crayon when I have tens of thousands hiding in couch cushions, junk drawers, kids' dressers, and some even in the pipes of my house.   So, what's the difference? Can't I just use a crayola crayon? "

846,Is there danger of combustion using raw flax / linseed oil for platform bed?,"I have built a platform bed using 90%+ cedar (all but some quarter round and the legs).   My plan was to use raw, food grade flax / linseed oil to finish it. I like the idea of the raw oil not having chemicals added. Plus, Iâve used this on cedar shelves and love the depth of color it brings to the wood. Since this is an indoor piece and made in cedar, it doesnât seem to me that there is a need to apply multiple coats to protect it (correct me if Iâm wrong on this), so Iâm not too worried about drying time - I just want to get one good coat on.   My primary concern is the fact that it takes longer (days to weeks?) to oxidize than boiled linseed oil. If I put the bed on the frame before it fully oxidizes/cures, is there a risk of combustion?   Iâm not putting the oil on the slats that the bed sits on, but it would be on the inside of the top layer of trim (about about 3/4â deep). This would be covered by the side of the bed. Thoughts?? "
847,How to remove staining caused by a clamp,"I was putting sapele inlay into maple.  The inlay was proud by about an 1/8th inch so I only used packing on the underside of the clamp, figuring that any indentations on the top side would be planed out.    It was mostly ok except that I had to use a couple of G clamps instead of my plastic faced F clamps in a couple of spots (ran out of clamps - does anybody ever have enough?).  The clamps were proud of the maple but there appears to have been some sort of reaction with glue squeeze-out that has caused a sort of 'ebonzing' stain from the face of the clamp, through the glue puddle and into the wood.  I hang my head in shame - I should have packed top and bottom and I promise I will NEVER take that short-cut again.  I have sanded most of the staining out but in a couple of patches it seems to go on forever and I am getting worried about planing or sanding deeper (bearing in mind that I don't have a planer, being a hobbyist, so must do it by hand and the maple has some pretty, but gnarly, grain that tears out as soon as you look at it).    So, here's the question: is there any trick to gently de-ebonize these patches or will I have to just keep planing my otherwise finished table top? "
848,Any diy glue or epoxy alternative strong enough to hold bamboo bicycle frame joints?,"I want to make bamboo bike like Craig Calfee and so many others have made, but if possible, I would rather not use epoxy, which is not biodegradable.  A bamboo bike has a frame made of bamboo, held together at joints by hemp-epoxy (or fiberglass-epoxy / carbon fiber-epoxy) composite lay up by hand. Is there any natural/diy alternative to epoxy which can be used with hemp fibers in a similar fashion to hold the joints strongly?  I want to use a truly biodegradable polymer, even if synthetic. Even better if it can be diy homemade concoction. What did woodworkers use other than hide glue before PVA and Epoxy became so prevalent?  I'm looking for a plant based or synthetic non-animal sourced biodegradable polymer. Isn't there something one can make from plant proteins similar to hide glue? "
849,Create a recess that nearly traverses the wood,"I would like to start with a box-shaped piece of hardwood and make a (probably cylindrical) recess in it that nearly traverses the wood, leaving only a very, very thin, uniform layer of wood on the far side.  Like this:    The thickness of the thinnest part should be similar to veneers.    Is this achievable with a forstner bit?  If so what type?  Any special setup?  An alternative: leaving a thicker floor in the recess then planing from the opposite side.  Aside: the goal is, roughly, to make an electrical switchplate cover that has an area where the wood is thin enough to be translucent, such that LEDs could shine through, similar to the following (but maybe with only a single digit of &lt;1in height).  Thanks   "
850,Hand plane gouging wood even with fine adjustments,"I bought a handplane from an antique store about two years ago and have struggled, off and on, to get it to work. I have flattened the sole, sharpened the blade (enough to pass the ""shave the arm"" test), derusted things, and filed the edges/corners off. The thing looks like a real beauty, but it just won't make a cut without gouging the wood. I start planing and it doesn't cut, so I make a tiny adjustment. Still no cut, so I bring the blade forward just a hair. Still not cut....    This process continues until I make a miniscule cut, then KAZAMO! The thing slams right into the wood and stops the hand plane in its tracks.   Has anybody had this experience? Any ideas how to fix it?  The only thing I can think of is that there's something wrong with the frog. I did notice that, without the lever cap, the iron rocks forward and back (forward = toward the sole, back = toward the handle). But once I cinch the lever cap, the wobble's gone.     So what's the deal?  Edit It was at this point in my post, I decided to try something and that fixed the problem. I thought about leaving my solution to myself, but figured someone else might have the same issue. See below.  "
851,advice for glue-and-screw butt joint,"I am an amateur, building a set of kidâs beds.  I have prepared side rails, headboard and footboard; I am ready to attach everything.  I intend simple end-to-face butt joints with glue and screws.  I am not sure 1. what size screws to use and 2. whether to screw or glue first.  All the wood is 2cm Ã 4cm pine.  The primary tools I have are a borrowed miter saw, clamps, and a drill.  I drilled holes in the headboard already.  I also (using a regular 10mm bit) cut out countersink for the screw head because in my tests it was hard to get the large heads anywhere near flush and I donât want to overtension the screws going into the endgrain.  If I can cover the screws afterwards, all the better.  Screw size  My screw optionsâall in mmâare 5Ã60, 5Ã70, 6Ã60, and 6Ã80.  (These are outer diameters, for 5mm screws I would drill a 4mm pilot hole and for 6mm a 5mm pilot.)  I like the idea of beefier, longer screws for strength, but in my tests I found drilling and driving them a bit more challenging.  As shown in the close-up I plan to put two at each joint, and the bed doesnât need to support more than about 100kg.  Are the 5Ã60 screws sufficient?  Screw first or glue first?  Iâd like to screw first because I think preparing the pilot holes would be much easier (especially if I use the larger screws) and I could use the screws to hold the pieces together when the glue dries.  As pictured, I have everything clamped into place (no glue yet), so it seems like I could start the pilot holes, disassemble, finish the pilot holes, apply the glue, put the screws in, clamp everything, and tighten the screws.  On the other hand, my experience from a few tests is that even when starting a pilot hole with clamped pieces, itâs hard to get the joint lined up nicely, so  my feeling is I may be better off gluing first and only later drilling the pilot holes and putting in the screws.  The disadvantages of that approach are that I canât use the screws to apply extra pressure while the glue sets and that I lose 2cm of pilot hole depth due to the thickness of the headboard.  (my 4mm bit is only 72mm long)  Any additional advice would be appreciated, but given the constraints of time and location, I am not in a position to use any more advanced tools or materials.  (I could easily use small plastic or metal corner brackets if that were preferable, although my planned approach seems more elegant to me.)     "
852,"If I make a stool from this composite (?) wood, will it end in tears?","I want to try making a stool based on this video series by Paul Sellers. Unlike Paul, I will use some power tools (power drill, oscillating tool for sanding/cutting, maybe rotary tool for sanding). Also I don't have a plane or spokeshave. I'm planning to use saw, chisel and a lot of sanding to smooth out the wood instead of planing/shaving.  I also don't have such nice wood on hand. I have a scrap piece which appears to be made from boards glued on a plywood, with some veneer as well (the veneer won't make it into the project). As you can see there are cracks and it's not in the best shape, but this stool will likely see abuse anyway, so I don't care if it looks rough. My question is, will the stool break during use in a dangerous way if I use this wood?         I tried suspending the wood with the plywood side down, and two blocks below the short edges, then climbing on top of it and pumping my legs. I'm 170 lbs and a decently good pumper. The wood buckled, perhaps by about 0.25-0.5"", but didn't break or make sounds.  The wood is 1.148"" thick, and 16"" x 22"". I can only guess at its original purpose, I found it by the dumpster. "

854,Which weight bearing knockdown joints,"I'm building a Murphy bed with 18mm plywood.  I would like to use knock-down joints for the sides of the base (outer-frame).

857,How to make dowelling jigs without metal bushings?,"I'm having a hard time making dowel holes on the butts of my pieces. I have a Milescraft Jointmate, which honestly isn't helping me a lot. The pegs which center the holes are too distant to fit into the butt of my lumber (2x5cm).  So I will probably buy a decent self-centering jig from China, but shipping usually takes long and in the meantime I need a shop made a jig to get me through in the meantime.  Problem is, I can't find metal bushings around here in Brazil. How can I make a decent jig without these? Would it be helpful to be make the holes as long as possible in the jig, or maybe replace the bushing with threaded inserts? "
858,How do I stop cracking noises from my pergola?,"I have built a pergola on my own about 1.5 years ago and it doesn't stop making those cracking wood noises (like the wood is cracking).  First of all I know I have built the pergola pretty good because I have followed the instruction of a friend who owns a wood business, and the pergola also ""passed the test"" of a very bad weather with very strong wind and rain this winter. I examined the pergola and I couldn't see any cracks or broken wood anywhere.  There are 2 kind of noises that I hear, I assume that 1 of the noises comes from the material that lays on top of the wooden pergola, while the other noise comes from the wood itself.  The noises comes mostly when there is a change in the weather, the noises start when the sun comes out and last for about few minutes, they start again when the sun goes away, and so on every day.  At first I assumed its because the wood is new, and I know wood tend to expand and shrink depending the weather, moist and such, but I thought that after a year it would stop, but it doesn't, the noises sounds the same.  I figured the noises come from the small wood bars that lay on top of the ""main"" frame and not from the frame itself, those wood bars are there just so there would be less sun inside and not for holding the structure together, when we put them on, they were not straight enough, so we had to manually put them in the right place with force to be straight, and I assume because of this I hear the crack sounds because they are trying to bend back to their first form.   Should I be worried? How can I check if I should be worried or not? While I can't see any big cracks in the wood I know that in most cases it doesn't matter and the wood can break without notice anyway. How can I stop it? Is there anything I can do to stop those noises? It happens on a daily basis and it is something that really starts to bother me.   Here are some images:   "
859,Evenly deepen a rounded hinge mortise,"I have a door that is rubbing at the bottom corner away from the hinge. The gap between the door and the frame on the hinge edge is wider at the top of the door.  I think the culprit is the middle hinge  which has its mortises cut slightly too shallow on both the frame and the door. I need to deepen them by about 1/50th of an inch on both sides.  The mortise has rounded corners, so a chisel is not a solution.  I have heard of people using forstner bits rout out hinge mortises, but it seems like a hack to me. I need to remove an even, thin layer of wood and I think using a Forstner bit would just be too ham handed and end up cutting too deep.  On the other hand, I will not be able to manipulate a full size plunge router on the frame.  What is the solution here? How can I evenly remove 1/50th of inch of wood from the two mortises? "

861,What is the minimum length I can thickness plane?,"The thickness planers I've seen have a cutter head between two rollers. The rollers grab the stock and feed it past the cutter head, counteracting the force applied by the blades.

862,How much grit do I need?,"At my woodshop, it's typically suggested that I sand up to 220 grit or 320 grit. I'm always amazed at how smooth my surface feels after a good 320-grit sanding.  However, when looking online I sometimes see advice to sand up to 600 grit. 600! That must be like glass!  I understand it's a matter of taste vs effort, but at some point there must be too little improvement to take another pass with a higher grit.  How do I know what this point is? Does it depend on the finish that I'm going to apply? "
863,What is the best way to enlarge a hole with my cordless drill?,"Whenever I try to make a hole slightly larger with my cordless drill, the drill bit catches and wanders, and doesn't stay centered. Normally I use twist bits, but I'm pretty sure I would have the same problem with most (or all?) other types of bits (e.g., brad point, spade, hole saw, Forstner). I know I could fill and redrill the hole, but that would be a pain, I'd have to wait for the filler to dry or cure, and I'd have to re-mark the center.  How can I quickly and easily enlarge a drilled hole without moving the hole or having to resort to some other tool like a drill press (which often wouldn't be practical) or a router jig (as mentioned in Enlarging a stepped through hole -- which would not work for small holes)?

869,Best setup to make dovetails,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to make clean dovetails joints using a router (maybe?).  I've tried by hand, results were not so good.  I got excited a while back and bought one of those porter cable router jigs.  It kind of worked but chipped out great chunks of the dove tail when I tried to use it.  That ended up a mess for me.  Now I was tempted by the incra router table and fence system which seems accurate at least.  Someone showed me something called the woodrat which looked interesting at first but started to look a little hokey as the demo video went on.  I was all excited to get an incra table but then I thought, is this just going to chip everywhere like the jig?  So I'm not sure the best route to go.  I'm a moderately experienced hobbyist, and I don't have a router table yet.  About the most complicated thing I've built is a crib with mortise and tenon joints.  I want to be able to make dovetails to make drawers and boxes. "
870,Is vertical storage of sheet goods causing my boards to warp?,"I have a consistent problem with warped sheet goods, particularly plywood and MDF. They always seem flat when I buy them, but by the time I use them they are always curved or twisted. It's a source of constant frustration. Even 3/4"" stuff gets a slight curve.  The way I've always stored everything is simply to lean piles of it against a wall. I don't have a lot of space.  After a recent comments discussion it dawned on me that this might be the problem:     Totally off topic, but how did the MDF warp in the first place? I have this problem where none of my MDF stays straight, and it frustrates me because all I hear about is how stable MDF is. â Jason C       The piece was stored vertically and had leaned a bit in the storage rack causing a slight twist. â Ashlar   My question is: Could this be my problem? Can storing these sheets vertically be causing all the warping?  If so, is there a way to store sheet goods vertically without damaging them? I don't have the space to stack them horizontally. "
871,Cheap table saw fence techniques,For a set of bookshelfs I decided to slice up a 4*8 sheet of cabinet grade plywood.  First I broke down what would form the sides I intended the shelves to be 6 inches deep for DVDs and 45 inches tall.  Using a 48x27 inch sheet cut out of the larger board I routed out the dados and rabbets while a single sheet so I was sure every thing would line up.  I set my table saw to 6 inches and started cutting me sides blissfully confident that my rip fence would let me make consistent sides and shelves.  what I got was a set of oddly bowed and tapered boards.  I think what happened is I was applying too much side pressure against the fence causing the cheap fence on my contractors saw to flex out on the rear of the saw.   I know my fence is normally straight and I also know I can push the back about 1/2 an inch  What can I do to mitigate this? Can I clamp the rear of the fence safely?  
872,What features and accessories should I look for in purchasing a used lathe,"My shop is mostly complete, but one gap is a wood lathe.  I have lived without one, but I could use some custom turnings from time to time and have avoided turning bowls etc. although I would like to add that skill to my arsenal.  I am a a retired hobbyist so high production capabilities and heavy use will not be needed, but I want to make sure that the lathe can do all the basics.  So what features are best and what tools and other accessories are most useful? Also, I am looking at used equipment so other than the motor, what key components should I scrutinize for problems? "
873,Enlarging a Hole made by a Hole Saw,"I drilled several holes in my desk to put some grommets using a 7/8"" hole saw bit.  Unfortunately, I realized afterwards that the hole was supposed to be 1"" to fit my grommets.  Then, despite knowing better, I used my 1"" hole saw bit in an attempt to make the holes the correct size.  Although I was able to make the hole larger, the new hole did not come out clean at all.  The obvious solution to this would be to clamp a piece of plywood behind the hole to use as a pilot.  However, the position of the holes make this solution pretty unfeasible - they are in the back of the shelf of a large hutch - i would need to get a very long piece of wood with some huge clamps in order to make that solution work (unless I am missing something):    What is the best way of fixing this?  I could get the next larger size of grommet (1.5"") and make the hole larger, but which bit would be the best for this task?  I have never used a Forstner bit - but it looks like it might be promising.  Thoughts? "
874,What is the difference between wiping polyurethane and wiping varnish?,"I make my own wiping polyurethane by thinning regular oil-based poly from home improvement stores with mineral spirits. According to Bob Flexner, the only difference between this and polyurethane-based wiping varnish is that the varnish also contains linseed oil, tung oil, etc.  Other than the color imparted by the oil, is there any difference between the two finishes? Can I just apply BLO to the wood and cover it with polyurethane? "
875,Supporting a level box on an uneven surface,"I am building some 6' x 2' x 1.5' (depth) cedar planter boxes for specific locations on concrete outdoors. The boxes need to sit as close to the ground as possible, a few inches max.  I am building three of them.  The concrete is neither level nor flat (eyeballing it I would say it's up to a 2-3"" height difference in some places), and throwing down a level concrete pad is not an option.  The challenge is that the boxes will probably each be holding about 1500-1800 lbs of soil. Additionally, they will have little kids climbing all over them, so it's important that they do not wobble and that any supports underneath do not collapse.  The other challenge is they sit against a wall. So I will only have direct access to one side once they are fully built.  Currently the basis for the design is pretty simple. I plan to build a pretty standard floor frame with 2x3 or 2x4 joists every 18""-ish, with the box built on top of it.  But I'm not sure how to build supports to level it. The shape of the ground is very complex and doesn't lend itself well to simple measurements and cuts. Also I don't want to paint myself into a corner and make it impossible to build, I need to construct it in such a way that I don't have to tear the whole thing apart if I don't get it level on the first try.  The boxes don't have to move once they are placed. They will be there until they rot.  How can I do this? How can I build a stable, level support for 1500+ lbs on an uneven concrete surface?  I am thinking about using those adjustable height feet with threaded rod, perhaps 8 of them around the perimeter of the base frame. Then I can level them before placing the box on top when I still have access to all the corners. But I don't have experience with these, and I'm concerned that they may wobble and collapse with sideways force.  I had also thought about cutting 2x4s to the contour of the ground and sitting everything on those. But I don't know how to transfer the ground contours to a cut pattern (Intel has those cool cheap 3D cameras out and I honestly considered grabbing one, but I don't have enough time to wait for one to arrive then develop software to generate contours), and when I run through this idea in my head, I see all sorts of opportunity for frustration. "
876,What joining methods would be best for the legs and other areas of a height adjustable desk?,"I am working on building my first piece of furniture. I decided to go a bit big and went with a height adjustable desk. I have the linear actuators and the electronics figured out. Today I purchased maple for the inner and outer legs.  What I am trying to figure out is what joining method/implement would work best in constructing these legs. In the linked design (above) for the desk they use butt joints and they use screws to construct the legs. But I was wondering if it would be better if I used wood glue.  To fit the actuators, I am using 1x4's for the inner legs and 1x4's plus 1x6's for the outer legs. I want them to be strong and sturdy.  The guy at Home Depot suggested I use deck screws and counter-sink them. If I go with screws, will the deck screws work just fine or should I use a different type? "
877,"When working with maple, do I need to seal the wood before assembling the furniture?","I am working on building the legs to an adjustable height desk for my home office. And I have purchased Maple wood for this part of the project.  Recently I was discussing this with a coworker and he suggested that the wood needed to be treated with tung oil, even before I assemble the legs, in order to protect it from expanding and warping over time. Preventing these things is especially important as I am trying to create a tight fit between the upper leg shaft and the lower leg.  So, do I need to pre-seal the maple wood somehow before I even assemble it? If so, then what is the best method to do this?  Also, on the outer part of the inner leg (see project link below) it was suggested by the same person that I put a wax or waxy layer on the shaft to ensure smooth leg operation. Would you agree? And if so then what would you recommend for this?  Here is the project I am working on (though I plan on making it look nicer and adding shelving):   (source) "
878,Can I cut homemade plywood on a bandsaw?,"Hey guys so this might be a stupid question but I am just a beginner, but can I cut wood veneer on a band saw.  I glued 5 sheets of wood veneer together to make it thicker and stronger, but it alternates in wood grain direction and in veneer type. I used paperback veneer and 2 ply veneer together. I used a vacuum compressor to keep them flat while they dried. Now I need to cut them into smaller pieces, I'm fairly sure it would be fine to use a band saw, right?  Also I've made 3 large pieces of veneers but one of them came out a bit warped for some reason, is there a way to flatten it even after it's been glued up and thick? "

880,Is glue the best permanent join?,"My understanding of modern wood glue is that, if the proper glue is used and wood surfaces are properly prepared, it will form a bond stronger than the wood itself.  Is this true? If not what are the exceptions to that statement?  If so does that mean that complicated and/or elaborate mechanical joints &mdash; e.g., dovetail joints &mdash; are now more decorative than practical? "
881,What minimum level of hardness (on the Janka scale) is appropriate for a desk top?,"A friend of mine asked what wood to use for his desktop and said, ""I'd be fine with pine, since I assume it's cheaper."" I told him that I wouldn't use pine because it's so soft and would dent easily, but when he asked which he should use, I couldn't give an explicit answer beyond some of the common woods used.  I don't believe the desk will take frequent heavy impacts or the like, but It would be unfortunate to get a dent just for setting a cup down too hard or the like.  Roughly where on the Janka Hardness scale would be too soft to use for a desk or table top? Are there any woods you would avoid for other reasons? "

884,How to improve a sliding miter saw dust collection?,"I have a sliding miter saw with a seriously undersized dust port (1Â¼"").  It's originally built to throw the dust in a tiny bag. When ever I make cuts, about 25% (bag) or 50% (shopvac) of the dust is collected and the rest just spread in a conical way.    How can I improve dust collection so that it captures a lot more dust?  Are there generic accessories available to remedy this problem? "
885,Gluing end-grain,"Reading Is glue the best permanent join? and How can I join two boards at the ends? it sounds like the consensus is that gluing end-grain just doesn't work well.  As this answer explained,      When glue is applied to end-grain, the grain acts as little straws and   draws a lot of the glue up the wood, away from the joint (similar to   how the grain draws water up the tree when the tree is alive). In   these cases, the majority of the glue is pulled away from the joint   and (without more elaborate joinery techniques) a strong joint cannot   be achieved, no matter how rough you sand or how tight your clamps   are.   Is this true for all glues &ndash; even epoxy and CYA?  It seems like there should be a way to seal the end-grain to prevent it from (excessively) drawing in glue, while still preserving the surface area and characteristics that allow wood glues to work effectively.  Are there no established processes for that? "
886,What are the considerations for different guide materials in a sled jig?,"I'm slowly gathering accessories for my table saw.  Most of the sled plans I've seen have wooden rails to slide in the table grooves.  But I've also seen some metal rails and I wonder if they wouldn't be more precise.  They aren't cheap so I wouldn't get a bunch, just a pair to move from jig to jig.    Given the different materials what would make me choose one over the other? What would I need to consider when choosing my rail material for my sled(s)? "

It looks like the areas where this is happening are the areas that get the most sun (through a skylight, not directly overhead), but I haven't seen sun damage like this.  Perhaps somebody else has?  I can rule out water damage or heavy use -- the table is lightly used and wear doesn't seem to be a factor as some of the most used parts look the most pristine.  Any suggestions for an intervention, short of or including refinishing? "

893,Frame and panel glue up,"I'm building frame and panel sides for a cabinet, which I've never done before, and had a question about the glue up. I'm use mortise and tenons to make the frame and the panel will be floating inside a dado to allow to wood movement.  I assume that you first apply glue to the 2 bottom joints, put in the 2 stiles to the bottom rail, slide in the frame, then glue and attach the top rail.   When gluing any joint, I was told that there should be some squeeze out to ensure that adequate glue was used. But if there is squeeze out from the mortise into the nearby dado, couldn't the panel potentially get glued in place (when the intent is to have it remain free to move a little)?  If you were to use less glue in this case to reduce squeeze out, how can you be assured that enough glue has been used to make a strong joint? Is there another way to make a frame and panel to circumvent this? "
894,"How to get better at fitting joints and ""seeing"" bruises?","I'm a beginner.   I'm concentrating on hand-tool joinery for now.  I've watched a lot of YouTube videos, trying to learn joinery.   For the purposes of this question I'm most interested in mortice &amp; tenon joints and dovetail joints.  When fitting a joint it's clearly necessary to remove a little wood where the joint doesn't fit yet.   But, best not to remove wood that doesn't need to be removed since (e.g.) this can make the joint fit more loosely than necessary.  So the basic idea is only to remove the wood that's preventing the joint from fitting.   Often, videos show people making a trial fit and then figuring out where the wood is ""bruised"" in order to deduce what to remove.   But I can't see this bruising on the videos, myself.  At the moment I find tenon fitting seems easier, since I can do a trial fit and then wiggle the part-way-inserted tenon in the mortise to figure out where the tenon pivots; this is the high point and I can remove material from either the mortise or the tenon to make it fit (and the shoulders of the tenon will hide some mistakes in this).   Sometimes, the layout marks may provide a hint as to what to remove, but that's not the case that's interesting to me here (since I already know how to do that).  Anyway, in this way I can more or less fit a mortise and tenon joint without being able to spot the bruising.     However, with a dovetail joint there are multiple places where the joint could be binding during a test fit, so spotting bruising is, I suspect, more important for dovetails.  So my question really boils down to these specifics:   How do I distinguish the wood that must be removed to fit a joint from the wood that should not? How do I identify where wood is ""bruised""?   Pointers to learning materials would be very welcome (i.e. you don't have to explain it all directly in your answer if there are e.g. videos showing how to work on these skills). "
895,Ripping vs Resawing - is there a reason for the difference?,"While I understand the technical difference between ripping a board in two vs resawing a board into thinner boards, is there a technical reason for the distinction?  Granted, thinner pieces of wood will flex more substantially during cuts on a resaw and binding while cutting is a concern, but that's a difference of degree not type, and would remain true when ripping boards into smaller sections as well.  For instance, if I were to saw a 4x4 into two 2x4s, is that operation a rip or a resaw?   It would seem to be more reasonable to label the cut according to it's orientation relative to the grain like we do with the crosscut. Presumably ""quarter-sawing"" perpendicular to a consistent set of rings of alternating density is mechanically distinct from ""rift/plain-sawing"" mostly between the rings, resulting in different stresses on the blade and wood.  Bonus question: Is there research that discusses the differences in these two cutting processes? "
896,How do I cut a blind half-lap T-joint?,"(Apologies if this has been answered before. This probably has a really obvious answer.)  I need to connect two 4x4s in a ""T"". (These are one leg and a center / longitudinal support for a long table.)  I decided on a half lap joint since it looked relatively easy to do, but my wife doesn't want to see the back of the joint on the table feet. I thought:  easy enough, I'll just make it a blind joint so that the end of the long board doesn't go all the way through, leaving about 3/4"" on the end of the lap.   However, I'm not sure what the best way is to cut this into the table foot (about 32"" piece of 4x4). My initial attempt on a piece of scrap was to drill a few holes in the corners of the waste area, hit it with the jig saw and chisel out the rest. This works, mostly, but is something of a pain and doesn't get me a smooth surface at the bottom of the cut for the long board to mate with.  I'm not super-comfortable with the idea of putting a 1.5"" bit on my router as I'm a bit afraid of snapping the shaft if the teeth catch on a knot.  Suggestions? I considered a mortise-and-tenon joint, but that leaves me with the problem of cutting a 1.5-1.75""-deep mortise, which is basically the same issue I'm having here.   I could probably just get a large bit or hole saw, use my neglected drill press and clean up the excess with the jig saw or chisel, but is there a better / more accepted / safer way to do this? "

899,Band saw blade replacement,"I am so new to band saws and I want to have a back up for my Ryobi band saw. It uses 62"" blades and that Part I get good. When buying they all say something like 62"" X 1/8 or 3/8"" X 6/14 TPI. The main thing I get confused over is that middle number. If it says 1/8"" or 3/8"" etc. is that how wide the blade is? I am almost certain but not sure. Because what if the 1/8"" means thickness? 3/8"" would be pretty thick so I think that would be width. What is a good general blade width. And what would be a good TPI. I was thinking 6 sounded good, even though 14 would be more fine. But would is the recommended TPI otherwise? I am just doing wood cutting. Last thing is with installing the blade. How much ""flex"" should the blade have when I adjust that tension. I heard you should be able to take your finger and pull the blade back 1/8"". That be all for now.Thanks "
900,Vise chop thickness?,"I'm in the process of making a work bench, mostly following the Nicholson style, and with a vise like this one.  The only difference is that I'm going to be using hard wood for the vise chop, and I want to put dog holes in the top of it.  Because of cost, I'll probably have to laminate 2 pieces of wood together to form the chop, rather than using a single thick piece.  My question is this: given that I want to put dog holes (3/4"") in the chop, how thick should I make it? I was thinking 2"" - is that enough? "
901,Are Oil finishing and Oil polishing complementary?,"There seems to exist two different procedures to finish wood with vegetal penetrating oils (raw linseed oil, boiled linseed oil, or pure tung oil). One method consists in letting the oil penetrate into the wood passively using only the power of passing time and a clean cloth, referred to as ""oil finishing"", and the other consists in rubbing/burnishing the oil into the piece ad nauseam, referred to as ""oil polishing"".  I can't find much information on oil polishing in newer/popular texts -- it seems to be more of a historical method. I may not have the nomenclature completely right, as I can't find a new or old text that covers both methods.  Are these two approaches complementary, or should they be perceived as alternatives to one another? What does the extra labour buy you?  A. Oil finishing  This is coat-wait-wipe dry-and-repeat approach:   cover the work in a generous layer of oil using a soft cloth wait some amount of time between 10-30m for oil to penetrate wipe all excess oil with a clean cloth wait between 24h and 48h depending on environment repeat (optionally de-nibbing with fine sandpaper or steel wool between coats)   Quoting the label at the back of my bottle of BrandX linseed oil:     Apply on well sanded wood, concrete or stone that is free of lint, wax or debris. Apply sparingly with a soft cloth or brush. Do NOT apply with a sponge. For more even penetration, dilute with equal parts of BrandX turpentine or BrandX paint thinner. Always wipe off any oil that has not penetrated the surface after half an hour. Wait until the first coat is dry before applying a second coat...   Similar instructions are given for pure tung oil:     ...   The first coat should be a liberal one, and you can rub it over the wood with your hand, a soft rag, or #000 steel wool (#0000 deteriorates badly). Allow this application to sit for 5 to 10 minutes so the oil can soak in, then remove any excess with a clean, soft rag or steel wool. Check after about a half-hour for any seeping, and rub this off as well. Let dry completely (24 to 48 hours) between coats. For woods with very open pores, allow an extra 24 hours drying time.      Source: LeeValley tung oil PDF   This approach also seems to be in line with popular practice (at least of the few who choose oil as a finish). E.g., it is what some spoonmakers recommend.  B. Oil Polishing  Some texts describe a much more laborious process, described as Oil Polishing or Oil-Polishing. It would appear that rubbing (and burnishing) is done with a padded heavy object (like a brick), and continues until the oil has completely penetrated into the wood.     Central to oil polishing is linseed oil, and it should be used in its raw form [...] The oil is heated by placing it in a container  and standing it in a bowl of hot water which can be frequently renewed. Warm oil will flow much more easily. Assuming that the wood is smooth and clean, a generous film of oil is applied, using a broad brush. The rubbing is done with a soft felt wrapped round a brick, and working from area to area. The first coat will rapidly soak into the wood. [...]       The end of each phase is marked by the disappearance of the oil. The first coat will not provide a mere hint of polish, but if the operation is repeated some results can be expected.      Depending on the condition of the wood the results will definitely appear after the fourth coat, and it will be marked by sweat points as saturation point is reached. These sweat marks should be removed with a rag soaked in methylated spirit, the use of which will not impair the final finish because it rapidly evaporates.      Chap 9, The complete manual of wood finishing, 1st edition, Frederick Oughton, ISBN 0-8128-2890-9, 1983   I can find a similar process described in Staining and Polishing - Including Varnishing &amp; Other Methods of Finishing Wood, with Appendix of Recipes by JCS Brough     Oil-polishing is most useful for table tops, bar tables, counters and spirit cabinets. A dining-room table with an oil-polished top, and the sides and legs French polished, will make a most satisfactory job. [...]      For a table-top or other surface which is large and level, rub some of the oil well into it, and then polish with a rubber made by rubbing a quantity of felt or flannel round a brick or other suitable block. [...] In applying the oil, do not saturate or flood it, but scrub it in, and afterwards rub long and hard. Of course the wood will absorb the oil, even after several applications. It will need much patience to bring it up to a good glow; in fact it might be said that the work is never finished.  "
902,"Lacquer brush marks, and dullness, on wood surface - what to do?","I looked around and didn't see an answer to this question. I have a wood door on my house that was looking a little dull. It had been finished at the factory with a black stain-lacquer combination. I thought I'd be smart and ""clean"" it up a bit after 10 years of sun damage, so I bought the right can of stain-lacquer and tried applying it with a brush. The results look pretty poor and I'm afraid to touch it again. I talked to a paint professional about fixing my mess, but he wasn't interested.   What can I do about this? I thought about trying to gently apply some lacquer thinner with a cotton cloth and just slowly rubbing it down until I'm back to the original state of the door, but I'm not sure of that will work. My understanding is that lacquer (and lacquer thinner).   The other thing I thought of was mixing the stain with lacquer thinner and (again) trying to apply a coat or two. But given the prior results, I'm very concerned about this.   Any advice?  "
903,How to cover the top and bottom of a piece with a self-leveling epoxy resin?,"Is there a good way to cover both the top and bottom of a piece with a self-leveling epoxy resin?  I have a small box/basket that I'd like to have in my kitchen to hold cooking oils.  Since the bottles will likely leak cooking oil, I'd like to treat the wood with an epoxy resin, so that it will be durable and more easily cleaned.  And, it case it's not clear, by epoxy resin I mean a material similar to what's used to finish bar tops.  Anyway, all of the resources I see on using epoxy resin cover finishing the top and sides of the piece.  Basically, we pour and spread the resin on the top and it runs over the side.  What's not clear to me is what to use on the bottom of the piece.  Can we use the epoxy resin on the bottom as well?  If so, it's not clear to me how to accomplish this.  Every piece I've seen has drips from the epoxy along the bottom.  I suppose we could sand these drips down, but then we'll have the same issue when we flip over the piece and treat the bottom.  Certainly, I could use a different product on the bottom, but I'd rather just use the same durable finish on all sides.  Is there a good way to accomplish this? "
904,Dust Control on a Table Saw Not Intended for It?,"I have a Ryobi table saw (RTS21G), and it is a half decent table saw for the price in my opinion. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a dust control system nor port. The dust just comes out the bottom. Is there a way to control the dust for this table saw? I've seen dust bags like the one from harbor freight, but it's not accessible in their stores and they say it's only for their table saw. The perimeter of the table saw's square base is 14"", and does not fit dust solutions such as Amazon's big gulp dust hood.   Are there any other dust control options that can fit this type of saw? I would prefer something with a vacuum port, but I'm open to just about anything such as dust bags. "
905,"""T"" joint with MDFâNo power tools","Disclaimer: I'm a complete newbie when it comes to woodworking so I apologize if I don't use good woodworking vocabulary.  I'm hoping to build a small hutch/monitor stand for my desk out of MDF. I'm choosing to go with 3/4"" MDF because I'm a poor college student and want to go as cheap as possible. So far I've gathered that MDF and screws don't really get along and that I can use box joints for joining ends. I'm wondering if there is a good way to join two pieces of MDF in a ""T"" shape, like this:    I'm trying to avoid using any kind of hardware or joinery that takes up space below or above the ""shelf"" in the image: I need to slide an object on my desk onto the shelf and it will fit exactly.  I also don't have any power tools besides a circular saw and a power drill, so I can't cut holes for biscuits. I want each joint to be sturdy, but also aesthetically pleasing (I want my wife's support in future projects so I don't want it to look like some scraps were just slapped together).  I saw a joinery method called a ""dado"", and was thinking that this might work:    If this is a viable option, how deep should I cut the groove? The MDF is only 3/4"" thick. How would I cut a blind dado (as shown in the image above) with hand tools?  If this is not a good option, why not? Are there any other methods I can use for a discrete but strong joint that can be implemented with hand tools? "
906,What technique is used to give new wood the distressed white color only in cracks and holes?,"Have a brand new piece of pine wood and would like to distress in this fashion, as best as possible:    Already made indentations, cracks, cuts and holes and it came out similar to the markings in the image (mainly with the back of a hammer).   However, not sure what to do to get that dusty warn-out white effect - inside the cracks, holes.  Is it is simple as painting the whole thing Chalk White, sanding down all the flat parts, so it is only left in the wholes... and then stain dark Espresso?   Or is there a known method, to create this effect? "
907,"PVC duct for dust collection: Glue the pipe and fittings together, or will tape suffice?","I am currently installing PVC pipe to act as duct for my dust collector. There will be a central pipe down the length of my shop, with a few branches coming off for specific tools.  So far, I've hung some pipe and connected it together with PVC fittings. I had planned to get it all loosely fitted together, and then go back through and glue it together with PVC glue and primer. But as I've pushed a few fittings together, I started to question whether I need the glue. It occurs to me there are some advantages to leaving it only loosely connected. If I should ever have clog, it'll be a lot easier to unclog if I don't have to cut the pipe apart. Ditto if I ever want to add branches.  Do I really need to glue the PVC together? Can I get away with taping the joints, either with the aluminum foil tape used on HVAC systems, or the X-Treme Tape for Dust Joints sold by Rockler?  I'm using the thinner DWV pipe / ASTM D2729, if that matters. It's mostly 4"" PVC, with one 3"" run for some smaller tools. "
908,Do I need a pre-stain conditioner if I'm not staining?,"I'm working on a project involving a bed and cabinets. I'm using cedar 2x4s for the structure and plywood for the visible parts. I'm not sure what kind of plywood it is; I chose it because it had the fewest knots.  I think the color is just fine as it is, so I was planning just to polyurethane it without staining.  Do I still need to use a pre-stain conditioner?  Also, will the poly eliminate the insect-repelling effects of cedar?  This is effectively my first woodworking project. I have no idea what I'm doing.

909,Whittling knife sharpening with Kennametal sharpening stone,"So I have this old Kennametal Sharpening Stone shown here:   I want to sharpen this dull edge shown here:    It was caused from learning mistakes which I am still doing, but would like a sharp knife, so I don't get discouraged by slow progress. So, before I start praticing my sharpening, I wanted to make sure what I have read up and learned is correct. I was going to use the stone with water on it and try to keep the knife at a 20 degree angle to remove the chips and regain the edge. Is this the correct high level process?  Also, I have recently learned about stropping, but I am unfamiliar with it. Is the concept of keeping a 20 degree angle the same? Also, if I have strips of leather (from deer) can I make a strop out of that? I can post a picture of the leather when I get home if need be.  Note: I have been using the quick sharpening tool with one coarse side and one fine side  to try to fix it. Is this a cardinal sin?  Sorry if these question(s) are too broad. I'm new to wood working and would just like to start with good habits of keeping a sharp knife! "

911,How to be confirm removal of glue residues?,"I have some loudspeakers with the front panel made of MDF, on which a matte plastic foil was attached.  After 15 years the glue is ineffective and the plastic shrunk, so I would like to remove it completely and I would like to apply some primer and black matte paint, both acrylic/water based (I understood it's better suited to my case than oil based).  I will sand the front panel everywhere, but how can I ensure, without applying primer, that I actually removed all the glue residues?  Should I use the colour of the surface, should I use a damp cloth, or is the primer the final test and I should simply sand again the parts where it's not sticking?  I don't have much experience with wood working, in the past I built something but I used new wood that required no treatment before painting.  Edit: sorry, I initially wrongly wrote particle board instead of MDF. "
912,Best way of building an interior door with screen,"I'm looking to replace an interior door with one that is mostly pet-proof mesh screen (like a patio door). I've come up empty on the ""just buy it"" front and am now looking at making one.   My first thought was to sandwich the mesh between a couple of boards - but can't seem to find any materials that will sum to equal 1 3/8"". Would it be okay if the door ends up being slightly under in terms of width?   I realize this isn't a discussion site - but I'm completely new to woodworking and could use any advice you're willing to give. Thanks,       Did you mean slightly under in terms of thickness?    Yes, I did. Rephrased, is it alright to replace a 1 3/8"" door with, say a 1"" or 1 1/4"" door?     Tell us what shop tools you have access to, especially to a table saw and possibly a planer.    I have access to a drill, jig, and router + anything that Home Depot may rent to me.  "
913,How should I cut a miter slot in my laminated router table?,"I have a router table top with a laminate surface and a rubber edge band on the sides.  I made it years ago on an MDF core.  Now, I'd like to have a miter slot on it.  How should I go about cutting that slot?  Should I simply fire up the router with a mortising bit?  I'm mostly concerned about cutting through the laminate top and rubber sides.  I'd hate to have the laminate crack or peel chunks of it.  Also, not sure about the advisability of cutting rubber with my router bits.  Any advice?  Perhaps I should score the laminate somehow before-hand?  Or chop through the rubber with a knife instead of the router bit? "
914,Are there any serious and non-obvious disadvantages to thermally modified wood?,"A local wood trader has shown me some thermally modifid ash planks (never seen that before!) with a stunning coloring that almost seduced me to immediately buy a table and two benches worth of it and build some new massive garden furniture.  Now, the wood is thermally modified. Which basically means it went into a kiln at a somewhat higher temperature and underwent a heat-induced chemical reaction. I had never seen such a wood (if you can still call it that) before. It's apparently a rather new thing (less than 20 years old) too.    From what I could gather from various (partially contradicting) sources, this means:   Greatly improved resistance to fungi and parasites, suitable for outdoor Even woods like beech and oregon pine are resistance class 1-2 after treatment Best invention since the invention of the wheel Wood almost doesn't work any more (50-75% reduction in shrinkage/growth, nearly no water uptake) No treatment needed Treatment recommended (... OK?) Varnish needed, oiling before varnish recommended to give the wood back its elasticity (how would that work???) Insufficient data for close-to-earth placement, might not be good (WTF?) Darker color (very obvious, and good looking, main reason to buy!) Harder, but somewhat more brittle Need to pre-drill big screws (Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that!) Not recommended to have too sharp edges in the open (Again, wow, what an insight!) Slightly less stable (slightly? how much?), not suitable for construction (why not, if it's just slightly weaker?) Glue might take up to 10 times as long to dry (... but, will it hold?)   So, what does that mean in summary? And does one of you maybe have experience working with that and can confirm or deny any of the above?  For example, when someone tells me ""hard and brittle"", I come to think of mineral substances. As in, giving that ultra-fine dust that causes lung cancer when being worked. Not exactly what I'd like. When someone tells me ""controlled, partial combustion, chemical change"", I come to think of ""easily flammable"" and ""unknown evaporations"".  Are there some obvious and maybe not-so-obvious reasons why one wouldn't want to use such a kind of wood? "

916,Letting the under-paint show through,"I have an old painted wooden bench that I want to refinish. The existing paint, dark blue with some toll-work flowers, is firmly on (no chipping or flaking) but faded and rubbed through in many places.     I want to change the color overall to a dark green, but let some of the under-paint (and maybe even a little bare wood) show through. How can I do this?  I am not talking about a glaze that gives a slight tint and then collects in the seams and cracks, but an overall color change with hints of the earlier paint.  What comes to mind is cleaning with mineral spirits, maybe a very light sanding, followed by an application of a satin water-based enamel which gets lightly rubbed off as I go. Or would I be better off with a spray shellac followed by milk paint and then a sealer of poly or wax? Or is there some other technique?   I do want it durable enough for regular use. Suggestions? "
917,Is a plunge router suitable for router table work?,"I mounted my plunge router to a new router table this weekend.  I discovered very quickly that it is difficult to adjust the router bit height, as the springs (the very heavy springs!) end up fighting my efforts.  Yes, I can use the micro-adjustment mechanism, but due to the awkwardness, I basically ended up taking the router and insert plate out of the table every time I wanted to make a change.  Am I doing something wrong?  Is it okay to use my plunge router on my router table?  Is it safe? "
918,Creating additional boards from thick lumber,"I have boards that are ~ 2"" thick, ~15"" wide, and x feet long.  I would like to divide these boards in half.  I do not have the funds to buy a large bandsaw or other power tools. I'm looking to trim the thickness and wind up with two boards around half the thickness.  What is the best way to divide these boards evenly (and close to level)?  What tools to I need to buy? "
919,"How are these toolmarks happening, and how to prevent / get rid of them?","I'm noticing that when I turn really hard woods, even with brand-new and very sharp carbide bits, sometimes I'll see these long scratches on the surface.   Often they'll only become apparent once I've started sanding, and no amount of sanding seems to be able to mitigate or remove them. Do I really need to re-surface the bowl with a chisel?  I pretty exclusively use Easy Wood Tools (carbide-tipped) since I don't have the space for a sharpening system. Generally, I use the circular bit (which they call the finisher) for roughing, then try to get a fine surface finish with a square or radiused-square bit.  I'm attaching some pictures that show the scratches I'm talking about.  Since my tools are very sharp, and I'm seeing the scratches no matter what speed I set my lathe at, I'm wondering if they're happening because the speed at which I move the tool along the wood is slightly inconsistent - could this be the case? (I find it really hard to move the tool at a super-consistent speed, as it seems like there are ""slippery"" and ""sticky"" parts on the surface of my toolrest).  Any tips or tricks would be much appreciated - I note, this doesn't seem to happen nearly as much on softer woods like walnut. "

921,Any suggestions on filling gaps in wood flooring? - Pine Tongue Groove,Any suggestions on filling gaps in wood flooring? Pine tongue groove was used that is usually used for wall or ceiling. Have no idea why they put this on the floor? I was thinking cutting wood strips and gluing them in then sand. Better idea may be to rip it up and put a real floor down. Impossible to clean for the owner.   
922,Tung oil stain resistance,"What I've done:  Made a small plate out of hard maple. Sanded it down to 220 grit sandpaper. Finished with pure tung oil (100%, not the big box stuff) over the course of about a week, giving four coats. Let sit for two weeks inside (under fan, about 70 degrees), until it no longer 'smelled' like tung oil and there was no more seepage.   I wanted to see how resistant to food stains the plate was. Against cold/room temperature stuff it seemed to laugh it off - sriracha, pasta sauce, wine, etc. But when I put some warm curry powder/water paste on it and let it sit as long as the others, I had a giant bright yellow stain and the wood had roughed up a bit from me trying (and successfully) scrubbing the stain out with warm water + gentle soap.   What I'd like to know is:   Would tung oil normally stand up to that kind of thing? Will it keep resisting stains if the food put on it is warm/hot (up to 140 degrees)? Or did I just not 'cure' the plate long enough? If tung oil really isn't going to protect the plate from anything warm/hot, is there anything out there that will and is a ""natural"" product? Don't laugh here - I've got a lot of people asking about food safe finishes, and the only one that I've found so far that all the ""internet experts"" seem to agree on is tung oil, as most other finishes can chip off into food or don't protect well enough. I need it to meet the ""can't chip"" and ""after curing is non-toxic"" criteria.    It's ok to say ""nope, out of luck"" - I can just as easily say ""eat your curry out of a bowl"" :P  "
923,Repurpose solid beech flooring,"I potentially have a large amount of solid beech flooring 20mm thick, 85mm wide and various lengths. I'd like to repurpose some of it to make a work bench entirely from the beech.  I'm inexperienced in wood working generally, but want to experiment a bit, and would like to know if the following are possible/realistic:  1) Can I glue the slats together and make suitable strong table legs and other structural parts, e.g. 80x80x900.  2) If I then cut mortise/tenons in there, will they then be strong enough, or will the wood break up?  3) For the bench top I have considered either joining the slats horizontally with two layers to produce a 40mm thick top, or putting the slats on their side to produce an 80mm top.  4) If I can't find long enough pieces to make the table top, and instead make the top up using overlapping shorter pieces, will that make a strong enough table top?  Sorry if these are very basic questions. "
924,Repair / Restore Veneer Covered Table,"Context:   I own a small couch table with a pattern made of veener on top (picture 1). As far as I can tell, the tabletop consists of at least three layers:    Massive wood A layer of thin veneer An unidentified but glossy coating (might be varnish or wax?)   While the veneer (layer 2) is intact, the unidentified coating is damaged. There are areas on the tabletop where the coating is completely rubbed off (picture 2, 3). Multiple fine cracks can be seen all over the table top.  My question:  I'd love to get your input on my question: How can I restore / repair the table? I would prefer to do it in a way so that the tabletop becomes as pretty as it once was and as resilient as possible.  Thanks a lot in advance :)  Pictures:  Picture 1: View of the tabletop   Picture 2: Detailed view of an area with damaged coating   Picture 3: Residue of the coating on a white sheet of paper (each particle is less than 1mm in size)  "
925,how to re-adhere veneer before refinishing,"I am going to refinish my late 1940s kitched cabinets, but first I need to repair some of the veneer. In some places the veneer is badly damaged, broken, missing. In these areas I removing sections and patching.  But in other sections, as below, the veneer is peeling off of the surface but it has not yet fallen off (the dado is for a shelf). So my question is, what is the best way to fix this? I have some tiny glue syringes which I could use to get some glue behind the veneer, but then I will have to clamp it, and there is going to be a lot of excess glue. Maybe contact cement? Is there any chance that I could use a wallpaper steamer to gently peel back the veneer and reapply  with contact cement? Any other ideas?    "
926,Flat spline for curves,Surely it's possible to use a flat spline to draw (and even jigsaw or route) an arbitrary smooth curve.  What are some guidelines for doing this?  What material for the curve? What to use for ducks? Is it possible to use a router with  a guided bit? 
927,Can one apply dark shellac over light shellac (satisfactorily)?,"Iâve darkened the color of my shellac by adding dye. Iâm quite satisfied with the new color.  I have a piece brushed with several coats of the same shellac flakes without dye, and i thought iâd be able to move expertly enough to apply new darker layers over it, evenly. Is this a futile enterprise?  Iâm at two coats of the darker stuff, but new layers are fusing too deep, and shades are melding.

929,Joining HDF panels and pine frame for good,"I'm currently building a green wall / cyclorama room, and one of its properties is that it has an infinity wall (curved walls with an X radius in all the corners).  After a lot of research I decided to go with 3mm HDF for the panels.  My question is, considering that the joints between the panels will be filled with mud, sanded down, primed and painted, I cannot afford any kind of movement due to humidity or temperature changes (room will be controlled anyway), as they would crack the paint.  Aside from nailing the panels (I'm using Type C staples), would you also consider glueing them? And if so, wood glue or construction glue?   "
930,Hand planing punky wood,"I have some spalted punky wood blanks I'm turning into a stool seat. How do I stabilise it so it won't tear out during hand planing? It's to big for ca glue, if i use a wood hardener can I then plane it?  "
931,Dovetailed spine?,"I snagged the image below while looking online for dovetail examples.     Instead of two boards coming together, it appears that the joint, what I called the spine in the title, is a third piece to which both boards connect. (Example 1, 2, 4, and 6 reading left to right)   Is there a particular name for this type of join that differentiates it among other dovetails?  Would this have any effect on the strength of the joint?   "
932,"Minimum Plywood Thickness for small ""crate""","I've never done any woodwork in my life but I wanted to try.  I thought about making a simple shelf consisting of a few small crate-like boxes (Each box being 60cm in Length, 15cm in Width and 20cm in Height and the shelf itself would be about 120cm tall, or 6-crates tall) and was think about having a 2cmX2cm long vertical square ""pole"" at the corners and a 1cmx2cm rail instead of a full side for each crate that would meet at the corners in a channel carved in the poles and touch in a 45Âº edge to the other rail of a corner. Something like this:    (Left to Right: 2cmX2cm pole with the 2cmX1cm channel cut through, the side rails in place, topside view of the join area ignoring the rest of the pole that would be on top of the joint)  My Idea for each crate would be something like this:   (Top-down and Side views of each crate, respectively)  I'd like to know if I use solid wood for the poles and plywood for the rails and bottom of each crate, in the dimensions mentioned, would it be strong enough? Do I need thicker plywood/wood for the structure to be able to hold?  I imagine this can be hard to predict, but I hoped someone experienced would have a better view on that and maybe point some obvious mistake I can't see.  Thank you very much for the attention! "
933,What solids content does a hardwearing wood / floor stain need to have?,"I have read that for paint the solids content indicates something about the quality of the paint in the sense that higher solids probably means fewer coats required.  Is this also the case for stains? Since stains are intended to be translucent I could imagine that the solids content could correlate with the darkness of the color, for instance, and have nothing to do with how well the finish will wear or age.  As an example, the Bona Drifast technical data sheet says: Solids â 35-47%  and the Minwax TDS states % Solids: 40.0-45.6  Aassuming the solids content is a measure of quality, what's a reasonable minimum value to have confidence the stain will hold up over time (say, 10-20 years)?   (All else being equal... obviously there are other factors which influence finish robustness as well.)  Thanks "
934,Cutting rabbets with a table saw against the fence,"I'm very new to woodworking (I've only just started out in an online course), and I've been trying my best to educate myself on safe practices. Recently, I've been thinking about how rabbets are cut on the table saw with a dado stack. Having never used a table saw, I've been looking around online to see how it's done.  This helpful video has some interesting tips, particularly about cutting the rabbet against a sacrificial fence. My primary question is how you handle rabbets that are ultimately wider than the stack can accommodate in one pass.  As an example, suppose that I want to cut a rabbet that's 3/4 of an inch in width (to accept a 3/4 inch wide piece of plywood). Some small job-site table saws can only accommodate a narrow dado stack, due to a short arbor length. For this example, assume the dado stack is only 3/8 of an inch wide.  How would the rabbet in this situation be cut? Would the first pass be against a sacrificial fence, cutting the outermost edge away first, followed by moving the fence away from the blade to make the second pass?  Essentially, how do you safely cut a wider rabbet (or dado) than the dado stack can physically go? I want to avoid kickback as much as I can. "
935,Tips for reducing sandpaper loading on drum sander,"So I got a great deal on a used 25"" Performax drum sander this past weekend.  It needs a little repair - specifically, one of the drums needs to be replaced.  But it works fine as a single drum unit until I get around to it.  Anyway, I decided to try it out on a Ponderosa pine slab that I have around.  About 15"" wide by 3' long and maybe 2"" thick.  I've had this in my shop in bone-dry Colorado (summer humidity can reach the single digits) for about 9 months.  Not sure how long the sawyer had it, but it was stored inside, stacked &amp; stickered, when I bought it and was from timber dead at least 5 years (forest fire salvage).  Felt dry then.  Anyway, I was taking light passes - about 1/8 of a turn.  Don't know what that comes to in inches.  And slow feeds.  But the paper loaded up like crazy, particularly over knots.  The 80 grit that was on it succumbed quickly.  Swapped it for some new 60 grit Al oxide, and that only lasted for about 6-8 passes as well.  I tried using one of those rubber sand paper cleaning sticks between passes - and a wire brush when it started getting bad.  I'm running dust collection on it.  Any ideas?  Maybe a heavier grit for roughing it in?  Or is this just what I should expect with a resin heavy wood like Ponderosa knots?    I ran a big walnut slab through several times yesterday, and no loading at all! "
936,Douglas fir stair treads spots not staining?,I made these stair treads out of reclaimed Douglas fir. The wood is gorgeous! Some of the stairs stained amazing and a couple have these much lighter spots where the wood didn't seem to take the stain?  Did I mess up with my process or is this just how Douglas fir works? How  is it suppose to look? First time working with reclaimed wood.  Process:   Sanded 80 grit- I read not to go higher than 80 to help the grain pop? 50/50 denatured alcohol/shellac  Minwax gel stain coffee     I love the markings and chose the darker color with the intention of getting them to stand out. I edited my pics and circled the spots Iâm talking about. Itâs these spots that came out even lighter that I donât know about. 
937,Suggestions on improving an elevated-bed project?,"I have my bed in a corner of the room and I want to elevate it. I don't like any of the IKEA solutions and the like because I want the corner of the bed that is away from the walls to be free. So I've made my own project   I've made it with this free android app [website]You can get the project and explore it in more detail here [website]The red wall cannot bear any weight, but he other wall is concrete. I would like to avoid turning the bed (so that the pillar can be fastened to the bearing wall) because this would take away the space for a desk. My plan is to just make the pillar fit exactly the height of the room so that it locks in (split it in two pieces, a main tall one and a smaller top that I can slide in), basically leaving no room for the pillar to tip. I am counting on this being able to sustain any weight and pulling I might stress on the far end of the crossbeam, since the ceiling is also concrete. I would also run a cable from the joint between the pillar and the  crossbeam toward the concrete wall, to put some tension and fasten everything together in that direction. I am planning to use 15x15cm massive wood for pillar and crossbeam.  This is my very first own wood project - Do you seen any flaws in the plan? - Do you have improvements? If you think it can work - What kind of joint would you make between the pillar and crossbeam? I simply plan to cut out 5cm out of each and insert them into each other, the the bolt for the cable would fasten them together but would not need to bear any weight. "
938,Can I really use my table saw as a disc sander?,"When looking through a tool catalog from the 1950s I noticed that Shopmaster sold a sanding disc for their table saw. I looked around online and found discs that fit my saw still available, e.g. here is a balance blade that you can also stick sandpaper to, and there are many others:    I had no idea this was a thing. Can I reliably use my table saw as a disc sander? The RPMs seem higher than a typical disc sander, and also would I run a risk of burning out the motor if I ran it too long? I mean, I know the table saw motor is pretty heavy duty, but it doesn't seem like it was designed to run in the same manner that a disc sander motor runs (long periods of time, low or no load).  I've always wanted a disc sander - I have no stationary power sanding tools right now - but don't have the space for one. What am I risking by using the table saw with a sanding disc? "
939,Choosing wood type for child's rocking horse chair,"I have purchased this plan to make a friend's child a rocking horse chair.    The photo appears to show the project made from pine.

940,How do I de-nib polyurethane after it dries but still maintain its finish?,"Sometimes when I apply polyurethane, for whatever reason, it's not completely smooth. Maybe a brush mark here and there, or a couple little nibs, etc.  The advice I see often is to sand the area lightly with a high grit sand paper.  When I do this, even when I sand very lightly, like one low pressure pass with 400 or 600 or even 1000, the texture comes out nice and smooth but the polyurethane is always scuffed with little white marks.  How do I avoid or remove the scuffing? How do I actually smooth nibs and other small irregularities out of polyurethane? The frequent advice to sand lightly is either incorrect, incomplete, or I'm missing something. I have never had success.  Also does the technique vary for gloss vs matte/satin? "
941,What makes a hand saw great?,"In writing an answer for How do experts make dovetails by hand that fit so well?, I realized that there is much more to say than ""get a good saw.""

While some of the cost differences between these saws may simply be marketing, I know that a number of design features contribute to a superior saw. So what makes a great saw great? "
942,How to attach steel strip to OSB board,"I'm going to reinforce a 2.2m span of shelf made out of 18mm OSB bord with two 60*4 mm steel strips running underneath the board.  The shelf will be 1m deep front-to-back and carry a 100-kg load (consider it uniformly distributed over the shelf).  What's the best method of connecting the strip to the board?  Screws are obvious answer, what size should I get and how many? Or would glue or rivets suit me better?  My understanding is that connection points would mostly have sliding forces when the shelf is bent under load, but I'm not sure. "
943,"Carved kuksa of ash wood has split and oozed water, what has gone wrong?","I hand-carved my first Kuksa a month ago from half an ash log. I worked with semi-dry wood (definitely not green, but still wet). I used axe, Japanese gouge and knife and all went well. The bowl is not too thick either.   So I let it dry in a plastic bag opened in the bowl and after some (short) drying I put linseed oil on it and let it dry more. I was quite surprised because it was absorbing so much linseed oil. A bit like a sponge... After two weeks of drying and the final application of a mixture of beeswax with linseed oil and some more drying I tested it with some warm tea.   To my disappointment I got a lot of linseed oil floating in my bowl. Then I let the tea in the bowl for some time, to see how it holds. In very little time tea began to ooze from the pores on the outside of the bowl in the faces that were cut across the grain. Then the bottom which was getting wet from this has split.  So I guess my mistake has been to not let the wood dry out completely before oiling and that the oil somehow has caused the wood to contract, somehow keeping the pores open.  Am I guessing right? Or is the ash really spongy like this and not suitable for bowls? Or have I overlooked something. Sorry I'm only starting with bowl carving...  I would like to add that I haven't got this issue with a well-dried beech bowl. "
944,"Shellac over paint, outdoors","I am making something for outdoor use and I've painted it with a matte exterior latex paint. I'm satisfied with the protection that the paint will offer but I'm experimenting with ways to make it look nicer.  Right now I am considering glossy finishes. I have found that I much prefer the appearance and texture of shellac (de-waxed) to a high gloss spar urethane.  I don't really need good scratch resistance for this particular piece, and the paint should protect the wood enough from moisture and sunlight.  I'm also not too concerned about color changes over time as long as it is uniform. The paint is just brown, and maintaining the precise brown isn't super important.  My question is, how should I expect a fairly thick shellac finish (over paint) to behave outdoors over time? It will be exposed to sunlight, a wide range of temperatures, and plenty of rain, snow, and ice. Should I expect flaking? Spotting? Blemishes (I've heard it gets cloudy with moisture)? Other weird stuff? Or will it maintain its nice appearance? If it does get grimy, will it be prone to staining (with polyurethane a good wipe down with an all purpose cleaner takes care of it)?   I already own the paint and don't really want to buy another gallon of glossy paint; I'm trying to do this with the stuff I already have sitting around collecting dust on my shelves. "
945,Hollowing out a piece of timber,"Wood, well most wood, is heavy. Is there any such thing as people ever hollowing out the inside of the wood to make the finished product lighter?   For example, let's say I have a 4in. x 4in. x 8' piece of timber to make 4 desk legs out of. Instead of having four square desk legs of solid wood, could I hollow out the inside of the timber leaving only about a 1/2 inch thickness on each of the four sides? This would save wood for other projects, and accomplish making the desk lighter while hopefully still providing a pretty sturdy, un-wobbly base.  What tools and method could I use to hollow out the inside of this piece of timber? "
946,Does it matter what type of mallet I use with my chisels?,Somewhere I read that you should use a round mallet to hit a square chisel and a square (I assume this means flat-faced) mallet to hit round chisels because otherwise when you strike the chisel you could hit it at an awkward angle and cause it to mess up the cut. Is this statement referencing the top (the face that you strike with the mallet) or the sides of the handle? Is there any objective evidence that it matters what kind of mallet you use? 
947,Does dropping boards really relieve internal tensions?,"A Fine Woodworking article I read a while back has a picture of Steve Latta dropping boards onto concrete.  The caption reads:     Drop relieves stress. For larger doors, like those on armoires, Latta   actually drops rough parts on the floor! The impact releases internal   tensions and lets the parts finish warping before final dimensioning,   he says.   I thought there was an accompanying video but I couldn't find it with a brief search.  I have a great amount of respect for any professional woodworker, but to me this seems really sketchy. Is this true, and if so, how would you explain it to a 5-year-old using pictures? Are there any studies which have measured and confirmed or debunked this claim? "
948,Respirator: do not use for hardwoods?,"I've got 3M Power Tool Respirator (product page). It has a sander tool icon on the cover yet it reads ""Do not use for hardwoods"".

I am about to sand some older wood pieces that might be hardwood. "
949,"What is the difference between ""curing"" and ""drying""?","When learning about different finishes, some resources talk about the finish's drying time, such as this Zinsser Shellac.     The shellac dries to the touch in 15 minutes and can be re-coated in 45 minutes   Whereas others refer to a curing time, like the Real Milk Paint Tung Oil:     Pure Tung Oil will take 7 to 10 days for a minimum cure and 15 to 30 days for a full cure.   Is this the same thing? If not, what is the difference? Can the same finish have a curing time and a drying time? "

951,How can I properly dispose of rags used with Boiled Linseed Oil,"I have read several times now that, if not disposed of in a proper manner, rags covered in Boiled Linseed Oil (BLO) can combust.   In that regard I have some related questions:   Under what condition, if any, can I reuse the rags? What is the process for prepping these rags for safe disposal? Once that is done can they just be thrown in the trash or is it considered a hazard still?   I was looking for environmentally friendly finishes and by name I though this was just another oil. I just want to be sure i'm doing this right.  "
952,What is the difference between a dutchman patch and a butterfly patch?,"In How can I repair a split in a board?, the accepted response suggests a ""dutchman patch,"" but I'm getting mixed messages from various sources. Some show a dutchman as being the removal of damaged material and insertion of a patch of the same size. Others seem to specifically be a bowtie/butterfly shape reinforcing a crack in wood.   For instance, both of these images are being referred to as dutchman patches:    Source: [website]Source: [website]So which is it? Is there a difference between a dutchman patch and a butterfly patch? Is this just a case of the same phrase meaning two different things?  Is a dutchman a general term and the buttefly specifically that shape of dutchman? "
953,What general considerations do I need to take into account for wood movement?,"I know that wood movement is an issue, but it's a bit vague for me where I should be concerned with it.  This page Suggests that there is almost no movement in the longitudinal direction, but that there is significant movement in radial and tangential directions respective to the grain.  Are there particular orientations which I should avoid, e.g. radial in one piece in a plane with tangential of another?  With what orientations is it safe to use screws without hardware that would allow movement? "
954,How should I store the batteries of my cordless drill?,"I have a nice cordless drill that came with two rechargeable batteries. However, there are times when life gets in the way and I'm not using the drill at all over the course of several months. When I return to the drill, both of the batteries have died.  How should I store the batteries when they are not going to be used for several months? Is there a way to do so such that they'll have a charge when I need them next? Are there any steps I should be taking when storing the batteries so lengthen their overall lifetime? "
955,Is dimensional lumber kiln-dried differently than a kiln-dried board meant for woodworking?,"It may just be the species that are normally used for this purpose, but dimensional lumber such as studs, 2x6, 2x12, etc. works differently than any other wood I've used. It requires more effort to handplane and never develops a smooth surface. I encounter more pitch.   What is the cause of this? Is it harvested during a different season? Dried more/less? "
956,Can I thin PVA wood glue that has thickened?,"I have half a gallon of Titebond I (yellow PVA glue) that has thickened quite a bit, making it difficult to pour.   Can I thin it? How? Will thinning it have any effect on the glue's strength?  "
957,What is the purpose of a saw set?,"I do understand what the set is but I suppose I have some questions about its purpose.  I was watching a video by Paul Sellers and the focus was sharpening saws. The video was very informative in that regard and towards the end the topic turned to saw setting.   He showed, using a tool, how to set a saw. After which he showed how to reduce the set with a hammer.  I read that having a proper saw set reduces the chance of the saw blade buckling. At the end of the day:    What is the purpose of a saw set? Would there be a reason to remove it permanently?  "
958,What type of blades should I use for machining MDF?,"I need to machine a 10x10mm chamfer along the edges of a large quantity of MDF (medium density fibreboard) boards, on an ongoing basis.   Previously I've been using standard tool-steel blades for this on a spindle moulder and have noticed that the blades dull and become too blunt to use effectively very quickly - much more quickly than when using the cutters on hardwood. Generally these cutters will run something like 100 linear metres of a 10x10mm chamfer before they're useless and have to be replaced or resharpened.  Is there a better blade material to use for this? I seem to remember I've read that tungsten carbide blades are not great to use on MDF for some reason? Are diamond tipped blades better / more cost-effective in the long run for this purpose?  (Also before anybody mentions that you're not supposed to use power tools on MDF, I have the proper extraction setup etc. to deal with the hazardous MDF dust/fumes.) "
959,What wood is best for engraving?,"I'm looking at getting into wood engraving for print, something like this:    EDIT - I've just found out that the person that created this bird recommends birch plywood for beginners. Is this a good starting wood?  And I wanted to buy some engraving tools. I know you can get electric engravers but I prefer the look of the manual tools, they have a nicer charm to them.  Is there a preferred wood type when it comes to engraving?  And would there be softer wood types used for manual tools as it will be harder to engrave over the electric tools?  As I'm only getting into engraving for fun I would prefer cheaper wood types if possible. "
960,Building A Table - Help With Wood Selection and Joints,"I am wanting to build a table that will hold a Large Big Green Egg grill.  I've created a mock up using SketchUp (Just learned how to use it today, so it is kind of rough)  My design is based on a youtube video I saw and it looked like the video used 2"" x 2"" wood.  Those are the dimensions I used for my mock up.  First Question: Is 2"" x 2"" a common size and is it actually 2"" x 2""?  I recall that a 2x4 isn't really 2"" x 4"".  Second Question: Since the table will always be outside, what is a good wood to use?  Pressure treated or some type of hardwood?  Third Question: Is a Mortise and Tenon joint the best joint to use?  I used one for the mock up and Tenon will have to be trimmed, is that okay or should I change my dimensions.      "
961,Cutting dressed pine to make it narrower,"Is there any issue with cutting along the edge as shown in the image in order to change the dimensions to 110 x 19 x 2400? What will the edge look like? Different to if I cut the long edge (2400mm)?  Firstly, what is dressed timber? If I cut along this edge what will I have to do to make the surface look the same as the current surface and is it possible without a mill or some other expensive machinery?   "
962,Lubricating screws,"I sometimes do odd jobs in a church, including rehanging doors. The church is 400 years old, I think the doors are a lot newer but still 100-150 years old.    Getting the hinges off is not easy (to say the least) but I at least want to help whoever is doing my job in another 150 years. So I pre-bore and lubricate the screws. My father was a chippie and used vaseline, but a fellow odd-jobber said he uses soap.    What is the best lubricant? soap, vaseline or something else? "
963,Shelf movement in a plywood bookcase,"I'm building some 7' by 3' bookcases with mix of plywood and solid oak for the sides and back (mostly plywood), but full solid oak shelving for strength. I'm worried that the ~9"" depth to the shelves will allow up to about 1/8"" of movement. If I used the online formula correctly. Since the sides and shelves are constructed so differently, and will thus move differently, I'm assuming I can't just secure the fixed shelves to the sides and back.  My primary question is: am I right about the movement, and if so, is it sufficient to place the fixed shelves in a dado and only glue the front couple inches? (I want the front of the fixed shelves to look solidly attached throughout the year.) Secondarily, can I ""hide"" the movement at the back, for instance by running a 1/4"" dado and only insert the first 1/8"" inch during construction (it's winter, so it's probably near my low humidity point)? I didn't plan quite far enough ahead to select my boards for grain direction, so I'm assuming the worst.  Here's a rough look at my design, for reference; green is plywood, and the rest is solid. The topmost and bottom visible shelf, as well as one not visible near the very bottom are the fixed shelves I'm asking about attaching. (The rest of the shelves will be adjustable, so I just need to allow room for their largest size, and accept some gap.)   "
964,Is it drastically more work to sand down barn wood instead of planing?,"100 reclaimed barn wood planks: 4.5 foot long X 6 inch wide X 3/4 inch thick.  Trying to get the weight down by half, by thinning to 3/8 inch thick.  See: Can barn wood planks be planed and how thin?    Planing could work but has significant risk (and some pieces have large long cracks and holes).  Instead, what about sanding each one:   Is it possible or realistic to sand to 3/8 inch thickness (or thin by half) ? Any possible damage by sanding ?  What type of sander would work ? How long is this going to take ?   EDIT    Intended Use: The wood planks are intended to be attached to a ceiling in a room. It is intended that the patina of one side of the barn wood is saved for it's aesthetics. "
965,Finish for pine plywood art piece,"I'm an artist new to wood burning (pyrographics) and I just finished a female nude on pine plywood.I would like to add a finish to the figure (not the background) as a subtle emphasis. But I don't want the color to change and want very little - if any - shine. I would love to make it look like skin in fact... almost soft, silky... Since it's wall art, I wont need much protection qualities.  After about 100 blogs, I think I should look at a water white matte finish? Is there a more suitable finish?  I would love some more help/ input.  Keep in mind I virtually know nothing :)   "
966,Tenon dimensions and orientation,"I'm joining 4x4's in a tee with a mortise &amp; tenon, and am not sure what the dimensions should be. Everywhere I've looked has either contradictory or nonsensical information, so I thought I'd add some more noise to the giant archive that is the Internet.  So, in the table that I am building:    BUT, it feels like the bottom/left joint should be vertically aligned, as the longer dimension of the tenon would provide more torque resistance. If I do that, though, there won't be much material left outside of the mortise on top and bottom, so THAT seems stupid.  Am I correct? (As in, is my Sketchup wrong, and the bottom-most board should be rotate 90 degrees?)  Also, I'm unsure of the correct mortise / tenon dimensions when joining two 4x4s. I've seen references to 1/3 of the stock depth, five times tenon length, etc. Most of these seem to be written by and for people who already understand how this works. Much like the EE textbooks in undergrad, such explanations are useless to me.  Help?  My geometry-saturated brain (game developer) tells me to make the tenons 1 3/4"" square and deep and call it a day, but I really don't want to make my wife a new table in 3 years if this sags / cracks / whatever. "
967,Hot Hide Glue Guidelines,"The instructions for my hot hide glue pearls say to keep the temperature at 60Â°C.   How forgiving is the holding temperature? If you overheat the glue, at what point will it break down and lose its ""glueyness""? How long can you cook it for?  How many times can you reheat it (and add more fresh glue)?  "
968,"My new 13"" planer","I had some questions about my new planer I got as a gift.   1) Sharpening the blade How many times could I sharpen the blade before it becomes inaccurate. I was thinking once, maybe twice. But I a sure that somebody has done it and has a good idea on that.   2) The belt I already ran into a problem. The company does not seem to directly sell the belts for the planer. So what size is typical or what kind of belt do they use?  3) Greasing the gears This was recommended in the book. But how often do I need to do this. And better yet, I do not know what kind of grease to use with this kind of stuff.  4) Grain direction I know you want to go with the grain. But what if I where to say make a board that had to be feed cross grain. Any way to make it safer? I was thinking just make shallow cuts. Which I already do at 1/32 of a inch at a time.  Well to be honest I really do not have any other question as of now. But anything that you have to recommend to me with this new planer, since it is my first one. Thanks! "
969,Creating a mount for Hitachi SB8V2 belt sander?,"I recently got a new Hitachi SB8V2 belt sander and am an aspiring woodworker wanting to do various small projects around my house. I don't have the space or budget to get a disc sanding table (or equivalent), but I have seen several articles/videos about making a mount/harness for a belt sander to turn it into one, which seems like a very appealing idea to me.    Trouble is, all the videos I've found on the topic make one of the two following assumptions:   Your belt sander has a flat surface on its side. Your belt sander has holes to mount it to something else.   Unfortunately, this Hitachi sander has neither. Both sides are curved and neither side has screw holes that I can see that might allow me to mount it to something.  I've been trying to brainstorm an alternative mounting solution and have been unsuccessful so far, so I wanted to ask here to see if anyone has a similar sander (or equivalent) that they've built a mount for, and if so, how you did it.  For reference, here's a YouTube search results that show various methods for mounting other sanders: [website]I've watched the top 15-ish results and nothing mentioned there looks like it would work with my sander.  Would love any and all ideas!  NOTE: Looking for creative suggestions for mounting this sander, not suggestions for returning the sander and buying another one. "
970,Veneer sheet stability and properties,"I have a simple lampshade design, on the picture is made out of paper: , it's a basic truncated cone from a single sheet of paper.   I want to make the same lampshade from veneer sheet. I do understand that veneer wouldn't probably allow to bend as much as my needed curvature radius of 2 cm. So I'll probably replace the figure with a truncated 3-sided pyramid, with sides interlocked like puzzles. I've got the idea from [website]My question is: veneer sheets on sale here in Ukraine look like this:    How do I make them nice straight and stable like this:  Second question: Typical thickness of veneer on sale is 0.6 mm. Can I expect much light to go through? What's the most transparent wood from commonly available oak/beech/maple/ash?  "
971,White spots on ash wood," I'd just sanded down the lacquer from my guitar, which worked pretty well. After a control of the surface I saw some white rough spots as you can see in the following pictures:     As far as I know it's ash wood. The spots only appeared after longer sanding these areas.  Now I have two questions: 1. What have I done wrong? 2. How can I remove these spots?  I looked at this question but it didn't really help me... Thanks for you help! "
972,Can polyurethane be used outdoors?,"I get Minwax polyurethane and it is oil based, indoor use. But I have some projects that will be used outside, couldn't I use the stuff I have without having to buy spar urethane? I am thinking it will work because it is oil-based. Water wouldn't be able to remove it very easily. So why is it indoor use only? "
973,Can the finish be different on joined pieces,"I'm making a table utilizing plywood as legs and solid ash wood as a tabletop. I plan on lacquering plywood and oiling the tabletop. 1) Should I be wary of oil interacting with lacquer at join line?  2) I need quite strong connection -- the tabletop is cantilevered, so I'm going to glue wood to plywood. My understanding is that I should glue first and finish after - am I right?   "
974,Is it important to minimize volume of duct in a dust collection system?,"Edited To Add:  The main thing I am asking here is whether it is beneficial to have blast gates that close off as much of the unused dust collection branches as possible. I will already have blast gates closed at the tools at the end of every branch. Is it beneficial to also have a blast gate that closes off an entire unused branch at the point it branches? I'd be closing off about 20 feet of 4"" PVC duct. If it will improve performance of the dust collector, is it something where I'll really see a noticeable improvement in dust collection at the tool being used, or is it just a few percent that I probably won't really notice?     Original question:  I built some blast gates to put on the main branches of my dust collection system. My goal was to close off the entire volume of that branch so the dust collector doesn't have to evacuate its air when I'm trying to use a tool on a different branch. However, I've run into a problem. Long story short, at the location I'd intended to install at one of the blast gates, there is a conduit blocking the path of the gate. I wouldn't be able to close it.   I have some ideas on how I might fix this. I can use a different style of blast gate, or I might be able to scoot the whole main branch over. However, before I go to that trouble, I'm wondering how important these gates actually are. My dust collection has three main branches (simplified for the purpose of this question): the Radial Arm Saw Branch, the Planer Branch, and the duct to the dust collector. My plan was to be able to close off the entire Radial Arm Saw Branch and the entire Planer Branch when those branches aren't in use. One way to fix this is, instead of closing off the entire branch, I could put the gates at the tools themselves.   My gut tells me it won't work as well. If I close off the entire branch, it will be a smaller volume of space for the dust collector to evacuate. But I'm not sure about this. Maybe if the tools on that branch are closed off, it won't really be much more work because no air will be moving along that duct?  Will closing off as much of the unused branches as possible make the dust collector do its job better and collect more dust from the tool that is open? If so, will it be by a noticeable amount? Or will it mostly not matter as long as the branch is closed off at the end?    Here's a diagram of my duct and where I planned on putting the gates. Instead of putting them here, I could just move them closer to the tools.    The self-cleaning style blast gates I built. Note that when closed, half of the sliding gate will be above the duct:    But that won't work as-is, because there is conduit above the duct:    (For the record, I did check for obstructions before I started hanging duct... but I checked at the other end, which is perfectly clear. I didn't check exactly where I wanted the gates. Whoops.) "

976,Oak veneer finishing,"I just brought an oak veneer to decorate my apartment. (picture 1) However the colour is too white and I want to make it a little bit yellow as in the next picture.   What would be the right wood finish for this? Should I use oil, wax or oil-based polyurethane?  Thanks!!     "
977,What happens to kiln-dried wood when it's exposed to moisture?,I have no experience with wood and just started reading a book by Haun Larry.   Let's take an example. What happens when it rains and an under-construction house doesn't have a roof yet. Do any special measures should be taken to protect wooden parts from rain? Or there's nothing to worry about and work can be resumed as normal after rain is over? 
978,"Is it appropriate for an 8 year-old to act as a 'helper,' ripping sheets on a table saw?","Serious question. I know of a child who at eight years old was instructed to help the operator of a table saw guide large (8 X 4 foot) plywood sheets through it. Neither operator nor child were wearing any safety equipment, such as eye protection. Child has no previous experience operating power equipment and very limited experience with woodworking. Table saw is over 20 years old, and it is unclear what safety features it has, if any. Operator believes this was safe and appropriate, because child was holding edge of plywood furthest from the blade.  What does the community here think? Is there ever an occasion in which a young child should be allowed to help with a table saw in such a manner? What could go wrong?  Edit: Operator has provided the below diagram and photo to support the idea that this was safe and appropriate. Could you also provide specific feedback based on this? It's not certain the representation is accurate, but let's assume it is.  Edit 2: Operator has stated that he enlisted child because he could not perform the job alone, specifically because he needed someone to hold the plywood ""so that it would not bind the table saw blade."" Also that child did not want to help, because he was scared, but operator made him help anyway.  Edit 3: It sounds like context is pretty important here, specifically how much one can trust the operator to do the right thing. I've tried to avoid biasing the question by mentioning for example that the child is my own, or that the operator had also recently poured gasoline on an open fire (which resulted in the can itself catching fire as well as a secondary fire), or that the operator keeps insisting these are both perfectly safe and appropriate. But it sounds like it's not possible to separate the judgment of the operator from this question.     "
979,"How do I duplicate large fretwork, brackets and corbels? Plywood and CNC?","I need to replicate 12 Victorian 1.75 inch thick 2 foot x 4 foot ornate triangular porch brackets, plus some corbels and other details. My idea was to glue 2 or 3 layers of marine grade plywood together and have a CNC machine mill them. Then I read the only difference between marine grade plywood and regular plywood is there are no voids, but I'm okay with using some wood putty in voids if it will save me $900.  Will plywood be okay outdoors if I paint it? Or will it fall apart? Should I buy MDO instead? The look i important as well -- will the edges look like wood or like layers of plywood? Is there another option I'm not thinking of?  Difficulty: it's a ""historic"" home so I can't use any non-historic material like PVC. But it's an 1865 home and plywood was invented in 1865 so technically it should be allowed... "
980,Making a Wooden Vise (or wooden screw thread),I want to build a moravian workbench. I am trying to decide between a wooden screw from Lake Erie ([website]Does anyone have any experience with cutting threads in relatively large dowels.  Are any kits better than others? Should I just buy the Lake Erie pre-fabbed vise? 
981,Pre-conditioner on seep through stain?,I'm staining a table and some stain got through between the boards of the table when I did the other side. Should I pre-condition over the stain that seeped through?  Sand down that stain a bit first and then pre-condition?  Just not pre-condition?  I should note that as soon as we saw that stain (while the stain on the other side was drying) we wiped it off immediately - so it shouldn't have set it much.  Thanks in advance!     
982,Can all whetstones be cleaned?,"I got a new (new to me, appears very old) whetstone today, and was told generally how to use it. I need to sharpen my son's knife, who at 9 years old has much more woodworking (whittling) experience than I.   My question is, because I don't know the history or source of the whetstone in question, can I still clean it the same as I might any others, without detriment to the stone or to the blade?  I am trying to learn as much as I can about sharpening so I don't ruin my son's blade, or worse his experience. I learn from various sources (including [website]I read that some are dry only, others are water only, others are oil only (the stone in question was treated with gun oil to demonstrate prior to me receiving it), and so I am concerned that dish detergent may not be best for all whetstones. On the other hand, I am not clear on what results of suboptimal whetstone cleaning might actually have on the ability of the tool to function properly, or on the knife itself, if any.   Can they all be safely cleaned the same way? "
983,Can I fix this whetstone?,"I have a whetstone that I was given, but it has very shallow dips in its surface; it is no longer level. Can I fix it, or should I just get a new one? is there a way to level a whetstone again?  "
984,"Wood table treated with raw linseed oil, how to speed up drying?","After sanding my wood table with sandpaper grit 80, 180 and finally 240, I applied a first layer of a mixture of 25% turpentine and 75% raw linseed oil, then two layers of 100% raw linseed oil.  After 48 hours the table shows no signs of drying. I realize that I should have used turpentine or other drying agents on all layers, but it's too late.  Is there anything I can do to speed up the drying process? Would sanding it again with a very fine sandpaper (grit 240?) help? Wiping off excess oil with a cloth lightly soaked in turpentine? Adding a layer of beeswax? Any other tip? "
985,How often should I sharpen?,"I find many different suggestions for length of time between sharpening, from before and after every whittling session to once every 2-3 years. I assume that many of these suggestions are talking about different applications, tools, and even using terms wrong (honing or stropping vs. sharpening).   Is it possible to quantify how often I should sharpen a whittling knife?  I realize the best answer is, 'when it feels dull', but my 9 year old son is doing the whittling and is not yet experienced enough to know the difference. Sharpening is my job, but I don't have any woodworking experience.   Is it possible to say a certain number of days/months/years, a certain number of minutes/hours of actual woodworking, an approximate number of strokes in the wood, certain number of projects or times per project, a table or multiplier by wood type for increasing or decreasing the sharpening frequency, or some other measuring guideline? "
986,How to store/dry freshly cut lumber (white oak),"I have a very old (approx 200 years) white-oak that is going to be cut down in the next few months. There is a mobile mill that is going to come out and help me cut it in to boards. I will likely end up with a variety of 1-in and 2-in boards that are between 6 inches and 24 inches wide.  I'm aware that I don't want to start using these for woodworking projects immediately, but where and how should I store/dry them?  I have a shed that serves as my shop and it would be possible to store some of the wood in there. Is stacking the wood on blocks (to keep it off the ground) and covering with a tarp a reasonable answer? How should I properly space the wood while it dries? How long does it need to dry before I can use it?  "
987,What is the minimal spacing between edge of leg pommel and mortise and tenon apron (intersected by tusk tenon),"I would like to balance aesthetics and strength for a craftsman-style tusked tenon table frame. Are there rules of thumb to determine how close to the leg corner an apron should be?  (as a preamble, I should mention I'm working with construction grade lumber)  A tenon within a tenon  The particular construction I'm shooting for has one tenon passing through another tenon. And I feel this might require larger margins around mortises to prevent splitting failures in the leg's pommel (i.e. the upper part).  For a visual reference, I am trying to lay out the mortises in the piece (D) from the following picture, and I would like to know how to pick safe lengths for X, Y, Z (in green):    For assembling, piece (C) goes through the leg first, intersected by the other tenon piece (B), and finally locked in with one tusk on each leg. I am planning on chamfering the part of (C) which protrudes on the outer side of the leg.  My personal opinion is that it looks best if the mortises are off-center relative to the leg, closest to the outermost corner of the leg.  Additional details on the objective  The assembly plan above is accompanied with a FRONT+SIDE view diagram where all mortises appear to go through the center (i.e. not offset), as well as a picture where they clearly are offset. Those discrepancies and oversights seem to be par for the course in most of the project-books I've looked at this far. Is this only a matter of personal taste?  I'm trying to to something like the plan, without the lower shelf. In the absence of the shelf and lower rail, the ""meat"" (Z) between the top of the leg and the top of the mortises becomes more important. I'm doing this in thick pine stock (aprons are long 1.5""x3.5"", and legs are roughly 3""x3"").     Most other table plans I've seen place the outside face of the aprons very close, maybe 1/8"", from the leg's corner (which places the mortises a third of the stock further inwards). But that might be a safe layout only for a hardwood leg. I can't assess from my limited experience.  References  Got the project description from this book: ""Tables you can customize. Ernie Conover. published by Popular Woodworking Books. October 1995. ISBN: 1-55870-397-7."" "
988,Wood movement with L-shaped mitred leaning shelf,"I'm doing a built-in for a closet. The closet is over the stairs so its front is sloped. I created an L shaped front and shelf from solid maple. The bottom foot or so is up against the wall that I can screw into. The top surface is hovering, supported by the miter (in the photo there is another shelf sitting on it).  I originally envisioned that the lower shelf would rest on the sloped wall. It currently is but that may change in the summer.  All the fronts are 1.5"" thick. The shelves are 3/4"" thick.  The front is mitered along its top edge and joins the shelf. I used two small pins on the very edges and just glue in between for the miter.  On the underside, I reinforced the miter (with two square 3""x3""x3/4"" pieces at 90 degrees near the sides, plus a long narrower 3'x1""x3/4"" piece of pine in between along most of the length of the miter, glued to the top and the front faces).  The problem I'm not sure how wood movement will affect this structure.  The main front will surely expand by at least 1/2"", more than the shelf will expand inwards. This will cause the shelf to hover. With all the other stuff on top of it, I'm afraid the miter will fail.  I thought about attaching the shelf to the front face on the underside with a larger brace, corner, or even metal strip (going 45 between them). But I'm afraid due to the difference in contraction/expansion, the brace itself will force the faces into each other, breaking the miter.  I'm concerned about attached the shelf to the walls for that reason.  So my question is, is my best bet to go with the flow and just reinforce that miter say with smaller metal brackets (so there is less force from the front's expansion). That way the entire structure will rise as one.  Or should I fight the expansion? For example, I can create 45 degree blocking along the outer edges on the underside of the front. I could then screw those into the wall and screw the front panel into the blocking. That way the front panel will be attached in all four corners  I could also attach the sides that the upper shelf will rest on. If the sides are screwed into the wall, the front face will butt up against them. Would that prevent the front face from moving up? Would the wood bow or warp because the sides are being blocked but the center of the front panel if free to move up?  Additional idea I had was to actually create a 1/2 gap between the bottom part and the top part. The top part can be attached to the walls. Not sure I love this visually. Maybe there's a way to conceal the gap?  Wondering if anyone's done anything similar or has any advice.     "
989,Can I stack wood finished with Danish Oil while it cures?,"This is my first time using Danish Oil.   I'm putting in a pine ceiling and wanted to finish it with this because I love the look and because, it being a ceiling, I don't have to worry about too much wear and tear.  Problem is: I have about 700 square feet to cover (that is a lot of boards). In order to apply and store them correctly, I need a huge space.   Can I stack these on top of one another after I apply the oil?  I would:  A) Apply oil to several boards.  B) Wait for it to penetrate. C) Wipe off excess oil. D) Stack and store so I can move on to the next set of boards.   It's step D that I'm not sure about. Will it damage the finish if I do this?  Any other advice is welcome! Thank you all so much. "
990,How to cut wood to square it up when both sides are not cut straight?,How do I take a piece of plywood that is not square and make it square? I'm new at woodworking.  The sides are not straight which I can tell by just looking at them How do I cut the wood to make it straight when both sides are not straight cuts? 
991,How can I ensure my threaded inserts go in straight?,"I'm putting threaded inserts into a MDF base.  When I start to screw the insert in, the thread digs in at an angle and pulls the entire insert in at that angle.  I thought it would straighten out when it got further down the hole, but it still managed to go in kattywompus.  Now, the knob and bolt look like some tower in Pisa.  What tricks can I use to ensure a threaded insert goes in straight?  Is this just a problem because I'm using MDF instead of hardwood? "
992,What features to look for when buying a router lift?,"I recently discovered the existence of a thing called a router lift, in answers to this question.  I'm intrigued and would love to get one.   A bit of internet research later, and I see there is quite a bit of variety, not only in price, but in basic feature sets.    Assuming I would like to purchase (rather than construct) a lift, what features seem to be important to you?  For instance:   Do I need a ""quick change"" ring to facilitate bit changes? Do I need to be able to lock the lift to a particular height? Does a flex-shaft controller (that I can attach to the side of the router) work better/worse than a screw controller (that means I have another hole through my insert plate? Others?   If it is important to answering the question, I have a DeWalt 625 plunge router (as long as my frustration with fine-setting bit heights hasn't caused me to throw it through the workshop wall).  My router usage: finger/dovetail joints, chamfers/roundover/edge decorations, picture frames, etc.  I tend to use the smaller bits (i.e. not panel work). "
993,How to deal with wood expansion when combining with a steel frame?,"Are there good general techniques to deal with wood expansion when combining it with a steel frame?  For the sake of argument, say we're building a metal and wood box where the metal comprises the frame of the box, but the wood comprises the panels (and assume that we're not using plywood or some sort of expansion resistant composite.)  How do we attach the wood to the steel in such a way where expansion isn't a problem?  With pure wood, we could cut a slot and float the panel, but I'm not sure what the extension of this to steel is.  Adding a slot to welded square tubing seems difficult. "
994,How to oil/treat a solid beech table top that will be used as a computer desk?,"I just got a GERTON table top which is made of solid beech. In the instruction they says:     Apply a thin coat of BEHANDLA wood treatment   oil. Leave the   oil to penetrate the wood for about 2 hours. Wipe off surplus oil with   a cloth or kitchen paper. During the first week of use the table top   should be treated every second day and after that every third day   until the surface is saturated (after about 2 months). Then treat the   surface as required.   But in the BEHANDLA instructions they say:     Apply BEHANDLA with brush or pad in a thin, even film. Leave to   penetrate the surface for approx. 15 minutes. Wipe off any unabsorbed   oil with a soft cloth. Let the surface dry and repeat the oil   treatment 1-3 times in accordance with the absorbency of the wood.   I will solely use the table as a computer desk.  My question is, which set of instruction should I follow?  Also, is there another (better) alternative for my use? The color of the table top is fine as is and I prefer matte surface finish over glossy finish. "
995,Which type of drill bit for which jobs?,"I was looking at a 35 piece wood drill bit set in an online shop    Although only Forstner bits are present for larger size holes, the size ranges overlap so ..  If I want to drill a 10mm hole I have a choice of   Forstner bit Auger bit Flat bit Spur-tipped drill   Under what circumstances would I choose which bit? and why? "
996,Maximum size for an unsupported bench,"I intend to make a number of simple wooden benches in the near future.    However, my aim is to make a wider bench capable of seating four across - pew style. Can I reliably assume that the same plan will work with a width of 80-96 inches? What kind of bowing might occur? Might they break? "
997,Edge jointing end grain cutting board strips with a power jointer,"I used to plane the edges of the wood strips I cut using a hand plane, but I've got a new benchtop power jointer and wanted to use it as it would be much easier and accurate.   I am in the process of creating some cutting boards and wanted to use the small jointer I have to straighten up the edges of the strips I cut. I dont think it will be an issue doing it for the first set of cuts as I can plan with the grain.   My questions are:   Would the edge jointing go smooth across the grain, which is the resulting strips after the second set of cuts, like the ones in the below pic? I used to do the same with the hand plane and didn't have issues there.      Would you use a jointer on end grain?   Edit I meant a jointer like the one in the following photo:   "
998,What is the difference between a dead center and a live center?,I am getting way ahead myself and looking at plans and examples of treadle lathes. One in particular was talking about his dead centre and how it was not as good as a live centre for his treadle lathe (which he states is due to friction).   Image still (of a dead centre) from linked video  My related and hopefully not too broad questions are  what are live and dead centres? What are the functional differences between a live/dead centres? Would there be a practical reason to choose one over the other?  
999,Food safe potting/knot filling compound,"I recently made an end grain cutting board. Unfortunately I didn't pay enough attention during the glue up and I have a couple of knots/knot holes that go through the board. The largest hole is roughly 0.5"" in diameter on one side and 0.125"" on the other. The board is ~1.25"" thick.   Typically I pot these kinds of holes with super clear epoxy and occasionally add saw dust or something if I want to match the wood color.  Given the application, I'm hesitant to use any old epoxy.  I've read a lot of threads (including on this forum) about different food safe adhesives/finishes/etc.  I've seen everything from      all epoxies are food safe once fully cured    to      never use epoxy     Other threads mention PVA glues, CA, and hide glue.  I don't think any of those are good solutions for filling a hole as large as the one I'm describing.  It seems like FDA CFR 175.300 is the most stringent regulation for food safe coatings/adhesives.  Wondering if there are any recommendations for a clear potting compound (doesn't have to be epoxy) that conforms with  FDA CFR 175.300 and would be good for this application. "
1000,How can I repair my broken drawer runners?,"I have under-bed dresser drawers that use two under-drawer metal runners with ball bearings. However, all of the runners are broken or missing their ball bearings.   I've considered fixing the drawers to use side mounts but there's not enough space.  My goal is to replace them with these Home Deopt 18 in. Slides, one per drawer, placed on their side underneath the drawer.  I was also thinking of using Lowes Richelieu 22.75-in Drawer Slides, one per drawer, upside down on the top of drawer to prevent the drawer from tipping when opened.  I am not sure if I also need rubber bumpers or felt in front since these are self-closing.  Has anyone done anything like this? "
1001,Removing black stuff from polishing pads,"I have just bought a polishing pad &amp; sheepskin wool pad from Festool and have used them to clean up my table saw top. Now they are both covered in black stuff.   Is there a best way to remove it and also, is it ok to use the same pads on wooden surfaces? Or do I now need to get a new set just for wood and leave the other ones to metal?  Note: I used a Festool cutting compound on the polishing pad. "
1002,How to choose an epoxy?,"The question is spurned by the fact that I've got a good deal of olive-wood scrap from creating utensils. I'd like to epoxy it all together and then turn a bowl out of them. In looking at epoxy, there are a lot of options along a fairly wide distribution of price points.  So, what should one look for in an epoxy for this use? Does anything change if looking to add color/dye to the epoxy? Are any epoxies considered food safe at the end of the day?   Edit to add: The scrap size is mostly 1.5""x.75""x.5"" (about a handful) and some larger pieces going up to 3""x2""x.75"". It is my plan to stack all of the pieces into a Tupperware container, layer in the epoxy, then turn the bowl. In the end, the bowl may be about 60-75% wood, 25-40% epoxy.   Thanks! "
1003,Routing With a Dremel,"I'm VERY new to woodworking and don't have a lot of tools. I have a DeWalt Pullsaw, a Dremel, and some various hand tools. I recently got into woodworking because I saw a lot of really cool woodworking projects involving D&amp;D, but now there are other things I'd like to work on.  My biggest issue is I live in an apartment, and even if I didn't, I can't afford expensive tools like a table saw or router. My Dremel is a Dremel 1000, which only has 1 speed, 35k rpms. Every time I've tried to use it to cut the wood I've been working with (birch, both 0.25"" and 0.75""), I've either burned the wood, or in one case, even heated up the bit so much, it melted and snapped in half.  I know I should get a better Dremel, but is the 1000 a lost cause if I just want to cut some small shapes out of the wood? Or do I need a softer wood?  Also, is there a way I can keep my cuts straight using the pull saw? Or will I have to refine them with a hand plane? They always come out wavy and trying to sand them down results in my cut being the wrong size. "
1004,Can I use Teak Oil instead of linseed oil for my needs?,"I have access to reasonably priced linseed oil. However it is cold pressed. Boiled linseed oil is a lot more expensive where I am. Teak oil is in between the two.  I do not want to use pure linseed oil because of the drying time (I heard it can take forever).  Teak oil got my interest because it seems to dry faster and offer better protection.  I will use the oil for furniture I am building for indoors.  My question is:  Can I simply opt for teak oil for the nice sheen, harder finish, better protection and quicker drying time? Is there anything BLO has that teak oil does not? "
1005,pine panels with minor cupping suitable for dovetails?,"I have these 9â-wide, 3/4â-thick pine panels from the bigbox store that i would like to make into a carcass with dovetails.  Such panels commonly exhibit some cupping, but have some spring into them, and can typically be flattened with clamp pressure.  Would they stay flat once joined with dovetails? or does stock need to be absolutely flat from the start?    Photo shows three panels with varying amounts of cupping. A second clamp, if placed in the center, makes them flat again.  Follow-up:  I gave it a go with the panels, based on feedback here. And it's totally fine, plus or minus some adjustments. This was my first attempt at dovetails. Here's a few things I'd not realized until I had to actually do it.  0) A bit more planning on my part would have revealed that the pin board (which was a glue-up panel) also had some cupping in it. So I had to clamp the two boards flat simultaneously while scribing my pin board on the tail board, which did complicate the clamping and marking situation. The tail board was clamped flat with a vise (a workmate), and I was holding the pin board vertically, with a 2x4 clamped on the piece to keep the pin board straight.  1) Depending on the level of cupping in the grain of the tail board, you end up with somewhat weak tail corners. I unfortunately didn't pay attention to that when I did the layout. I designed pins first, but didn't double check where the pins landed before committing to their final shape. I also should have pared more carefully around these fragile corners.   Photo shows two broken tail corners, right on the growth line. I tried glue, but it broke once more in a different spot, then I just accepted my mistake.  2) I put the heartside facing outwards of the box, as was recommended. But I still ended up with a minute gap. I've shone light through the gap here. There is some spring still in it and it won't rest at the bottom without pressure -- maybe my joint can be cleaned up a bit more. I feel it will probably vanish, with clamps and glue-up.   Photo shows a minute gap at the bottom of the pin board.  And the overall look:   Photo shows the overall look, before gluing and planing finished join. A few gaps which I'll try to fix using slivers (Full size). "
1006,Router planing jig problem - tracks,"I put together a simple router planing jig - everything seems level, but as I pass the router over this test board, it leaves a track (as pictured).     You can barely feel it, and hitting the board with an orbital sander real quick seems to touch it up, but I'm concerned that the board will be no good for an end grain block that it is destined for.. though it looks like it might be flush enough.   The bit I'm using is a 2 inch wide bowl bit (flat on the bottom) though I've tried a larger bottom clearing bit and it had the same issue.   So, question - is this to be expected using a router as a planer? If not, is there something in particular that is causing this?  "
1007,What does a hex nut say about the age of a butcher block?,"I just bought an old, thick butcher block (~16â) that has loosened up over the years and I canât determine how old it is.  It does have ~5/8â through rods that have washers and hex nuts on them.    I feel like since it has hex nuts it probably isnât much older than the 50s or so, but thatâs just a gut feeling.    When did hex head nuts become common in furniture?  Is this evidence of the age or is it just too hard to tell from that one data point?  Aside from an obvious mark, what other clues might I look for? "
1008,Making a 25â deep butcher block counter deeper,I am looking to install a butcherblock countertop in my kitchen but can only find 25â depth which is only 1/4â overhang. Can I add a strip of wood to the back of it to widen it?  Or perhaps make a trim around the front?  Best way to do this? 
1009,Solid wood furniture faces expand at different rates?,"I'm a ""weekend woodworker"" (boxes, small shelves/cabinets, stuff like that). Now I'm thinking about replacing one of my wardrobes, and was thinking about doing it myself. The problem is: in Romania, solid wood is actually cheaper than processed wood (MDF, plywood, etc) with veneer faces (because I want an overall natural wood look).  My question is (I didn't find anything concrete searching here or on the internet):  When making solid wood furniture, do I need to worry about the wood cracking because the different faces expand at different rates through-out the year?  More explicitly, if the sides, top, and bottom planks/faces will be screwed to each other, will the planks expand/shrink at different rates, thus making the wood susceptible to cracking at the screws? They, of course, will be from the same type of lumber, with the backing from plywood. But even so, I'm worried one of the planks will expand more/less than the adjacent ones and put a strain on the screws.  I'm thinking about making it either from oak or more possibly walnut, 2m (6.5 ft) height, 1m (3.2ft) width with divider in the middle, and 0.7m (2.3ft) depth. So the faces/planks will be about 2*0.7m (6.5*2.3ft).  Any info/hint you can give me will be much appreciated.  EDIT: Since I am clearly misunderstood: if the grains are running in the same direction, will any of the faces expand more/less than the faces next to it, thus cracking the wood?    (please excuse my crude drawing, I am in a hurry) Thanks.  EDIT2: would it be better if I made my own boards/planks from quartersawn lumber (I can easily get it in 1.8*1.8cm (0.7*0.7in)) with each piece turned 90 deg cw (thus making the grain in each plank run in all directions, which if I understand correctly, will make it more dimensionally stable)? Or would that just be even worse? (elbow grease and tools are not a problem. I have enough tools / friends with tools, and I'm not skittish about work...I actually like working with my hands on projects like this :) )   "
1010,How to prevent joint gaps after applying glue,"The joint between these two boards was very nice, snug and barely visible before gluing. It's about 20"" and has three small biscuits. However, when I applied Titebond and waited about 30 min, when I joined the boards the joint wasn't snug any more. I figure that's because the biscuits didn't fit snugly with the glue.   How do I prevent the glue application from spoiling the snugness of the joint? Could it be because I waited for the glue to dry 30 min before inserting the biscuits? Should I have inserted them when I first applied the glue?   "
1011,Wood Lathe Safety Drive Center: Correct Usage?,"I'm just starting to learn how to use the skew chisel in spindle turning and after watching one of Alan Lacer's videos I decided to invest in a safety drive center, shown below:    He had his students actually practice dig-ins with the safety centers to see what causes the dig-in and to change future behavior to avoid them. The dig-in with the safety center causes the piece to stop turning (with adjustable ""cut-offs""), which is different than what you would see with a spur drive. It seems like a good way to learn.   I do have a question on its use. I know the tension of the pin can be adjusted via the hole on the side of the drive. Do I want any portion of the pin exposed between the cup on the end of the drive and the wood? Or do I always want to tighten the tailstock (which has a live center) such that the cup of the safety center in the headstock presses flush against the end of the wooden piece?   Thanks for comments/direction. "
1012,"Why a 5hp 14"" table saw?","Is a DIYer who works on smaller projects, such as cabinets, desks, lamps, etc., would I have any benefit from owning a 5hp 14"" Powermatic saw? More specifically, it is pretty clear that a saw like this will give me a greater depth of cut. But will it also make it easier to make smaller cuts and will the end result be better? "
1013,Eclipse style honing guide changing blade geometry & preventing tight mouth setting on planes,"I find it much easier to get repeatable sharpening results with a honing guide, but I have noticed that the plane blades I sharpen with my Eclipse style guide are ending up with a different geometry than I want, and it is preventing me closing the mouth on my smoothing plane very tightly.  When looking at the blade from above, the angle between the edge to the long sides is changing, so that the edge is developing a skew. My theory is that this happens because the blade tapers in width measurably along its length (EDIT: approximately 1/16"" over its length), and also because the right jaw on the honing guide is flat and the left is curved. This inherently presents the blade to the stone at a skew to its long axis.    I suppose it is also possible that this is because I am right handed, so maybe I am bearing down harder on the right of the blade without noticing, but the geometry involved seems very suspicious.  The reason this is a problem is that even with the correct lateral adjustment, there's a point where the blade is slightly skewed in the mouth and the mouth can't be closed as much as is recommended on smoothing planes, because one side of the blade is just plain further forward than the other. It also makes it difficult to set the cap iron because then the cap iron needs to be at an angle to the blade's long axis and can interfere with the sides of the plane.  How do other people deal with this issue? Is there something weird with what I'm doing?  EDIT: This is an old Stanley plane blade that is doing this. I compared it to a new retail Stanley plane blade &amp; the new one DOES NOT have a noticeable taper along its length. Did blades change from tapered to untapered at some point? Do I just have a weird blade? It came from eBay.  I also have a Kell honing guide -- but the jaws are both parallel so I'm not sure that would help much, and it seems like it would be a less secure clamp on a tapered blade. "
1014,"Hinge Identification, Usage, and Limitations","I'm currently attempting to make a table that folds in order to be easily stowed away. I'm currently looking at either a Self Supporting Sewing Machine Hinge, a Folding Flap Table Hinge, or Adjustable Folding Door Hinge.   In addition to these, I was hoping to have an elbow style hinge that would be on the outside of my rectangular table the spans the joint where the hinge is on both sides of the table. Ideally it locks at 180 degrees, along with the rest of my hinges.   One of my issues is that I am unsure of the weight limits of these hinges as they are unlisted. Is the best way to determine this to buy them install them in some test wood and stack weight on them until they break? Is there a guide somewhere, or some math I can do to calculate this?  Additionally, for future projects, what's a good way to identify a hinge I see in the wild and its limitations? Other than searching online. "
1015,Lathes and cutting machines: sharpness versus hardness,"As a primary school student I took woodworking classes and recall the teacher sharpening the gouges and chisels that we used on the lathe. I use the word sharpening but that is, perhaps an assumption. He ground and polished the cutting edges of the tools.  Years later in the workshop of a university department, I asked the instrument maker how sharp the cutting tools on the metal lathe needed to be. He said that he thought that hardness, not sharpness, was really the issue with metal lathe cutters, and then simply assumed that I fully understood what I'd been told.  And then yesterday, using a pair of old hair clippers, I caught myself wondering whether they needed sharpening, which reminded me once more of the sharp vs. hard distinction which I never did investigate. Does it make sense to talk about wood-lathe tools as being sharp as distinct from being hard, and vice versa for metal lathe tools? I can think of all sorts of ways in which wood is not like metal (!) but what are the differences that lead to qualitatively (as opposed to quantitatively) different characteristics of the cutting tools? ... and do hair-clippers get sharpened, or does the hardness of the steel versus the softness of hair solve all problems? "
1016,Alternative to Bosch T 308 BOF for tight curve in 18 mm MDF,"I am fairly new to woodworking and I need to cut some hearts in 18 mm MDF - please see the design at the bottom of the post, including a revision inspired by @WhatRoughBeast. The radius of the curve is circa 30 mm and the default blade which came with my Bosch PST 650 is clearly unsuitable. I had a look at the manual - this website contains this direct link to the download, you may notice the link contains the extension .pdf twice but I checked and it works. I included a snippet below anyway, it says I need a ""T 308 BOF"" but these are only pricey and only available online.  My question is, what is the next best blade I can go for?  T 101 AO and T 101 AOF are both for clean curves but only up to 15 mm. I would imagine they can still produce decent results in a slightly thicker sheet - or am I better of with T 244 D, which are in stock in my local Selco, and OK for up to 50 mm but branded ""fast"" as opposed to ""clean""?  My budget is limited and I don't use the jigsaw that much so I don't want to buy a full pack of the wrong blades. I don't mind branded/unbranded - any suggestions would be appreciated.    "

1018,Filling crack in walnut table top,"I'm building a table with the walnut top shown below. (Sorry for the blurry photos).  I think I should fill this 8"" long crack. I need to decide how. I'm considering cleaning up the edges and cutting/carving a piece to insert and sand down. Probably something a little darker. Another possibility is a filler - I've read elsewhere on this site about wood dust mixed into glue.   I'll treat the small crack at the lower right similarly.  My question(s):    What if I just leave it as is? If filler, how do I make ""wood dust"" and what glue (I have titebond on hand)? Any other suggestions?      "
1019,"Can wood be ""dyed"" transparent?","Is it possible to ""dye"" or otherwise treat wood so that is becomes transparent? Or at least, somewhat permits light to pass?  I think I've seen examples of very thin handplane shavings which have a similar 'diaphanous' effect but I'm thinking of a treatment which could be applied to thicker pieces (though not necessarily very thick).

1020,Design: Adjustable/Collapsible Wooden Table Leg,"I'm looking to make a wooden table that has collapsible legs. My current idea is just to have the leg basically fold into itself but I'm unsure how sturdy this would be. This also means that the legs are folding in two places: The joint where the leg meets the table, and again at some point in the leg.   Is this a feasible design? Is there something that would be sturdier while still maintaining collapsibility for storage? What sort of hinge would work for this build?  Edit: Should have mentioned this from the start, but the length and width of the table are both shorter than the height which is why I cant have a simple/solid height sized folding leg.  "

1022,Do you need to countersink self-countsink screws,"New to the forum and a bit clueless when it comes to DIY.  I'll be putting down some new floor boards and then laying subfloor sheet to give a nice even surface.  I'm using 18mm floorboards and 3mm hardboard sheets.  For the floorboards I was going to use 5 x 50mm Goldscrew Woodscrews Double Self-Countersunk screws (image below).  Not sure what screws I'll be using for the hardboard yet.    So my question is, do I need to countersink these screws?  And if I do what size of countersink tool should I use?  Any advice on the type / size of screws to use for the hardboard would be great as well. "
1023,Protective disc between moving pieces of wood,"I have a multi-tiered sewing box that has articulating wooden arms on the outside (the tiers slide out similar to some tackle boxes). I recently re-finished the wood but when I took it apart I noticed these thin felt or paper pads between the sides of the box (at the screw holes) and the arms which I believe were to help with friction and prevent the sides of the boxes from being scratched when opening/closing. Does anyone have ideas of what I could do to replace these? Perhaps just a simple round sticker, or a small piece of felt, or those hole protectors for 3-ring binder pages?  "
1024,Polyurethane rub down problem!,"I'm in the final stages of finishing an oak poker table. I have applied 3 coats of deep mahogany oil, which went on OK but didn't really soak in well after the first coat.  Now I am applying 3-5 coats of polyurethane. After applying the first coat I felt small bumps here and there and so lightly sanded the surface with 400 grit paper. I have a smooth surface ready for the second coat now but I'm left with what looks like poly smudge marks in two places, possibly from pressing too hard, but only enough to smooth out the bumps. And also in a couple of places I have removed stain/oil back to original wood.  A similar thing happened when finishing the pedestal but I continued to finish the poly thinking it would cover it, but it is still viable. I think i can get away with it on the pedestal but not on the main surface of the table.  What is my best course of action here? If I sand back to wood to reapply oil where do I sand back to and how to sand back only the poly so to not remove all the stain? I know in an ideal world it would be take it right back and start again, but this table has a lot of layers/sections with moulding etc. I feel sanding too much will create a knock on effect and have to sand it all, which really isn't practical!

1026,How to choose desirable oak slabs for projects,"I'm new to woodworking and have recently been given the opportunity to pick up free logs of a recently felled oak tree. (I believe logs is the proper term here, correct me if I'm wrong. Cords? Slabs?)   I have been on the hunt for this opportunity for a while as i have been thinking up projects that would take advantage of this opportunity. I want to make a coffee/side table with the widest piece of the trunk, bar stool seats, and maybe some bowl and spoons carving projects while its green as well as anything else i can come up with along the way.  My concern is that i go and move all these big heavy pieces of oak only to realize that the pieces just aren't suitable for what i have in mind. I certainly don't want to waste oak just for being a foolish novice.  Can anyone provide any advice or links on how to pick good large logs/slabs of lumber? Particularly relating to any project i mentioned above?  Picture of the cut tree:   "
1027,Flush trim Router bit question,I have seen the flush trims that are either flat or normal if you will then they have some that are up-cut or down-cut. What is the main purpose with these? what makes them so special compared to a normal flush trim? 
1028,Does a thickness planer's platen need to be absolutely flat?,"I just bought my first thickness planer, a DeWalt DW735.  I received it today and, after I'd broken down and disposed of all the packaging, I noticed what looks like curvature in the mirrored surface of its platen, sort of like a dent in shiny car paint. Sure enough, I could feel some ""waviness"" when I ran my hand over it, and a second check with a level confirmed that one quadrant of the surface has a small hill that rises up to maybe 1/32"" - 1/16"" higher than the rest. The remainder is very flat.  Will this cause any difficulty in achieving good results? Or is there anything I'm not aware of about how a planer works that implies that this might not cause problems? On this model, the platen appears to be made of sheet steel that attaches to a cast aluminum base beneath it, so maybe the sheet steel has enough give that it will flatten against the pressure of the outfeed roller on the material? When I press down on the platen, it does give slightly and appears to flatten out onto the surface of the base beneath it (the flat section of the platen doesn't have any give to it, but this ""bubble"" does). Maybe the material will do the same?  I bought it brand new from a factory-authorized online retailer, so exchanging it is certainly an option (I've already emailed them), but it will be a pain. I can try it out and use the factory warranty if needed, or ask for a replacement base, but the platen and base are sold as a complete unit and do not appear to be user-serviceable so I doubt the latter is a viable option. "
1029,How can I improve my strategy for flush trimming with a router?,I always have trouble with flush trimming. I use clamps to keep the piece in place but it gets in the way.    Is it better to use a table router or a hand router?  Couldn't I use some sort of double sided tape?  How much should I remove of the wood before flush trimming the other thing to it?  
1030,Can I run pressure treated deck boards through thickness planer?,"I inherited a deck with my new house.  I'm thinking about resurfacing the deck because the boards are badly discoloured, although they appear to be structurally sound.    I'm trying to convince myself that purchasing a $500 thickness planer and planing 1/16"" or 1/32"" off the surface of the boards is a better use of funds than just buying new boards.  Will I have problems running 16' deck boards through a planer and will I get a nice result?  Will the pressure treated chemicals, or the years of tree muck adhered to the surface of the boards wreck the planer blades? "
1031,Painting a built in bookcase?,"I'm building a large built-in bookcase system for a home office (floor to ceiling). The bookcase is black walnut plywood with poplar trim and a 1/8"" tempered hardboard backing.  Bookcase will be painted a low gloss white to match the trim in the rest of the house.  I'm assuming two coats of white primer followed by one or two top coats of white, with appropriate prep work between coats. I'd like to do a hand apply with a water based paint, primarily to ease cleanup. I'm not intending to use spray (no good way to deal with overspray here.)  A few questions:   What type of water based paint makes the most sense for durability and ease of application? (Acrylic? Latex? Waterborne Enamel? Waterborne alkyds? Something else?) I've got 2000 drilled holes for the adjustable shelving pins.  The holes were drilled with a plunge router with a downward cutting bit.  The holes are all crisp with no tearout, but they are slightly charred black from the process.       What do you do with regards to painting these holes?  Q-tip dip into paint, then into the hole during the initial priming? Note the holes in the attached image are shown without any post drilling sanding.  The black ring on the surface sands / scrapes off pretty easily.   Anybody been here before?  "

1033,"Using scrapers on ""fuzzy"" woods","Just started using scrapers and I love them. I was looking for questions and thought I would look around the concept of pitfalls and I read this paragraph in regards to sanding:      Sanding that makes the wood fuzzy      Some woods, such as birch, get fuzzy when you sand them too much. The fibers of the wood tear and create hairlike fuzz on the surface of the wood. You don't want to stain or topcoat wood in that condition.      If your wood does get fuzzy, go down a grit or two with the sandpaper (120-grit is a good place to start) and sand out the little furs. The way to avoid fuzzy wood is to make sure you don't sand with a paper finer than 150 grit. And don't use a scraper either.   That final emphasis is mine. I get that sanding can create fuzz due to tearing. That makes sense. Scrapers are supposed to avoid that by slicing the wood instead of gouging it. Why say don't use scrapers then? Are you not suppose to use scrapers on ""fuzzy"" wood?   I never use dummies.com as a solid information resource so if the information there is wrong I won't be surprised. I feel that sentence is misguided or needs to be embellished. "
1034,Beach chair reclining arm mechanism,"I'm attempting to build a set of reclining beach chairs for my in-laws, but I can't identify the mechanism that's used on the arms to recline the back. Google searching hasn't been very helpful (all I can find are the chairs themselves, no parts).  Looking at the mechanism, it seems like I could fabricate one at home, but it would be pretty tedious. Does anyone know what this thing is called? Or better yet, where I can find them?      "
1035,Mortise and tenon joint proportions for 3 wooden beams corner,"I'm designing a cabinet with drawers and I would like to use 60mm (roughly 2 and 3/8"") wide beams for the frame. The frame with one side panel visible looks like that:    I would like to use mortise and tenon joints as they seem like a simplest solution and are relatively easy to cut. The problem is I'm not sure how to size them. You can find multiple rules for such joints in the internet, one of them being (this is from Christopher Schwarz):   tenon's thickness should be one third the thickness of the stock being mortised tenon's length should be 5 times its thickness tenon's width should be half the width of the stock you're cutting it in   This doesn't make a lot of sense in my situation, because one third of 60mm is 20mm and 5 times that is 100mm, which is longer then the beam width. And even if the beam was wider there won't be as much place, because there will be 2 horizontal beams connected to the vertical beam. I found three simple ways to do the joint in such situation:  1) Making ends of both tenons slanted:    2) Cutting a through dado in one of the tenons:    3) A variation of the second joint:    Would any of these joints be suitable for the situation? What would be best proportions then? I can't find any good source of information on joining beams in such a way. If any other type of joint (dovetail?) is more suitable for such situation, I'd love to hear about it too. "
1036,Is making a breadboard table top using just pocket joinery asking for future problems?,"I like pocket holes as it is a simple and easy method of joinery. I ran into plans for a farmhouse table that is nearly solely built with pocket holes. The following is the step where the table top is made. This showcases the use of pocket holes and the top's overall design.     Image from ana-white.com  Now, I have seen in several places warnings in regards to breadboards and several suggestions to mitigate inevitable wood movement.   Is this design begging for future problems? Are those problems minor and the top should be just fine? "
1037,How do I sharpen curved tools like gouges?,My uncle gave me a set or carving gouges and chisels that he was not going to use anymore. They need to be cleaned as they have a little bit of rust on them.   More importantly they look like they could use a sharpening before I start using them. Based on other questions I have a good grasp of how to sharpen flat tools but how does that play out with curved tools? The blades of moudling planes come to mind as well. Some of them have very complex forms.   What tips and tricks do I need to know when sharpening curved edge tools? I don't want to have to remove too much material to make up for mistakes.   I don't feel this question really covers this topic: How to hand-sharpen a badly worn gouge? 
1038,Recommended technique for applying oils,I'm not sure if different oils have wide varying techniques as far as application goes. Yes some might take longer to cure/dry but I figure in general the approaches are the same. If I am wrong then this question is meant to have a focus for Boiled Linseed Oil(BLO).  I am just getting into finishes and experimenting with BLO. I am trying to figure out the ideal method for applying it to wood. I don't know how much of this could be covered in one question or should be separated. The points I am looking to cover are   How do I know if a coat is thick enough? How do I know if coat has set/cured? How long between coats? How many coats am I suppose to use? Should I apply something to the wood before the oil? In the case of BLO: Does the smell go away over time? Is it an indication of something?  
1039,Should you always use Pre-Stain?,"I've read that wood conditioner (also known as pre-stain) helps prevent blotching, but it 'designed' for use with soft or porous wood.  I've got an 80x36x1"" red oak panel that I think I'm going to stain. Red Oak is not considered a soft wood, but would Pre-Stain help my staining project turn out more uniform anyways?  Furthermore, if I change my mind on staining, but still wish to do a poly coat, does Pre-Stain do anything beneficial for that? "
1040,"Cut, then Sand? Or Vice-versa","I have a rough-sanded red oak panel (120 grit). I need to make a small circular cut with a jigsaw for a grommet. I plan on sanding the panel with 150, then 180 grit, in preparation for either staining and sealing, or just sealing.  I was planning on using blue painter's tape on the panel, and some on the foot of the jigsaw, to help prevent any scratching.  Should I cut this hole before doing my 150 and 180 sanding? The hole is about 100mm (3.9"") in diameter.  I worry that I'll get better sanding results without the hole in the way, but that I could have to re-do some sanding if the foot of the jigsaw scratches the surface.  Which is the tried-and-tested best practice here? "
1041,Why a zero clearance insert?,I sometimes see woodworkers talking about a zero-clearance insert for their table- or band-saws.   What is it? And why/when should I use one? 
1042,What common woods produce the safest/most harmful dust?,"I inherited a bunch of my tools from an woodworker who had developed a severe lung condition due in part to sawdust.  I've had lung problems my whole life so have been mindful of this via dust collection and masks.  However, after learning about different woods I'm realizing some are more dangerous than others.  Exotic woods in particular can cause severe allergic reactions, but even common woodworking woods like black walnut produce shavings that will kill plants if you mulch it into your garden.  Cedar has a number of great anti-microbial and anti-insect properties, but do those very properties carry allergy risks for people, too?  Pressure-treated lumber is bad due to the chemicals injected into them.  Given adequate dust collection and so on, which commonly woodworked woods are most allergy-safe?  Which are the worst? "
1043,How to hinge a piece of wood for an up/down configuration?,"I'm making a simple sit/stand base for a monitor and keyboard--something similar to the one this guy made.   A few questions:  Are there any other hardware options besides two rods bolted to the wood top and wood base? Any hardware to get it to lock at all different positions?   Is there a way to make the wood sit closer to the desk, in the lowered position ?  What type of wood does one use for something like this?  This design can not be attached to the desk in anyway. "
1044,How can I enclose the top of my contractor table saw for better dust collection?,"I have a contractor table saw that I want to seal up for better dust collection. I have a good idea for how to close in the back and other holes, but I'm not quite sure what to do about the area where the sides meet the top.    Source: me  The underside of the cast-iron top is fairly irregular here. Will this have much effect on dust collection? How can I seal this area to get better suction near the blade? I'll be using a 1.5 hp collector with 4"" hose, with the port directly under the blade. "
1045,Should router bits be stored with the gel coating that came on them when they were originally purchased?,"My straight router bit came in a little plastic box that has a hole that the shaft of the bit fits into.  The other half of the bit (i.e. with the two cutting edges) was covered in some transparent gel. From the way the gel looks it is obvious that the gel was applied in liquid form and then cured on/around the bit.  I suspect that this gel is there to seal the bit from air, especially moist air, to prevent corrosion. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Does it make sense to reapply the gel when storing the bit?  I found many images of bits being stored without such gels in simple wooden boxes. Does it depend on the bit? Hardening steel changes its properties possibly making it more prone to corrosion. Does it depend on the material of the bit? "
1046,How do I prepare and take care of a wooden countertop?,"I got a piece of acacia that was already oiled. I cannot specify what kind of acacia that is.  I cut it to size and sanded the surface smooth. As the sanding removed parts of the oiled wood, I applied some linseed oil (It was some left over from a can of oil bought from ikea. Called ""behandla"" and labelled ""linseed oil"". It is still available.)  I applied oil until the wood wouldn't soak it up any more. After that I let it sit for a few days with puddles of oil on the surface.  I wiped off the excess.  However, as soon as I first wiped the countertop with a wet cloth, it soaked up the water (I could clearly tell from the smell). The surface that was very smooth after sanding got rough again. The fibers of wood are noticeable on the surface.  It's not a problem for me, the wood looks rustic anyway.  Because this was the first time I ever did this, I would like to know:   Should I apply more oil? I wonder how, because the wood soaked up as much as it could Can I get the surface permanently smooth by sanding and applying oil again? Wood is a natural material after all, that takes and gives humidity. Maybe it was dry and just needed a bit more water. Or maybe I have to adjust my expectations of what's possible with wood as a material? How do I keep the oil in the wood? I noticed that when I put something heavy on the countertop, the surface of the wood becomes oily. I think this is because the applied pressure forces the oil out of the wood  "
1047,How to remove dust after sanding before applying paint/oil/glue?,"Before one can paint a piece of wood, it should be clean from any dust on its surface.  What is the recommended way to remove the dust?  I tried using   a hand brush, which only got rid of the rough bits and pieces a vacuum, which worked great for the most part, but did not remove the very fine dust. The suction could cause the nozzle to bump into the surface and leave scratches a glue soaked cloth (called ""tack cloth"") from the hardware store, which was intended for exactly that purpose and got the job done. Working with it was not very nice though, reusability is questionable and who knows what kind of stuff is used to make it sticky.   I guess that a wet cloth has similar sticky properties than the aforementioned shop bought cloth, but has the disadvantage of applying moisture to the wood (leading to warped wood).  Is there a better/recommended way to do this? "
1048,How to make a louver vent in a board?,"I'm planning to make a couple of houses for owls and bats around my property to help control vermin. I've been looking on youtube.com at the owl houses and being one of those people who tend to go a little overboard with detail, I see all kinds of things I don't like. I saw one woman build an owl box where she designed the top with vents that would literally direct rainfall down into the box. I also saw lots of other things I didn't like, such as screws in the roof that will allow an entry point for water and many other things.  I'd like to put vents up the side, but I don't want rain running in. To accomplish this, I'd like to make them angle up into the box at a roughly 30-45 degree angle. I'd like to know the best way to do this. My first thought is to take a circular saw and set the angle on its blade. I'm not sure if mine is capable of that or not. I also have access to a table saw. It seems like it'd be simple to set the angle and cut a line, but how do you get the blade into the board? You can easily make and interior cut with a table saw or circular saw by setting it down into the board, but at an angle, it doesn't seem like it'd work the same. Can anyone tell me how to do this?  Again, these are just vent holes, probably about 5-6"" long in a 1""x10-12"" board. I don't want to make straight cuts and then add an angled vent on the outside as it won't last and will be a week spot. I'm basically wanting to add a few angled slots and inch or two apart. Thanks for the help.  Edit: Here is a mock up of what I'm trying to do. Let me know if it's not clear and I'll try to do better.   "
1049,"Are drain holes in a wooden bird house necessary, and if so, what's the best way to make them?","I'm asking a few wood working question in relation to an owl box I'm making to put on my property. My question is about drain holes in this and any bird box.  I've always put drain holes in bird houses I've made, because they've called for them. However, they don't make much sense to me. It seems like any bedding or nesting material would absorb any pee, and there wouldn't be enough to need draining. I'd also think that general debris would clog any drain holes.  Firstly, do you guys think that drain holes are necessary? The only real use I can think of is that they might be for any rain that gets in. However, if nesting material and bird crap get in them and clog them up, they wouldn't even drain that. It seems to me that it'd be more important for air circulation to get rid of any toxic fumes like ammonia from the pee and to evaporate any liquids.  Secondly, if you think they are necessary, how do you recommend doing them. Would you just use holes, slots, or like some I've seen, would you chamfer the corners of the bottom so you have a vent on each corner? Will any liquid even run to these vents or would you need to work the wood to have some kind of slope to direct it to the corner holes? Thanks for the help. "
1050,How do I make a wooden garter/captive washer?,"I wish to build a tail vise using the Shop Fox D3258 Bench Screw (Link to Amazon).  This bench screw comes with the screw itself and the cast-iron mount for moving the block in the table, however it does not come with a way to secure the handle to your bench, presumably because there are so many potential ways of executing the mounting.   Someone mentioned in a forum elsewhere that one could fashion a wooden washer to hold the piece in place, but I'm not sure how one would execute that.  My question is: given an inner diameter of approximately 1"", with a slot approximately 1/4"", what is the best way to produce a washer or garter out of hardwood that could hold the bench screw from unscrewing out of the vise?  Should I get 1/4"" stock, jigsaw two crescents and then screw them together over the slot in the bench screw? "
1051,How does one make a perfect circle on a table saw?,"I have seen videos related to cutting circles on a table saw.  I would love to try this but I am hesitant to make a jig that, to me, seems to be extremely dangerous.

1053,How to make large table less springy in the middle,"I needed a workbench for working on stained glass (so no heavy pushing like with hand planing). I took a spare sheet of 3/4"" particleboard with melamine finish on the faces and cut it to 6x3', rounded the corners with a jigsaw and attached 4 IKEA screw on legs that I had from an old table. The legs are very strong but the table seems to be a bit too long for the material and if I press in the middle it bends considerably and springs back to place with a wobble when Iet go. This wouldn't be a problem except that for stained glass I need to do very precise movements and I can't have the thing wobbling on me every time I make a cut.  I thought about installing edging with some scrap pine that I have except that I rounded over the edges and it's going to look ridiculous.   I also thought about adding another set of IKEA legs in the middle but they don't make them anymore.  The last thing I thought about is screwing two strips of pine running parallel to each other, fastened to the underside of the table so that you wouldn't see them but I'm not sure if that would work (though it's the same effect as siding, right?)  Any ideas? "
1054,Hinge that extends flap/door so that it is in line with the wood it is mounted to?,"First of just a quick note, I'm struggling to explain exactly  what I'm looking for, so I made a quick image of what I mean.    A new project I'm looking to undertake has me a bit stumped; I want to create a coffee table that has flaps on the shorter of the vertical sides, that fold up and extends the table creating a longer, yet still flat, table.  Now the problem is that I don't want to use just a regular hinge or piano hinge because when the flaps are folded down, there would be a gap between the top and flaps. So of course I tried looking for a solution. At first I thought of European hinges, but when its folded open it doesn't pull back to eliminate the gap between the flaps and table but leaves a gap. So I continued looking for an answer online and found something way better:  [website]Note how when the legs are folded in the table top lies on the flaps/sides. How does one achieve this? Is there a way to have the flaps sides next to the table top instead of under (like in my original idea)? What are the hinges called?  Thanks "
1055,Shelf building questions from a newbie,"Good day all  I want to start building a wooden ""shelf"" of sorts, the problem is that I have literally no experience. So I have been looking at a bunch of youtube tutorials and asking my stepdad for some help (lately he's too busy) and doing some research.  The design is actually really simple: There are two arching side supports with 3 ""shelves"" in the middle. 450mm tall, base radius of 300mm    So the cutting of the curves I'm not worried about (I got a stencil and a jigsaw at the ready) what I was wondering was if I could use wood glue and dowels to secure everything together? Or would it be better to stick to screws?  Secondly; I was thinking of using pine, but in my research found out that it is a very soft wood, would this be okay provided it would only carry small light objects (Keys, pens, rubiks cubes, Nicolas Cage bobble head)? What would be a better alternative taking into account that I want to use a light (colour wise, not weight) wood?  And lastly; What sealer do I use? I saw that there really isn't one correct answer for this. What I want is a clear, dry curing layer to protect the wood and keeps its colour. So an acrylic lacquer maybe?  Thanks for helping the noob "
1056,Table Saw Challenge: Making a Sled for a 2' Circle,"Intro  I only have a table saw, no band saw. I do have a jig saw, though. I have a 2' x 2' square of glued white oak that I wish to make into a circular table top.  I've seen articles and posts about getting a near circle with a sled/jig. I believe this is by rough cutting and then making many passes tangent to the blade. I'm fine with it not being perfectly smooth, but just dimensioned correctly enough that I can sand it with a belt sander.  It seems to me this is a feasible idea. I'm comfortable around the table saw even with safety guards removed.  My Question  So  what is the best construction for such a sled?  My 10"" blade will only come up 3"" and my material is 1.5"" thick, so the sled cannot exceed 1.5"" itself. Being a tabletop, I'm not concerned with any holes within the inner 6"" or so of the bottom of the piece.  Here's my table saw:    One thing that concerns me is my slot for the runner is fairly close to the blade. But I guess, a solid cross cut sled runner will hold it tight for several feet out?    I'm not asking any of these questions:  What is a crosscut sled used for?  How does one make a perfect circle on a table saw?  How do I use a cross-cut sled safely?  I'm asking about how to construct a quality and safe sled/jig that will still meet my specific needs. If there is another method on the table saw that is not how I described at the start, I'd love to hear that as well. "
1057,hand plane controls (bevel down),"I finally got a decent craigslist haul of a #4, #5 1/4, #6 Stanley Bailey and a bunch of spare blades.   I have been searching online and can find explanations for each of the adjustments.  But I am having a hard time understanding how they interact together.  For example, moving the frog back is for taking larger shavings and less figured wood.  Moving it up is for smaller shavings and more figured woods.    A similar logic applies with the chip breaker.    Would you ever use the chip breaker really opened up but with a tight mouth? Or the opposite?  Also what is the point of this lateral adjustment lever, is that just in case you want to take non-perpendicular shavings?  One other aspect is how the blade extension interacts with the chip breaker and the mouth opening.

The finish will be a stain + oil/varnish. "
1063,How can I design a large speaker cabinet to come together square and true when my panels aren't flat and my boards aren't straight?,"This question differs from similar questions about wood warping because I'm not asking how to straighten a warped board nor how to fix an existing design that warped.  Rather I'm asking how do you design at the outset for a large enclosure to come together square and true even if the boards and panels you have available are not straight or flat.  I'm also wanting to know if there is an order of assembly that will maximize accuracy or minimize how much correcting force is needed.  For instance, one strategy might be to lay the largest side flat and build up on it.  An alternate strategy might be to start with a section of the innermost bracing that I can make square and true (using the best pieces I have) and build out from that seed.  This is for a large speaker enclosure approximately 2' wide, 3' deep, and 5' tall, but I think the question could apply to any piece of similar size and construction.  The materials I have are 7/16"" OSB panels and 2"" x 3"" douglas fir studs.  (A more usual choice for speaker enclosures would be 3/4"" MDF for panels and bracing, but if I can build it with OSB it will save a lot on material cost.  Moreover the size of the speakers is such that you can't get enough stiffness by just using thicker panels; either panel material will still need bracing every 8"" or so.  Rest assured I am still using MDF for the actual panel the speaker drivers bolt to, but due to the type of speaker design these MDF panels will be internal walls, not external.  (These internal MDF panels form the ""inner box"" I was talking about that I can make most accurate in size/shape.))  I'm planning to rip some of the 2x3's to make 1.5""x1.25"" battens.  I know that if I take two panels that do not lay flat, and join them at 90 degrees with a batten, the joined edge will be straight assuming the panels were cut straight.  I also know that a 2x3 that is warped over a long length is ""less"" warped if cut into short sections.  So perhaps breaking the battens into sections is a good idea?  However in any case, when building from the skin to the inside, I think there is still the possibility that panels fixed in 2 dimensions will have warping in the 3rd unfixed dimension?  (E.g. they might bow in or balloon out even though the edges meet.)  The way I've most seen recommended online is build a skeleton or matrix and attach panels to it.  In this method, keeping the 2x3's in long sections would ease construction and assembly, but I'd be worried about getting to the end and discovering an irreconcilable difference in shape between the skeleton and the skin.  Not to mention differences in expansion, and resonance in the long boards.  I also thought about making a large number of ""pre-fab"" pieces to use to assemble the enclosure like Lego bricks.  These would be C-shaped and rectangle-shaped biscuit joined studs with OSB triangles nailed and glued on top of the corners.  I am not sure, however, whether these would take too long to construct, and also worry about building them to a designed size and finding out the actual size needed is different during assembly.  So, to recap:  how do I make a straight object out of wood that is not straight?  Should I start assembly with the longest edges / largest panels or smaller parts first?  Is it better to break the design up into an assemblage of short pieces joined together, or to frame it with some of the straightest studs to make a basis for the shape? "
1064,Do I need to seal the ends of hardwood fence boards?,I am building a small horizontal fence.  The facing is batu and matches my front entryway deck.   I put penofin penetrating oil on the fence boards. Do I need to seal the end of the hardwood fence boards?  With what? 
1065,What are good reasons to return hardwood boards selected by a lumber yard?,"I am building a fence with hardwood facing.  The lumber yard (not a big box store) selected the lumber, batu decking boards, and delivered it. These are fairly expensive, 1x6 x 8' and 1x4 x 8' boards.    I know that a certain percent of boards have issues.  In the past I have hand picked, avoiding less good boards.  What are good enough reasons that might cause me to justifiably return a board?  I am ignorant on this point and don't want to be unreasonable about it.  End split (N inches or more inches)?  Packing strap damage?  Through fractures at a crushed spot? Dull planer, so rough board?  Splits / splintering on the machined edges?  I am talking a few hundred linear feet of hardwood lumber. "
1066,How can I cut a 90 degree angle with a table saw?,"Before I start I would like to offer the obvious solution is to use some sort of sled, like a crosscut, that would give the perpendicular fence that would allow the cut. The problem with that is I was making my first sled so I was was stuck staring at my table saw trying to think of a solution.   Since it was my first sled I was allowing for some irregularity since the saw is not the best to begin with. I had this odd contraption using clamps and a long level that I knew was straight. I figure there has to be a better way (for when I make a better one).   Assuming I am working on a sheet (sheeted goods but not a full 4x8) or something where a mitre saw would not help what can I do with my table saw to have two side meet at a right angle? I can make 2 opposite sides parallel but I don't know how to get my 90 degrees.   Or perhaps this was not meant to be done with the table saw? "
1067,Joints for a 3/4in-thick pentagon,"I'm attempting to create a pentagon from 3/4in-thick pine boards, which will become part of a slightly odd shelving unit. Of the five angles, two are 90 degrees and I'm planning to use dowels and glue to connect them. The remaining angles are between 110 and 140 degrees, and I'm looking for some advice how to best join them.  Just glue? At those angles, I'm not sure the dowels will do much.  Also, any suggestions how to fixate the parts while the glue is solidifying?  Update per request: Here's a rough drawing. The plan is to add the middle board after the rest is complete. (And before you ask, the contraption is going to be 1) installed in a nook, 2) screwed to the wall on the left, 3) have a similar, smaller sibling, but flipped horizontally, 4) the sibling will rests on top of the upper-right board with a parallel board on its own, and 5) the sibling will be screwed to the right wall of the nook.)

1068,Can low durability be mitigated with specific finishes?,"I'm looking to build some outdoor furniture and I happen to have a lot of hard maple on-hand.  While I also have a bit of cedar, I dislike how easily it scratches and dents.    When reading up on maple, its durability is listed as poor and people seem to comment that it's easily susceptible to bugs and fungus.  I happened to just finish watching Marc Spagnuolo's (The Wood Whisperer) video on his outdoor bench where he uses African Mahogany which is has a listed durability of 'fair' (versus cedar which is 'excellent').  As part of finishing this project, he uses clear penetrating epoxy sealer (Smith's EPES) followed by spar varnish.  Is this finishing schedule enough to mitigate the poor durability of a wood like maple?  Are there other finishes that can be used to protect a non-durable wood in the outdoor elements? "

I've been using a 2000 watt vacuum cleaner (not a shop vac) which was ok until I started using the bandsaw and jointer more after which things started to get messy.   I am planning on buying a 3/4 HP dust collector and was wondering if it can handle the chips and dust from the bandsaw/jointer provided that it will be hooked to one of them directly? I always wear a dust mask and going to upgrade to a respirator, would that be enough? "
1070,Single glue-up for an end grain cutting board,"I've got those wide and thick Maple boards that I'd like to use to make end grain cutting boards with end grain Walnut and Jarrah inlay. The main body will be made up of Maple. The normal process of creating an end grain cutting board that I've seen so far is done by:   ripping the board into strips. gluing the faces together. cross cutting to the target thickness gluing the edges together.    Is this process mandatory or cosmetic? Since the main body is made up of a single type of wood, can I just cross cut the board into strips with the thickness I am after and glue the faces together? My main target it to decorate it with an inlay while having the advantages of an end grain cutting board?  "
1071,How to clean glue brushes,"I see people using brushes (hair or foam) to spread glue. This is not something I have seen in real life.  Without experimenting I have a feeling that spreading glue with a brush might be a good idea, but when the gluing setup is finished and one has time to clean the brush it is already set.   So every such gluing would cost a brush.  I can of course use a piece of wood or my fingers but the question is: Is the brush wasted if used for gluing? If not, how it is cleaned (water of course)? "
1072,What to do with a mineral-oil finished desktop,"I recently finished an oak butcherblock desk with mineral oil. While the surface looks great, I just learned about the difference between non-drying oils and drying oils, and I'm worried the desk will forever leave oil stains on my papers.  Could I refinish it by simply applying a drying oil (tung or linseed) over the mineral oil? Or would I need to completely sand off the layer of wood that soaked up the mineral oil before refinishing it? Any other ways I could salvage the situation?  Note: This is an office desk and does not need to be food safe, I chose the butcherblock &amp; mineral oil combination based on looks alone. "
1073,How do I remove scratches between layers of polyurethane?,"My husband and I have been building a farm table and we are oh-so-close to being done, but we are having issues in the final coats of polyurethane on the top. Here's a rundown:  We stained the wood with gel stain and put three coats of Minwax polyurethane on top. I used steel wool between coats and it looked pretty good, except we noticed brush marks in about three different spots. I think the brush didn't have a wet tip and the poly dragged or something... the rest of it looked great.  We used steel wool again and did another coat of poly, this time with a foam brush. When it dried it left these weird spots, so we put on another coat with a foam brush... even more weird spots. (they almost looked like water marks?)  This time we took 220 grit sandpaper and sanded the entire top of the table (with our hands... we didn't do enough research to learn that we should have used a sanding block... we're total newbies!) and put on a coat with the brush again. The coat itself looks great! But we can see scratches from the sandpaper under the poly :(  I've seen mixed advice online about how we should proceed.... do we need to sand down to get rid of the scratches (and probably sand out all of the stain and start over), or will using steel wool again and applying more coats of poly get rid of the scratches? I so do not want to sand down completely and start over, especially when we are this close to being done. But I also want our table to have a beautiful finish. Please help!   "

1075,How to make a heptagonal construction set?,"I want to make a construction set with rods and nodes similar to Zome or K'nex or Tinkertoys. Mine will be in entirely in the plane and based on heptagonal (7-fold) symmetry. (In fact, I'd like Tetradecagonal (14-fold) symmetry, but I'll continue my question with 7.)  I imagine the rods will be fairly easy to make - bamboo skewers cut to certain lengths and stained accordingly to length (probably between about 5 and 15 cm).  The nodes will be heptagonal prisms about 5mm thick and 10mm ""diameter"" with holes to fit the struts drilled into the centres of the (yellow) sides:    I imagine this could be most easily made from a length of wood with heptagonal cross section drilled and then cut up. (Alternatively, the nodes could instead be round and made from dowel or pvc pipe then drilled with 7 holes.)  Question: How to make the heptagonal prism nodes? How to drill into the sides? "
1076,"Easiest joints for 3/4"" plywood step?","I'm making a rectangular box that will act as a floating step.   9"" deep x 7"" high.  The top will be hinged as there will be storage inside, so only one edge of the top will be glued to the box.   What joints will be best for the sides? Mitered edges with triangular blocks glued on the inside see easiest. Rabbets also seem easy. Will these be strong enough for use as a step? Or should I take the time to do a box joint? Also, should I rabbet the bottom plate so that part of it is inset into the box? Or will simply screwing/glueing be strong enough?  "
1077,Laminating Boards For loft Leg,"I'm designing the leg for a bed loft and was planning on laminating together 4 1x4's of Poplar.  The middle two boards would not go the full length of the leg, so that a 2x6 can slide into it.  This 2x6 would be what forms the length of the bed on each side.  I am wondering if wood glue on the faces of the 1x4's would make it strong enough, or if I should drill a hole through all 4 of them about every foot and glue in a wooden dowel. Would the dowel help or would drilling the hole just hurt the integrity of the boards and create more work for myself?  Also, the 2x6 will be running the length of the mattress and supporting most of the weight (along with its parallel one on the other side of the bed, about 7ft long).  Is a 2x6 overkill and would a 1x6 suffice (dropping the legs to be three 1x4's instead)?     "
1078,Food Safe Finish for Cutting Board,"I made an end grain cutting board for my wife that had various hard woods that were all supposedly food safe.    Doing some reading and watching videos, I understand that this can vary depending on the type of wood and grain and such, or personal preference.  The woods chosen also have a contrast in various colors, from a lighter blonde look to a dark look.  From Walnut to to Cherry to Oak (I think, it was mostly scrap pieces and hard to remember).  What is a good finish that is food safe for a cutting board and for different colors of wood?  The design is random, not a specif detailed design.  How is this different than using beeswax? "
1079,"Is my 44"" Diameter 12' Long Black Oak Log with Wind Shake still usable?","We just had our huge black oak tree cut down because it was inches from our roofline. Ever since we first bought our house, we had planned on turning it into our dining room table. Being new to woodworking, I wasn't familiar with wind shake (also called ring shake) and just thought that the waviness in the rings would give the slabs more character. Well I had a mutual friend who owns a portable sawmill come out to look at the logs and he gave me the bad news about the wind shake and that the lumber is probably not worth milling.  Before just cutting all the wood I have into discs and making epoxy or resin supported live edge slabs (my idea of what to do with it short of firewood), what do you all think could be done with this log? Do you think it's worth trying to mill and see what I end up with after it dries or is that route a lost cause?  I also have shorter ~3 foot sections, most of them also show signs of separating at the rings.  Here's the album of the 12 footer: [website]"

I would like the stain to be environmentally healthy but am confused about whether to use a water based stain or an oil based stain as I hear the water based can be streaky.  We are thinking about putting Bona Traffic HD as the water based poly on it afterwards.  How important is it to stay ""within product"" vs. to use an oil based Minwax stain and then the Bona Traffic on top?  And what about the VOCs of the oil based stain?  Finally, any experience with Safecoat products??  I could also possibly use one of their stains and polys.  Any in put would be appreciated!!!   "

1083,Fix damage to maple table,"My question may be similar to How to fix water damage to wooden table, but even then I would appreciate the woodworking-101 treatment ...    The damage inside the red rectangles is from acetone and is two years old.  This 54""x76"" table, according to the place that sold it to me years ago, is maple.  I understand I can try to sand and re-stain just the small patches and try to match the color.  If I'm happy with the result then I'm done.  If not I would sand-and-stain the whole thing.  Some questions:   If I sand, what kind of sandpaper and machinery?  (I have a belt sander and a sheet sander.) What kind of stain? Sanding the edges would be more difficult than the flat surface.  But the edges will receive different light than the surface and a difference in stain color might not be as noticeable.  Or is this wishful thinking? How do I match the color?  "
1084,Edge joint failure - what is the cause?,"I've had a few instances where my glued up panels, breadboards etc. have had gaps open up at the edges. This happens a few days or weeks after gluing. The gaps have all stopped at a certain point and the join remains strong, but it looks terrible. I'm hoping to start selling soon and I can't afford for things to fail like that. It seems that the wood is moving after it gets to its new environment and is able to overcome the strength of the glue.  This has happened with multiple woods and multiple glue bottles so I know they aren't problems. I tried using splines to reinforce the joint but it still failed.  To mate the edges to be joined I start with a straight edge off the jointer, thicknesser, or table saw and then hand plane it smooth and flat. I am pretty certain the quality of the mating surfaces at this stage is not a problem.  I then usually put a very slight concavity in the surface, both across its width and its length. I was taught to do this as it supposedly helps the ends and sides of the joint that are exposed to air and moisture mate properly. I then glue with PVA and clamp.  Possible causes that have occurred to me are:  1 - The moisture content of the wood just isn't close enough to what it will reach in the environment it goes into. This seems like a big issue but one that is hard to avoid. The area I live in is fairly humid and my workshop is not well insulated or heated. The pieces mostly have gone into a very modern house which feels very dry which can't help. It seems unlikely to me that commercial furniture is made in a climate controlled environment though. Do I need to relocate?  2 - The concavity I put into the mating surfaces might need to be more extreme. Since the joint is pulling apart where it should be tightest it seems unlikely to me that the concavity is causing the problem. Rather, it seems that I might be making the concavity too subtle. Thoughts?  3 - I might need to use a different kind of glue. It is often said that any of the major woodworking glues are stronger than the wood itself but that isn't my experience; these failures are right along the glue line.   I've done some testing where I glue two bits of wood together, leave it overnight, then break it apart with a hammer. The break would generally be fairly clean with only a bit of splintered wood. This would suggest a glue issue to me.  Perhaps there is something I am doing wrong but I can't imagine what there is to mess up with PVA. I always leave it to cure overnight. Maybe I need to switch to something stronger, like epoxy?  4 - Clamp strength. I've read about glue starvation from excessive clamping pressure but I've also read that it is a myth. I would describe my clamping as ""pretty damn tight"". Maybe I need to either increase or decrease my clamping pressure.  5 - Reinforcement. I know a butt joint is supposed to be strong enough on its own but maybe there is something I can do to really pin the joints together at the ends? Splines didn't work but then I suspect they may only help with alignment and may not give the joint any extra strength. Is there some way to mechanically lock the ends of a but joint together that is invisible or that is easy to hide? If there is a method I suspect it would only work on thicker boards. "
1085,What is it called when you use screws with a butt joint?,"I always thought that this wasn't done, because the screw would likely blow out, unless it's perfectly aligned.  I'm wondering if there's a name for this technique (using screws to reinforce a butt joint), and if there's a jig or technique for drilling the holes?   For example, cross-sectional view:  screw               __   _______________  [\\\\\\&gt;   ---&gt;    |  | |_______________  board 2                    |  |                    |  |                   board 1   I saw some guy doing this by hand (with no jig or drill press) in the second half of this video.  Seems a little risky.  Is this common?  I've found something called a doweling jig, seems like it would work if used on board 2, but I don't think it would hold them both in place. "

If I want to cleave a log, e.g. ash, what other options could I consider? I could use axe heads but that wouldn't work well as I would not be able to get them deep enough into the wood and they are too wide anyway.   Any suggestions for froeternatives alternatives that I could use for cleaving? I have some ideas about Finding the right metal for making a froe but in the absence of the tool what else could I do? "

1089,prevent wood bending when glue is applied,"I'm trying to make floor tiles which should look similar to attached picture. I sliced a wood about 6mm thick and wanted to glue them to the mdf base. However when I put PVA glue on a wood slices, they bent. Corners of slices raised from a base from 3 to 7 mm. Bending is really huge and caused by the moisture of glue. So with such a deformation gluing is not possible at all. I tried to straighten slices with a board on top of them and clamps but only crack a couple of them.  So the question is how to prevent wood bending? or is there other way to attach slices to a base?  Thanks.  PS: as mentioned in comments, each tile is supposed to be a rectangular about 800x400mm, these sizes could vary. Slices (open grain pieces) are going to have width about 60-85mm (85 is the capability of a saw) and length 60-100mm.   "
1090,What are some tricks to flatten twisted and warped lumber boards without removing any material from them?,"I live in Lithuania, Eastern Europe. Throughout the years, I have bought lumber from more than 20 lumberyards all around the country, trying to find at least a single one that could sell me straight, clear boards that I need for making boats and spars. My efforts were in vain. Even though I always bought the highest quality lumber, dried and calibrated, and often even promised to pay double for the really good stuff, the stuff they actually give me is barely acceptable to make pallets. I am slowly accepting the fact that there is no quality lumber in my country, regardless of how much I am willing to pay. The boards I get are twisted, bent, warped, don't have a single straight edge, and are full of knots (I am talking big ones, every 10-20 cm (4-8 inches).  By the time I re-rip and plane these boards flat and straight, there is almost nothing left to use, and 3/4 of the wood is wasted. What's worse, when I rip a straightened and flattened board, it often starts twisting and warping right after it comes out of the tablesaw - that's how bad it is. Before you say it, the machines I have in my shop are of high quality, and I do know how to use them.  Because of that reason, I am forced to consider ways to straighten and flatten these boards after ripping them to dimensions. I tried forcing it them into shape using steam boxes, but most of the time the lumber breaks, even after steaming a piece for hours, and bending slowly. Even when it works, I still can't get them perfectly straight and flat, especially when the bend is compound and changes direction every few meters. Steam-bending to approximate straightness and then finishing up with a tablesaw or a planer doesn't work, because as I said, these boards start immediately warping again as soon as they come out of the machines due to released internal stress.  You can't imagine how frustrating this is. I haven't seen a straight board since the last time I visited USA. The stuff we get in Lithuania is beyond horrible.  Fellow woodworkers, do you have any advice for me? How do work with such lumber without wasting so much time and money? I can't afford shipping lumber from other countries or continents...  Thank you for your time. "

Questions:   First and foremost, is this kind of finish possible with the type of varnish I'm using?  Assuming the answer is ""Yes"":     How many more coats of varnish and/or varnish-oil layers should I apply before stopping? To obtain a high gloss finish, what rubbing and/or polishing compounds should I use (links to products would be great!)?  As well as what method of buffing and polishing should I use? I've assumed that something like this buffer/polisher would do the trick?

1093,Salvaging Failed Spar Varnish/Danish Oil Finishing Layers on Redwood Live-Edge Slab,"This question is a follow-up/continuation to another SO question of mine with added detail and hopefully a better explanation of my approach and current state of the board.  The state of the wood slab has evolved even since posting that question and rather than amend that SO question into oblivion I figured best to ask a separate one...  As reminder, I used spar varnish and watco danish oil.  It's my first real attempt at wood finishing and made the following mistakes:   using spar varnish.  I have since learned from my other SO question above that spar varnish is generally too soft for indoor use and not a good varnish to use for a high gloss/polished finish as it likely doesn't buff/polish well. not wiping off excess DO after application and leaving a rather thick film on coats 1,3 (see below application schedule) not wiping off excess varnish after application (not sure if this is important if used by itself as in layer 2 below)  excess coating pooling on underside edge and live-edge (evident in pictures below)   After sanding down the table I have applied the following coats with their respective dry times and mixtures:   50/50 mix of spar varnish + Danish oil (>= 10 days dry time) spar varnish (~4 weeks dry time) 50/50 mix of spar varnish + Danish oil (~48 hrs into dry time)    Current state of the last coat is best described as ""tacky/gummy"" with strong smell (both reducing as time wears on...).  I'm not sure it's still soft enough to leave finger prints but feels sticky.  Not sure how hard to expect it to feel or how odor free to expect it to become either.  From what I've read at these links a gummy feeling after about 48 hrs after not wiping away excess DO is expected.  Though it's unclear if this will ever harden well enough to buff/polish (crux of this question...):    [website][website][website]However, not entirely sure what I should expect for spar varnish + Danish oil coats...   My end goal is a high gloss/polished/hard/durable finish.  From the SO question above and it's thoughtful answer as well as considering my mistakes, it seems I have a few courses of action:   Immediately try wiping down last layer (layer 3 above) with a cloth and mineral spirits to thin/remove the spar varnish + danish oil coat.  Then apply 2/3 layers wiping varnish.  Let dry for 24 hrs.  Wet sand 1000,1500,2000 grit.  Then use power buffer/polisher in conjunction with minwax paste wax. Wipe down with mineral spirits as in 1 above but after that, sand off first 2 coats as well.  I dread doing this as I'm not sure how easy it will be to remove the varnish + danish oil from the live edge.  But if necessary, I'll do it... Let current coat (layer 3 above) continue to dry and hope that it becomes hard enough to either directly buff/polish or apply successive coats of wiping varnish on top of this layer that I can then buff/polish.   Is there another course of action that I've missed? If no, which of the above would be best to pursue?    Ideally, I'd like a combination with the best balance of:   least potential damage to the underlying wood (especially the live edge with it's small amount of inner bark) highest quality/high gloss/polished look completion time from now   This is a learning experience and ultimately want to know how to get the best outcome out of this piece and how best to avoid these mistakes (considering my desired outcome finish) for future pieces.  Thanks!  Pictures here of the current state of the slab top/bottom.  Note the live edge.  Note also that the thickness of coats 2 and 3 combined is apparent when looking at the underside photo (4th below) (not sure if that helps anyone when answering this question).  I applied only coat 1 to the underside, however I applied both coats 2 and 3 to the topside AND to the live edges (even though they face down). I'm happy to upload more/different photos if that would help in answering this question!        "
1094,Cross cutting narrow stock using a track saw,"I have (very) limited working space and I intend buying a track saw in order to do rip cuts, cross cuts, beveled cuts. I cannot fit a table saw unfortunately.  I was wondering, can I cross cut 2x4s using the track saw using the aluminum track?  Does it make sense? Can I sag the track as most of it would be unsupported? Should I clamp it to some sacrificial scrap wood, below the track, at its ends, in order to prevent the sagging? Should I take totally different route? "
1095,Is a bench top jointer better than no jointer?,"I've love to get a nice big 6"" jointer but I don't have the space for it so I've been looking at bench top models that I can store when not in use but man are the reviews horrible. On multiple sites I've seen reviews saying that it's actually worse to use a crappy jointer than no jointer at all so I don't want to spend the money and not use it because it doesn't work well. I have a planner and have tried sled method but it's too much work for the amount of lumber I want to mill so a dedicated jointer would be nice. So, is having a cheap bench top jointer better than not having one at all and using alternative methods? Any recommendations?  "
1096,Is wood-glue enough or should I use extra support?,"I am building a 2' x 2' bar table, which will be either supported by a single metal base (like this) or by wooden legs at the corners.   For the table-top, I'm planning on using Poplar from Lowe's in sections of 0.75""x1.5""x2' glued together. The edges will use a lap joint with a dowel through both pieces. It'll look like this (crude drawing warning):    My question is: in either configuration - a center support column or corner legs - would any other structural support be needed for the table top (or is wood-glue enough)?  Thanks! "
1097,How to treat tools immediately after de-rusting treatment (molasses)?,"I have a set of tools (handplanes, to be precise) currently swimming in a molasses bath for de-rusting. I can find a lot of comparison data with other de-rusting methods, but not so much information on what to do after the treatment.  It appears imperative that the tools be treated immediately after being rinsed out to prevent flash rust from forming. But with what? Seasoning them with oil (like a cooking pan)?  In case it matters, the tools in question have cast iron main bodies with nickel plating, some brass hardware, some screws and spurs/knickers which are possibly steel, and some plane blades.  References:   In the ""stop the rust"" youtube video, after rinsing off the molasses, the author brushes on phosphoric acid (""deoxydine""), which seems a bit ironic. Treating tools for long term storage: How can I store hand tools so they won&#39;t rust? . Not quite what I'm looking for, as it assumes there is already some lasting finish on the tools.  "
1098,Stronger attachment method for B&D Workmate top,"I'm refurbishing my 70s vintage Black &amp; Decker Workmate. Itâs seen a lot of abuse, but the only thing that ever broke, besides working corners of the plywood vise jaws (which I'm replacing) were the screws that held the plywood to the 1/16"" metal bracket underneath (2 screws on each jaw, per side). So I'm looking for ideas on a better, stronger method than the manufacturer used. I'm thinking of Ikea furniture I've seen, where they've used a machine screw that screws into the side of a larger tapped shaft, that you insert into a hole that's drilled perpendicular to the machine screw/hole â in my case, a long hole drilled into the vise ends (see photos). Seems to me it might suffer abuse a lot better than a dinky little, 3/4â long, wood screw? Any other suggestions out there? 1/16â metal plate into 1â Baltic birch plywood. I'm excited to hear what other ideas y'all have! Thanks in advance.   "
1099,"Is shellac really a ""universal binder""?","I recall reading that shellac is supposed to be a ""universal"" binder which can be used as an intermediate layer between otherwise incompatible layers of finish.  Say, for instance, you are refinishing furniture but you're not sure of the original finish. So the theory goes that you could put on a layer of shellac, and then use whatever alternative finish you want on top of that. (I'm obviously glossing over details here.)  This seems almost too good to be true. Is this a generally accurate attribute of shellac? What are its limitations?  I am aware that some paint primers are shellac-based, which lends some credibility to the idea. "
1100,What does methyl bromide look like on timber?,"I have timber from pallets without any stamps. From my research, un-stamped pallets may be for domestic use and, therefore, are not treated in any way.  With that said the timber has some granular whiteness in places. It is almost like salt in texture with occasional granules on the surface. There is no odour.  The image shows the whiteness on the right mostly. Is this methyl bromide?  Ultimately my question is one of safety. Should I use this timber for outdoor furniture and dog houses?   "

1102,Refinishing teak patio table,"A couple of years ago, we purchased a beautiful teak outdoor table. I sealed it with Semco sealer (recommended by the store for teak) a month after we bought it. To protect our investment, we also had a custom cover made for the table to protect it from rain and sun. Unfortunately, we got a lot of rain recently and when we took off the cover, the teak was covered with mildew spots. The water got through the cover and was trapped inside. I first tried mild bleach to remove the spots. That didn't take all of them out, so I tried a stronger commercial product. This didn't work either and just left the table looking faded and splotchy.  So I'm thinking I should just refinish the surface. I've done some reading on this, and I'm thinking I'll start with 120, then 220, then seal with Semco. Is there anything I should watch out for? How deep to these mildew spots go? Should I use an orbital or straight sander? I'm hoping I won't have to strip off too much of the wood.  Any advice appreciated! Thanks.         "
1103,Table saw cross cut on panel,"I'm a beginner who wants to be safe here!   I need to cut multiple boards (let's say 10"" x 16"") with a table saw.   My first cut was going to make a 16"" rip cut on my 4 foot plywood and then cross cut it to 10"" pieces. Now it is evident I could use a sled, or the miter gage for that cut. The longer length is clearly too long to use the fence alone and risk kickback.  Let's now assume that I would like to rip/cross cut those 10"" x 16"" into roughly 10"" x 8"" boards. Could I use my fence only? Will it risk kickback? Since it is almost square, is there some kind of safety rule of thumb regarding the risk or absence of risk? I know the 10"" edge can be firmly pressed against the fence and it will not rotate, but is it a bad practice?  What about if my previous board was 10"" x 24"" and I rip 8 inch or even 16 inch boards?  "
1104,What can cause cracks in painted pine?,"I'm taking an online woodworking course (The Weekend Woodworker), and built a small patio table a few months ago. I made it out of select pine (kiln dried), spray painted it (~2 coats), and put in on my back deck. Being the first thing I've ever made, I was (and still am) pretty proud of my efforts! However, I noticed today that the top of the table is already cracking:    What could be causing this? The deck is south facing, and gets a ton of sunshine all day, so perhaps it's a UV thing? I also note that water sits on top of the table after it rains, as if the top boards are cupped a little (I did indeed sand the top). I try to dump the water off each time this happens, but I'd like to know what (if anything) I did wrong. "
1105,Dust collection for Bosch sliding miter saw,"I have a Bosch 4410 sliding miter saw. It has a small dust port that I've found to be woefully inadequate as the sole means of dust extraction. My shop also has a 5HP cyclone dust collection system that I'd like to put to use on the miter saw. I'd made up a 28"" x 44"" hood, of sorts, using a couple of window well covers that helped somewhat but takes up too much real estate in the shop. The sliding mechanism extends nearly 16"" behind the dust port, putting the hood too far away from the blade and dust port to get the job done effectively. The current thought is to build a smaller hood that attaches near the rear handle behind the motor using a 6"" flexible collection hose connected to the shop dust collector. I've seen some nice hoods folks have designed, but none for a saw with a long slide mechanism. Suggestions???   "
1106,Will a tabletop bolted to slotted angle brackets have problems with wood movement?,"Iâve been planning to build a farm style table for our patio. If I join the top boards using pocket screws + titebond III and attach the top to the base using angle brackets with wide slots, will I be ok as far as expansion and buckling? Wife would rather not have gaps between the boards. I will be staining and applying a good amount of spar urethane to the top while the base will be painted. My wife wants bread board ends as well.   Wood will be top will be 5 - 2x8 framing timbers from local lumberyard.  This is the inspiration for the table -   [website]"
1107,Best way to scab joists for bridge,"I'm building a bridge across a ditch in my nephews front yard. Shown here is an elevation of one of the four joists that will support 2 x 6 redwood treads, width of 5.5'. To achieve the curve, I will need to assemble the joists from 2 pieces that will need to be scabbed together in the center. The unsupported part of the span measures 11.5 feet, the vertical thickness of the majority of the span is 10"", it measures about 8.5"" where it leaves the supporting pads at the ends. The wood to be used is pressure treated Doug Fir, structural grade. My intent is to scab these two pieces with a 4' long piece of 2 x 8 PT Fir, same as above.   I'm a long time builder but I'm a bit nervous on this one. I've not, in memory, seen similar. Think this is sound? If so, how best to secure the scabs? Many screws? Carriage bolts? Use iron versus the wood scabs? (I'd rather avoid that.) Wood-scab both sides of the interior joists? I guess my biggest concern is stress, or wear from use, on holes going through the joist halves.  I could run the design flat with a single piece but that would require steps on the ends and would not look nearly as nice in its intended location.  EDIT: As per suggestion, I've lengthened and fattened the scabs.The left side shows bolts at 6"" centers, 4"" centers on the right. Comments?  "
1108,Filling cracks with epoxy after Tung oil,"So still working on my live edge walnut table, and I think I may have screwed up the order of operations a bit.  The slab has some defects - cracks, small knots with voids, etc.  Didn't think to much of it - just part of working with this type of wood.  But now it occurs to me that I could do an epoxy fill.  Maybe clear, maybe with a metal powder fill.  But I've already put 3 coats of Tung oil on it.  So I'm not sure the epoxy is feasible at this point.  Will it stick?  Will the process of sanding it down flush damage the surrounding oil finish in a way that will be noticible in the end?  Thoughts?  5/5 update  Ok, following Graphus's advice ... and adding a bit.  I scraped out several of the defects with a small pick.  Turns out there alot of punky stuff in some of the defects, and one knot came out entirely.  I followed up with a small ballnose rasp on a Dremel, and the the suggested drill.  In the end, there probably wasn't much oiled wood left in there except for the smallest cracks.  Mixed up the epoxy with alot of brass powder.  Mixed way to much material.  Applied with a bamboo skewer, applying the suggested heat gun.  I'll update again in a few days.         5/13 update Cut down the epoxy with a rasp and block plane, then sanded flush wit a 1/4 sheet sander starting at 100 grit.  Worked it down to 220 with the power sander.  Hit the filled stuff with 600 grit, which brought it out a good bit.  I'm pretty happy with how it came out.      Edit 2019-05-26 Thought I'd post a few of the finished piece - thanks for the help!    "
1109,Does the final coat of a Danish Oil finish need to be wiped?,"Does the final coat (in this case third) of Danish Oil have to be wiped?  Or is not OK to just let dry and then lightly sand/buff?  I ask because I am using the dark walnut version of the Watco product, which was applied very thinly, and currently have the exact color match I want, but if I wipe it down, it will remove some of the solids and thereby lighten up the finish.  I'd like to not have to keep reapplying... "
1110,Doweling technique - can they be applied in two stages?,"I am planning to build a custom box to fit in my car's trunk on one side, as tall and long as the trunk and as wide as little as possible. This would hold my tools, emergency gadgets etc.  Since I plan not to invest a whole lot of effort I will avoid box joints and dovetail joints (which I practiced a few times in the past but they seem to have taken too much time and effort) and want to resort to butt-joints reinforced with dowels. I already have a doweling jig from Wolfcraft.  In order to prevent some issues that I had in the past with doweling I am thinking to do things a bit different but that might end up in a disaster so I am asking first here.  How about I glue the pieces of the box first, simple (glued) butt joint (that weak kind of joint) wait for the glue to dry and then drill the holes for the dowels, apply the dowels with glue, trim them flush, apply finish etc.  Would applying the dowels after the first set of glue cured weaken the joints? Or would this have any other downside?  Why would I do this? Clamping simplification. Having a long and atypical form and size would ask for large and specialized clamps that I currently do not own and most importantly don't have space for.  Most videos on the internet (youtube mainly) show doweling as fitting the whole thing in one go not in two stages as I would try so I became curious if such an approach holds a nasty surprise (weak joints or something else). "
1111,Desk with hidden space underneath,"Im designing a long desk with a section that has hidden working space underneath. There will be an space (like a drawer) then you can remove the desk surface and access the space underneath. There I can do my electronics work and when people is visiting I put the cover back in place and the desk look like a tidy desk.  The desk is in the main room (open concept house) and is against the back of the sofa, so no wall around the desk. The desk itself is rather long (L shaped with 2.5+m in the long side) but I don't need the whole surface to have hidden space.  Main source of inspiration are board gaming tables like this one: CoveredBoardGame  Approaches I came with so far are :   Removable top lid, like in the boardgame: A removable cover that you take away and put ""somewhere"". Not acceptable by my wife :) Hinged cover: the cover will be too big and there is no wall to lean it against so... It will need to stay in the air.. not realistic. Sliding mechanism that allow the cover to slide between the desk and the sofa. Sounds cool but sounds also hard to put back and forth. Not sure Mechanism to slide the cover under the remaining part of the desk. To me looks like the better approach.. But construction will be ""funny"".   Does anyone has another idea? Have you ever seen something similar ??   "
1112,How to address a failed glue up?,"I'm working on my first major glue up, and I noticed a failure to bond properly along the edge of the outer board, see picture below. I did some research, and I can think of a number of things I did wrong that caused this -- not enough glue, not using scrap pieces to spread out the pressure, not using freshly worked faces, working too slow, etc. My question is, what do I do now?   Do I simply try to pour more glue into the cracks, clamp is again, and hope for the best?   Do I try to drip denatured alcohol into the cracks, to soften the glue and pry it apart, then try to glue it up again?  I don't have access to power tools, so simply cutting off the offending board on the table saw and starting again isn't really an option for me.   "
1113,How to fix a gap in plywood screwed joint,"I've knocked together some plywood to make a shoe rack and I've messed up the cuts.    There's a gap that I thought I could live with but I'd like to try and fix if possible.      Notice the slight bulge?  I thought I might get away with using clamps to pull it together but I'm worried I'll end up ripping the screws out when I release the clamps.  Short of replacing the top shelf or shortening the middle and bottom shelves, which I'd rather not do, is there something else I could try? "
1114,Long lasting exterior shutters,"I'm creating some exterior wood shutters made from Eastern Red Cedar (rails and stiles) and Western Red Cedar (panels). The mismatch really has more to do with what's available locally than a design choice. The ""boss"" wants them to be raised panel. She does not like board-and-batten because they're too rustic for her tastes, and louvered are boring to her.   Putting together a frame and panel are pretty straightforward, so my question is more about the details. These shutters will be primed and painted, but there's the possibility that water could get inside the frame. For this reason I'm considering drilling 2 or 3 ""weep"" holes in the bottom rail that will allow water to drain rather than sit if water gets down into the groove the panel sits in. Let me know if this isn't clear, but is this a decent idea? How did the old timers handle that?  Second, I'm going to attach hardware since these will be working shutters. Should I put a dab of caulk into the holes before I drill the hardware to keep water out? What's the best practices to make sure wood shutters last as long as possible? Thank you! "

1120,8 to 12 mm plywood box joints: brackets vs glue(box joint) vs screws,"There's very similar question, but there're no answers for my specifics.  I'm going to build few open-top boxes to be used mostly as a bench to seat 2 grown-ups,  with ability to also carry things in them sometimes.

Say the max load on boxes when used as benches = turned open side down is 200kg and the load when used as a box is 50kg max.  I can think of 3 methods of making a corner joint, I want to choose based on labor time and cost given they are made to provide same strength.   Inside corner brackets. -- how many brackets do I need, what's optimal screw size? Fingered joints.

When I think of fluted dowel I picture these guys...    Image from HomeDepot.com  That style of dowel would be difficult to emulate. I am not going to make a jig where I would rotate the dowel and run a beading moulding plane, or similar tool, to scratch a groove in. If they are actually compressed maybe I just need to compress them with something? Is there another method of working the dowel that will get a similar functional result? "
1122,Identifying Paint Type on Finished Furniture,"I recently acquired a wooden table with a high-gloss painted surface.  In moving it, I scratched one edge.    I am hoping to repair the damage (hopefully without repainting the whole table) and then somehow weatherproof the entire table so that it can be kept on a covered patio.  (I may post follow-up questions on color-matching, scratch repair and weatherproofing very soon).  I'm guessing that the first step of this project involves figuring out what kind of paint is on the table.  Here is what I can tell from my uninformed observation...  The table is high gloss white, not quite mirror-like when viewed straight on, but highly reflective from an angled view.  It is resistant to fingernail indentations, but obviously not indestructible.  There is also a small ""dimple"" on the surface (which is way above my repair skills, so I will just live with it).  Here is a picture of the dimple.    Question Do these photos and observations provide enough information to identify the type of paint (Acrylic, Oil, etc.)?   If so, what is it?  If not, how do I acquire the other information needed? "

1126,Planing a laminated curve,"Preface, I have not worked with a planer before.  I have a curved piece of wood which was created by laminating three 1/4"" oak boards over a form.  The curve looks good but I would like to clean up the edge.  I can do this with a sander of course, but was wondering if I could pass it through a thickness planer.

1127,What do I need to know to use a claw hammer effectively,"Yes, I get the gist of it. The hand goes on the handle and you hit the nail or whatever object with the head (of the hammer). So... not this:    Image from ShutterStock  I am referring to both the action of seating nails and removing them. When I am removing nails from pallet boards I hit all the nails out and then flip the board to I can pull them out.   Eventually this repetitive action is going to start to hurt and obviously that is going to happen regardless. However I wonder what I need to know to hold it off as long as possible.   Does something simple like my thumb position play into account? Should I be giving a thumbs up or making a fist when holding it? Could this just be a matter of whatever feels comfortable?  What do I need to know to use my claw hammer effectively so as to not cause unneeded stress on myself? "
1128,What should I do to maintain a saw blade?,"In an answer, rob â¦ stated that:     Many other factors also influence the longevity of a blade between sharpenings, such as the hardness (e.g., steel vs. carbide, or one grade of steel or carbide vs. another) and initial sharpness of the teeth, whether the blade is properly maintained, the operating temperature, and the materials cut with the blade.Emphasis mine   What is necessary to properly maintain a saw blade?

1129,What is the difference between a worm and sidewinder drive circular saws?,I didn't even know this was a thing. Then I read comments in this question     Worm drive saws are long and unwieldy for all but the burliest of men. I found them a real pain to work with. A Makita is a nicely-balanced tool and will last a woodworker 200 years. We used them like rental cars for years with nothing more than motor brush and cord changes.   I aspire to be a burly man on occasion. What is the difference between a worm drive and sidewinder drive circular saws? Do each lend better to certain applications? What do I need to know to use each properly? Are there other types where modern circular saws are concerned? 
1130,What would be the UK equivalent of the common US 2 by 4 (not just by size),"I've found a DIY shelving project that interests me and am setting about researching the best place to obtain the wood required for it.  In this project, and others I have seen, the American instructor commonly refers to the wood in use by the size, either 2 by 4 or 1 by 2 (only 2 sizes are used in this project).  I know from reading around that size wise this would roughly equate to the UK's 44 x 96 and 25 x 44 but it is my belief that in the US if someone refers to 'Using a bit of 2 x 4' then more is understood than just the size. It is also known what the type of wood it is, the cut, whether it is sawn / planned and so on.  So my question is:  Does the UK have a piece of wood that is universally commonly used for hobby / domestic projects that it is simple referred to by a common name and is this typically a suitable substitute for the US 2 x 4? If so is there a common place to purchase this wood (B&amp;Q, Wickes, etc)?  If location makes a difference, I am located in northeast Scotland. "
1131,"Technique for using a ""poor-man's rebate plane""","I made a poor-man's rebate plane following the approach shown by Paul Sellers in his blog and video    It is made from pine (construction timber, probably spruce) so isn't likely to be accurate or durable but it seems to work  I tried it out on another piece of spruce and am having a couple of problems,     I find it hard to control the depth of cut, tapping the chisel usually results in a very coarse shaving. The rebate depth is hard to control to get uniform depth from end to end, I guess I need to add a depth stop. The side wall tends to be very rough and has some shreds of shaving attached.   My reason for making this was to see if it would serve as a plough plane to make a new frame for a garden cold-frame. I need to make a housing (dado) to hold the plastic glazing. Since this isn't fine furniture I'm not too concerned but I do have the same problems I'd like to eliminate     Here's some early coarse shavings and some newer thinner ones     How can I improve the results I get?

1132,Can you make shaker doors out of one piece of MDF?,"I've seen people make raised panel doors out of one piece of MDF. I've also seen a professional machine make a shaker door out of one piece. But is it feasible for someone to make one with a handheld router? Would the inset middle area be smooth? If so, what type of bit would be best? "
1133,Why keep gaps in siding of outdoor furniture project?,"Below you can see a picture of a patio prep cart that I'm building for my brother. I would like to make a few design changes to the plan but I'm not sure if it would have some unforeseen negative effect down the road.    What I would like to do is implement some Tudor house design features since he just bought a Tudor home to start his family in.  One way I would do that is by painting the trim a traditional Tudor dark brown and paint the panels a more cream color.  In order for that to look nice, I think I would have to do away with the 1/4"" gaps between the boards. Or maybe just use a piece of plywood. But, I'm worried that maybe the gaps are there on purpose, maybe allowing the cart to have airflow is needed?   Can anyone tell if eliminating the gaps between the boards on the siding might somehow hurt the integrity of this patio prep cart? If it makes a difference, I plan on using cedar for this. "
1134,Can you apply wood with glue over stained areas?,"I am making a chest for my son. Was going to stain then assemble but have decided on the assemble, sand, stain method. However I will be gluing wooden letters to the lid of the chest and have seen many posts stating to be sure to tape off glued areas when staining (if doing the stain then assemble method) my question is why don't people glue over stained areas? Will it not hold? I don't want to have to stain around all of the letters before or after gluing. What do you guys recommend? "
1135,Can I use a 6mm shank in a 1/4 inch collet?,"There is a nice bit I would love to get/use but it uses a 6mm shank. My router uses 1/4 inch shank. It is a 0.014 inch difference...is it a bad idea to get this? Is there an adapter or something if not?  From the comments on an answer:     My router is a Performax trim router, there is 1/4 collect and 3/8 collect. Not sure of the model.  "
1136,Sculpture: Anchor a wire armature to a natural wood branch,"I'm working on a sculpture (of a gibbon swinging on a branch) which will be made of wood and wax with a wire armature, and I'm trying to figure out how to anchor my armature to the branch.  Here's a quick drawing of the intended setup:   The branch is a natural, hardwood branch, about 3/4"" in diameter and about 10"" long. It's quite strong. One end of the branch will be anchored in a block of wood. Somewhat close to the other end I need to attach a strong wire armature, which needs to be able to hold, say, 8-10 ounces of wax altogether. The tricky bit is the angle: I need that wire to come out from the branch at a 45-or-so-degree angle as shown above, and since it'll have the weight of the wax pulling down on it, it has to be anchored very sturdily in the branch.  My current thought is cutting a channel in the top of the branch from the point where the armature attaches heading toward the anchor, so the wire would poke through the branch, be bent and then run through the channel; fill the channel with epoxy or something, and paint over the top. It's less than perfect because I'd love to preserve the bark... also, the actual cutting of the channel doesn't seem very easy at all to me.  My question, then: Is the wire-in-the-channel idea the best option? If so, how should I go about cutting that channel? Or, is there a better way to do this that I haven't thought of?  Many thanks! "
1137,Are there any extra considerations to gluing pressure treated lumber?,"I am in the process of designing a floating raft, which will be built out of pressure treated lumber. There are various elements I would like create from gluing together some smaller boards rather than purchasing more expensive, larger stock.  Does gluing the pressure treated lumber entail extra considerations, or should I just approach it like gluing regular lumber? Does this projects future being perpetually wet also warrant extra scrutiny? "
1138,What are the differences between sanding and scraping?,"How do both techniques compare? In terms of result, cost, applicability to different kinds of wood, different shapes of work pieces and cleanliness of process.  I always used sandpaper to get a smooth surface, which you have to buy again and again. Getting one scraper that does the same (does it?) sure sounds tempting to me. I wonder if I could substitute sanding with scraping, either entirely or partially. "
1139,Should I use one large spline or multiple smaller ones for a miter joint?,"This obviously depends on the thickness of the wood. When you see multiple splines on a join they use contrasting wood colors to create a nice effect. But is that the only reason? Consider the following picture:    Image from CanadianWoodworking  Would it be preferential, for the strength of the joint, to have one large spine that spanned the space between the outer splines of the picture above?

1140,How to find out what kind of finish is on a piece of furniture,"I have several old pieces of furniture that have issues with the existing finish. I would like to do a gentle restoration of these pieces while maintaining the original look. I am not sure if the finish is shellac, or some kind of other varnish.  How would I be able to tell what is there? Is there a way to test the finish to determine what it is? "

It seems all these machines are 3-phase. What do I need to know about the machines in order to determine whether they can be made to run on the single-phase 240V, 20A circuits in my garage?  Also, I've seen people mention rewiring or replacing the motor or using a phase converter to run old industrial-size machinery in a home shop, but what's involved with each of those solutions? "
1142,How can I make a sliding interior 'barn' door?,I want to make a door similar to this:      What kind of wood would you recommend and what would be the best way to build it?  I am guessing it would need to be reinforced from the back?

I need a somewhat decorative piece of metal to mount the awning to the wall.   I also thought I would be able to find plans for building an awning like the one pictured. Is there a good resource for finding plans for woodworking projects, or do I just need to put in the work to create one myself?   "
1144,"Best method to stain the ""side"" of a project","I wasn't sure how to stain the 1"" side of my desktop (an 80x30x1"" red oak panel), so I thought painter's tape would be a good idea to only stain half at a time. (Half while doing the ""bottom"" of the table, then tape other side and do the ""top"")  This has left me with a line along the side of the table where the stain is darker on the bottom and lighter on the top, mostly noticeable on the end-grain.  To avoid this result in the future, what is the typical way to deal with having to stain the ""side"" of a project? Should I have stained the entire side when doing the bottom? Should I stain the side as a separate process from the top and bottom? Clearly painter's tape was not the right method.  Also, what are my options other than sanding the sides down and starting over, to fix the mismatch in color? "

1146,Should I do many shallow quick cuts or a single deep slow one with my router?,"Most cutting tools have a certain removal rate of material at which they should operate.  You don't want to go too slow because it takes forever. And if you go to fast the tool heats up too much.  This question is concerned with the latter one on a router. I heard that the usual technique is to plunge the bit only a little and not the full depth of the cut. Then make several cuts plunging deeper every time.  That makes sense. It reduces how much material is removed in one go.  Couldn't I achieve the same thing by doing one single cut with the bit plunged to the final depth, cutting very slowly?  The problems that I see with the first approach:   it only uses the top part of the bit, which will become more and more dull while the rest of the bit is not used that much doing that same cut over an over again is could cause marks of the different cuts to be visible   What's the better way of doing it? "
1147,What qualities do tea and steel wool vinegar offer as stains?,"I stumbled upon the below picture today via social media titled Aging Wood Instantly.    The method shortly summed is staining the wood first with black tea and then, after drying, with vinegar that's imbued with steel wool for 24 hours.    While the result looks like many other possible stains, it got me wondering, what, if any, good properties would such a stain have? Any reasons why it's not a sustainable idea? "
1148,How do I look for a table saw blade with non-angled teeth?,"I'm thinking about building this box joint jig so I can make my joints with a single blade (rather than having to pull out my dado set). The problem is that I've got one of them fancy Freud blades that has angled teeth (adjacent teeth are pointed in a different direction). It makes great, clean, quiet cuts, but for non-through cuts, it leaves a little ridge.  I know they make tablesaw blades that don't have the angle on their teeth, but I can't find identify where it's listed online whether it's angled or not. Is there a generic name or description for this type of blade? "
1149,How can I make an inset cutting board handle?,"How is this cutting board handle possible? The only way I can think of is that it was done by hand with a gouge, but it looks too clean for that. Can an inset handle, such as the one pictured below, be done with power tools?   "
1150,How can I remove green streaks from cherry lumber?,"This cherry lumber has some faint, but definitely noticeable, green streaks.   Source: me  I'd like to give the piece I make with these boards a natural-colored finish, but not if the streaks will show. How can I eliminate, or at least reduce, the visibility of these green streaks? Would a dark stain hide them, or could I remove them before putting on something like Danish oil? "
1151,Is there a recommended distance between dog holes on a work bench?,"Most of the general uses for the holes I have seen only require individual holes. When more than one bench dog is used they are used in parallel holes so the distance is not usually a factor. I suppose it is possible there is some hardware that makes use of two or more holes simultaneously. If such hardware did exist the dog hole placement would be a factor.  Either way, is there a general recommended distance between dog holes in both directions? And by both directions I mean lengthwise and crosswise on the bench.   A related question would be: At what point would you have too many dog holes? "
1152,Simple Dovetail jig,"There is a small dovetail jig my teacher has that he showed the class and I thought it was neat and want to make it. Here is the video I think he got it from. Because it is very much the same thing, but without the magnets. Here is the VIDEO. It is very self explained as to how it is built. But I miss on how you use the thing. The teacher did not show us, I am sure I can figure it out but if one of you know how to use it and explain that would be great! That really sums that part up.  The other thing was, what does the angles have to do with dovetails? There are 7* and 14* and whatever else. Is it just looks, or is there a greater strength with on over the other? "

Which of these planes would be best for a shooting board?  Is there some trick to grinding the edges square to the sole?  Maybe like clamping a square to the sole to angle the edge properly?    Squaring the edges sounds like something I would only want to do once in my entire life so if anyone has any tips to help please let me know "
1154,Is my 1/4 sheet palm sander going to die?,"I was using the 1/4 sheet sander the other day when the motor was getting funny. This started about 4 months ago and got worse. What happens is the motor does not start up to full speed. After some time running it would kick up and run like it is supposed to, but this did not last because it went back to a slow speed. This is a fairly old sander, but am not sure for this was handed down to me from great grandma. It has not been sitting outside or anything so I do not think the dry, cold weather had anything with it. But maybe in the summer because humidity is about 75% around here.  So with that said, do I need to get rid of this tool before something dangerous happens (like would it start on fire?) If it is not the motor, how else can I fix it?  Update: Well my sander died already. I could not get to the brushes since they where inside the sander. But since it was dead I looked. The brushes were fine but they snapped out of place it appeared. Otherwise I couldn't see a problem with it. But it is not worth trying to fix this one. The brand is Skil. Model I do not know, the sticker wasn't there. I have another old sander so it should be good for a while. When it's dead, I will move to a Ryobi cordless sander.  "
1155,The best way to cut small square holes and shallow rebate in chipboard?,"I'm building a bar-top arcade game. I have some plans from I Like To Make Stuff which I'm modifying and I'm steadily cutting the necessary pieces etc. I'm upcycling an old desk to make the front panel, control panel and monitor mount. The desk top is 22mm thick veneered chipboard.  One of the modifications I want to make is adding 4 USB ports to the front panel. The holes to mount the USB connectors need to 13.5x6mm, ideally with lip around the outside measuring 14.8x7.2mm, 1mm deep (to accommodate the USB port lip).   I've enquired about getting this laser cut, but the material is unsuitable. Could anyone suggest a method for cutting such holes? Would CNC cutting be an option? Is it even worth attempting, as plan B might be to go with a material that could be laser cut? Thanx.  This is the USB port I'm trying to fit.  "

I would like to make this table:  [website]It mentions the dimensions : 1-5â8â³ square at the top and 1â³ at the bottom.  One thing I was wondering is how legs are typically made?  Do I find some larger square block of wood and cut it down? Or can I laminate some longer thinner pieces, since a 1-5/8 inch thick board is not easy to come by.  If I do laminate the boards, is there a straightforward way to then round one end (the top end) into a circle (so it can slide into the holes drilled in the stool top)?  Something like a huge pencil sharpener maybe?  Thanks for any suggestions. "

1158,What is the cheapest way to create a right triangle out of a square dowel rod or similar?,"I'm working on adding internal lighting to my pantry, and have discovered that the LED strips really only work when held at a 45 degree angle to the bottom of a shelf. I'd like to get a dowel rod and cut it into two dowel rods, each being a right triangle in cross-section, such that I could attach the led strips to the hypotenuse of that triangle. I have some woodworking tools from my dad (skill saw, circular saw, miter saw, reciprocating saw), but little to no experience beyond ""saw this 2x4"" or ""cut this plywood to this size""  I think if I tried to use any of these tools, I would probably not get a decently straight line down the dowel, so I'm hesitant to try. What tools could I use to rip this dowel rod in this way? That being said, I'm not really interested in wood working as a hobby, so I don't want to invest in the most expensive way to accomplish this task, I'd like to do it with either the tools I have or relatively inexpensive tools. I'd like to avoid going out and buying say, a table saw.  For reference, I'm using a 1/2"" square dowel that I will be cutting to 12'' long. "
1159,how to design and install full length (floor-to-ceiling) built in bookcase?,"I'm planing on using live edge boards for the sides of a floor to ceiling bookcase, and I would prefer not too use a ""header"" board (for lack of better term) or any sort of trim around the top or bottom. That is, I want the sides to really be full length from floor to ceiling.   How might I best accomplish this?   The boards will be ~ 1.5-2"" thick and ~8' long, so I can't just bend them into place. I was thinking of making 45Âº miter cuts on the bottom inside faces, the sliding the waste back in after the sides are installed. Might there be a better way? "
1160,horizontal stability of a table,"I'm making a table and I wonder how to improve the horizontal stability so that the table does not wobble/move from left to right.  Here are the details: The table width is 160cm, depth 70cm, height 76cm.  The table top is 6cm thick and is made out of block-board (14mm pine core + 2mm birch + 1mm oak veneer). It's empty inside.  The table legs are 70cm tall and 70cm wide. They are made out of a stainless steel closed profile (width 4cm, depth 2cm, thickness 0.2cm).  I need more reputations to post more photos/links so I redirect you to this question where I've already posted them horizontal stablity  The leg is connected to the table top by two screws. Additionally, a flat metal bar is welded to the leg and it is mounted to the table top by another two screws.  Right now the entire connection is bad and hence the table top doesn't touch the leg nearly at all. There are only few touching points; even where the screws are, the table top doesn't touch the leg perfectly (I think the leg and bar are not completely straight). All in all, the table wobbles and the horizontal displacement is around 2-3mm.  The design of this table has to be however as clean and simple as possible so adding a cross member is the last thing I want to do :/  I think that improving the connection will decrease the horizontal displacement. However, I wonder if the table will still wobble a bit just because of table and legs dimensions (especially because the leg width is only 4cm and the table width is 160cm while the table height is 76cm).  The other issue is how to make the leg-table-top connection better (assuming that the leg and bar are completely straight). Right now the screw goes through the entire profile of the leg, like on left figure. Would it be better if it connects the table top only with the upper horizontal wall of the leg, like on the right figure?    If I use more screws, is it better to fix them in an alternate manner? like this:   I could also make new legs which are wider e.g. 5cm x 2cm x 0.2cm (width x depth x thickness). Would it improve the stability considerably? "

The jig will hold a piece steady while the user hand-drills a hole in a certain spot.  I want to use a steel bushing to guide the drill bit so that the hole is straight.  The bushing will be 3/4"" long with a 1/4"" ID, for guiding a 1/4"" bit.  My question is, will this be damaging to the bit?  I'm thinking that the cutting is done with the point, which never touches the bushing, and the flutes that do touch it just collect the waste, so it would be okay.  What do you say? "
1164,Sawdust all over house and furniture from old house modifications - toxic?,"Can sawdust be toxic if you're breathing it a lot and it's all over your house and furniture? Vacuuming does not seem to get rid of all the sawdust on the couch, bed, comforters, in computers (!) etc., etc.     More context: We are renting an old house, managed by a leasing company (that thus far seems to have been hiring rando's from Home Depot). Disappointed that they gave the keys to someone who started sanding and sawing a bunch of sticky and jammed doors without covering up the furniture beforehand. (We arrived home to find a stranger working on the doors.) Now there's sawdust everywhere... Vacuuming only does so much. This is an old house and I'm not sure if the saw dust is safe or toxic?  "
1165,What hand tools to use for rounding edges and creating pockets?,"I've seen some tutorials online about how to create a cutting board, and all of them suggests using a power router to round the edges and create the pockets for the handles. It looks so easy to do with the router, but I was wondering if those steps can be done using hand tools and get a satisfying result?   What tools can replace a router in this case?  What I am after is something similar to whats in the image below, but the handles are at the bottom instead of being in the middle of the sides:   "
1166,How does one aggressively sharpen chisels and plane irons when damaged?,"I have a lot of finds from garage sales and from picking out tools from my grandfather's old shop. While he mostly keeps his tools in great working order he had some that I would guess he didn't feel comfortable throwing out (He kept EVERYTHING.)  So let's say you hit metal or otherwise caused a dent in the tool or found a tool in damaged state. For argument's sake say maybe at least a 2-4 mm dent or chip. The following is an extreme example of both.    Image from lumberjocks.com  From what I remember the sharpening techniques discussed here already at WW.SE govern sharpening dull tools.  What does one do in the case of this type of irregular, severe damage? Another example of just a chip which could likely happen. Do you just do more of the roughing step (like standard sharpening) or is there something else that should be done first?    Image from thejoinersapprentice.com  I understand that some options are listed in the pages I linked but I wanted the community here to have a go.  "
1167,Questions about my custom stain and cleanup,"As some know I was experimenting with making my own stain using vinegar and nails removed pallets. I used white vinegar and a couple hundred nails in a 5 gallon pail.  In the end I have a stain that is working but the results are not what I expected so I was wondering if someone might be able to determine where I went wrong. In hindsight I can think of a few specific things that changed the outcome. Outside of the general process of putting nails in vinegar I did the following things:   Concoction was left in the pail for about 3 weeks. Life got in the way. Most the tutorials about this sort of thing suggest a week at most.  There was a large amount of what I can describe as rust foam (it was about 4 inches high above the liquid). I was not sure how to separate it from the liquid so I just mixed it all together. (This would be why my results are slightly red / orange where it should have just darkened.)  I might have used too many nails but I didn't think it would hurt.    I know from an answer to another related question     In reality you just need iron and vinegar. Rusty metal is no more or less desirable here   so it is possible I put myself in this position by using too much rust.  At the end of the day I wanted to know how can I clean this pile of nails? In theory most of the rust should be gone and I just need to clean them and I could use them again.  Do you think the ""rust foam"" was unavoidable? How could I have removed the liquid from the foam?  Below is a picture after I poured almost all the liquid out.    "
1168,Why are metal lathes not used for woodturning?,"I'm an engineer and have designed several parts that are made on metal lathes.  I'm wondering why metal lathes aren't used for turning.  In particular I'm wondering why woodturners don't use a tool holder on a stage or tools that resemble metal lathe tools.  What is the advantage to manually holding your tools and using a tool rest?  Without knowing much about woodturning I would assume that it's next to impossible to get repeatable/super accurate results (or perhaps better stated I'd assume it must take years of experience to get the hand eye coordination down to get good results).  Perhaps the ""one of a kind"" nature of the process is part of the appeal? "
1169,Gluing plywood to plywood for doll's house floor,"I am making a small doll's house for my daughter. This is my first project; I am a total beginner at woodworking, basically what I know is remembered from watching my dad 30 years ago :)  It's going pretty well, I have cut the panels, and even managed to get some perfect rectangles cut for windows; however when cutting them I noticed that of course, the plywood delaminates very easily - in fact much more easily that I expected.  A front view of what I was planning to do:    So I plan to make the base and main ceiling out of pine so I could screw into it for strength, however the floor was just going to be plywood glued, along with some mouldings as batons to increase the surface area along the side.  Will this design be strong enough for the interior floor just with the glue? I know that the glue is stronger than the wood; my concern is that the top layer of plywood and glue will peel off and the floor will collapse if she bangs around too much (she's two and a half).  (There will be a back as well of course.)  Matt mentioned dimensions may be important:  It will be ~22cm x 34cm x 22cm (w x h x d)  The plywood is 8mm thick; the pine is 15mm.  The plywood is basically offcuts from my father in law, so is in ""been knocking around the workshop"" condition. Clean but a bit flaky.  The plywood has a paper thin veneer on one side in a reddish looking wood. I should have mentioned this actually, although I can just use the other side. I assume this was done for appearance - it is literally paper thin and flakes as soon as you bring a tool into the same room. I presume I should avoid gluing to this side altogether? "
1170,When is the ideal time to work green wood,"I had made a really simple bow saw during my summer holidays. I was trying to see if I could make a project from start to finish using only hand tools.  I cut some poplar (Mostly guessing but the shape of the leaf makes me pretty sure.) and started shaping the log. I used a draw knife as a froe (for lack of better option). I then made a bench hook and though between the draw knife and a plane I could get the wood fairly flat.     That is where I was mistaken. Using both of those tools on the wood created the same problem. Instead of slicing the wood it looked like it was tearing little strips instead. Those got caught on the blades of the respective tools.   So I had an exercise in futilely. With every push or pull I got fibres stuck on the blade. Those would prevent the blade from making another cut. So I would remove those and be able to maybe make one more cut.   I eventually gave up and just used my axe to finish. It was rougher but got the job done. I know that green wood will eventually ""settle"" once it dries but I wanted to try and see what I could do before hand.  The reason I even bothered, and leading to my question, was because Roy Underhill gave me the impression that working was easier. He did not suggest that all the work could be done while green but that initial shaping was easier. There was one specific video where a gentleman made a Winsdor chair and made the same comment when he was using his draw knife on some red oak. In the case with Roy he was making a grease pot out of some black walnut.  Was my green wood too green and I should have waited longer? Am  I not interpreting the comments on the work-ability of green wood? Perhaps the wood species I was working on is not the green work-able kind? "
1171,A second coat of water based poly beads up when applied.. What is the problem?,"I applied oil based stain on a old cabinet after stripping and sanding. It dried a week (but it was humid).  I applied a coat of water based poly and had no problems, just a light coat. When I try to put on a second coat, it beads up immediately. I waited 3 weeks and tried again (still a little humid) but the same thing happened.  The veneer cannot handle much more sanding, what can I try to get another coat of finish on?  Oil based poly? Shellac? "
1172,Applying oils over stains,As we learned from Can I apply water-based polyurethane over an oil based stain? it is possible to do just that under certain conditions.   I would like to broaden that question if possible. Finishing is not my strong point (yet) but I have understood that stains and oils both work by penetrating the wood. With that in mind am I making the oils less effective by applying them over a stain? Perhaps I am just ensuring that I will need to provide more coats of oil?  When using oils with stains are there any generalized guidelines that should be followed? This question is dependent on my assumption that stains and oils both work by penetrating the wood. 
1173,What knock down hardware can I use on this platform bed frame?,"Basically, I want to be able to make the platform of this bed easy to take apart, because I'd like to be able to easily move it by myself. I'd like knock-down fasteners to be used in a way that the frame can be assembled and re-assembled repeatedly without damaging the lumber or hardware.   The picture below is a rough mock-up of the bed frame from the underside.   Here's a quick rundown on the frame:  It's a queen size. In the above picture, the brown corresponds to the wood, the light gray corresponds to headboard brackets, and the dark gray corresponds to mounting plates for the bed legs.   Lumber  The wood will be red oak.   The outer boards will be 8/4 (1.5"" thick) and 5.5"" wide. Two will be 60.75"" long and the other two will be ~82"" long. The middle inner board is also 8/4 (1.5"" thick), but it will be 3.5"" wide with a length of ~71"". The skinny strips will be 4/4 (0.75"" thick) rails for the bed slats. They'll be joined to the long adjacent boards with biscuits for alignment and screws for strength. (I don't want the rails to be knock-down.)  Current Hardware  The leg mounting plates are approximately squares with 2.4"" sides. I'd like to keep them near the innermost corner of the miter joints. If that's not possible, then I'd like to keep them as close as possible to the miter joints by placing them all on the vertical boards (in the picture).  The head board brackets are ~1.5"" wide by ~5.5"" long. The center headboard bracket will be kept in its place. However, the other two outer brackets can be drawn in more, but I'd like to keep them as close to the edge as possible.  I'm planning an attaching the above hardware to the lumber with tee-nuts, because threaded inserts with knife type threads do not go easily into red oak.  Design Constraints  I would prefer for all of the knock-down hardware to be visible only on the bottom. It's okay if it's visible on the top, but I'd be a bit worried about moisture from the mattress corroding the hardware or damage to the mattress from the hardware. However, if it would be visible from the outside perimeter edges, I will revert to my original plan of using floating tenons.  Knock-Down Hardware I've looked at   Cam Bolts and Screws: I've looked at a wide variety of cam bolts and screws. However, I'm only interested in ones that have threaded inserts for the bolt as knife type threads do not work all that well in hardwood. I'm currently looking at Cam Bolts with a 6mm diameter. These would be my first choice with metal dowels for reinforcement (if needed). Countertop Joint Fasteners: I've only briefly looked at Rockler's Tite Joint Fastener Metal Dowels: I was thinking of using these just for extra strength. I'd like them to be of a uniform size, if they are used. However, I'm not sure how big the holes should be for the dowels due to the wood expanding or contracting.   The Question  Will any of the above options work for this bed frame? Would other knock-down fasteners work? Is it completely infeasible?  My preferred option would be to run a pair of cam bolts &amp; screws along each joint of 8/4 wood, with metal dowels if they are needed for strength. "
1174,Reusable Desk design: how to join pieces?,"I just saw this question about how to join pieces of a bed frame in order to dispose and reassemble it without damaging the wood. I want to pose a similar question about a registration studio desk. The reason for a separate question is that joints are to be placed differently from the bed frame, therefore different solutions may be viable.  My main concerns are:   Ease of reassemble and structure movement; Stability (firm structure and ability to hold the required weight); Ease of construction (I'm not a woodworking expert).   Material, measures and weight  I'm pretty much wood-agnostic and, given my ignorance, would go for the best size-for-bucks option. I'm probably going for fir. I have a Leroy Merlin store available nearby, and am considering having a slab like this roughly cut for me (sorry, I can't find an English Leroy Merlin catalogue, but the image at least should give you the idea).    The desk board should hover at roughly 32 inches (82cm) from the ground, while the drawer under it should sit at 25.5 (63 cm) inches. The overall depth is supposed to be around 24 / 25 (60 cm) inches as well, while the drawer should be around 12 inches (30 cm) deep. Minimum width for the drawer is 53 inches (140cm), but could go up to 63 (160 cm) depending on considerations about future purchases.  The drawer is supposed to only support a digital piano and some additional weight from playing, so from 24 pounds up to probably 30 (12 to 15 kgs) or so. I'm not sure if and how to account the additional weight from body pressure during play. The desk board should support at most the same weight of the drawer, as the items I would put there are considerably lighter than the piano itself.  Methods I've ruled out  Glue and / or naked screws: obviously, glueing pieces of wood with screws makes for sturdy builds, but makes it impossible to disassemble the desk afterwards. Screws can be unscrewed, but 3 / 4 cycles of screwing / unscrewing are going to ruin the wood.  Methods I'm taking into consideration  Wood thread inserts: this was proposed as a solution for using screws without damaging the wood. The inserts act as a ""fixed"" ""middle"" screw so that the wood is ""damaged"" only once and actual screws and bolts can be used multiple times without damaging it. Illustrative picture below (the inserts are shown separate from the pieces but they should actually go inside the holes). As far as I understood, I am to use inserts in both wood pieces I want to join, but I'm not 100% sure. Also, do I need to glue the inserts in their ""housing"" or is the outer thread sufficient for the purpose?    Pipe structures: this seems to be a big thing on Pinterest where I looked for reference. Pipes seem to come relatively cheap (even if not fully customizable in size) and are infinitely recombinable. You typically create a structure with pipes in order to support the wood boards, which are not required to hold weight anymore but just to provide some additional binding (and of course the desk top). In this case I was suggested to use a combination of pipes with flanges ""permanently"" screwed to the tabletop (and the other components) and pipe couplers to connect the flanges with the pipes structure.  Mortise and tenon joints. I saw some videos illustrating how relatively easy and cheap it is to make a mortise and tenon joint and how strong it is. I'm not sure if this joint is safe to disassemble and reassemble, if no glue is used on the tenon.  Questions  What is the best joining technique among those I presented for this particular case? Do you know of better techniques I could use? Are there things one needs to be aware of, that a novice might not take into account?  Thank you in advance and sorry if this turns out to be a duplicate, it's just hard to understand what would be the right ""reassemble"" keyword. "
1175,Sanded and stained a pine window shelf... water damaged areas too dark. How to fix?,"I am prepping my house to sell.  We sanded and stained a window shelf under a Bay Window and the water damaged areas came out too dark. So how should I fix this? Sand again or stripper, or just cover over with gel stain?  I'm reading that I could apply a dilute finish before staining to reduce the blotchyness. But that means getting the stain off of the shelf.  Trying to limit the level of effort, but match the wood trim in the house. "
1176,Wood stain coming off wood onto hands,"Let me first say that I am new here but hoping to get an answer for a specific question. I'm not really a woodworker, so your tolerance is appreciated.  I was recently gifted a very nice sword. The handle and scabbard is stained a rich dark coffee colour.  However, with a little bit of sweat on my hand, the colour comes off and soaks into my skin.  I am not sure what the type of finish is (oil or water, etc.) But the fact it is coming off only when my hands are wet (or moist) is an issue.  Is there a remedy for this problem? Should I seal the stain? If so, what would be the best type of sealant to use, since I might be handling the wood regularly.  Any help would be much appreciated!!  Cheers,  Lucian "
1177,What tools were used to make this toy block?,"My daughter has these wooden blocks; they're about 5cm on a side. Two faces are machined(?) with various letters, as shown -- and my question is how this face was made?   It doesn't look laser-cut, because the lower surface does not look burned or charred; It doesn't look CNC machined, because some of the gaps are impressively narrow and would require a ridiculously small machine bit; It doesn't look ""pressed"" because that would probably not work on such fine details, but would just squeeze them all flat; But then how was it likely done?   I got them for free 2nd hand, but I know that (for just wooden toy blocks) these were very expensive -- apparently it's some form of name brand, plus the painting is actually very nicely done and the wood itself is a very pleasantly-smelling sort.  Edit: Ooh, my wife explained it to me: They're Tree-D printed!   "
1178,How to speed drying of unknown finish in high humidity?,"I'm in Malaysia helping my sister in law setup for a dinner party this evening. She has a beautiful 6' diameter table that had some stains on it. She had some eucalyptus oil based cleaner that we used to clean the surface with. The problem came when I was over zealous with the cleaner on the worst stains and it's softened the finish.   I have no idea what the finish is, but I'd guess varnish judging by how sticky my hands are from rubbing in the eucalyptus oil. There are also little balls of finish that come up when I rub it with a dry hand.   I've got a ceiling fan running on high trying to cook off the volatiles, but the humidity here is so high that it's taking forever. However there is progress, it's not so tacky anymore, so maybe patience is the correct approach?  My SIL is impatient to get the table ready, and I have no access to my normal tools and solvents back in the US, so suggestions would need to revolve around normal household items.   You guys got any ideas?  Edit I've gotten a stay of execution from my SIL, so the table can sit for a few hours (with the fan on high) before it needs to be set. It's still pretty tacky in places, but seems to be drying, albeit, slowly.  "

1182,How to join at an angle?,"So I'm building this bookcase. Birthday/wedding present for my middle child.   Sides are bamboo (originally supposed to be hotel stair treads) 6' x 11"" x 1"" Horizontals are African Mahogany. 10.5"" x 1"" x variable length. Sides lean out @ 15 degrees. 11"" spacing between the shelves. Total weight of the bookcase is ~105lbs. Add 100lbs(?) of books.  I saw this design online a few years ago, and of course cannot find it again to see how he did it.  Tools and skills  Typical homeowner tool selection. Drills, table saw, circular saw, Kreg pocket jig, a dozen big clamps, router, sanders. Not averse to buying something new to get this done.  Skills = just on the unskilled side of 'medium'. I can build a mean deck. Aircraft mechanic and computer programmer (engineering mindset).  Degree of difficulty - the vertical sides cannot be replaced. I only have the two, and so cannot screw up any holes or cuts. The shelves, I have spare material and can get more. At $7 bd/ft, my wallet would cry, though.  How to join the horizontals with no visible means of support? No visible stiles, braces, brackets...  My current thought is pocket screws from under each shelf, into the bamboo sides. I have enough extra mahogany to create enough sawdust to mix with glue and plug the pocket holes.  Secondary thought is screws from the outside of the sides, into the end grain of the shelves. This also involves somehow covering over the screw holes with matching (something). Of course glue with whatever solution.  Due to the off angles, I'm not sure I could pull off dovetails or mortise and tenon.  Other joinery options? Convince me why pocket screws will not work or are a bad idea.

1184,Wood Coasters from Tree Branch finish,"My family just chopped down an old silver maple tree in their backyard.  It has some great branches that are about 2-3 inches.  We thought that slicing them and cutting them up into thinner pieces to make a some nice drink coasters.  The plan is to have a nice bare tree look with them.  The bark is thin on these in this area.  We want it to have a nice natural look, and possibly something to show off the rings of the tree.  Nothing dark, nothing that will change the color/hue too much. There won't be a need to make it food safe, as its just for cups and glasses.  They will potentially be used outdoors on the patio.  I would like them sealed so they will retain their look for a long time.  However, I also don't want anything that will smell (in case they are used in the house or in the enclosed patio room).  Something that would also stand up to the elements (to some extent) if they are left out.  My question is do you think that they need any type of finish on them?  And if so, what kind what do you suggest? Should these also be dried out, and if so for how long before a finish?    I know some of this might be opinion based, and I appreciate everyone's opinion and thoughts on that.  Overall, looking for a what works best, and what is a good thought on sealing a wooden coaster that is sliced from a tree branch. "
1185,Can I avoid spur / knicker marks in dado bottom cut with plough plane (stanley #45)?,"I want to use a plough plane (stanley #45) to cut dadoes (cross grain). The spurs/knickers are useful in preventing tearout and defining a clean knife wall, but they score past the bottom of the dado, like in the following image (dado profile outlined in red).  This is obviously due to the knickers cutting ahead of the iron, but if push the iron further out to a depth equal (or close to) the spurs, the operation of the blade is much less smoother -- broken shavings, and at the far edge, it results in breakout.      So, is there a way to produce perfectly rectangular dado profiles with this tool? Would one re-adjust the depth of the blade relative to the spur, or are spur marks to be expected regardless? "

1187,Oil based stain over water based fire retardant,"I'd like to treat some wood (raw pine) with a water-based class A flame retardant (Flameseal WSA), but also stain it with an oil based stain (garden variety Minwax or Varathane).  I'm a bit unsure of compatibility, and the need for a barrier layer (e.g. shellac) if any.  The FR datasheet states:     This product may be used on most types of wood as long as penetration occurs. The product may be stained with a compatible stain or top coat after treatment. However, many stains and top coats are flammable and can adversely affect the flammability of the treated substrate.   The priority is FR effectiveness over looks, but I'm concerned because the flame treatment is penetrating, then if I have to put a coat of shellac over top, I'm thinking any stain on top of that isn't going to penetrate well. I'm also concerned that, even worse, the stain will never really dry properly. The wood will be used on a ceiling so at least any finish doesn't have to stand up to heavy wear and tear, although if it stays sticky forever it will attract dirt.  So my main question is: How can I apply both the water based FR and the oil based stain and get the most out of both?  My second question is, given the last sentence of that quote above, should I be considering a water-based stain or some special FR stain instead of my go-to oil stains? Does anybody have any experience with this?  I only actually need a class B rating (these are ASTM E84 ratings) so I do have a fair bit of leeway with reduced FR effectiveness, if it matters. "
1188,How can I determine when a linseed oil finish has cured?,"I have only recently begun experimenting with linseed oil and walnut oil finishes, after mainly using mineral oil. Today I read this question and realized that my process may be flawed, because I am not pausing at all between applying linseed oil and then finishing with a carnauba wax topcoat.    I found this reference about drying oils in the above-mentioned question, but there's no real indication of how to tell by touch/sight when the curing process has completed.    Right now, my process is: * Scrape or sand the bowl to a medium grit, usually 220 * Wipe gently with mineral spirits to remove dust in the grain and raise the remaining grain for finer grits of sandpaper * Wait 1-5 minutes for excess mineral spirits to dissipate/evaporate (sometimes I try to hasten this using puffs from my mini air compressor) * Sand up to my finishing grain, usually 600 grit and then 0000 steel wool * Wipe with linseed oil until surface is covered; use a fresh rag to remove excess * (note, no pause between previous step and this) Apply carnauba wax and buff into surface    ...my question is, am I making a mistake here by not waiting for the linseed oil to cure before sealing it in with carnauba wax? If so, how long should I wait / how will I tell when it's OK to proceed to the final wax step?    Thanks for any help/advice you can provide! "
1189,How to make out-of-square cabinet square?,"I'm refinishing some old speaker cabinets and noticed they were out of square. They're reasonably sturdy, but if I push the top sideways while holding the bottom (shear force), I can bend them square. In case it's relevant, they're just four boards nailed or screwed together... I can't tell for sure because the fasteners have been covered with wood filler.  I had my wife hold one of the cabinets square by pushing the top sideways while I installed angle brackets on two of the four corners. But when she let go, it immediately went back to not being square. In other words, the two angle brackets weren't strong enough to hold the cabinet in the desired position.  I'm not sure how to get these cabinets square without disassembling them... try more brackets? I have plenty more and could put two in each corner. But I don't want to put a bunch of holes in the cabs if it's not likely to work. Or use beefier brackets? I'm not sure where to find something like that. Or maybe some other way?  By the way, if I have to disassemble them, I think I'd just leave them out-of-square and tell people they were designed that way to add to the tone.    "
1190,Fresh sawn oak sleepers deck,"I'm planning to make a deck (~18m2) using oak railway half-sleepers (50mm thick, 200mm wide).

I've read somewhere that it's really hard to sand fresh sawn softwood - is it also the case with oak? If it's possible, assuming I have a decent belt sander, how long sanding may take - would it be hours or days? After sanding, what could I apply to improve the finish and make sure there are no splinters and the deck is ""nice to touch""?  Thanks! "

In the auger kits that fit square-tapered bit braces, the largest auger in the kit is often smaller, at 1"" or 1-1/2"".  What type of brace bit should be used for larger holes? Is boring large holes into a thick slab, with a hand brace, a bad idea? "
1193,How to set up a Veritas Basic Grinding jig with short chisels,"Problem  I need to regrind new bevels on some old worn-out chisels, without using free-hand techniques, which I know how to do already.  After some belabored research on grinding jigs, I purchased a VeritasÂ® Basic Grinding Set1 for use with my 6"" grinder. However, the chisels I have vary in length, but most/all of them are quite short.  In actual use, during setup, I very quickly ran into a problem in the setup, where the short chisels do not fit the jig, without pushing it forward so far as to then throw off all of the dimensions that are required for the jig to work.  Is this just my not knowing how to properly set up the jig? Or, is it due to the design assumption, by Veritas, that the jig would only be used by chisels with long shanks?    Details            Solution/Options  Some solutions I'm considering are:   This is just my ignorance in setting up the tool. If so, what is the proper setup? Donate/sell the short chisels, and buy longer, higher quality chisels that will fit the Veritas Grinding Jig. Definitely a viable option, as I don't see any issues with the Veritas, if this was by design. Only return just the VeritasÂ® Grinding Jig, keeping the VeritasÂ® Grinder Tool Rest, and build2 my own jig to use with the VeritasÂ® Grinder Tool Rest, using suitable plywood/hardwood/aluminum/steel. Not too difficult, but I don't want to spend the time on that unless someone can convince me that it is the best option. Return the entire Veritas set, guide plus jig, and research some other vendor's sharpening guides and jigs. Feel free to comment on guides you know will work with both long and short chisels plus plane irons, but this is not intended to be a tool recommendation. Return the entire Veritas set, guide plus jig, and build2 one from scratch. There are tons of videos and design plans out there, but, this is a last resort as it is just more time spent building tools to do woodworking, versus well, just doing woodworking.   Update #1  Graphus's comment was:     1st and most important is, do the problem short chisels all need to be reground or do you just want to?    Yes, and the grinder comes into play because I want to avoid manually regrinding them on diamond stones. Examining each of the chisels closely, I found that, over the years of abuse, I've honed and rehoned each of them to the point where the entire bevel needs to be reground. Basically, what should be a microbevel is actually a rather large macro bevel, on all of them.  I will also consider the possibility of using my Extra Coarse diamond whetstones to do the coarse work. But from experience, that is a lot more work than using a grinder, that is, only if I can relatively quickly set up the chisel on a/the jig.  Graphus's comment was:     Can the jig be moved inwards so that the grinding wheel comes forward, in fact just shy of kissing the rear of the slot? This strikes me as being the main setup change that could resolve most issues, but the grinder or the base of the jig could easily not allow it.   I could and did get close, but that turned out not to be viable, because the upper-left handle bumps up against the grinder housing.  I even tried moving that handle over to the right side, but it runs into the lower-right handle. See this photo:    I also reconfirmed the problem I detailed in the second image above: In order to adjust the chisel's angle of attack onto the grinding wheel, such that it meets 1/2 way up the bevel as per the instructions4, I indeed had to push the chisel so far forward, that the conical part of the back of the chisel abuts up against the jig top plane, tilting the chisel upward even more, throwing off the invariants the jig uses in those instructions. Thus, for these short chisels, I've concluded that jig part is not really applicable.  So ""but the grinder or the base of the jig could easily not allow it"" is the case here.  I neglected to show the condition of the chisels in the original question, so updating this now: This isn't a great photo as it doesn't really show the bevels with any degree of resolution, but you can kind of see the ""macrobevels"" from the light reflection, in this photo:      1 There are many viable options, but my read of tons of Amazon reviews led me repeatedly back to the Veritas as ""the"" best here.  Of course, I have diamond whetstones of varying grits and a honing wheel to do the final stropping.  2Building tools is fun, and I have no problem with that at all, but I do want to avoid needless Yak Shaving3 or filling holes in buckets requiring tools that require buckets that hold water, etc. etc.  It might have taken me just as much time to type up this SE post as it would to have just built my own from scratch. :)  3 Definition #2:     A less useful activity done consciously or subconsciously to procrastinate about a larger but more useful task.   4 Click on the ""Instr"" link at the bottom of the page at VeritasÂ® Grinder Tool Rest, second page in the PDF.

1194,"Table saw, possible replacement queries","My father is a casual woodworker, and rarely deals with something as precise as fine joinery, and has been using his father's old table saw for his whole life. I believe it is a 1960s craftsmen with a cast-iron top.   Though I think it is fair quality, age has taken its toll and the saw can be a pain to use. Part of the track for the fence has sunk and it does not operate smoothly, the bevel has been broken as long as I can remember, and truthfully it may just die entirely.   The family is thinking about replacing it however, for the amount of use it would get, I think a cabinet or hybrid saw would be out of the budget.   My questions are, would a new jobsite saw be a big step down from the current machine in quality? Would building a nice bench to house it and expand the top help rectify that? Or are we better off working with the old saw?  "

1196,How to soundproof the Wood Shop?,"I hold a small (15qm) Wood Shop  at the basement, where I have the classic power tools like: a miter saw, a bench saw and a wood drill press and some other hand power tools.   There is a real issue with the noise, the power tools are too loud and the neighbors are irritated.  Now I was looking into tools that are silent, but since they are expensive and hard to find, and I think it would be easier to soundproof the whole room or put the tools in a soundproof box.  My loudest tool has 108db(A) and produces frequencies from 400Hz to 16kHz, for that I have considered using inflammable resistant acoustic foam. But before I start spending money, time and research, I wish to ask first :   Have any of you had to soundproof a wood shop? what solution is effective if so? "
1197,What is Old English Scratch Cover?,"Seems like a basic question but I haven't really been able to find the answer anywhere. I understand that it's used to restore scratched up wood... I've seen pictures and videos of it in use. But what is it?  Is it a stain that darkens scratches so that they match the rest of the wood, or does it build up and fill in scratches? I also don't really understand why some people say it needs to be reapplied occasionally. Can you put a finish on top to prevent that? "
1198,how to make a new drum,"I have hand made one drum. I carved it from a live poplar tree. When finished it stood 16"" tall with a drum head greater than 10"", but not much. I hand sanded it inside and out after I burned the center out. I hand carved some animals in the side like a wolf and a brown bear.   I am wondering is there a way I can do this on a lathe?   Can I turn a log if it has been hollowed out?  What tools will I need? (besides a good lathe) Can this drum be put on a lathe to clean the inside?   I also have a new project that is also poplar that is 10"" high with a 10.5"" base. Base wall is about 1.5"" thick with the head walls being .25"" thick/1.00"" tall they widen out to base thickness.   Could a lathe be used to thin the out side walls? How would this be done?    I previously used fire and chisel to clean out the center.     Trees don't ever grow straight or round so I my not always be ""DEAD CENTER"" but I feel I get close. That's why one side of the drum wall is a little thicker then the rest.   This is my concern: can I turn drums on a lathe even if it is not true center?    I enjoy drilling the first fire hole and burning my drum hollow but I want a faster and cleaner outside. "
1199,Actual KVH sleepers dimensions,I know that for some kinds of lumber there is significant difference in nominal and actual size (for instance 2 by 4).  How is with KVH (dried and glued up construction lumber used in EU)? What are actual dimensions of 60x140x13000mm sleeper? 
1200,Exterior glue for tapered plugs,"[Updated - see pictures below]  I treat joinery in the UK for rot by drilling 10mm holes, injecting fungicide gel, and hammering home a tapered cross-grain oak plug to seal the hole. I've been using exterior-grade PVA smeared on the inside of the hole to fix the plug. After hammering home, I immediately plane the plug flat, while the joint should still be open. After 24 hours, I apply a conventional exterior paint finish.  Revisiting a property I treated 6 years ago, I see that about 25% of the oak plugs have moved enough to crack the paint finish. Not one plug has come loose, but some have moved enough to crack the paint, and that is unsightly, and will let in water. I'd like to fix the plugs more reliably to avoid this. The glue has to work in the UK, which can be hot, wet or freezing.  I asked Loctite if they could recommend anything. They said they weren't sure anything they had would be better than PVA. I need an easy-to-use glue, since I insert thousands of these plugs, often working at height outdoors on old buildings. It's hard to experiment, since all the plugs look great for a long time after the painting. I'd prefer to have just one visit for glue-and-plane-flat, without having to wait for the glue to cure.  What glue can I use? Or what better plugging process can I use?  Update two days later, following great suggestions from answer and comments:  Here is a close-up picture of paint cracking at oak plugs in 2016. These are oak plugs hammered into an oak frame and glued with with pva in 2010. The frame was made about 1939. Actually what species of oak was used for plugs or frame is not known. The paint is Dulux weathershield Exterior high gloss over Dulux weathershield undercoat (I think this was just after the shift from old-style high-VOC paint to low-VOC paint, and before the takeover by AzkoNobel, but I may be mistaken).    Looking closely, I can't see any evidence there that the plugs have moved out of the holes. It is, as others have suggested, paint cracking at the boundary between the woods, despite the fact that the grain is aligned and the woods are vaguely the same. So my plea for better glue is not useful.  I found it hard to take photos of plugs that haven't cracked because they're so hard to see! Here's just one:    I have a suspicion that the reason that did not crack is there may be a smear of epoxy over it. That plug is oak in softwood. The softwood had major rot, and I filled a big hole nearby with Repair Care Dry Fix and Dry Flex 4-pack epoxy. That sticks very strongly to wood and flexes with it, and a smear might well stop the cracking.  @bowlturner suggested that different woods might be to blame. I did start off long ago trying to match plug wood to frame wood, despite having to custom-make all the plugs. But I gave up because the softwood plugs tended to break up as they were hammered in. They need to be pretty strong to stand up to the insertion process, especially halfway up a building in a gale. It may well be true that oak in softwood tends to crack paint more than oak in oak. But oak in oak does crack too.  @Graphus suggests filler. The only filler I have found that does not crack with time (and I hope that means decades) is the Repair Care 4-pack system. That would probably work, but the setting time is such that the fungicide gel will probably leak out before I can get the hole filled. I would have to plug the hole and leave a gap at the surface to fill - I will think about that.  Much thanks to everyone for the ideas! Keep them coming if anyone has anything more. Meanwhile, I will tick the answer from Graphus because it contains much wisdom. "
1201,Are there any best practices when using dado blades or stack?,"I recently got an 8"" dado set for my table saw, and was a little nervous about using it without the normal safety equipment I usually have in place (primarily a riving knife), especially since they've been deemed ""dangerous"" enough to be banned in Europe. I want to approach my use of the set with a thorough understanding of the dangers involved. Are there general guidelines of what to do/not do with a dado set installed?  For example:   Can I cut dadoes with the work piece against the fence, or should I strictly use a miter gauge or crosscut sled? Obviously using both the fence and miter gauge at the same time would still be a kickback risk. Are through cuts a definite no-no with dado stacks? If I need to make one quick one, should I just go through the hassle of switching out the dado stack, reinstalling my regular blade and safety equipment?   So far, I've made a zero-clearance insert to replace my standard insert so there isn't a gaping hole in my saw table around the blade. "
1202,What is the benefit to gluing boards together instead of buying a thicker board?,"It seems rather common practice for woodworkers on YouTube to combine smaller boards into larger boards, and then milling the larger board down to the size they want.

1204,Building a wooden arcade stick case,"This is my very first DIY project, I am building an arcade stick:        Rubber feet will be attached to those 4 holes.  Now I do not have tools for any woodwork at home (will buy once I do start doing more DIY!). I plan on sending the template to a wood CNC workshop (2 dimensional cutting) and they will cut the wood out for me. So careful planning and screw hole sizes are important here. I will be using tapered M4-30/35 (thread: 1.41) screws mostly.   Materials used: Birch plywood, Clear Polycarbonate Top 3mm, Clear Acrylic Bottom 2mm.    When drilling screw holes for acrylic should I make it slightly larger than the actual diameter of the screw hole so that it does not crack? e.g. 4.0~4.1mm. I can only find pilot hole guide for plywood but not acrylic or polycarbonate sheets. Depth of the screw hole for the birch plywood. Would 3/4"" suffice or should I drill same length as the length of the screw since it is hard wood? I am trying to minimise screws showing. Will this setting be strong enough? I am concerned about 2mm acrylic panel wobbling especially.     Many thanks in advance. "
1205,What is this turning process on the woodworking Wikipedia page?,"I was looking for a simple way to describe woodworking and I found myself glancing the wiki page for it. The pictures on the side were intriguing. Particularly one showing one (two?) gentlemen turning some wood.     The caption I did not find particularly helpful as it more described what they were making more than how they were doing it.      Damascene woodworkers turning wood for mashrabia and hookahs, 19th century.   We can see the turner using his left hand and foot to hold the blade against some sort of tool rest (or the frame of the turning box). It appears his right hand is holding something like a bow which I will assume is what is literally turning the wood.  The other man is supervising as best I can tell.   What are the tools being used to turn here? Does the process have a special name in this context or is it simply a form of traditional turning? "
1206,What tools could I use to cut a turned chair leg in half vertically?,"My uncle was recently trying to fix up a cabinet that used to belong to my grandfather for my mother. It used to be part of a modular set and you attached the same drawer set on each end.   Since she only had the one my uncle wanted to embellish the outer edges with chair legs. He then told me he basically tried to cut them in half free hand with the table saw. While he didn't hurt himself he did say ""Never doing something that stupid again.""  What could you do to cut a turned chair leg in half? Table saw and band saw come to mind but the leg will not have the same dimensions from top to bottom. Cutting a dowel in half could just be a matter of a 45 degree box jig but that wouldn't work here exactly? Also would be hard to secure it given the round curves and what not.  "

On top of the carcass is going to be a piece of plywood, and on top of that a laminated solid wood plank top of 3/4"" thick planks. The plywood is to provide enough support for the overhang so I don't have to install corbels or legs.  I painted the plywood underside before attaching it. After I painted it, it cupped. I screwed the plywood down and now one corner kicks upwards a little.   Is there some way that I can make this plywood lay out flat?

1210,Invisible join between two 200x200 beams on a support,"I'm an IT'er with some experience in woodworking, looking to build his own backyard porch. It should eventually look something like this;   I'm pondering now on how to make the connection between the large top front beams. They measure 200mm x 200mm and ideally I don't want to see any screws or bolts.  What I want to do:  There should be two lag screws in each of the notches on either end of each beam that connect them to the vertical support. I can then fill the notch with a custom fit piece of wood. I can then also screw the custom fit piece to the beams for extra support from the top.  Do you think this will be strong enough?

These are display pieces that will not be used outdoors and that I want to make very shiny. My goal is maximum preservation and presentation. Something that will last forever and look amazing.  It seems for each step different materials can be used, and I don't know which is best suited for a display stick, and I'm also wondering if I should harden it. Can someone talk me through the steps and provide the best materials and methods for my stated purpose?  After cutting the wood and I have to seal the ends immediately. What should I use to seal and where do I go from there? How long should I leave it to dry (I have plenty of time - is a year to dry the optimal choice for a display staff and cane?). Should I harden it before or after drying? Where do I go from there? And what maintenance does it need to last forever?  Thanks  Note: I do not want to add any carvings or color to my sticks and want to preserve but round any knobs or protrusions.     the reason I ask here on Stack Exchange is because I've read umpteen websites telling me umpteen different materials and methods on how to make walking (not display) sticks but need an expert opinion to help me choose which of those materials and methods is the best for a display stick  "
1212,Pore/Grain Filler Over Danish Oil,"I have two slabs:   redwood some kind of hard wood that I think resembles a red gum wood   I have coated them in Danish Oil and this coating has been allowed to dry for over 10 days.  My long term goal is a smooth texture with high gloss.  So my plan is to apply wipe on poly - clear gloss by minwax.  To this end, I've been using the underside of each slab as a test bed for the topside of each slab.  Currently, I'm practicing the technique of applying wipe on poly and building up a film.  I've applied 8 coats to the underside of each slab and am noticing that the pores/grain in both are still evident and tactile.    Below are two images of the underside of each slab respectively (after 8 coats of wipe on poly).  With an eye to the road ahead, specifically the topside processing of each slab I have the following questions:   Do I need to just keep applying poly until the pores/grain fill? If ""no"" to (1) above, is it possible to apply a pore/grain filler over Danish Oil? If ""yes"" to (2), what are recommendations for manufacturer/product/color to use on each of the slabs? If ""no"" to (2), will buffing and then polishing using a paste wax by minwax post-applying 7 or so wipe-on-poly layers fill the pores/grain? If ""no"" to (4), any alternatives not mentioned?

1214,Filling large gaps,"I have made a router table fence with a ""dust extraction"" feature:      As you can see there are gaps that would make the ""box"" not air tight. I need to use some kind of foam to fill those gaps.   The gaps are around 2-3 mm (5/64 - 1/8 inches) wide.  It doesn't need to be pretty, there isn't much mechanical stress, obviously it doesn't need to be food safe.  What solution/foam/etc would you recommend?

1215,How is this engraving obtained?,  I thought it could be laser but the wood is exposed raw inside the letters.   Could this be obtained with a router and a template?

1216,"Is shellac that has been dissolved with methyl hydrate (methanol) toxic, once dry?","I've dissolved de-waxed shellac flakes in methyl hydrate (which contains methyl alcohol), and I would like to know if the alcohol retains some of its toxicity after it has dried. Intuitively it's so volatile that I don't think anything remains, but I'm not sure.  Note on methyl hydrate vs denatured alcohol: Before I purchased this product, I thought methyl hydrate was the same thing as ""denatured alcohol"" (aka ""methylated spirits""). Although the two types of solvent are interchangeable in function when it comes to dissolving shellac, it seems they are very different chemically -- with methyl hydrate being apparently methanol, and denatured alcohol (aka methylated spirits) being ethanol mixed with another type.    In the particular case of the product I used, ""Methyl Hydrate"", there are no ingredients listed on the back label. The front mentions ""99.9%"" pure. Pure of what? Just methanol, or pure mix of 99.9% ethanol with methanol? The fluid from this bottle is transparent. I've seen purple ones too in videos, but maybe they were denatured alcohol.  I've sent an email to their support. But received no reply yet, after a week.  Possible Substitutes?   95% grain (drinking) alcohol from the liquor cabinet. Nothing more concentrated than 95% is sold in my area. It might not be concentrated enough, and might contain sugars. Bad idea? 99% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol from the medicine cabinet? Bad idea?   Edit: Feedback from the local poison center  Before posting this question, I'd initially wiped a surface with a methyl-hydrated rag in preparation of applying shellac. And I stopped in my tracks, realising it was perhaps the wrong solvent to use.  I placed a (very quick) call to my local poison center, (Vancouver BC, Canada), to determine what to do after spilling methyl hydrate on food contact surfaces (like a kitchen counter, dining table, or wooden cutting board). They made several (somewhat controversial) recommendations:   methanol is highly toxic. should wear adequate protection. sure. methanol ""does not just evaporate"". This claim is dubious, but I figured they assumed it had been mixed with water, or booze. Methanol is water soluble, after all. When I mentioned that it was precisely the point of pure methanol as a solvent, i.e. to  evaporate quickly, they seemed perplexed. And it made me very suspicious about the veracity of the other claims. in the case of the wooden cutting board. they mentioned it would be preferable to just discard it, or clean it thoroughly with dish soap. For a plastic cutting board, they suggested a run through the dishwasher. For a melamine counter top, they suggested cleaning it thoroughly with water and soap. I would have expected them to suggest letting it dry, followed by cleaning, but that would have been a surprising answer, given (2). At least there was some consistency.  "

1219,Is the MT2 Arbor for a Drill Chuck milled incorrectly?,"I'm not necessarily new to woodworking, but new to lathes.  I've borrowed a Rikon 70-100 lathe from a friend. It has a MT2 receiver in the tail stock, and currently has a live center on the tail stock.  To remove the live center, I just rotate the hand wheel on the tail stock counter clockwise far enough to get the internal bar to push the live center out of the tail stock.   I just purchased a drill chuck with MT2 mount  ([website]When I mount the drill chuck in the tail stock, it sits farther out (from the opening in the tailstock) than the live center. Also, the removal process of rotating the hand wheel counter clockwise far enough to get the internal bar to push doesn't work because the end of the mount doesn't reach the internal mechanism.    My measurements I took on the two arbors are:                   small         large Drill Chuck:     0.59665       0.71750 (inches) Live Center      0.57860       0.70330 (inches) Spec             0.5720        0.7000   The lengths are the same.  From what I've found in online specs for MT2 tapers, the small end should be 0.5720"" and the large end 0.7000"".   I think this means that the arbor I have was milled incorrectly, but is this ""within tolerances""?  I don't think so, but I'm not sure.  I think I'm going to return the drill chuck and get a new one, but I wanted to see if y'all thought first.    Lastly, Now that I look at it again, I think the Jacobs drill chuck side may not be right either as the drill chuck doesn't look like it's far enough in.    BTW, here's a pic of the drill chuck (this is after giving it a bit of force (a decent hand push from about 1"" out) to get into the tail stock.    and for reference, here's the live center:   "

1221,The epoxy hardens extremely slowly - what's the cause?,"I'm not sure if this is the right section to ask this question, but I assume at least some of you woodworkers have experience with epoxy. I'm having a problem with 2 gallons of epoxy that I bought for a boat building project. I made a test batch, and the epoxy is hardening extremely slow. The specifications say the pot time is 22 minutes, but even after 2 hours, the batch is still liquid, as if I just mixed it. It takes ~4 hours for it to start turning to gel. After 24 hours, it is like soft rubber. After 48 hours, it's like hard rubber, but still not hard enough for sanding.   Things I checked and tried:   The ratio is dead on. Specification calls for 100:44, and I'm mixing 16 gram batches with scales accurate down to 0.01 gram. The ambient temperature is controlled 23 degrees. Specification calls for 20 degrees for nominal cure, so if anything, the epoxy should cure faster, not slower. I suspected that the components have settled too much in their buckets, so I mixed them before using. Didn't help. Epoxy was bought 4 months ago, so it's definitely not expired. Epoxy was always stored indoors, in nominal conditions (never frozen or anything). No contamination either.   I called the seller, suspecting that maybe he shipped the wrong hardener, but he swore on his mother that everything is correct, and the batches are labeled in the factory. He tried to persuade me that what I'm seeing is normal, and refused to send another batch (even if he did want to, I would have to wait ~2 months for it, and there is no other epoxy supplier in my country.)  I have a bit of experience with epoxy, yet I've never seen anything like this. What could be the problem? Can somebody please advise?  P.S. The brand of the epoxy is Barrikade EP-TP. "

1229,Wood Still Rough After Finish,"Preface - I'm a woodworking novice.  I applied a polycrylic finish to an Ikea Gerton (solid beech wood) table top.  I only lightly sanded with 220 by hand before applying the finish. I wasn't aiming to smooth the wood as I was under the impression the finish would smooth things out based on the following:     The whole idea with sanding the wood is not necessarily to get it as smmoth [sic] as glass. Rather, its to give the wood a clean, even, and scratch-free appearance. [...] Sanding up to 400 really isnât going to give you a smoother finish in the end. Because after the first coat of finish is applied, you are no longer dealing with the raw wood. You are dealing with the finish.   Source  However after applying 3 coats, with a light 220 hand sanding between coats, the wood feels pretty much the same as before applying the finish.  Should I have sanded more before applying the finish or did I do something wrong in the application?    Would sanding the finish help achieve a smoother feel to the surface? If so any tips would be appreciated. "
1230,Is support on three sides of a long poplar bookshelf enough?,"I'm hoping to install a 94"" wide, 8"" deep, 1/2"" thick bookshelf made of poplar in a location surrounded by three walls.  Thanks to the three walls, it would be painless to support the shelf on boards attached to studs at both ends, and along the full length of the rear 94"" edge.  Because the shelf will be in a ""showy"" area of my home, and because the underside of the shelf will be visible when coming up a staircase, I'm hoping to keep the installation tidy, without unnecessary brackets.  Because I'm matching an existing built-in ""pedestal-top"" shelf below, I want to stick with stained poplar, rather than a harder wood.  I don't have a good instinct for whether simply supporting the shelf along three edges will be enough to keep an 8""-deep poplar board from sagging over time, when fully loaded with books.  Any thoughts on whether three-edge support will be enough? Or might it call for a bracket or two for additional support?  Edit: I'm intending to securely attach the shelf to ""rails"" made of the same 1/2"" poplar, which would in turn be securely attached to wall studs. "
1231,"Can I use a hidden wedge tenon joint in 2""thick pine?","The plan is to take some live edge pine, chop a square mortise in it, and use a hidden wedge in the tenon of the legs (poplar 1.5"").   Is this too thin? Unnecessary? It would be for side tables.  "
1232,How do cabinet makers achieve seamless joins,"How do cabinet makers achieve a seamless fit when joining panels with dowels to make up their furniture?  The dowels obviously help align the panels perfectly, but to avoid a half millimetre gap along the join (between the panels), is anything extra needed such as hammering in thin nails or gluing the actual panels? "
1233,What can a plunge router do that a fixed router cannot?,"I am a beginning woodworker, and I'm thinking about buying a router later this year. I note that fixed base routers are somewhat cheaper than plunge routers, which is attractive to me. As such, I'm curious to know what one can do with a plunge router that you cannot do with a fixed base router (and some patience). Is the plunge mechanism really just a convenience / time saver? Or are there tasks that can only be done with a plunge router? "
1234,How to fix white splotches on pine from wood filler?,"total newbie here. First wood project is turning a live edge piece of pine into a kitchen island, but I think I've run into a problem.  I wanted to fill holes with this wood filler,    but I covered some large areas with it because I assumed I could just sand it off:  Now that I've finished sanding, there are quite a few spots that have white splotches from the wood filler, like this:   Is there anything I can do to fix it? Sanding more doesn't seem to help.  Also, secondary question: what will happen if I don't use a wood conditioner before staining? "
1235,"Lacquer, persistent brush marks","So I'm 6 coats deep and cannot get the lacquer to settle flat. I think the lacquer is just drying too fast for me to adequately put enough on before it starts to set, it's a desktop of 2 feet by 4.5 feet.   I've tried sanding between coats and even going over a new coat with thinner to make it really wet, but the bristle streaks always come through. The surface feels entirely smooth to the touch, but the streaks are real.   I've read that when people are using shellac for french finishes they move on to sanding with progressively finer sand paper with a final round of polishing. Is that what people usually do after reaching their desired number of coats or is this just totally misapplied?  What am I doing wrong here?  EDIT:  Materials:   Watco ""Crystal Clear"" gloss lacquer Wooster 3-inch White China, flat brush Klean Strip lacquer thinner   Original process:   Apply coat thick enough such that the brush would glide with no friction across surface After coat was dried, it was sanded with 420-grit sandpaper until surface was smooth and flat to the touch, then another coat was applied Final coat with no sanding   Altered process:   Apply coat as before. Then I would go over the coat with lacquer thinner in an attempt to get the lacquer to stay liquid and coalesce Sand as before, then apply another coat with lacquer thinner Final coat with lacquer thinner but no sanding     "
1236,Stabilizer or hardener for handmade wooden canes,I have been using a wood hardener and so far that has been working. Should I be using a stabilizer instead?  More generally put: when fabricating a walking stick or walking cane what is the best product to use to stop the ends from splitting? A stabilizer or a hardener? 
1237,FIlling up gaps in an old wooden floor,"I'm currently in the process of renewing an old wooden floor. What would one use to fill in the gaps between the planks?    I've asked in the local home repair store and they gave me a silicone like mass that resembles the color of the wood.  That seems to work ok for the nail holes, but is kind of soft and somewhat expensive for filling out all space between the boards.  I have seen some youtube videos in which people are mixing sand dust with either wood glue or some special liquid. Does anyone know something on the pros and conns of these approaches? "
1238,Cutting curved box legs,"I'm a fairly amateur woodworker, and I'd like to make a particular box, a picture of which I keep seeing floating around. It seems reasonably simple, but I'm struggling a little with the legs. Two sides are straight, and the front is curved.  [website]I'm not entirely sure how to do this, and there are no plans - just a picture. Anyone have thoughts? Router? Jig? Something else entirely? "
1239,Is it hopeless to glue together two parts of oiled butcher block countertop?,"I just got this oiled butcher block counter top yesterday, and I'm planning to on one end glue it to a another part of the same wood, cut shorter.  I have heard that glue won't stick well on oiled wood, is this true? Is there any special kind of glue that works better, or a treatment I can apply to get it to stick better?  The sides will be glued together on the long side, seen on the left in the image below.  I will fasten both pieces of wood to the counter below, so the glue won't be carrying much weight, but it would still be nice if I could get a seamless transition.   "
1240,Sealer and Clear Top-Coat for wooden sign/art,"Two questions:   1) What Base-Coat do you recommend  2) What Cristal Clear top coat do you recommend  Background: I was at a craft show, and a guy that made wood signs for outdoor patios was there. He had very nice signs. He said he could make a custom sign for me. It's been over three weeks, and a few emails/calls... he has disappeared from the face of the earth... so I am going to tackle the job myself.  I recall he described using Auto paints, then coating with an Automotive Clear Coat... and his signs really ""popped!"" I mean his geckosâ, Bird, they had a great shinny Depth to them.  SO, I want to make a ""Campsite Sign."" It will be on a wooden post, outside for one or two weeks every few months. So not too much weathering. But, will get moderate rain &amp; Sun.  I intend to:    use a marine grade 2ft x 2ft finished top-grade plywood  bevel the edges for better/even coating  sand all smooth  apply a Base or Sealer coat (U recommend which?)  brush paint with Rustoleum Gloss paints  apply a ""Cristal Clear top-coat"" that will give a rich/pop look (U recommend which?)   I'd prefer base/primer and Clear top-coat to be buyable local, (Depot, Lowes, etc) but ordering is okay if needed.  I will be using Brushes, as I don't have a sprayer, and don't do this enough to invest in one now.  Any other Tips-n-Hints gladly accepted.  Thanks for your imput.  Paul L.  Florida   "
1241,Planing thin material to consistent thickness using hand tools,"Is there a special tool/setup for achieving a consistent thickness of thin stock that leaves a planed/smooth finish? Something like I imagine is used for Kumiko members?   [website]I roughly imagine something like a thickness planer except without the spinning blade. Or maybe there's a way to clamp blocks to the side of a plane or something such that the blade no longer engages when the target thickness is achieved?  It seems like there would need to be some sort of mechanism in the role the pressure rollers play in a thickness planer, to keep the thin stock from being lifted off the bench or reference surface in response to the planing action. "
1242,Farmer Table Legs,"Starting on a farmer's table and have it all how I want it designed, but I'm looking for assurance on my method of attaching the legs. I don't have a bountiful workshop, but I do have a table saw and dado blade!  This table top will be 8' long, 43.5"" wide, and 29.5"" high, contstructed of 2x8 boards with 2 perpendicular 2x8 ends. The apron will be constructed of 1x4s and will be 90"" long and 37.5"" wide, to allow for 3"" overhang of the top. There will be a brace half way along the length, and an additional 4 slats to support and help mount the top to it.  For the legs, I intend to ""tendon"" .75"" x 3.5"" off two adjoining sided of the legs, thus notching them to slide into the corners and be flush with the apron. I can then attach an angled cut of wood across the corners, stopping horizontal movement.   My problem is then how to stop vertical movement. I am currently thinking about drilling the angled cut into the leg, screwing in a threaded rod (like a headless lag bolt?) and then keeping it secure with washer and nut. Would this work, or is there another way?   "
1243,Tips for Jointing Reclaimed Barnwood Table Top,"Finally broke down and decided to give this current fad a try. For anyone that is experienced in working with reclaimed wood, do you have any tips for edge jointing and getting a decently flat top? I want to keep as much of the character in wood as possible but still have a good solid top.   Here's what I'm working from:    Looking to get to something in the neighborhood of this:    Note,  2nd picture is from Sons of Sawdust.  After searching the internet for tutorials, instructional material, it seems almost overwhelming with the amount of opinion out there. Just looking for a good place to start I guess with reclaimed joinery. I've done some panel glue ups before but always focused on planing to get dead flat faces and dead square (or complimentary edges). How does that change when working with reclaimed wood?  Also, any general advice on this project is appreciated.  "
1244,Cheap or Expensive sandpaper?,"I read on all the different types like aluminum oxide, silicone carbide, etc. And the open coat closed coat. But what about price? Is, say, a pack of 5 sheets (assorted) for [tex]10?  Note: I do sanding on both hardwood and softwood regularly. Thru hand sanding, palm sanding, and belt sanding (depending on the case). "
1245,what do you do when the two sides of a mortise hole don't line up exactly?,"I am working on hand tool skills and building a workbench. The Paul Sellers workbench that he has videos of on youtube. I find that as I am chopping my mortises my chisel wants to turn to one side or the other. I am using a bevel edge chisel not a mortise chisel and using the Paul Sellers technique. The mortise is a through mortise so I work it from both sides, the twisting of the chisel I try and correct for as I go along, at one point I re-ground the bevel to make sure it wasn't the problem.  Anyways all that to say the holes from one side don't line up perfectly from the other and I am trying to decide what my solution should be to fix this. Should I widen the mortise on each side? cut thick tenons and pair them down till they fit? Any suggestions would be helpful. Sorry for the extra long question.  "
1246,Safety - Cutting multiple pieces at the same time,"I'm barely a novice carpenter, in fact all the wood work that I do is for my college's technical theater program, but I'm handy with saws, and other power tools.  I've been told by many people I work with that I should never cut more than one piece of wood on the miter saw at a time. I think this is ridiculous. When I ask them to explain how its more dangerous, nobody has a good answer.  It seems to me that if I need two pieces of identical length, I should cut them at the same time. If they're small enough, maybe three in one cut.  So my question to you all: Is it dangerous to cut multiple pieces of wood on a miter saw in one cut? What about other powered saws? "
1247,Refinishing - how much to sand,I'm refinishing a bakers box and it has some scratches and tape over it.  Am I supposed to sand the stain off or just the poly?    I generally like the color. I could darken it a shade to a darker walnut.  It seems to have a lot of nooks so I think sanding off the stain would be a risk.  How deep should i sand to refinish this?  Could I just take off the coat of poly and stain a bit darker?  What should grit should i use to remove it?  General thoughts?          
1248,How to fill gaps in mirror frame corners?,"I made a mirror frame and even though tried to adjust the saw at the right angle, the corners still have gaps in them.  What's a good way to fill those: caulking or filler? Before or after hanging (I'm planning to liquid nail it directly to the mirror)? Any particular brand recommendations?     "
1249,Box joints for this table with just jigsaw and chisel?,"I'm planning on replicating this side table.     It looks nice, but of course from a stability point of view that is probably one of the worst table designs to come up with ;). A lot of force is on those box joints, of course this is just a couch table for some glasses and a bowl of chips, but still.  I'm pretty new to woodworking, and only have an electric jigsaw at the moment, a manual saw and will get some chisels.  If I work carefully will it be possible to make the joints fit well enough to make the table as stable as it needs to be? Or would I really need precision machines like a table saw with box joint jig? I'm aware this will be quite a bit of work... Any tricks to make this easier?  Also, does the wood used matter much? The example table is made from    acacia, but I would prefer birch. Is there a difference in hardness, for example? "
1250,What makes a high quality bench plane?,"What is the difference between a high-quality (e.g. [tex]20) bench plane?  The two obvious things that come to mind are blade quality (specifically, how well it holds an edge) and the amount of out-of-the box setup required (e.g. lapping the base, cleaning off grease, sharpening the blade). But what if we replaced the blade in the cheap plane with the same high quality blade and a skilled worker tuned both planes? Is it just ergonomics &amp; looks after that, or are there other qualities which set apart high quality (or even mid quality?) planes? "
1251,Are oils sufficient for the last step of finishing?,"So I have stained and oiled my project (well... oiling is ongoing right now for me buts lets pretend!). Is that it? Am I done? Assuming it is fully cured my project is complete? This is not a question of appearance or aesthetics as that is subjective. More of can the oil survive as the outer finish.  Most of the projects I work on just use white wood, like pine, and the odd one I get lucky with an oak pallet. I don't know if the wood in use matters. Can oiling be the final step in finishing a project or do I need to throw a coat of varnish, or some other finish, on it?  The pictures in this answer show some works with just oil and other with oil and varnish or lacquer. That suggest is could work if I just leave the oil.   If I leave the oil and pass of the project to another person for their use can they get away with not oiling it themselves? This is not a butcher block or bread board but a piece of furniture. Any other implications to consider beyond that?  "
1252,Accidentally used steel wool before water based poly,"I'm finishing my black walnut table top. I have already applied 2 coats of Old Masters Tung Oil Varnish. After this second coat, I began sanding about half the table top with 0000 steel wool before my water based poly arrived and I read the instructions.  So, I didn't know not to use steel wool before applying water based polyurethane. It makes total sense now that I think about it.   I still haven't applied the poly yet. I have attempted to remove these small fibers by wiping the top with an old t-shirt, and the top feels very smooth.   Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do to get these steel fibers out completely? "
1253,How to setup joint proportions?,"I am a brand new woodworker and I would like to know how to setup joint proportions correctly.  I've watched many videos on various joint techniques, but most won't teach you about the proper measurements required. The only consistent advice I find is keep dovetail length about equal to board thickness. And keep dovetail ratios between 1:6 and 1:8.        Disclaimer 1: This is my first time setting up a joint of any kind, so please take it easy on me :)      Disclaimer 2: This is not about the half lap dovetail in specific. I am curious to know about the joint setup/layout process involved in approaching any joint.     For this hardwood joint, I've chosen 1:8.  Here's the process I used:  If the board is 48x48 mm, I said ""let's call that 1 unit"". From there, I mostly made decisions based on fractions of the unit. 1/4 unit = 12 mm, and 1/2 unit = 24 mm, etc. I wiggled things around until they looked like most stuff I've seen elsewhere.    My Question(s):  The joint above looks like a half lap dovetail joint, but how well would it function like one ?  Is there any basic science/math to picking dimensions for the joints ?  What techniques do you use to layout a joint from scratch ? "
1254,Reusing mineral spirits?,"So right now I have a paintbrush sitting in a small jar to clean my brush of poly. Once I take the brush out what can I do with the left over spirits? Would seem a waste to get rid of it.   To what extent, if any, can I reuse mineral spirits? It is possible, given their similar nature, that the answer would apply to paint thinner as well.  "
1255,Blue/Greyish look after sanding polyurethane coat,"I applied my first coat of General Finishes water based poly last night.  But now after sanding with a 3M finishing pad, I am seeing blueish fogginess on the table top.  It doesn't seem to be dust, since I can't wipe it off.  Will this go away in the next coat? If not, how do I fix this? Thanks in advance  To prep this top, I first sanded to 220 grit. Also, I applied two coats of Old Masters. Tung Oil Varnish  The blueish gray bits are visible on the left side of the image.   "
