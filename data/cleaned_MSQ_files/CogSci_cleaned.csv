0,How do you randomize within a Qualtrics form without breaking timing?,"My current survey has a number of blocks. Each of those blocks contains a bunch of questions, each on their own page with a page break, and each with an associated timing question to limit time spent filling it out. I'd like to randomize the order of these questions, but not randomize the order of the timing questions. Right now, if I just randomize the entire block, the timing questions will get shuffled too.   Essentially my blocks look like this:     ---- (page break)         timing question   quiz question                  timing question   quiz question                  timing question   quiz question         ---- etc..   In the above example, I'd like to randomize the order of questions 2, 4, and 6.   Any suggestions on how to do this? Previously when this has been asked it has been suggested to put the questions into blocks and then randomize the order of the blocks, as in here: How to randomise order of survey items in Qualtrics where some items have to appear together?.   This is not really a workable solution for me - it would result in a really unwieldy number of blocks and a very hard to modify and upkeep survey.  "
1,What does fMRI data look like after pre-processing?,"I wish to know what fMRI data looks like after preprocessing.  My Understanding  My understanding is that fMRI is MRI in time dimension that is we have repeated scans of brain volume. A voxel is a unit if measurement in fMRI because BOLD signal is measured on a typical voxel in different regions of the brain using gradient of the High frequency signal.  For example if we have fMRI scans say of D ADHD patients, V voxels and T time points in a fMRI study then how the fMRI data after pre-processing would be arranged in a matrix form.  If we assume that it is organized in D x V x T then we have a 3D scan of each brain on a time dimension. Since each 3D scan consists of voxels in the brain, and voxels are cubes that have 6 values around them, then where are those 6 values?   If a voxel is a cube, does it have a single value, or 6 potentially different values on each face? I know voxels have coordinates like that in the MNI coordinate system. "
2,How does aging effect performance at maths and science?,"How does aging effect performance at maths and science? Clearly, it effects intelligence as measured by iq tests. But I wondered, is that reflected in e.g. mathematicians invariably doing their best work when younger? "
3,Raven Progressive Matrix: why's my chosen square wrong?,"Source: Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count (2009). pp. 7-8.             The example that the problem-solver must follow is set up by the two figures in the top row of the left panel. The figure at the left in the bottom row then specifies what has to be transformed in order to solve the problem. The six figures on the right correspond to the answer alternatives. The solution of the problem requires you to notice that the figure in the upper left of the left panel is a diamond and the figure in the upper right is a square. This tells you that the answer has to be a square. Then you must notice that the bottom half of the upper diamond is divided into two, with the left portion in black. The fact that the left half of the figure on the right is also black tells you that the corresponding portion of the square on the bottom right must match the corresponding portion in the lower left diamond-that is, the entire bottom half must be black. Then you notice that to make the top right figure, one of the bars has been removed from the top left diamond while symmetry of the bars has been preserved. This establishes that you must remove one of the bars of the square at the bottom while preserving symmetry. Now you know that the correct answer must be the square at the bottom right of the answer panel.    My attempt    Between #1 and 2, 2 orange lines remain, the blue is removed, and nothing is added. So in #3, the 2 orange lines remain. #3 has no blue middle line that can be removed. So how can the right answer be #5, where the green line has been added to #3? "
4,Why aren't any advancements being made in physically diagnosing Bipolar and other psychiatric disorders?,"I was involved in a discussion where somebody had asked if others had thoughts of doing risky things during their manic episodes. Two people commented, including myself. I worried that only relying on a specific set of guidelines established by the diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders fifth edition could lead to disastrous consequences.  Let's say somebody came into a psychiatrist's office. The person has previously read the DSMV and understands the criteria. That person played their cards right to convince the psychiatrist to diagnose them with Bipolar Disorder, when in truth that person might not likely have it at all. Instead, their true motive would have been to get free benzos so they could space out and get high.  On the other end of the spectrum, some people have been misdiagnosed, leading to unwanted and unnecessary medications.  For both of these situations, why can't blood tests and other physical and objective means be used to insure that neither party is in doubt? You can't lie on a blood test or magneto encephalogram, so why not this? "
5,What's the psychological concept behind mobile game design and marketing?,"I see a very common trend in how every mobile game is being designed and advertised on the market.   The common features are (not limited to):   Very cartoony graphics (big heads small bodies) Characters standing on the side of every presentation screenshot Overblown attitude of characters, characters show very exaggerated  facial expressions whether it be angry or classy. Very simplistic captions and feature descriptions like ""choose your weapon"",  ""kill your enemy"", ""build your empire"" Flashy graphics with colourful and glowing stuff, often exaggerated to the levels that its visually overwhelming   I am currently clueless how such marketing and design appeal to anyone? Is it aimed at children (by eventually making their parents pay for in game purchases)? Personally for me its quite repulsive, but since every other game is following it they must be doing something right?  "
6,When your two eyes disagree sharply,"Now and then, the image from each eye is so different from the other that it seems the brain has trouble combining them into a coherent image. You can create this situation by putting a hand or sheet or paper in front of one eye, then moving it about an inch away. If you open one eye at a time, you see the obstruction with one and what it obstructs with the other. If you keep both eyes open, you see a composite where the obstruction appears translucent or transparent in parts.  I've been curious about this phenomenon. Is there a name for it? Is it clear why the brain handles it this way, producing a seemingly impossible object, and not some other way? "
7,Convolutional Operations in the Visual Cortex,"One of the fundamental operations in image neural networks is the operation of convolution, where a filter slides across the receptive field, activating on particular features. This is incredibly useful because it allows us to recycle filters, without having to train neurons on each piece of the receptive field.   It seems like such an operation is mechanically impossible within the human visual cortex. From the paper How does the brain solve visual object recognition - DiCarlo, et. al.,  the brain opts to instead use a massive amount of neurons in each layer, most of which are redundant in that many neurons detect the same feature at different locations. This is clearly unscalable to apply everywhere, so only about 10% of the visual field concentrates these neurons.   On the other hand, we do have the ability to perform convolutions by moving our eyes. So in effect, we can jitter our eyes thereby applying the same neurons to different parts of the scene infront of us. I would think that this, combined with short-term memory can help us process images.      Suppose I force a subject to focus their eyes on the   center of some common object (e.g. a car), such that the object is   within the center 10% of our visual field. Are there situations where   the brain is unable to process what the object is, without   jittering our eyes? Said another way, how much visual processing are we able to do without any physical movement of our eyes or head?   I'm interested in understanding this question because I'm not convinced that even the massive amount of neurons in the visual cortex are sufficient for visually parsing the object. Whereas by (even slightly) shifting the object in our vision, the combined featurizations from each location would significantly reduce the computational complexity. "
8,"In general, how does one resolve two competing theories in Psychology?","In looking at a post on twitter from a somewhat well-known psychologist Tal Yarkoni, he references a paper which lists multiple sets of competing theories in Psychology that have not been resolved.    This is interesting to me and related to my question on selecting ""the most well supported"" among competing theories of generalized anxiety disorder (link).  But, I could see this being related in other areas, such as procrastination research where psychologists with different focuses explain the phenomena differently (as elaborated in this video.)  As an aspiring research scientist, I am curious what it takes today to resolve competing theories in Psychological science?  I read that it may take a joint research paper between the authors of the differing theories with conditions of what defines sufficient evidence, but certainly there must be another way, because some authors may be deceased, unavailable, etc.  Moreover, why might these disputations, it seems like there are 13 of them (26 theories in total), some dating back to the 50s, still be unresolved today?  I think this question should be germane to the topic, because in a meta post here, the moderator agrees that meta-science posts are fair questions for this site. "
9,What is the evidence that mathematicians are more likely to have autistic traits than the rest of the population?,"Baron-Cohen has conducted extensive studies [1,2] examining the prevalence of autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) and mathematical or scientific ability. Most of these studies, however, have focused mostly on (Cambridge) undergraduates or winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad.  In one study, Baron-Cohen found in [2] that Olympiad winners scored the highest in the AQ test ([tex]), with the second highest scoring group being the mathematics students ([tex]).[tex] This leads one to conjecture that autistic traits may be more prominent among individuals with higher mathematical ability.  Question: What is the population evidence[tex] around autism/autistic traits in mathematics? If possible, at the postgraduate level in professional mathematicians?    Disclaimer: There is a another question focused on the postgraduate maths skill set: Is there any evidence for the distinction between undergrad and postgrad mathematics?.   [tex]Note however that the sample is small: [tex] for UK Olympiad winners, [tex] for mathematics students.

10,Noise ceiling estimate is lower than model prediction in RSA?,"I am using representational similarity analyses (RSA) to compare models to some fMRI data. As part of this analysis I have computed noise ceilings for each of my regions of interest (ROIs). What's weird is that, for one ROI, the correlation between my model and the aggregate participant data (RDMs averaged together) is higher than the noise ceiling.  I calculated the noise ceiling by splitting the participant data into two sets, averaging the RDMs from each set and the correlating the two sets to one another. The main model comparisons are done by correlating the model RDM to an averaged RDM from all of the participants.  Given that the noise ceiling is supposed to estimate the performance of a ""hypothetical true model"" and be the upper bound of your prediction accuracy, how should one interpret this?  Given that this is only one ROI, my interpretation is that this region is a little noisier than others and so the between-participant correlation isn't great, but when you aggregate many participants it averages out some of the noise in the data and allows for a decent model correlation. Is that reasonable? "
11,Biologically plausible models for causal inference in the human brain,"Introduction:  In ‘Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?’(2018) Romain Brette argues that the causal structure of neural codes (linear, atemporal) is incongruent with the causal structure of the brain (circular, dynamic). While he clearly explains how neural codes are inappropriate theoretical constructs for behavioural neuroscience experiments it's immediately clear what he means by causal structure.      On the 18th page he explains that:      The causal structure of the brain is sketched on Figure 9A. At a   coarse description level, the brain is a dynamical system coupled to   the environment by circular causality. At a finer description level,   the brain is itself made of neurons, which are themselves dynamical   systems coupled together. To a first approximation, the coupling is   mediated by spikes, which are timed events. In a dynamical system,   state variables have a causal role by construction; examples of state   variables in this physical system are membrane potential and the state   of ionic channels. Spikes have causal effect, but being events they   are not state variables; a spike is something that happens, not a   property of the system.   which is incongruent with concept of a neural code since:      Neural codes abstract time away, but temporality is critical to the   operation of a dynamical system.   It's worth noting that Judea Pearl and other computer scientists have developed practical methods for causal inference [2] but no rigorous notion of causality. For this reason, I think evidence of the brain's causal structure would require a practical dynamical model of the brain on which we can perform causal inference to answer questions in behavioural neuroscience.    Questions:  This leads me to a couple questions:   Are there biologically-plausible dynamical systems models that would qualify? (Might brain network models be sufficient? Ex: [3]) Assuming such models exist, what methods may we use to perform causal inference on these dynamical systems?    After further reflection upon comments due to Bryan Krause I think these two questions may be combined to form a single question:   Are there biologically plausible models for causal inference in the human brain?    Discussion:  Dynamical Systems that build upon neural coding theory:  Brette's notion of causal structure for the brain appears to be in direct opposition with that of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle [4] whose formalism builds upon neural coding theory:      Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of   optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the   sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal   regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those   underlying cell assembly formation.   However, in [5] Karl Friston argues that a dynamical system like the brain can encode sequences of events via attractors:      ...the basic idea is that the environment unfolds as an ordered sequence   of spatio-temporal dynamics, whose equations of motion induce   attractor manifolds that contain sensory trajectories. Critically, the   shape of the manifold generating sensory data is itself changed by   other dynamical systems that could have their own attractors. If we   consider the brain has a generative model of these coupled attractors,   then we would expect to see attractors in neuronal dynamics that are   trying to predict sensory input. In a hierarchical setting, the states   of a high-level attractor enter the equations of motion of a low-level   attractor in a nonlinear way, to change the shape of its manifold.   This is a plausible hypothesis which suggests that a more sophisticated notion of encoding might be used by the brain where state variables emerge from temporal sequences via attractors. Having said that, Brette's critique of the conventional interpretation of neuronal codes by the majority of behavioural neuroscientists still holds.   Causal Inference vs the metaphysics of Causality:  We can't know the brain itself, only models of the brain that we may use to do experiments. To clarify my first question: Brette says that models based on notions of neural coding wouldn't qualify so what are concrete examples of dynamical systems models that do? My questions are very much designed to move the discussion beyond theory and what could be useful to behavioural neuroscientists. Furthermore, I suspect that it's not possible to define causality without going into metaphysics. This is probably why Judea Pearl chose to develop a theory of causal inference and not a theory of causal methods. Using methods from causal inference you can argue that two causal structures are distinct if: (1) there is a method for causal inference that is applicable to struct A but not struct B (2) there is a method for causal inference for which struct A and struct B give different answers.

12,Do people always decide to do things that they believe will provide them the maximum amount of positive feelings in their conscious life?,Is there any scientific study or theory which supports the following claim? - People always decide to act in accordance with things they believe will guarantee them the maximum amount of positive feelings in their conscious life.

14,Is there any evidence for the distinction between undergrad and postgrad mathematics?,"Baron-Cohen has conducted studies [1,2] investigating whether autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) are related to mathematical or scientific ability. These have, however, focused mostly on (Cambridge) undergraduates or winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad.  Interestingly, Baron-Cohen found in [2] that Olympiad winners scored the highest in the AQ test ([tex]), with the second highest scoring group being the mathematics students ([tex]).[tex] This leads one to conjecture that autistic traits may be more prominent among individuals with higher mathematical ability.  While investigations on the relationship between autism and mathematical ability have been carried out [3,4], mostly of these focused on students at the undergraduate level or below. Furthermore, these studies may be focused on a completely different skill set than the one required for the practice of research mathematics.  Is there evidence for the distinction between undergraduate and postgraduate skills and studies especially from a biological or psychometric point of view?  Is the level of mathematics as done by undergraduates different from graduate students or professional mathematicians? There are very distinct skills required at various levels for example, a set of skills[tex], such as good writing, abstract thinking, endurance[tex], creativity, and problem solving for a research project. Is technical ability such as [4] ""mathematical ability"" through arithmetic problems, which focuses only on problem solving, a distinct set of skills that has been shown to be distinct in other studies?    Disclaimer: This question has been split from this one.   [tex]Note however that the sample is small: [tex] for UK Olympiad winners, [tex] for mathematics students.  [tex]Of course, there are also skills which individuals with ASCs may have trouble with, such as socialisation (mathematics is often described as an activity with a large social component by its practitioners).

15,What is the relationship between mathematical ability and autism?,"There have been studies [1],[2] investigating the relationship between autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) and mathematical or scientific ability. In the first study, Baron-Cohen et al (2007) examined 378 undergraduate mathematics students with 414 students from other disciplines (medicine, law, social science). There was a ninefold increase in the rates of autism in the mathematics group compared to the control group (seven cases of autism 1.85% in the math group vs one case of autism 0.24% in the control group).   There is some evidence that seem to indicate that individuals with higher mathematical ability might have more autistic traits. Baron-Cohen has suggested that there is an empathizing–systemizing difference where empathy is mutually exclusive to systematizing or conceptualization but this is hotly contested [3].

What would make parents act like those in the footage? "
18,Does our consciousness die when we go to sleep or fall into a coma?,"I have sometimes wondered if our consciousness dies when we go to sleep at night or perhaps when we enter a deep coma, like from brain damage, for example.  When we wake, or are woken, a new consciousness is booted up with the memories of the previous consciousness, so that it gives the illusion of one continuous consciousness.   This question may be partly philosophical as well as scientific, because it looks at some of the assumptions about the nature of consciousness.  A possibly unfair analogy might be to a computer, when its running it has a memory-set like a consciousness.  And if you shutdown and reboot the computer, then it can continue running as it did before, as if it had never been shut down.  However, once a computer is shut down, its largely inert, though I know there are unimportant edge cases exceptions to this.  The computer is effectively dead when its shut down, its ram has largely dispersed.  We can start the computer back up, but it will really be loading the ram from disk.  The original electrical activity that made up the 'consciousness' of the computer before it was rebooted is effectively dead.  How do we know we don't die when we go to sleep? I mean even if our consciousness doesn't wholly die, we may suffer a partial death of sorts. I could be wrong, but I believe its possible for victims of brain damage to show minimal neural activity.  Rarely, but occasionally some of these victims recover, but perhaps their brain has rebooted their mental ram (if you will). And they may not technically be the same consciousness who fell into the coma, but merely a copy of that consciousness reconstituted from data held in the brain.  Surely plenty have considered this question, has there been any research?  Do we have any kind of answer to this question? "
19,Are women naturally inclined to expose their skin more than men are?,"It is obvious that at least in western culture today, where much personal freedom is accepted or tolerated by society, women often wear clothes different from those worn by men. For example, they tend to expose more skin than men in public (e.g. university, etc.). Here are the links to a few images serving as examples:  [website][website][website][website]How should we interpret such a difference in behavior? Does it reflect some innate difference between the two sexes or is it simply caused by cultural factors?  Two different hypotheses for or against which one may argue:  1) Western women's preference for clothes exposing more skin is at least to some degree driven by their genome, which is, to some degree, different from men's genome.  2) Although women naturally like to be attractive and beautiful, nothing in their genes directly drives them to expose more skin. Social and cultural forces and factors, like peer pressure, are the only major factors which make more exposed skin equal to more beauty/sex appeal in their minds. What is the source of those cultural forces? One possibility is that men's libido has shaped some customs and norms in society through different possible mechanisms. "
20,Supplementary Motor Area or Juxtapositional Lobule Cortex,Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas now calls the 'Supplementary Motor Area' the 'Juxtapositional Lobule Cortex (formerly Supplementary Motor Cortex)'.

21,How does displaying existing votes to a poll influence subsequent voting behaviour?,Some polls involve a question where the existing votes received for each response option are displayed.

22,To what extent do individuals vary in their ability to mentally visualise?,"Background: Yesterday I was shocked when a friend of mine told me that he can see only ""completely black darkness"" when he closes he eyes. When I close my eyes, I can see some images or ""movies"" of what I'm thinking of just now. I don't see the real world. I can ""imagine"" anything I would like, e.g., a car crash or a sunshine or someone who I know or who I do not.  I also can control them in any way: change colors, action, everything. I was sure that anybody on Earth can do it. Indeed, when I asked him if he could ""see"" even a simple figure, e.g., a circle - he couldn't. He said he could not see anything.  Questions:   What is this ""phenomenon"" called where a person cannot mentally visualise images when they close their eyes?  Are there many people who can't see anything with closed eyes?   "

25,Why does it seems in similar cases sometimes classic conditioning happens and in others habituation?,"I'm slightly confused and was hoping you guys could correct me.   In classic conditioning as with Pavlov's dogs if we ring a bell just before a dog is given food, the bell will give the same response for the dog as the food alone would have, such as an excess of saliva. On a cellular level when two cells fire at a similar time one can cause the other cell to fire.  What I don't understand is why this doesn't happen in cases of habituation. So we already have the connection fattening foods taste good and when we eat a burger it should strengthen the connection between this is a fattening food, you like fattening foods you like this burger, but this doesn't happen if we had burgers everyday we get bored of it.  So guys where am I going wrong here? One a cellular level whats going on? "
26,Difference between parallel processing done by human brain and by computers,"I am asking a question regarding parallel processing as done by billions of Neurons inside our brain and parallel processing done by our computers in a cluster for example or even on a Graphics processor having 500 processing cores.  Recently we have seen great success in applying computers to solve complex problems applying parallel processing, such as in the field of scientific simulations, modeling, video/image processing etc.  Also due to limitations on semiconductor devices, chip makers are now forced to develop multi-core CPUs. This encourages and motivates software developers to apply parallel programming to gain the required performance, exploiting all the processing cores inside the CPU.   While people are encouraging to solve problems using parallel programming on the computers, at the same time generally discouraging to do parallel processing inside the brain. Expert say that we must concentrate in one dimension to get best results. Why can't human brains be used to do massive parallel processing in the same way computers are doing today? The brain is having billions of computational units called Neurons, and thus it provides an opportunity to do processing at both coarser level and at finer level.  Why can't we use our brain to do certain jobs in parallel in the same way as computers, for example, while I am writing this question using my right hand, why cant I solve a problem in geometry at the same time, using my left hand? Using much less powerful computers having just two processing cores (vs billions in brain) I can do these two jobs of writing and solving geometry problem, in parallel by launching two separate threads. Why it is so?   "
27,How does the brain learn what something is for the first time?,"I'm trying to understand how the idea of what a thing is originates in humans.  For example, in computer science, it is possible to know what an object is and what it does, by examining its ""parent/ancestor"" objects with concepts of inheritance:     In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a way to reuse   code of existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing   object   and polymorphism, where objects may share similar function:     Subtype polymorphism, often referred to as simply polymorphism in the   context of object-oriented programming, is the ability to create a   variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form. In   principle, polymorphism can arise in other computing contexts and   shares important similarities with the concept of degeneracy in   biology   What makes me interested in this is that human children do not learn all words at once - there's a slow, but steady exposure to new stimuli, which are quantified, remembered and become available as concepts and words. The exact order of exposure is unknown, but if I remember correctly, most people know about 20000 words, and use about 6000 in daily interactions.   For example, a child has never seen a potato. A child sees a potato for the first time.  A child has neither an idea nor a word for a potato. Now the child's brain has to create an idea of what a potato is.  The question: When a child is exposed to a new stimuli, as in the example above, does the child's brain:   create a brand new representation of an object or does a person's brain modify and re-purpose the ""closest matching"" idea and add extra attributes to it? (a potato looks like a brown rock)   In other words, has there been any research that found evidence for case 2: a ""common ancestor"" for ideas and objects within a person's mind? (if a person forgets ""rock"", then the person also forgets ""potato"").  I don't know where to begin a search for the answer. Are there some keywords that I can use? Maybe scholarly articles on cases of unusually high working memory capacity for related objects? "
28,Causal reasoning(implicit models?) vs grammar of native language,"I was reading about linguistic relativity and it struck me that there could also be differences in multilingual individuals and mono/bi-lingual individuals on how they derive/reason/create structure out of the environment (causality models).  Anyway, my question can be split as :    Are there standard/widely accepted experiments have been done to test methods used by individuals to infer cause and effect? Couple of  examples for what i have in mind is here and here.  Is there consensus on correlation between these experiments and indication of causal models used? If so, have there been studies of those experiments across monolingual, bilingual and multilingual individuals?  "
29,Does medication to treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder reduce associated cognitive deficits?,"Some studies point to existence of cognitive deficits in OCD (it seems that these deficits are not comorbid but have the same neurological roots as OCD). Unfortunately I found no studies with positive effects of medication (SSRI etc.) on cognitive deficits/impairment in OCD patients. I found only one study about cognitive-behavioral therapy and improvement of cognitive deficits symptoms in OCD.  Is there any research that indicates medication used to treat OCD (such as SSRIs) can mitigate these cognitive deficits?  Related articles:        [website]  Fenger, M. M., Gade, A., Adams, K.

30,Possibility of perfect virtual reality,"Is it biologically possible to build a ""perfect"" virtual reality, in which the person in that world cannot distinguish it from the real world? (e.g. as in the movie The Matrix)  From my knowledge (which is very limited), we perceive everything as a result of electrical activity within nerves. If we were able to encode/decode the patterns of the electrical activity and understand how the brain communicates with and intercepts all the nerves between the brain and the other parts of the body, would this mean that a perfect virtual reality is possible? "
31,What causes people to remember events which did not take place?,"How do we ""remember"" events which did not take place, or future events? I'm using remember as a way of describing the experience of recalling a future scenario. For instance, when you were little say your mom promised you a soda at the grocery store, but then didn't give you one. You might have created, imagined, a scenario where this did happen, memorized it as such, and then later when you didn't get the soda you remembered the other, expected, imagined. It's not the expectation I'm focusing on, but the act of creating, and remembering something that never happened, and is expected in the future.  I've read a few articles, mostly philosophical, about this sort of thing, and what I've gotten from that is we know about the future because we have a memory of the past. So in a way this is a question about memory itself.   I don't understand why we are able to remember events which did not happen, like events in the future. What causes the brain to be able to do this? Do we know yet, or is there research on-going?  "
32,Kelly Criterion Observed to Be Adhered by Psychopaths?,"As this study shows, psychopaths are much more willing to take advantage of expected gains despite recent losses as opposed to normal people who frequently stop after a series of losses.  Has there been any follow up to this to observe whether psychopaths also take the Kelly Criterion into account?  The participation rate was still only 84% for the psychopath group.  I didn't see any data that shows whether those that stopped participating were ones whose amount of money in immediate control declined to nothing or near-nothing.  If those who lost stopped at some point relative to the amount of money in their immediate control instead of a bad run regardless of money in immediate control, it might indicate that psychopaths are acting more rational than normal because they quit when the Kelly Criterion is being violated, that they quit positive expected values when their ""risk of ruin"" is greater than ~0%.  Do psychopaths care about the so-called ""risk of ruin""?  Kelly Criterion  The math behind the Kelly Criterion was actually originally developed by John L. Kelly, Jr. to maximize data transfer rates relative to risk of data loss due to noisy (error prone) lines.  Taking into account those two factors, the amount of data to transfer, the possible loss, and the possible success, choices of which lines to use at which times and amounts of data relative to noise can be quantitatively made to more or less maximize the total expected data transfer rate with an almost certain chance of no loss over time.  Later, Edward O. Thorpe, the first to prove that blackjack can be beat by counting cards, discovered that the Kelly Criterion can be employed to maximize returns from card counting with an almost certain chance of no loss over time (now called the ""risk of ruin"") when ""bankroll"" (total amount available for gambling), risk of a single or series of gambles, cost of the single/series of gambles, and payoff of the single/series of gambles are all taken into account.  A formula was also derived to give a risk of total loss, ""risk of ruin"", from a collection of potential investment choices.  When the Kelly Criterion can be strictly adhered to, the risk of ruin is always ~0%. "
33,Does the relationship between positive mood and motivation for sex differ between males and females?,"Background: I recently heard the saying from a doctor: ""men are motivated to have sex when they want to feel good and women are motivated to have sex when they already feel good"".  (In a side note, such a difference would help to explain why males might not understand female sexual motivation.)  Questions:   Do any scientific studies support the claim that males have greater sexual motivation when they want to feel good (or are experiencing temporary lower subjective well-being) whereas females have greater sexual motivation when they already feel good ? If so, what is the reason for this difference?  "
34,Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Limitations,"In treating people with Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy:   Which people can't be helped by therapy? How are some people more treatable than others?      Additional Info  In the comments of a blog post analyzing male seducers, a psychotherapist explained the effect of narcissistic mothers on their sons. She said that some people have a greater capacity for benefiting from therapy than others. Some people can't be helped by therapy.  What makes a person unable to benefit from therapy? "
35,Meditation for patients with neuroleptic induced tension,"Patients taking antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs often suffer from some kind of discomfort or tension. This can manifest as a neuroleptic induced dysphoria, akathisia, or some kind of anxiety.  Is there a way these patients can overcome this unpleasant feeling with some kind of mind work, i.e. meditation concentrating on breathing, visualization, watching coming thoughts or something else?  Is there some research on this topic telling what kind of meditation could be helpful in relieving the discomfort? Is it even good to work with mind under these chemicals? "
36,How do graphic objects in data visualisation facilitate ease of interpretation?,"Background: I vaguely remember reading in a book (I think it may have been Nudge - Thaler and Sunstein) about the advantages of using graphics for visualising data, such as a smiley face, or traffic lights, to communicate a message in an easily interpreted, visual language.    To what extent do graphics such as smiley faces and traffic lights in visualisations facilitate ease of interpretation? What is the cause of this ease of interpretation? What research has studied this phenomena?   Initial thoughts:  I imagine that the ease of interpretation is due to these items being purely visual that we quickly recognise them, and they can make complicated, unfamiliar information (for instance health results) that much easier to comprehend.  Is that an accurate summary?   If it's any further help I'm looking into this specifically for use in the communication of health results. So for example if you have a 20% risk of developing a disease, a good way to illustrate this could be 100 smiley faces - of which 20 are :( and 80 are :)  "
37,Stiffing the tip as groups get larger ... like the prisoner's dilemma but ...?,"Is there a game theory analysis or other research or modeling describing the commonly perceived phenomenon whereby the amount by which people underpay a gratuity seems to be proportional to the number of people at the table?  In other words is there term of art for this behavioral pattern just as we use the phrase ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" to describe the game theoretical mechanics of two parties who can collude (to their mutual benefit) with risk, or betray their colleague in an effort reduce or eliminate their own risk?  (I would suggest that the mechanisms by which people exploit common resources and by which people fail to invest and maintain such resources (for example ecologically) are similar to this other group dynamic but I'm curious what research has been done on this). "
38,Are there any cutting edge techniques that would enable one to acquire a foreign language at a relatively fast pace?,"I am aware of immersion methods as well as mnemonics such as the one Daniel Tammet mentioned in Born on a Blue Day. I read that Kim Peek's lack of corpus callosum enabled his brain to absorb information faster with his whole brain but that hindered other daily activities.  But my motivation was the folklore legends of William James Sidis who is supposed to have acquired a language in one day.  My question thus is two-fold:   Are there any medical conditions which allow one to learn a language faster? For instance, consider John Travolta's character learning Portuguese in a half-an hour car drive. What are some current theories in cognitive science that allow one to acquire a language faster? For instance, see the book Babel No More. At the end the author mentions a trick of using the whole body to learn a language as well as the accent.   So, how would an artificial intelligence programmer view language learning? What sort of model would he attempt to create? "
39,Is there evidence for a unique isolated internal representation of loved ones?,"Some time ago, I've read that the most significant people in a person's life have their own internal representation/model of within the person's mind. For example:   An internal representation of a spouse An internal representation of parents, grandparents An internal representation of children Close friends, etc   This representation does not matter, until the connection is severed - the significant person dies or moves away. This is when there's no more input from the real world - only the internal representation remains. For example, it is possible to dream of an interaction with a deceased relative. My question is about whatever phenomenon causes people to be able to dream and interact with people previously known, while in a dream.   I'm interested if there has been research that confirms that people do indeed have unique internal models of significantly close relatives? If so, what is the correct term to use when searching for scientific information on the subject?  Update: In particular, I'm interested in unique internal representations - linked to a unique object in real life. Do they exist?  For example, there is only one spouse. Jane Smith. Has there been evidence that the internal representation of Jane Smith is unique (every single time Jane Smith is encountered, it is the same representation, possibly lighting up the same region of the brain if viewed with imaging techniques).  "
40,What neural mechanism explains the tendency to visually attend to the whole scene before attending to details?,I have the intuition that human vision first attends to large-scale objects and then small-scale details. Is there any mechanism in the visual cortex that will explain this phenomenon? Is there a resolution refinement process when we look at scenes? 
41,Is it possible to measure the differences in processing and interpretation of reality between individuals?,"What variables can be measured to compare, for example, two different individual's conscious processing and interpretation of the same objective reality ? For example, when terms like ""distorted view of reality"" are thrown around, how does one measure that or can conclude that?  How can we measure the differences in the processing and interpretation of reality between individuals and if it's impossible, please explain why it can not be done or what can not be measured. "
42,"Does the transcription method used (e.g., printing, handwriting, typing, voice recording, etc.) affect memory retention?","When I was in high school, one of my teachers used to make us hand print copies of materials from transparencies on an overhead projector (I may be showing my age), with the reasoning that re-writing notes by hand was better for memory retention.  I later was told, via sources I can no longer recall, that typing out notes wasn't as good for memory retention because it was too easily done without thinking. Hand printed/written notes, I was told, were superior because they forced you to think about the words and letters being written, whereas typing uses more or less the same actions for each character and can be done faster with less conscious thought. Anecdotally, I know I certainly type faster than I write, and am better able to multitask as I do.   Is there any evidence to support the idea that writing is better for retention than typing?   Does it matter if you print or handwrite the transcription?   Do other transcription methods, such as dictating into an audio recording device, have better or worse retention rates?  "
43,Overcoming the effect of Limerence?,"I recently came to know about  Limerence.   I could not find definite answers for the following questions:   It has been said that limerence generally lasts between 18 months to 3 years, could be more in some cases. Is there a way/approach/strategy to reduce this duration? As per this article, it has been suggested that limerence is due to low self esteem. This conclusion was based on ""I never expected anything in return"". I thought this is what most successful people like Bill Gates, Clinton do with their charity/foundation without expecting anything in return. How can this be judged as a bad thing? Is Limerence really due to low self esteem? I have read that limerence can affect people's mind at a unconscious level. Is there a way to train the unconscious mind to get rid of the limerence effect? I could not find anyone offering therapy specifically for this. Has therapy been shown to help conditions like this? It has been mentioned in the Wikipedia article that people with limerence can become ill. If you are ill, is there a way to find out if this is caused by limerence or something else?

44,What is the proper term: optical Illusions or visual illusions?,"I answered the question ""Why aren't optical illusions called visual illusions?"" and would like to get more information to improve my answer.  In doing a search on Ngram for occurrences of the expressions ""optical illusion"" and ""visual illusion"" I saw that ""visual illusion"" appeared in 1900.  It might have existed earlier.  My questions:   When did ""optical illusions"" start being seen as ""visual illusions?""  By visual illusions, I mean phenomena of the brain and visual system. In your field (cognitive/neuro sciences) is the expression ""visual illusion"" now preferred over ""optical illusion?"" Also, sources say that interest in optical illusions goes back to Aristotle and the ancients.  What were these optical illusions they were interested in?  "
45,Is there such a thing as word synonyms?,"I'm an English teacher and participate in the English Language forum.  The question of word synonyms is very frequent.  People ask if words can be substituted in sentences and still retain meaning, etc.  I feel that there is no such thing as ""synonyms"" because the pictures created in the mind of listeners and speakers  are different for different words, and to complicate matters putting the words in sentences will produce different mental pictures / movies.  For example, if I ask 100 native English speakers what they imagine when they hear these two sentences, I feel that very different mental pictures / movies will be produced:  a) Please wash your hands. b) Please clean your hands.  Some would argue that ""wash"" and ""clean"" are synonyms, and that the meaning of both sentences are the same; remove dirt from you hands in whatever way you choose.  I feel that they are not the same.  I'm sure there are better examples to help my point.  The words garbage, waste, pollution, trash, and rubbish, were discussed in another post.  I read Benjamin Bergen's book.  I am an ESL teacher, and a big problem I have found is that students don't have the same mental pictures as native speakers for words.  If I ask them what a word means they can say, but if I ask them what they imagine, the results don't always match or coincide with what native speakers would likely imagine, and I know that they will end up using the word incorrectly.  My questions are:  1) Does it really make sense to talk about ""synonyms"" in light of what we now know about how people process language?  2) Are there books besides Bergen's that explore the topic of language processing in the way his book did, i.e. language as a mental movie produced in the listener and speaker's mind? "
46,"What Cognitive/Psychology Theories Are Behind The ""Mind Control"" Magics?","I have seen a TV program talking about an interesting 'mind control' magic/experiment. I cannot find this video clip online so I have to describe what I saw in words.   The video (some sort of documentary?) begins with two persons walking on the street. One person is the host and another is the subject of this experiment.   Both person walking down the street and do some casual talking. While they walk, the host introduces the area and so on, points to some interesting scenes around (for example graffiti and people on the street etc...). Also, an one instance, there was a boy skating and the boy almost hit the subject. Anyway, everything looks perfectly normal and natural.  Then, they reached an art gallery. They walk into the gallery and then in a room, there is a covered painting there. The host asked the subject to tell, what would be on the paint.   The subject mentioned a couple of things, some thing like the color of the paint, the object on the paint etc, etc... Guess what? As you certainly can predict, when the host reveal the paint, it looks exactly like the one described by the subject.   The host then explain to the subject that everything and everybody he had seen during this experiment are controlled and are carefully selected. For example the boy skating, the people on the street, the graffiti etc. The host then suggested that its what he (the subject) saw lead him to think (about the paint) the way the host would like him to think.  So, my question here is that assume this video is not just a fake camera trick, then what psychology theory is behind it? Could anybody offer some links to academic papers in this area?  "
47,Does the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM contain a Global Assessment of Functioning measure?,I suspect that only licensed psychiatrists get to see the contents of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID). I am drafting a proposal currently and need to know if the data I am applying for access to use has the data structures I need for my experiment. I need to know that the SCID generates evaluation measures of symptom clusters from disorder types in the DSM AND a measure of Global Functioning. Is this the case? What does phenotypic SCID data look like? 
48,Why don't people listen to smart people?,"Generally speaking, I feel like there are two things everyone can agree on when it comes to intellectuals:   They don't know everything. They know more than me (at least about a particular topic).   It's #2 that's tripping me up. The words of a Know-It-All are usually very poorly received (at least in Western culture). We don't consider intelligence as a meaningful criteria for political office, we bully them in schools, and even tell them to their faces that they're wrong about scientific/mathematical concepts that we admit to not understanding! When a problem arises in our lives, they are the last people we want to hear from. We instead run to the counsel of our family, friends, and other people who many times know even less about the problem than we do!  But why? Everything we have as a species is owed to our brains. If they really do know more than us, it would be in our best interest to revere them, no?  Have there been any studies done that would explain why people generally don't listen to smart people? "
49,Behavioral and mood differences between D1 and D2 dophamine receptors action in context of monogamy and out of it,"Claim: I initially thought of posting this to Biology SE, but the fact that the question finds its resting formation in the area of cognition/mood/personality, I decided to post it here.  It is stated that in respect to monogamic relationships in mammals, D2 receptors activation effect is important for initial male-female pair formation and D1 receptors activation effect is important for prolonging the relationship in time (up to death).  Since potentiation of D1 receptors and decrease in D2 receptors effect cannot limit itself to the context of these relationships, I wonder about how this change in the organism first changes the perception of its chosen mate and, later, affects its overal behavior, mood and cognition.  I would appreciate an answer along one or several of these lines, in the order of increasing interest:   What behavioral traits can be attributed to each of these receptors actions? What changes in mood and mate perception/estimation/assesment can be spotted by a person affected by this process on various stages? What overall changes in perception of reality can be expected to manifest? I.e. how does this change translate to outside of the context of relationships and overall understanding/perception of reality?

52,What is the key elements that make westerners have some better characteristics over asian,"I want to get your ideas or any suggestions of references (books, articles..) that I can read to help me answer this question:  We all know that westerners are more open while Asian people are more shy and close this is a real characteristic but not saying which one is better. But  beside many aspects westerners are learning from Asian, I also observed that westerners have some characteristics that not very popular to Asian, the things they often do that end up making their social develops faster and more modern:   From very long time before, they make ships and risk their lifes to cross oceans find out new lands. (that's why now US is born, and many asian countries is dominated in the history). They find new places in the wilds, build good infrastructures, social and laws. Where they go, they can easily determine where is a good place to stay, as good or sometimes better than the local people. They quite dare to try new things, get risk of old stuffs and thinkings. Try out new things.   But we also know that westerns social also go through the dark period (when there are kings and not very develop social system), similar as Asian.  So is this because of the genes (DNA) or the type of monkeys they are develop from (so the brain structure different?) or the climate, food, environment differences or the social system, different way of education... ? What are key elements that drive the differences in these two culture, people?  (Please ignore any racist or comparison on who is superior, I know everybody has their own goods) but I just want to find out the reason for these facts. I live in Asia. "
53,Why cerebellar input fibers use 2 ways to send a siganl to DCN?,"Both groups of input fibers of cerebellum (mossy, climbing) start 2 pathways: 1)  project  directly to the deep nuclei 2)  project to cerebellar cortex, which then (after some processing) sends projection back to deep nuclei through Purkinje cells.

It stayed like that for an hour.  Had troubles concentrating and working well into the afternoon.  Is this normal to have trouble concentrating after a fight response?  Is the fight or flight response considered voluntarily or involuntarily?  What is a appropriate time to recover from a scare like this? 
55,Does intentionally being aware of an emotion or thought pattern increase the incidence of that thought pattern?,"As a means of tracking and exerting control over my life and emotions, I've considered doing a daily log to measure various life metrics, like what time I got up, how much coffee I've drunk, and various emotions etc.   One of the metrics I've considered measuring the prevalence of suicidal thoughts.   But what's put me off this idea is thought that actively considering this question would lead to further ideation, and would be counterproductive over all.   The question - does intentionally taking note of a particular thought, cause you to think that kind of thought more often? Are there any studies or related studies into this? "
56,"Avoiding Cognitive dissonance,is it a necessity?",I want to know how strong is the pain of going through cognitive dissonance.

58,How would slowed message over the reflex arc work?,"Take, for example, a person with average reflexes/a normal reflex arc. The person touches an extremely hot stove and immediately pulls away. Slowing this event down, upon touching the stove, it takes 10 milliseconds to register the pain and then 10 milliseconds to pull away (made up numbers here &mdash; not realistic).  If this person's reflex arc was then altered to make the neural message take longer, would the timing be different between (1) afferent neurons and interneurons (e.g., 20ms to feel pain), (2) interneurons and efferent neurons (e.g., 20ms to pull away), or (3) both?  To add on to this: are both paths mentioned above linked together or can they be lengthened/shortened independently? "
59,"Is the split-brain, dual consciousness experiment from Rhawn Joseph valid?","I have been reading about the problem of possible dual consciousness in split brain patients and  I came across this wikipedia page.  In the ""other experiments"" section, the two last paragraphs about Joseph's experiments seemed extremely simplistic, too obvious to be true. The way they are described and how groundbreaking it would be if true: two consciousness living in one brain and fighting with each other.  So I decided to google the name of this Jospeh Rhawn. You should judge by yourself: [website]is the first link showing up. It is clearly a crackpot. Although he managed to get published how can you trust this guy about the split brain experiments?

60,"Interpretation & Actual Result of ""10% of your brain"" Myth","It is well known that the common myth that an individual  only ever uses 10% of their brain is.. well, a myth. I had a question about a possible interpretation of this idea, and a follow-up question about the result of that interpretation.   After spending a small amount of time with computational neural networks, it seems that at any given time, a small percentage of neurons are actually firing. All neurons have the potential to be firing, and at some point in execution likely will fire, but due to efficiency, only very few are needed for a particular function. This is my interpretation of what I have seen so far.. is this interpretation valid for the activity of neurons in the brain?  If this is valid, what would happen if 90-100% of neurons were firing at all times? I'm assuming this would be a huge disadvantage to whoever this happened to. Epilepsy? Overheating? Would the body be overworked and go into shock? "
61,Adaptation to Discrete Perturbation in Sleep?,"Generally, are there and how long do lingering affects of polar sleep patterns affect someone? For example, assume someone slept for 2 hours one day and then slept for 14 hours the next. Their 2 day average would be 8, an unofficial heuristic for optimal sleep length. However, intuitively, I feel that their cognition would notably be different for a while because of these polarized events. Is this true? And if so, what are the basis for this, and how long do these effects last assuming someone got 8 hours a sleep religiously over the next few weeks?   By changes in their cognition (the ones I feel ""intuitively""), I mean like a lower fidelity of memory, slower reaction times, but still the ability to function normally in a group setting.  "

63,Psychological effects of social nudity,"I have been conducting extensive research over the last few years on the history of nudity in social situations, and I am looking to expand my research base now I have come across a few other interesting facts.  I have found a lot of facts stating that although the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures; some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity (for example Nudists/naturists - WARNING! - Link is NSFW), however, attitudes often depend on context.  It is generally agreed by naturist organisations (for example, British Naturism and International Naturist Federation) that eroticism and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, directly opposed to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given include rapport with other humans including equality and respect.     Being nude in groups makes all feel more accepted – physically, intellectually and emotionally (Veltheim, 2010)   On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude.  You only have to look at the history of Steven Gough as an example.  Besides meeting social disapproval, in some countries and in some settings within more liberal countries, public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure.  Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality.  Some people have a psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia.  On the flip side, there is a form of psychotherapy I have not long come across called Nude Psychotherapy which is     the use of non-sexual social nudity as an intentional means to improve the participant's psychological health.      The field began in the 1930s with psychological studies of the effects of social nudity on the lives of naturists. It developed in the 1960s along with the encounter group movement as a way to challenge preconceptions and promote intimacy and trust, but suffered a decline in the 1980s. It is still used by some organizations that offer participatory workshops on intimacy, sex and love...      ...Today The Human Awareness Institute (Global Site) (UK Site), an organization that offers participatory workshops on intimacy, sex and love continues to conduct group sessions in which the participants have the option to be naked. (Shewey, 1994)   There are a lot of historical studies on the history of clothing, social nudity, and nudity in art, ancient Greece and ancient Rome; plus there are also anthropological studies on the irony of losing fur when evolving from primates (Horizon: What's The Problem With Nudity, 2008). I am not after biblical references (I have lots of those through my research) and I am not after personal opinions without scientific backing.  What I am wondering is are there any referenced books, articles or scientific studies anyone is aware of, on the psychological effects of nudity - particularly social nudity?

64,Can binaural beats be generated with carrier tones outside the audible frequency range?,"I know that binaural beats are a controversial subject, as they might not work for everyone. In my own tests on myself I shuffled multiple recordings of binaural beats, with stereo headphones on, not looking at the frequency and resulting brain state advertised by each. I did, in fact, experience notably different mind states in these tests.   Binaural beats can be generated using carriers at any frequency within the audible range of human hearing. The frequency of binaural beats dictates the mind state that is being induced.   I'm wondering if binaural beats can be generated using carrier tones outside the range of human hearing? And suppose that that works, do these binaural beats still have an effect on the state of mind? In other words, can you entrain your brain without being able to acoustically perceive the carrier tones producing the beats?  "
65,get signal from eye neurons,Hi guys you know some scientists could get electronic signals from brain and move it to muscles (full article here)  My question is: can we get signal from eye neurons and analyze it with a computer and after that see what he/she/it is seeing?  If somebody did this research will you please give me an article about that? 
66,Quantification of tendency for people to believe what is convenient,"As a generalization, people have a bias towards believing what is convenient to them and/or doesn't challenge their worldview. I believe (though correct me if I'm wrong) this is linked to status quo bias, confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.  Has there been any attempt to quantify this numerically? e.g. in a specific experimental situation, with existing bias and a certain level of new information, how likely are people to pick the convenient/status quo interpretation of phenomena over the correct one?   If so, has there been any attempt to generalize this to other environments e.g. numerically predict the level of bias based on other quantifiable facts about the situation?  Not a duplicate as I am asking for a numerical model of the bias not just a name for it. "
67,Is there a game-theoretic explanation for why people do (or don't) participate in community policing/moderation?,"My question is closely related to this Meta post about what drives individual participation in ""community policing"" on Stack Exchange sites (e.g. downvoting, voting to close, participating in review queues, etc.). This is also related to this question.  A few ideas I came up with why people might participate (and this list is not exhaustive by any means):   People are naturally biased towards being helpful to others Gamification If you have a lot of posts (questions, answers, etc.) you're essentially invested in the community, which gives you an incentive to ""protect your investment"" (so to speak)   Are there any more I'm missing?  What, then, tends to drive people not to participate? There are certainly a lot more people who have certain moderation abilities (the ability to downvote or vote to close, for example) than who actually exercise those privileges.  My other point of confusion is that it seems like a lot of the reasons I listed for people participating would seem to apply equally to people who are not participating. If you have a relatively high reputation (e.g. the requisite 3000 reputation required to be able to vote to close), presumably you're invested in the community too (and would therefore have the same incentive to participate as other people). So, if these actually explain the behavior, why don't they seem to ""work"" on most people?  Is there a game-theoretic (or other) explanation for what drives people to participate (or not participate)? "
68,What happens when I speak in these certain situations and how to reprogram my brain?,"I want to start off by saying that I have been a stutterer for the most of my life (I am 18) and now it is significantly bad. I noticed that the whole last year was totally stutter-free but this year, it has turned bad once again.  The stuttering does not differ when talking to strangers, family, doing presentations at Uni or talking in general - I stutter equally in each situation. However, I do not stutter at all when I am alone or talking to my pets. In fact, I have a youtube channel where I upload videos containing several analysis of different scientific topics(devised by me), in which I do not read directly from any paper  but I have all the information stored in my head. I do not stutter in any of these videos and I am talking A LOT so it is really weird to my that I can talk to myself and talk to my pet, and record videos where I theoretically know that it will be heard by others, all without stuttering. But when I am surrounded by people (it does not matter who it is), I stutter. So why does my brain reject to let the words come out/let me exhale fully with the given combination of vibration and position of my tongue etc.. Note: I do BLOCKS as my type of stuttering and not repetitions etc. like some people. I have noticed that when I am alone, my brain focuses at what I am looking at or the actual content of what I am currently saying but when I am surrounded by someone, my brain, in some way, focuses on every single word that I am saying. Sometimes, I even see the words as letters before saying them(if I actually manage to get the word out after a potential block). Anyway, I could explain a lot of my further observations but I do not think that would be beneficial.  So my questions are:   Why can I speak loudly to myself without any problems and why can I record yt videos containing long analysis of different scientific topics, where I even know that somebody will listen and ""judge"" it?  Why does my brain act very different when I am together with any human being? How can I reprogram my brain to do the same thing that it does when I am alone or talking to my pet, when I am together with one or more human beings? I do not have a lack of confidence when talking to other people. Of course, I am scared of stuttering whenever I start talking to somebody, no matter how much I try to convince myself about that if I can speak when being alone, and that I actually have taught some people about different topics on my youtube channel, I can do just perfect now.   Thank you so much! It would really mean more than just a lot if you would answer or at least share your thoughts! "
69,Alcoholic behavior at a bar without having any alcohol?,"I am a recovering alcoholic sober 11 month.  I do not crave alcohol, or need it anymore. I have adapted skills that I am no longer depressed. but enjoying life again.fun, happy, with good social skills.  I have treated myself to a month in Mexico were I have vacationed over 20 years drunk at beachside bars.  This first week, I headed to the first bar with a big party crowd.  I have met 15+ people of what I used to be like.  After 3 day same time they are all drunk and acting crazy.  By the time I left all 3 days I could swear I was drunk, lost all inhabitions, over talkative Without any alcohol. Any still no craving.??? "
70,Non-computational models of cognition,"There is a question on this site that asks a somewhat related question, whether there are non-physical models for cognition.  However, that question still assumes a computational paradigm for the non-physical cognition.  Another question asks whether computational learning theory has been applied to cognitive science, which would then allow us to say what non-computational learning would look like.  However, there is only one answer that provides a non-computational alternative.  Are there any accepted models that do away with computationalism altogether?  Such a model would depend on cognition performing incomputable feats, such as being a Turing oracle, violating the No Free Lunch Theorem, or reducing NP to P. "

In the alignment function, it refers to a global variable st, which as far as I can tell is not described in the SPM8 manual. I'm updating the code to SPM12, which does not refer to st.  What exactly does st do in SPM8? Is there an equivalent in SPM12?   "
72,"Using ""it sounds"" instead of ""it tastes""","99% of the time I use in the conversation (or when I am thinking) the phrase ""it sounds"" instead of ""it tastes"" when I am talking about the food, or drinks, etc.   For example: ""This coffee sounds very good."", ""I like how this hamburger sounds.""  I do not do it intentionally, sometimes I ""say"" it in my head and then say out loud the ""normal"" version.  Has this something a name? Or this is probably just my association and there is nothing to it?  EDIT: And recently I have used it in sentence: ""I wonder how this will play.""

76,Named conditions that are the result of exposure to psychopathic behavior of another person?,"Are there any recognized terms for conditions that stem from or are the result of exposure to  psychopathic behavior (by another person) that are distinct from those that might have predisposed the individual to it or made them more vulnerable to it?  In other words, something like a ""post psychopath stress disorder""?  It would not have to be an official diagnosis, it's the only applicable tag I could find. "
77,Improving reading speed for complex material for already high comprehenders by eliminating mental vocalization?,"I'm a heavy reader, but my reading is limited primarily to non-fiction and scientific material. I find that my speed is becoming a real hinderance and is starting to discourage consumption. Comprehension and recall are excellent; speed is the bottleneck.  I'm not seeking to ""speed read"" (skim, etc.), but rather to improve my intake rate while maintaining comprehension.  When I read I find that I have at least two primary difficulties (probably more, but these are what I mainly notice):   I vocalize what I read. This of course greatly slows me down (perhaps this helps in comprehension, but I can't believe it does entirely since the mind can process data more rapidly in a visual fashion).  I find myself lost in thought sometimes both about the material AND occasionally other things.   It's clear that if I could eliminate these two issues I could dramatically increase my speed.   Are there any specific techniques available to help in these areas, perhaps especially in eliminating vocalization?  Perhaps there are other areas of improvement as well that could help, while reading such material. Any techniques or studies that have proven helpful in establishing good reading behavior and habits?

78,Is quick left brain vs right brain test fake?,"  When I saw it at first she did rotate to the right.   With some mental effort I could make her rotate either way in half rotations where it looks like she dances not rotating in my minds eye, but I can only hold that until she starts to rotate either way again. After a few minutes it looked like her leg twisted one way and her body the other.   What would a person see if their brain is equally balance without a dominant side? What does it say when a person has the inability to only see a rotation?  Does this test have any basis if you are left or right brained? Does switching the direction from mental practice of build any part of your brain when you get to a point where you can do it more freely?  Does this picture identify anything about cognitive abilities? "

But on the other hand the data regarding electrodes from each patient are DEPENDENT, all electrodes share a bit of common signal.   What kind of statistical tests we can use to check the difference in for example this theta power between the task no. 1 and no.2? How to take care of this dependancy/independancy in neuroscience data? "
81,Probiotics and Mental Health,"While trying to find research articles within the realm of Psychosynthesis, I have been looking at the ""collective unconscious""   Image Source: Wikipedia Commons - (CC BY-SA 3.0)   Lower Unconscious Middle Unconscious Higher Unconscious Field of Consciousness Conscious Self or ""I"" Higher Self Collective Unconscious   Conducting a Google Scholar search for ""collective unconscious"" I stumbled on an article by Dinan, et al. (2015) which states:        Gut microbes are part of the unconscious system influencing behavior.   Microbes majorly impact on cognitive function and fundamental behavior patterns.   Disorganisation of the gut microbiota can negatively impact on mental health.   Psychobiotics are probiotics with a potential mental health benefit.      they also talk about bidirectional communication between gut microbes and the brain occuring via a number of routes including the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and cytokines produced by the immune system.     Bacteria also have the capacity to generate many neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. For example, certain Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); Escherichia, Bacillus and Saccharomyces spp. produce norepinephrine (NE); Candida, Streptococcus, Escherichia and Enterococcus spp. produce 5HT; Bacillus produces dopamine (DA); and Lactobacillus produces acetylcholine (Lyte, 2011, Lyte, 2013, Wikoff et al., 2009). Some probiotics can modulate the concentrations of opioid and cannabinoid receptors in the gut epithelium (Rousseaux et al., 2007). However, how this local effect occurs or translates to the anti-nociceptive effects seen in animal models of visceral pain is currently unclear.   My question is can poor mental health affect the bidirectional communication between gut microbes and the brain, and can consuming products containing probiotics be used to help with mental health problems?  If so, will consuming products containing probiotics when well cause mental health problems?  References  Dinan, T. G., Stilling, R. M., Stanton, C., &amp; Cryan, J. F. (2015).

82,Can gamification lead to better group cooperation?,"I was wondering. Would it be possible to stimulate an individuals sense of group by gamification?  For those who don’t know, gamification is a method of making a game out of the mundane.   For example: If you earn a badge for every time you correct something on StackExchange. Would that be a good enough ‘reward’ for most people to keep doing it and not giving up after some time? "
83,Why is the hopfield network a model of associative memory?,"I'm struggling to understand the meaning of the term associative memory in the context of Hopfield networks. I'm not sure if associative learning is the same thing or a different thing. In associative learning, you have two unrelated items and you learn to associate one item with the other. In a hopfield network you have a partial pattern then you can retrieve the full pattern. How is this associative learning? Or are associative learning and associative memory different things? "
84,How moral reasoning is measured?,"According to this answer, there are some kind of points used for moral reasoning. Therefore, I'm interested now, how the amount of points given for reasoning?

85,Does NMDA-receptor activation depend on neighboring AMPA-receptor activity?,"This question is coming out of a couple points of confusion after I learned about about NMDA receptors' role in LTP.  I got the impression that after AMPA receptors were activated enough, which depolarizes the cell, that nearby NMDA receptors will allow Na and Ca to come into the cell.    Is it the local membrane potential, around those receptors that matter for a given voltage-gated NMDAR to open up? Or is there no such thing as 'local membrane potential', and the whole cell body is about the same amount of negative or positive voltage?  If there's no such thing as 'local membrane potential', does it matter if the AMPA receptors are activated or if other receptors are activated? Does a single neuron usually respond to more than one type of excitatory neurotransmitter? If so, couldn't the activation of any receptor that results in cell depolarization eventually cause NMDAR to open up?   "
86,Criteria for Something to be Considered a Mental Disorder,"I know this will probably be closed for being broad, but I think it certainly has an answer.  What are the criteria for something to be considered a mental disorder?  Does a disorder need to be observable physiologically? Or is behavior/perception that is far from the norm enough? "
87,Reason for Inter-stimulus-Interval in psychology studies,"In many of the studies that I have read or participated in, I have seen that they show a blank screen between two stimuli. For example, in a study by Cohen et al. (2017), a training paradigm was used where a flanker task was shown, followed by a blank screen for (1000 - Reaction Time) ms, followed by an emotional or neutral image. I've cited this study just as an example, but I've seen similar blank screens in many other studies. My question is:  What is the reason for showing the blank screen? What would have happened if they showed the emotional/neutral image right after the flanker task?  One reason I can think of is that it is shown to keep the starting point of different stimulus constant between different participants. Is there any other reason?  "
88,Does neurodynamics have any relation to psychodynamics?,"From Neural oscillation - Wikipedia:     Neural oscillations are commonly studied from a mathematical framework and belong to the field of ""neurodynamics"", an area of research in the cognitive sciences that places a strong focus upon the dynamic character of neural activity in describing brain function.   From Psychodynamics - Wikipedia:     Psychodynamics, also known as psychodynamic psychology, in its broadest sense, is an approach to psychology that emphasizes systematic study of the psychological forces that underlie human behavior, feelings, and emotions and how they might relate to early experience. It is especially interested in the dynamic relations between conscious motivation and unconscious motivation.   When I was watching this artwork, I didn't know about neurodynamics and thought that it was completely about psychodynamics, because I thought the emergence and dissipation of the waves in the artwork were about consciousness and subconsciousness. This thought is strengthened in this letter:     Mental awareness and ‘I’ emerge as a secondary phenomenon from the primary stream of thinking-in-movement.    I know psychodynamics is regarded as pseudoscience for the lack of evidence, but it's still useful enough for some specific psychological disorders. And as neurodynamics is about oscillation and psychodynamics was inspired from thermodynamics, if we can find the link between the two in physics (which they should), then we will see the link between the two.  So does neurodynamics have any relation to psychodynamics?    Related: Is there a difference between physiological stimulations and psychological stimulations? "
89,When to use standard versus moderator regression techniques for the most parsimonious approach?,"I know how to run multiple regressions (SMR, HMR, and MMR) in SPSS but I'm still a little vague on when it's appropriate to use each of them to achieve the best and most parsimonious result. (SPSS being the mathematical software, SMR being standard multiple regression, HMR being hierarchical multiple regression, and MMR being moderated multiple regression, SMR and SPSS are further explained in this video, hierarchical multiple regression in this video, and moderated multiple regression in this blog post).   e.g. in a case where I want to see the impact of social anxiety, and sense of humour on life satisfaction, I hypothesise that both social anxiety and sense of humour will be individually associated with life satisfaction.  When controlling for age, gender and anxiety, participants high in sense of humour will have higher life satisfaction.   Also, when excluding variables of age and gender, I predict that the negative association between anxiety and life satisfaction will be stronger for those with low sense of humour ratings.   I feel that for most of these questions, the answers could be found using an SMR, and the last question, with an MMR, but is there a simpler and more parsimonious way to do this? Can I gather the data for the first few questions from the MMR analysis, for example?   "
90,Rates of parental burnout for parents with ASD children/disability,"In a question from Academic SE, there was a description of parent's of a student on the spectrum refusing to be contacted by the university. I suspect that his parents may be suffering from burn out/mental exhaustion, hence they do not want to be contacted with concerns about their child at university. I am struggling to find studies or reports of parental burnout, especially for parents of children with ASD. Otherwise are there rates for parents with disability in general? The assumptions may be wrong and there are minimal or no impact on the parents?   This 2015 question discusses ""What cognitive processes occur during a mental exhaustion or &#39;burnout&#39;?"" "

""I Never Thought I'd See the Day!"" or ""I never thought I'd get this far"" from SpongeBob's Plankton T.V. Show are memes.       I'm adding to social psych tag because I've seen related questions in social psych class.  "
92,What important psychological results would not have been discovered without experiments on non-human animals?,"Many psychological experiments involve shocking animals, playing loud sounds near them, depriving them of social contact, etc. For example, Martin Seligman's studies of learned helplessness in dogs are of this nature.  However, to my understanding, studies of learned helplessness in dogs at best provide an analogy to depression in humans, and it seems unlikely that actually shocking and trapping dogs was necessary for insight into human depression.  Similarly, Harry Harlow's studies of deprivation of maternal contact in monkeys seem to give extraordinarily obvious results, telling us what almost anyone already knows - that infants crave maternal contact. I don't think I need socially maladjusted monkeys in a laboratory in order to understand this point.  Is this wrong, or if not, what are some other counter-examples? What experiments involving inflicting physical or psychological pain on animals were necessary parts of important results in human psychology? "
93,is there any psychological condition that fits what I describe?,"I was observing some condition. most people (that I observed), if they do something (mentally) to someone, they will tend to have the same feeling like 'the someone' is doing the same to them.  example, if person a is lying to person b, person a would think that person b is lying too to person a, although it may not. it is something like anxiety that appears due to our fault.  so, is there any psychological condition that fits the description? what is the name, and how exactly it is (?)  I'm trying to search it over the internet but couldn't find any. maybe because I used wrong keyword or something. "
94,Does social psychology include study of human cultures?,"Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), not a professional psychologist or anthropologist but a smart thinker and philosopher, believed that jealousy was one of the main sources of the sexual ethics of his time. I'm much interested in this kind of analysis, relating cultures, customs, norms, and traditions to basic human drives and emotions and also to other factors (geographical, economical, etc.). For example, why is there hijab in islamic world? Was it originated as a result of jealousy of men at some period of time at a specific region?  I would like to know if professional social psychologists today deal with such questions at least partially, and how they differ with anthropologists or sociologists in this respect, if at all. "
95,"is it possible to be severely autistic yet not being ""visibly autistic""?","It is common problem for many ""mild"" (ASD level-1) autistics to be criticized as ""you do not look autistic"" or some of its variants. Also sometimes seen in social media that moderate autistics (level-2) (claimingly) facing similar issues to disclose their diagnosis.   By ""visible"" I mean the publicly considered easily observable disabilities, such as extreme intellectual disabilities, visibly heavily motor nonfunction or totally unable to move, saliva dripping from mouth, complete nonverbality or observably distorted voice and language, disfigurement or birth-defects, inability to hold urine or stool,  etc. Usually the known to be severe (level-3) autistics have at least one of these ""publicly perceived as disability"" symptoms.   Incidentally, autism is not itself a visible condition at all, and the intellectual disability is not itself autism, its sometimes a co-morbid condition with autism but it is not identical to autism, rather autism is basically the impairment in social cognition. Also some of the symptoms of autism may be actually visible or easily observable but these are commonly mistaken as intentional inappropriate behaviour or lack of morality or as some mental illness instead of cognitive difficulties or social disablilities.   Now my question is; Is it possible that someone has level-3 (severe) autism yet on superficial look or talk the disability does not appear?   Theoretically it seems to be very possible that a severely autistic person may lack all of the publicly believed stereotype on disability, also can lack intellectual disability, moreover can apply sharp observations and observation to mask and fit-in, yet can have tremendous problem in social aspects. In such case a level-3 autistic too may face ""you don't look autistic"" situations. And probably all the observable symptoms will be imsinterpreted as mood or behaviour issue.   But does that happen in reality? or all of the severe (level-3) ASD have also some publicly believed stereotype of disability?     Note: See also Autism ""severity"" levels       Screenshot:         "
96,What activity causes the highest level of brain-activity?,"I expect balancing on a tightrope and juggling apples while listening to Mozart would trigger more brain activity than say playing chess, and while there are many ways to measure/define brain activity, still, is there any human activity that is known to be 'the most taxing'?  Brain activity I suppose can be measured as some function of below suggestions, or is there a commonly accepted definition?

97,Informed Consent Research Question,"I am a member of a closed, fairly large private group on Facebook of former game show contestants.  Several years ago, another member posted a Google Forms version of the Asperger Quotient test, asking group members to take the test, to report their overall score (anonymous), and to answer a few demographic questions on the form.  After collecting about 300 responses, he shared the composite results with the group (who were enthusiastic about the idea).    I've since asked the member who composed the original post if he would be interested in turning this idea into a publishable research brief. I am a psychologist and faculty at a small university and could create the IRB/ submission at my institution.  My issue, though, involves about informed consent. The data is collected, but he did not include an informed consent statement with his Facebook post.  Should I scrap his data, create an informed consent, and then re-send out the AQ?  Or do you think I should submit a request to the IRB asking to use the existing data?  Thanks! "
98,Can repetitive music help remember by increasing theta waves?,"Can repetitive music (minimal) help remember by increasing theta waves?  As far as I understand theta waves are involved in memory tasks. If correct, can I try increase theta waves with audio neuro-feedback to help remember or find clarity on a question? I am thinking about something very simple like drumming with 4-6 beats per second.   Cheers! k "
99,"Excluding psychometry and interview methods, is there any physical or molecular method that can confirm mild autism?","ASD is a set of very much heterogeneous symptoms with some common characteristics like lack of eye contact, lack of social guesswork, difficulty in learning unwritten social norms or conventions, missing the sense of personal boundary of other people, lacking or inappropriate gesture, restricted repeatitive and intense interests, etc.   The interview and psychometry methods, sort of, work, still misdiagnosis ain both ways, are common and develop controversies and harasses. Delayed diagnosis is also a fact.   But my question is; do we yet have any ""confirmed"" and reliable test for ASD particularly those at the ""mild"" end of the spectrum? Such as a scan-based technique such as MRI/ fMRI/ DTI or say electrophysilology techniques such as EEG or qEEG or molecular tests like DNA blotting or DNA sequencing or Elisa etc does such physical or molecular techniques can characterise ASDs??   Notably, this article says no significant anatomical difference found in a large-scale analysis using ABIDE database.   "
100,What's the importance of reward on acquiring expert level skill?,"I've been reading into Anders Ericssons work on expertise and as made popular by Malcom Gladwell(though quoted incorrectly) is the requirement of accumulating large amounts of ""deliberate practice""(Practice with a specific goal in mind with adequate feedback). I was also looking into Daniel Coyle's work on skill development and he follows a sort of similar theory in the sense that he does agree with deliberate practice, but puts more of an emphasis on ""reaching"" which can be defined as practicing and pushing yourself slightly outside your abilities with every practice session.   I don't see a reason to disagree with the above, but I pose another question which is how does one achieve consistency in the above described practice, which is usually tiring and require discipline (sometimes the mood just doesn't strike us to practice much less practice at the edge of our abilities).   My theory is that those who persist and are consistent in their practice over a long period of time in pursuit of expertise either deliberately or not have a reward system(Something releases dopamine as a result of practicing). It seems reasonable that people are only motivated to do a task where there is a positive correlation between reward and difficulty. So my question is how important is reward in your guys' opinion in achieving expertise? How can we add more reward to practice if it is important? "

102,Difficulty of having profound scientific discussions with more than 2 or 3 people?,"I am a physicist and the other day, a friend of mine pointed out something that I had never noted explicitly before. This is an empirical observation, but it seems true to me, and it may raise a lot of questions about the current organization of research. I wonder whether this has already been documented and studied, either from the sociological or psychological points of view.  The observation is that fundamental discussions on physics (i.e. implying non-standard physics and epistemology) often occur in discussions involving at most 2 or 3 good friends (all being physicists). The more people you involve (5 or 6 good friends), the harder it is to speak about these subjects. It is not ""explicit""; it is just a personal feeling that a kind of ""social pressure"" appears and tends to bring the discussion closer to ""standard discussion subjects"". And it seems to occur even if all possible subgroups of 2 or 3 people among the global group of 5 or 6 people are OK with having fundamental discussions on physics when they are isolated from each other.  My questions are:   Is this a well-known effect? (Any links to studies?) What is its origin? How to avoid it?  "

104,Could motivational interviewing techniques be used without engaging with a counselor?,"I've found lots of info on motivational interviewing for strengthening a person's own motivation and commitment to change, but I'm wondering if this technique has been adapted to help people who won't or can't get to a counselor or therapist.    Is a therapist required to administer the interviews?  Has anyone used the technique without having therapist appointments, e.g., could an interactive website provide similar guidance? "
105,What is the difference between a psychopath and sociopath?,"The Internet is of course full of memes from Sherlock Holmes show, based on one of the episodes having Sherlock self-diagnose:     I'm not a psychopath, I'm a highly functioning sociopath   But what exactly is the difference?  Wikipedia does not actually seem to offer any meaningful distinction between the two, including seemingly indicating that they are synonymous in DSM but not actually named there.     The DSM and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) subsequently introduced the diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder, stating that these have been referred to (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy.

106,Why do we have so many wishes and desires?,"Two years ago I started to learn (as self-education) evolution theory and neurobiology for to understand - who we are and where we came from? Now I see clearly that we are our brains, which are the result of RNA &amp; DNA selection and replication.  Many of the issues now resolved for me: about love and intuition, origin of religion and art etc.  But one question remains ""a mystery"": why are there so many wishes, desires, urges? What is the neurobiology base for a monstrous amount of consumer goods, objects of art etc.?  The most primitive idea is ""complexity of brain -> intricacy of processes -> lots of desires"". Another naive answer has to do with so called ""play-explore-investigation instinct"", which plays an important role when two basic instincts are ""still"".  But to me, human wishes and urges look like more of a  Akkerman function  than just ""a lot of"".  I belive that (sooner or later) evolution and neuroscience will give answers to all questions  about our mind and behavior. So glad to hear something about this one! "
107,Explanations of responses to real graphic harm,"I want to know answers to the following questions :   Why do I feel curious sometimes to check out sites of ""real accidents"" such as ""Documenting Reality"" or ""Live Leak"" ? Why do I feel nauseous when I have seen a few of these events, such as videos / images of real motorcycle accidents ?   I am confused that I feel both occasionally (every 3 months say) curious to see what really happens to people in these accidents as well as feel physically ill once I have seen that.  I suppose this is somewhat similar to the reason people slow down to ""take a look"" at a motor vehicle accident while driving past on the highway.  I guess what I am also interested in is -- how is it possible for people to feel turned on by this same content -- such as ""self harmers"" or psychopaths? Is there a ""causal emotional chain"" that could be explained the reactions of such people as compared with the feeling of aversion ... or is such arousal just random and unexplainable? "
108,"Are axon terminals always part of a synapse, or are there any that just release neurotransmitters into the ether during an action potential?","By ""ether"" I mean to no post-synaptic cell in particular.   If this is the case, how common is it for an axon terminal to not be part of a synapse?  Related question: do axon terminals form only as part of a synapse? Or are they formed ahead of time, and then connect to form synapses as needed? "

110,Is there a psychological explanation for the age of 18 being important in many societies?,The age of eighteen is an age that in many societies gives rise to various additional rights and responsibilities.   Is there a scientific reason for assigning such right and responsibilities at the age of 18? What are some of reasons and history for this convention?  
111,Why does clickbait use numbers?,"Around the Internet, especially in social media, we see examples of hyperlinks in a common format that has been cynically dubbed ""click bait"" or ""link bait"".   The idea is that authors publish these links with evocative titles, trying to entice a casual browser into clicking the link and viewing the content (where the resultant loading of the advertisements presumably earn some small amount of money for the content provider).  Some examples of click bait (with links removed, to protect everyone's sanity) are:        Watch out, these 15 baby penguins are waddling off to steal your heart.    31 creative life hacks every girl should know   20 Powerful D-Day Photos On The 70th Anniversary Of The Invasion   11 Sexy Star Wars Tattoos      Many of these kind of links use provocative phrasing, like ""you won't believe"" and ""will shock you"". I can see intuitively why this works to entice people to click the link.  What is the reason for giving a number, like in the examples? Is there any psychology involved in this trend?    This question comes from someone who doesn't really know anything about psychology or cognitive science; I'm just interested.  "
112,"Is learning and memory formation mostly comprised of new synapses forming, or already-existent synapses strengthening?","I'm guessing it may be some combination of the two. If so, which is the more frequent situation?  I'm also guessing it varies depending on the type of memory being formed. Let's take for instance, my memory of opening up this tab and clicking the ""Ask Question"" button about 30 seconds ago. Surely this can't just be a case of strengthening former synaptic connections, right? It's a completely new and specific memory. So would it be a case of (for the most part) many new synapses being formed to somehow encode this memory? It seems hard to believe that there could be so many new synapses being created constantly in order to encode so many memories. It must happen lightning-fast, no? "
113,Why does not everyone avoid peak hour rushes?,"We all want/wish to avoid heavily crowded places. There are a few such places we daily encounter - office closing hours traffic, heavy rush at the food counter at lunch time, bank closing hours, evenings in markets.   No one likes to stand in a queue or move at a snail's pace in a heavily crowded street. But why do we still find these rushes occurring every day ?  This either means that -    Not everyone hates queues. There are people who will prefer going amidst heavy traffic.  Not everyone knows how to avoid these - which is quite hard to believe. Its common knowledge that if you leave by 6pm (or whenever your office ends) you will find huge rush on the main road.  Some people try to act smart(or try to bluff) - they think many people won't turn up at the peak hours fearing the rush, so let me go at the usual time. This is what ""majority"" of the people end up thinking and thus the rush happens again.   [I can't think of any sensible reasons]  Is there any reasonable scientific/rationale explanation for the above phenomenon ? "
114,Is a Hopfield network with a continuous activation variable and a discrete time variable possible?,"I've found plenty of resources on Hopfield networks that use either discrete variables for both activation level and time or continuous variables for both activation level and time. Is it possible to construct a Hopfield neural network that uses a continuous variable for activation level and a discrete variable for time? If it is possible, can anyone offer resources and/or tips on how to construct one in software? "
115,What is the support for a global personality factor?,"The Big 5 is a popular framework for describing major factors of individual differences in personality. More recently, I've been hearing people talking about the utility of conceptualising personality in terms of a single factor of personality. The idea might be to map the Big 5 on to one global factor with high conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and openness combined with low neuroticism.  Questions   How has such a global factor been conceptualised?  How much variance is typically explained by this factor relative to other factor models such as the Big 5 using personality test items?  To what extent  does such a global factor reflect true personality variance versus social desirability bias or an artefact of questionnaire item measurement? What are the major authors or references advocating the global personality factor?   "
116,"Is there a ""foreplay"" equivalent, priming activity for thinking or conversation?","I've noticed the following phenomenon and am trying to find out if it is indeed true and if there is a scientific term for it:  When I think about ideas, I notice that I can rarely jump straight into ""heavy"" stuff, like thinking about a cognitive neuroscience article I read. Instead, doing another activity that ""primes"" my brain first tends to make me more conductive to heavy thinking. This can be watching a talk on TED.com or reading some lighter article.    In conversation, I find that it's fairly hard to have a ""heart to heart"" talk with a person right off the bat, but a casual conversation can evolve in that direction.  When thinking about the phenomenon, the following supporting evidence comes to mind:  I've read that in some asian cultures, it is traditional to start a business deal with small talk, or over a friendly dinner. The motivation for this tradition was weird to me, until I thought about it light of the phenomenon described above.  Most of my successful job interviews started with small talk, unrelated to skills or position at hand.   When thinking about other human ""priming"" behaviors, the one I can think of most clearly is  foreplay before sexual encounters, which serves the following role     Foreplay is important from at least two considerations, one of which   is purely physiological.[6] On the other hand, foreplay implies a   certain level of confidence and trust between the partners and creates   intimacy. Psychologically, foreplay lowers inhibitions and increases   emotional intimacy between partners. Physically, it stimulates the   process that produces sexual arousal.   I'm interested if there is indeed some ""priming"" activity that can put the human brain in a state of mind, where thinking or conversation is easier?  If so, what is the term for such activity? Has any neurotransmitter been implicated in the phenomenon described above? "
117,How does one study the effect of a dietary supplement on cognition?,"I've really enjoyed this talk by Molly Crockett: Beware neuro-bunk. The speaker outlines the limitations of modern neuroscience when accessing the effectiveness of dietary supplements intended to enhance cognition. I believe the speaker mentioned that 68% of (americans?) take dietary supplements for a variety of reasons.  I've done some research, and these compounds typically go into ""neuro enhancing"" products:   DMAE GABA N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine Vinpoceitine 5-HTP Vitamin B complex   This got me thinking: How does one assess the effectiveness of dietary supplements on cognition? These are low- dose compounds that may be taken at random times of a day, combined with assorted other supplements. How does one study the effects of something like that? Is there a ""gold standard"" study that I can take a look at to understand how this is done?  What I'm interested in is how do they account for the time of day, and other supplements/drugs/activity that happened and followed the study.  When thinking about ""real psychoactive drugs"", their effect is much more profound, and thus easier to study, with a fairly well defined  onset times, intensity curves. For example, I can go to erowid.org and see curves like the one below for      With a graph like that, one can with a reasonable certainty estimate the duration and intensity of effects. But what about dietary supplements? Is it just big placebo? "
118,What is the scientific support for Einstein's claim about the negative effects of reading too much?,"Einstein once said:     Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its   creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain   too little falls into lazy habits of thinking, just as the man who spends too much time in   the theater is tempted to be content with living vicariously instead of living his own life.    What is the scientific claim implicit in this quote? Is it true that reading too much makes the mind lazy, and is reading too much harmful to the mind?   *Quote from an interview with G.S. Viereck, ""What Life Means to Einstein,"" Saturday Evening Post, October 26, 1929; re-printed in Viereck, Glimpses of the Great, 437. "
119,"Will Our Brain Speed Reduce As Our Memory ""Mail Boxes"" Fill Up?","I recently stumbled accross the article ""When the Brain's Mailbox Is Full"", which can be found here:  [website]The article claims that:     ''As we get older, we run out of places to store new information,''   said Dr. H. Lee Swanson, a psychologist at the University of   California at Riverside and the author of the study. ''We have a   limited amount of space in our memory system.''

120,"What is the scientific term for unexpected, spontaneous dream recall?","I'm interested if there's a term for spontaneous dream recall. I will try to define the phenomenon I'm talking about.  Over 10 years ago, I started to notice that I can spontaneously recall dreams, and clearly label them as dreams. I may recall 3 dreams from the past night, then more dreams from weeks or months ago. Some of these dreams I have written down, others were ""forgotten"" upon awakening, only to be recalled much later. That's a lot of dreams. When in this state of spontaneous recall, I can consciously guide the recall process once the original dream is recalled and recall a number of additional dreams that may or may not be loosely connected to that one.  Just to clarify, these are not fantasies and neither waking memories. I can clearly distinguish a waking memory from a dream memory. The entire dream memory is recalled in a flash with all the details: place, action, characters present. All of this over a second or so, similar in duration to the Deja-vu.   I've looked up and found Cryptomnesia, which is defined as:      Cryptomnesia occurs when a forgotten memory returns without it being   recognised as such by the subject, who believes it is something new   and original.   What I'm describing is similar to Cryptomnesia, except that the memory is immediately recognized as a previously seen dream.   This phenomenon makes me believe that I do not really ""forget"" dreams. Normally, such memories are ""blocked"" from ordinary awareness, but can be recalled at random times of the day, or when laying in bed and preparing for sleep. Just to clarify: I calculated that I potentially see up to 1600 dreams in a year, and can recall many of them this way.  Is there a search term I can use to look at scientific literature that deals with the phenomenon of unbidden, spontaneous (dream)memory recall? Maybe there's something that deals with real memory recall that sounds similar? "
121,Does anxiety produce adrenaline or does adrenaline make the person anxious?,"Its obvious that both are related(adrenaline and anxiety) but which causes which? What (I think) I know:   Anxiety accelerates the hearth rhythm due to the feeling of fear. It makes the body believe that there is a need to spend an enormous amount of energy getting away(someway) so it cuts the blood flow in the cognitive parts of the brain and sends more blood to the other muscles, it also releases adrenaline in the blood due to the increasing need of energy(even if there is no real need). Adrenaline, (when released) makes the hearth rhythm increase and gives some ""extra"" power to the muscles by cutting the blood flow in the brain and giving it to the muscles. With the lost of blood flow in the brain the person loses a considerable part of the cognitive capacity (among other things), causing the person to have some feelings (like anxiety) and unreal thoughts.   Resuming my question: Anxiety results in a release of adrenaline, but adrenaline also makes the brain malfunction causing some feelings like anxiety. It makes sense but it is an infinite cycle. What is the false (and why), or if both are true then how does it ends? "
122,Do feelings have a purpose?,"A car has dashboard lights, like ""check engine"" to indicate malfunctions, etc. Do human feelings have some similar, meaningful function (x produces feeling y), or are feelings just random glitches of cognition?  I can think of feelings that are easy to define:   pain, localized to the injury site as serving a purpose: do not use the injured limb until it feels healed. Heartburn may be a feeling associated with eating incorrect types of foods: stop chewing gum and the feeling goes away. Feeling heat/cold has a purpose that may be connected to metabolism and thermoregulation. Feeling of hunger is relieved by eating   For example, the feeling of hunger can be explained by the balance of hormones of leptin and ghrelin, which control appetite and the feeling of satiety.   But what about those other feelings, defined by abstract words from dictionaries? Jealous, silly, disgusted,motivated,comfortable, etc, etc. Here's a list of human feelings. One can imagine what they are, but to catch oneself in one of them is a completely different thing. I'm interested if feeling in some way has a purpose. Can we say something about the hormone/neurotransmitter levels based on how a person is feeling? "
123,How are qualia localized in consciousness?,"I understand that evolution incorporated arbitrary qualia into the default network to inform consciousness (the largest cranial global processing information subnetwork) about properties and qualities of the body in spacetime. However, how does the feeling in my toe know to appear near my toe when nerves there are stimulated? Is this an illusion, and there is extraneous processing that matches the visual stimulus of me looking at my toe and the tactile stimuli of someone touching it to make those qualia feel related, even localized in the same area in space?  What if my somatosensory cortex was moved to my stomach (say all dendrites and axons were chopped off and were replaced with wireless hubs that signaled to the newly transplanted somatosensory cortex in my stomach). I would presumably experience no change in consciousness, which indicated localization of qualia is not achieved by the spatial embedding of the neurons, but by their graph-theoretic interconnection.  If I swapped the information processing (in some information-theoretic sense, say graph-dynamics) associated to the smell of strawberry (it's much more complicated than that but just go with it for a second) with the brain's processing of thermal information from afferent skin sensors, would I appear to feel the smell of strawberry all over my body when it's cold and the feel of cold in my nose when I smelled strawberry? I am excluding affect swap here so the qualia of strawberry smell now feels unpleasant like cold and the qualia of cold feels pleasant like strawberry smell.  Now what if in mad science I permuted the thermal sensors all over my body? Say my foot and hand neurons got swapped (say through a nanobot intercepting wireless relay). Would my hand feel cold when my foot is immersed in ice and vice versa? This would indicate these qualia are processed in consciousness in the brain rather than at the afferent sensor sites.  For bonus credit: How does this relate to phantom limb syndrome? Are there other observed processing defects that lead to faulty localization? E.g. Out of body experiences, certain particularly nasty mental disorders like dementia, rewiring of somatosensory map due to stroke, that engineering dean who wanted his arm chopped off (I forgot the name but I heard this from V.S. Ramachandran)  Second bonus credit: I've read ""butterflies"" in your stomach are serotonin releases in the enteric nervous system. Doesn't consciousness have to be informed of this release for you to feel it? If not, how do disconnected information graphs allow you the cohesive ability to feel in love? "
124,What positive writing exercises improve happiness?,"Writing seems like a perfect medium for expressing ones problems but can it also be used to improve happiness somehow? Maybe through some sort of creative writing exercises that focus on positive thinking?  Are there any positive writing exercise that can improve happiness, if even temporarily? "
125,In what ways can someone increase their brain function while reading,"On Facebook, someone posed the following question:     In what ways can someone increase brain function while reading?  I like to read but have problems retaining information.  Sometimes I get a headache that seems to bound off anything I read, and the more I read the more it bounces off.   My answer would be:     Split your target text into smaller chunks and read each multiple times, so you can build ""islands of understanding"" before moving on. Do you have an example text you are stuck on?   Are there more methods for improving reading in this fashion?  Related:  Is it possible to improve reading speed and visual comprehension by doing exercises? "
126,Any research on right-hand/left-hand based preferences when interacting with an interface?,"My original question is ""Left or right placement of interactive elements on a web page"", but only now did I find a place where I think I can find the right people to understand it.  The gist is: is there any natural inclination in right-handed people, when reading a web page, for example, to prefer those interface elements which lead to actions (e.g. ""print"", ""save"", ""get a link"", etc.) to be placed on the right side of the screen and then, to prefer navigational elements (e.g. menus, especially tree-structured category menus) to be placed on the left side, while the preference for content for reading would be in the middle?   That is: navigation (reference stuff) on the left, content (passive perception stuff) in the middle, action elements on the right, all in this manner because of a potential instinct to reach for anything action related with one's right hand.  Is there any research or at least speculation on the subject?  And a follow-up question: if there is such an inclination does it appear to be reverse in left-handed people?  update: - similar question asked here: [website]"
127,Are there any reliable self-tests for autism spectrum disorder?,"Are there any reliable tests, on-line or available for download, for auto-diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (including Asperger syndrome)?   I've found that test: [website]So now I'm searching for another test, that is verified by scientists and not based on some unproved assumptions.   To be clear: I'm fully aware that no self-diagnosis can be replacement for diagnosis by professional. I'm aware that the results can be strongly affected by my personal assumptions. However, I'm not decided to get formal diagnosis because it would give me no benefits now and my claims to be diagnosed could be rejected because my social skills have been strongly improved in my adult life. "
128,What effect do random visitors have on children in orphanages and people in old age homes?,"Leading a volunteering team, I've been to an orphanage where the sister (who did a psychology course) running the orphanage was strict that volunteers should spend a minimum of 3 months teaching the kids on the weekends if they wanted to, because kids develop an attachment to the visitors. Another NGO insists that volunteers pledge a minimum of one year if they wish to mentor a child.    At another orphanage which is frequented by volunteers of many companies, a worker there said that the kids were accustomed to seeing strangers everyday. Girls at an orphanage in Delhi told my friend (head of an orphanage in Bangalore) that they don't like it when (well-meaning) visitors arrive and ask them to stand in front of them and narrate a poem or sing a song for them.    As a volunteering leader, I encourage people to contribute to society meaningfully. I want to know what the best psychological/emotional effect we can have on the children. Would it be bad for the children in the long-run, to see strangers come to conduct events for them where they sing and dance, distribute snacks and gifts and then the kids never get to see these people again. People from various companies visit these kids. Is it better to not conduct such events, and instead ensure that volunteers visit these kids weekly/monthly, find out what their needs are, become familiar with the kids and help them in whatever way possible?    The problem here, is that a lot of volunteers see what other companies are doing, and are more interested in conducting a grand event at orphanages/old-age-homes, donate money or gifts and then walk away. They say they don't have the time for multiple visits.     Should I discourage people to do this? (a friend described it as being similar to visiting a zoo)   Shouldn't they spend more time with the children/senior-citizens? Empathy and understanding.   Won't it just reinforce the kids/senior-citizen's belief that nobody really cares about them?   Is there any research done on the psychological/emotional effect this has?  "
129,Do widespread brain toxins explain violence rates?,"Saw this: [website]  Lead emissions from tailpipes rose steadily from the early '40s   through the early '70s, nearly quadrupling over that period. Then, as   unleaded gasoline began to replace leaded gasoline, emissions   plummeted.      Intriguingly, violent crime rates followed the same upside-down U   pattern... The two curves looked eerily identical, but were offset   by about 20 years.   They claim a strong methodology: they studied during the phaseout of leaded fuel (which was not implemented uniformly across places, crucially) and subsequent violence levels. The same trend was proved across the world. Lead shrinks the part of the brain responsible for empathy, hence where lead poisoning was more common, people are more predisposed to violence. Big cities thus become more violent.  Do widely-spread brain toxins explain more violence? Are many violent criminals people who got their prefrontal cortexes shrunk by toxins? Do big cities make people aggressive and violent due to increased concentration of toxins? "
130,Evidence that qualia are not the same as physical processes?,"With regards to the answer posted by @sandygautman in the question Do feelings have a purpose:  Let me first state that I don't have a problem with either the question nor the answer; I'm only looking for some clarification.    From the answer:     If fear circuit is activated, the organism exhibits a flight-fight-freeze response. Conscious feeling of fear may or may not be involved, but physiological changes like activation of sympathetic system happens. If the unconscious fear circuit is OK to keep us out of harm's way (predators) why do we also need to feel fearful? A related meta question is, if a zombie behaving like me, but having no qualia, can and will succeed similar to me, why have consciousness?      I'll address the questions, but first let me solidify the claim that unconscious processes are sufficient for most adaptive regulations. Consider your example of heat/cold as thermo-regulation of body temperature...but do you really need to 'feel' heat/cold for that. Consider when you are sound asleep- you still unconsciously cover with blanket or throw away blanket depending on how sweaty/ cold you are- you dont need to consciously register that. So thermo-regulation, like other adaptive actions of affects, can happen in absence of accompanying felt feelings.   (emphasis mine)  What evidence do we have for a separation between the processing of a stimulus and the experience of a stimulus?   That is, what evidence is there to indicate that what we experience is NOT the body processing the stimulus? For example, what evidence is there that the experience of cold when jumping into a lake is different than the body processing the temperature difference (and processing related tasks such as thermo-regulation, etc)?  My assumption has been that the only difference between 'feeling' something or not 'feeling' something has been attention; that doesn't mean the 'feeling' isn't there, but that it is literally not being processed by the conscious/attentive part of the brain.    That is, instead of saying        So thermo-regulation, like other adaptive actions of affects, can happen in absence of accompanying felt feelings   it would be more correct to say:       So thermo-regulation, like other adaptive actions of affects, can happen in absence of consciousness of or attention to the thermo-regulation process      I'm concerned that this question is unclear, but I have to leave my computer for a while, so please let me know if you have any confusion and I will attempt to clarify.

131,"What happens in your brain when a concept ""clicks""?","What happens in your mind when the ""lightbulb goes off"", or a concept ""clicks"" for you? Why is there such a threshold for human understanding?  Existing searches: I've searched a good amount for it. ""when the light bulb goes off"" leads me to English Grammar-related/expression questions, ""What’s Happening When Something Clicks?"" gives one or two decent articles, like one from xraylistening.com, but doesn't really scientifically answer my question. ""Aha moment"" just tells me about the feeling. These are just a few of the searches I've done. I've searched, but haven't gotten a satisfactory answer. "
132,How can the aversion response be explained neurologically?,"If Dopamine and Dopamine D2 receptor is involved in craving, wanting and clinging towards something or incentive salience     Dopamine is closely associated with reward-seeking behaviors, such as   approach, consumption, and addiction.[38] Recent researches suggest   that the firing of dopaminergic neurons is a motivational substance as   a consequence of reward-anticipation. This hypothesis is based on the   evidence that, when a reward is greater than expected, the firing of   certain dopaminergic neurons increases, which consequently increases   desire or motivation towards the reward (from dopamine on Wikipedia )   What is the opposite mechanism in humans - by which we are experiencing aversion from something?  For example, someone finds something rotten, stinky and covered in white fuzzy mold in a plastic bag. Eww! Gross! Get it away! don't touch it! Keep distance. What is neurologically responsible for the person's feeling of aversion towards an object like that?  Are there different pathways to aversion?  For example, would seeing a person who looks like a witch from fairy tales (old, ugly, rotten teeth, lots of warts, body odor) cause the same aversion response as moldy food? "
133,What causes short-term dysphoria following intense pleasure?,"I'm interested in the phenomenon of short term Dysphoria:     Dysphoria is a state of feeling unwell or unhappy; a feeling of emotional and mental discomfort as a symptom of discontentment, restlessness, dissatisfaction, malaise, depression or anxiety.   What interests me is when Dysphoria arises following moments of intense pleasure:   Post-coital tristesse, a feeling of blues following orgasm Postorgasmic illness syndrome Dysphoria associated with recreational drug use, where X minutes of euphoria are followed by Y minutes of dysphoria ( I do not know the term for this one).   The phenomenon that I'm describing lasts from 5 minutes to a few hours, then disappears. It is experienced by only a small subset of population.  I tried to look for an explanation, but cannot find the cause - why Dysphoria appears following intense pleasure? Is Dopamine or Dopamine Transporter or D2 receptors involved in some way ? Is this some sort of sensitization/desensitization homeostasis mechanism at play?  Thank you for any search terms or hints that would help me shed light on the subject.  "
134,What is the definition of affective cueing?,"In contrast to affective priming, what is affective cueing? I'm not sure how to differentiate between the two.   I found a good review on affective priming in Karl Christoph Klauer (1997) in the European Review of Social Psychology, and from this I gather that affective priming simply is a priming which is targeted at emotions instead of at reactions. I did not find any definition of affective cueing so far. The best I could manage was from this question, however it does not help me at all, nor do the reference in there. "
135,Effect of Physical Exercise on Intelligence/IQ,"I am interested in empirical research relevant to answering the following questions:   What is the effect of physical exercise on IQ/intelligence? Does any such effect vary by type of exercise? e.g. aerobics, weights Are there any forms of physical exercise that can stimulate brian growth?  "
136,Is the Raspberry Pi capable of operating as a stimulus presentation system for experiments?,"I'm outfitting a small behavioural lab with a fiscal-austerity-induced budget. I'm considering trying out a Raspberry pi for individual participant systems. My tentative plan is to run linux and code experiments in python.   Does anyone have any experience with this?   My primary concern is whether the processor and video capabilities of the Pi will make it accurate enough in terms of timing. Will the Pi have substantial delay / variability between a call to present complicated visual stimuli (like arrays of Gabors) and the time stimuli actually appear on the screen? When a keyboard or mouse button gets pressed, what will be the delay / variability between the actual response time and the recorded response time?  "
137,What's the frequency of the ringing in my ear?,"I have ringing in my ears that has become constant over time. Most of the time I just ignore it, to tell you the truth I can't even remember when it started. Lately I'm curious what the frequency of the ringing is.  Is it the same for everyone or does it vary?The answer seems to be that it varies  Are there any usual suspect frequencies?  If it's always different from person to person, what's the easiest way of figuring out what it is? Is there an app for that? I still haven't found answer to this  When I chew something tough, many times I can hear the ringing increase in loudness and decrease as I flex my jaw and release. Thought this might be relevent. "
138,Why is my mind working against me?,"I have recently read that most of the thoughts in our head are automatically produced by our subconscious mind and that the conscious mind is there to focus on those thoughts or not.   I wanted to perform a task but then my mind started to make excuses which eventually led to anxiety and avoiding the task even though I knew I should've done the task. I think this was a subconscious reaction.   I also read that to avoid bad thoughts you can ""rise above them"" by meditation and so on. That however looks to me like treating the effects and not the symptoms of the problem.   My question is:      Why do I get negative thoughts at all in the first place that trick me into avoiding/not doing what I want and is it possible to get rid of them altogether ?    Philosophically It seems that my mind has life of it's own and sometimes it works with me but other times against me, it's like I've got no control over the thoughts that appear in my head. Furthermore I've read somewhere that the whole consciousness might be just a clever trick and that we're actually on an autopilot the whole time. Any thoughts about that ? "
139,Attributing change in DV to IV manipulation: between-groups (control group) vs mixed-model (pre&post measure),"One often sees researchers attributing a change in the dependent variable to their experimental manipulation, semingly without considering whether this change in DV occurs between or within groups.  For instance, in the classical Bargh et al. (1996) paper on behavioural priming, subjects in an experimental group were shown word primes recalling stereotypes of old age (e.g. ""forgetful""), while subjects in a controlg group were shown neutral words. Everyone's walking speed as they left the experiment was measured, and because the first group's was slower, it was concluded that priming people with words relating to a certain concept (in this case: old age) makes them unconsciously take on characteristics of that concept (in this case: walking more slowly).  The question that comes to my mind is, however: how do we know that the mean difference in walking speed is not just due to pre-existing (baseline) differences between the groups? How can we be sure it is due to the IV manipulation (different word primes)?   To me, believable evidence for this claim would be if they had measured everyone's speed pre&amp;post-experiment, and then found an interaction showing that, while controls' speed stayed the same pre-to-post, that of the old-age-primed group had decreased. Without such an interaction (involving the use of a mixed between-within model), is the authors' between-groups-only inference statistically correct? "
140,Source of sensory data related to cognitive effort,"How does the brain assess cognitive effort? Is there a chemical that is being created or consumed at a rate that is proportionate to the amount of effort felt?  I'm mostly interested in short term effort, such as in short-term-memory tasks. "
141,Is semantic pointer architecture compatible with a predictive coding account of the brain?,"Both SPA (Eliasmith et al.) and predictive coding (Friston, Clark, Rao, et al.) seem to have a lot of explanatory power.      My understanding of SPA is probably rudimentary, but Eliasmith and others seem to be able to explain and simulate higher-order psychological constructs (e.g., emotions, concepts) impressively well.  Similarly, predictive coding (e.g., Clark, 2013)--if correct--is a very convincing account of the fundamental computations of the brain.  And there's a lot of emerging evidence to support it.   So I'm curious whether these frameworks can be integrated.  Would Spaun perform better by implementing some sort of predictive coding algorithm(s)? Or does SPA make this unnecessary?  These questions may be poor due to my ignorance about the complexities of SPA and NEF, but any insight would be great. "
142,Processing Inverted English Script,"I was sitting in a restaurant when I realized that it was relatively easy to read this list of a few locations in inverted English script. It made me curious about how it is possible to read this with such ease. It also seems that since these names may be familiar, I might just be engaging in ""inverted image"" recognition since the normal 'whole image' (e.g. Boston) seems so familiar. Perhaps if these locations were not familiar, it would be slightly harder to process the text.  I was conflicted between posting this in this or in the Linguistics StackExchange but felt that this would be more relevant since there will be multiple perspectives from those interested in neuroscience, psycholinguistics, machine learning and natural-language processing.  A search on the internet seemed to give a lot of instances of the freak-phenomenon of 'mirror writing' and the well-known phenomenon of irrelevance of spelling in comprehension. Furthermore, it is important to notice that this is different from writing of those who are diagnosed with Dyslexia who process language differently (the writing is whole-wise flipped as opposed to individually). However, there seemed to be a dearth of information on this topic in particular. Of course, I am not interested in one-word instances, another example would be like this.     My questions are :-  Are there any good experiments on the phenomenon of processing inverted text ?  Although very little is understood about the neuroscience of language, are there any neurolinguistic perspectives on this phenomenon?  What are the underlying mechanisms hypothesized by the quoted papers in processing such text?  Does there seem to be any evidence of rule-based processing  (e.g. flipping each letter individually)   "
143,How is saccadic movement managed in the brain?,"I haven't been able to find any decent articles on this specific topic. So I have three (hopefully quick) questions:   What part of the brain is actively controlling saccadic movement? If this part were to be removed, does saccadic movement cease to exist and cause the person to go blind from not being able to look around? Additionally, is there a disorder which eliminates saccadic movement in some way?  "
144,What is the underlying genetic basis for ADHD?,"According to Psychcentral depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, schizophrenia and autism are traceable to the same inherited genetic variations  According to AsapSCIENCE, depression could be genetic due to a variation in the serotonin transporter gene. Having at least one short seems to give some kind of genetic predisposition to depression.  So what's the analogue of the serotonin transporter gene in ADHD? Is there a dopamine transporter gene?  I have double posted this question on the Biology StackExchange. "
145,Do antidepressants reduce displays of anger prevalent in those diagnosed with ADHD?,"According to Wikipedia and WebMD , difficulties in managing anger are more prevalent in children with ADHD.  Why are antidepressants used in treating symptoms of ADHD?  Is this due to a relationship between aggression (specifically, the display of ""angry"" affect) and the administration of antidepressant drugs? Is this relationship well-studied?  "
146,What is the relationship between anger management difficulties and ADHD?,"According to Wikipedia, ""Difficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD""  Is it that the anger is due to ADHD specifically? Is the anger suggestive of a comorbid disorder? Could it be either? "
147,Why ADHD instead of ADD? / Why predominantly hyperactive-impulsive instead of predominantly-impulsive?,"The types of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are:   predominantly inattentive predominantly hyperactive-impulsive combined   Not sure I understand. People with ADHD are hyperactive because of the H in ADHD. So what's the point of the word ""hyperactive"" being in both ""predominantly hyperactive-impulsive"" and ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"" ? Why not just say predominantly impulsive or attention deficit disorder?    Edit to justify this question not being a duplicate:  I think one of the terms unnecessarily uses the word ""hyperactive"":   ADHD predominantly hyperactive-impulsive   Why do we use hyperactive twice? Why not   ADD has 3 types: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, combined   or   ADHD has 3 types: predominantly inattentive, predominantly impulsive, combined?  "
148,How are friend pairs similar in terms of personality and individual differences?,"Lay psychology holds different opinions on whether having similar or different personalities promotes friendships between people. A case in point may be the conflicting idioms of ""birds of a feather flock together"" versus ""opposites attract"". Which one of them is true?   How does similarity in personality affect becoming friends? Are there certain personality traits that correlate positively or negatively between friends?  "
149,What problem-solving skills are essential for the Allen AI Science Challenge?,"Recently, many in cognitive science and machine learning circles are very interested in the 'The Allen AI Science Challenge' that was recently announced. Here is a brief description:     The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) is working to   improve humanity through fundamental advances in artificial   intelligence. One critical but challenging problem in AI is to   demonstrate the ability to consistently understand and correctly   answer general questions about the world.       The Aristo project at AI2 is focused on building such a system. One   way Aristo ""learns"" is by extracting facts from various sources and   processing them into a structured knowledge base. When taking an exam,   questions are parsed and processed along with any accompanying   diagrams to determine a strategy for answering. Aristo then uses   entailment, statistical analysis, and inference methods to select a   final answer.      While Aristo's abilities have improved significantly in the last two   years, it still doesn't have perfect, reliable methods of gathering   knowledge, understanding questions, or reasoning through answers.      Using a dataset of multiple choice question and answers from a   standardized 8th grade science exam, AI2 is challenging you to create   a model that gets to the head of the class.   What problem solving and reasoning skills do you feel a computer will need to get past a 8th grade MCQ standardized science test?   What are, or what do you think are the obstacles present in present in training computers to master these cognitive abilities?  And to throw in a subjective question, do you think that someone will be able match this task given the present state of Artificial Intelligence?

150,Why do we talk unconsciously while sleeping,"Somniloquy is very fascinating.   It is unclear what are the causes, but most of the time it is not seen as a medical condition.     ""Sleep talking usually occurs by itself and is most often harmless.   However, in some cases, it might be a sign of a more serious sleep   disorder or health condition.""      [website]Here is a brief descriptive testimony of someone having this condition:      This is what happened to me for about one year: almost every night, I talk unconsciously while sleeping (of course I don't know, but my room mate told me that). I dream almost every night and I consciously perceive that I'm dreaming, that I'm talking to someone, that what is happening in my dream.      Why does this happen? Is it a kind of mental disorder? Is it because my brain is too active and I keep thinking too much about one thing, so that it keeps obsessing me, even in my dream?   In other words, I understand that Bringing dreams to conscious awareness is possible, but why are facial muscles sometimes activated when talking in dreams? Are there correlations with other types of sleep disorders? "
151,Can a brain be modeled as a simplified interaction of different states and their triggers?,"I've long been interested in the concept of ""states of mind"", which influence the perception of the outside world and outlook on past, present and future. They can be thought of as ""colored lenses"" through which the world is perceived. Each state has a certain trigger. Some example states are:   Anxiety - world is a terrible place full of danger Sexual arousal  - brain notices sexual stimuli more and reduces inhibitions Creative inspiration - ideas fly and there's a drive to create   Today I've read about an experiment to replicate a part of a rat brain in supercomputer. The following quote jumped at me as rather significant:     The researchers wrote, that the slow synchronous waves of neuronal   activity, which have been found in the brain during sleep, were   ‘triggered’ during the simulations, suggesting that neural circuits   may have the unique ability to able to switch into different ‘modes’   that could explain critical behaviours.      “An analogy would be a computer processer that can reconfigure to   focus on certain tasks. The experiments suggest the existence of a   spectrum of states, so this raises new types of questions, such as   ‘what if you’re stuck in the wrong state?” said Markram.   I read that the project is criticized due to it's complexity, seems like they are working from the bottom up, which makes me ask:  Are there projects out there that attempt to model the brain from the higher levels of abstraction (discrete states and their triggers) down to more detail?  To use a computer analogy - instead of writing very low level binary code, I can take a high level programming library and work with that. Is there research in this direction?  This image is an example of a state machine - a system is modelled in terms of discrete states and their interactions. The author does not concern themselves with interaction of individual neurons, instead with higher level states:   "
152,Do online mental age tests have any scientific validity?,"If you google for 'mental age calculator', you can find several tests that claim being able to assess your mental age, as opposed to your chronological age.    Is 'mental age' a valid scientific concept? Do online mental age tests have any scientific validity?  "
153,Are there studies on the effect of nicotine patches on dream vividness and dream recall?,"Acetylcholine plays an important role during REM Sleep. I cite an answer to the question ""Why do dreams lose clarity quickly over time after we awaken?"":     Activity in the PFC during sleep may be modulated by levels of acetylcholine, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters.   See references and links there. Nicotine also binds to ACh receptors.  Are there studies on the effect of nicotine patches worn while sleeping on dream vividness and dream recall?  "
154,"For comprehension and critical thinking examinations, is recognition sufficient, or is recall more imperative for success?","Recognition is the ability to retrieve information given a set of stimulus, be it a cue, a hint, a reference to a term then asking one to elaborate. Recall is the ability to produce content without such stimulus. Assume one is taking a critical thinking examination, where there is a discrete list of prerequisite content recommended for success on an examination. However, the examination is not a fill in the blank of this definition with 4 answer choices examination. The examination is of the format where one would read a passage. The passage's content is arbitrary and transcends the discrete list of prerequisite content. That is, it is related to the prerequisite content, but it is more complex and cannot be studied for. To achieve a high score, a test taker must apply relevant prerequisite knowledge to the passage's details and answer scenario questions.   Is the test taker at a disadvantage if the test taker is very fluent in the content, but only from a recognition perspective as opposed to a recall perspective? That is, the test taker cannot spontaneously lecture or write a chapter on the content, but given a cue, can retrieve information.   Here is an example. Pretend there is a neuroscience test. The requisite knowledge the professor assigns include:   Know the physiology of action potentials Know common neurotransmitters and roles Know neuroanatomy Know common psychological disorders such as schizophrenia, ADHD, and symptoms/treatments   A student reads upon these chapters, understands the content well, but cannot simply draw up a chart and list 20 neurotransmitters, with their common effectors, ec. Nor can the student spontaneously reference literature on schizophrenia and genetics for 30 minutes, despite spending hours reading such literature.  Then the student walks into an examination, and the first passage is about a drug that the student has never heard (again, this is a critical thinking examination) of and its mechanism of action in dopamine receptors. The student is asked scenario questions about how this drug would affect schizophrenics. Given the cues ""dopamine"" and ""schizophrenia"", can a student realistically succeed on a test assuming normal reading comprehension if he can only remember pertinent information about ""dopamine"" and ""schizophrenia"" when triggered by a test taking atmosphere, a passage, reading those words, etc.? Or is innate recall outside of these cues more likely to end up in academic success on this test?   "

How much power does the human brain actually use?  Notes: If other assumptions are necessary, just state what you're answering for (e.g. healthy adults). If you know of differences between groups (e.g. people who are awake vs. asleep), please mention both.     References to scientific papers, especially reviews, are helpful.   This paper, which might be the one discussed here, discusses power usage of individual neurons but not the whole brain.  "

158,How do lay people develop psychological theories about themselves and the world?,"Are there models that attempt to chart how lay people develop psychological theories about themselves and their interactions with the world?    For what it's worth, every time I read a post about emotions (or something psychological) on places like reddit, I often see so much strange logic and conceptual confusion. Their lay theories are incoherent and skew so far from scientific data/theory.  So how exactly do naive humans go about developing these theories? Do they perform some sort of hypothesis testing? Bayesian inference? How do they derive (and update) theory from the data?  "
159,Should you completely get rid of your temptations or do them in moderate amount?,"So, I am preparing for this really important exam that requires me to give maximum time to studying and lately, I have found myself addicted to this television series. Although I study during my study time very sincerely, I have begun to realize that watching that television series eats a good amount of time in my daily schedule.   I don't know if I should completely cut it out of my schedule, which according to me might make me crave for it even more or I should watch it only in specified time of the day. If I do the latter, I am afraid, I might lose concentration because those scenes sometimes just keeping running in my head, and also I might just end up watching it for longer than I should.  What should I do? Will cutting it out completely make me crave for it even more? Or is specifying a time for it a good idea? What does psychology say? "

161,Do people feel impotent when arguing with someone able to do Emotional detachment?,"Some people who experienced negative emotions after being forced in their childhood often develop a passive-aggressive behaviour as a form of self defence against whoever is trying to manipulate / force them.  Instead of a simple assertive ""no"" in a dispute they tend to overreact sometimes in a passive-aggressive way, i.e. through emotional detachment.   They are usually aware this can hurt the person who is angry with them but use Techniques of neutralization to feel ""OK"".  But why do people tend to be hurt by this kind of passive aggressive behavior? Does this happen only to people with obsessive / narcissistic personality trait? "
162,"Experimental design with two groups, pre-post measurement, and where everyone is treated","I am designing a study in which a large number of people are being treated. I cannot influence the treatment (e.g., a delayed treatment). I am able to make pre and post treatment measures on the subjects. The treatment has many effects on the subjects. I have a screener that I believe will identify subjects that will predict individuals that will improve on measure A.  The proposed experimental design is for two groups to be identified based on a screening test (the screening test can be administered pre or post treatment). Both groups will be subjected to the same treatment. Prior to and following treatment both groups will be tested on measures A and B. The hypothesis is that the treatment will effect the groups differently on measure A but not on measure B. Is there a term for this design? Is this a valid design? "

I have looked up a bit of information on the topic, but I would still like to know some of the opinions of people on this site. I do know that both have to do with a lack of empathy. Also, how do these disorders work? Is there a certain part of the brain that doesn't function correctly, thus not allowing them to feel empathy, or something of that nature? Thanks in advance to anyone who might come across my question and decide to answer it! "
164,Persuasion strategies by Cialdini (why is punishment not there?),"Cialdini is famous for his book ""Influence"" where he talks about various ways to get people to do things you want them to.  They are:   reciprocation commitment/consistency scarcity authority liking social proof   Should not punishment be included?  Or are there soft/hard ways of persuasion, or perhaps short-term/long-term distinction?    I considered maybe punishment is part of authority, but do all forms of authority have additional power to punish?  I don't think so.  Some are just empty titles/positions.  In addition, non-authority figures also have the power to punish, even if it's not legitimized, and as a result an abusive parent or child, or a bully or someone wielding a knife can punish you if you don't do what they say.  In addition, the effects of or threat of punishment itself can also last a long time, like many other persuasion/influence strategies. "
165,What is the best way to reduce measurement biases when studying topics that can evoke insecurity?,"I'm interested in measurement biases relating to self reporting in surveys.  To add more context:  Under some circumstances, people have been known to add a positive spin when surveyed regarding goals which have significant social status attached to them. One example is how survey subjects over report the number of sexual partners they have or the amount of money they make.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I would assume that if someone is struggling to reach the social standard (ie: having less than what they think is the average number of sexual partners) it will be even harder to get them to be honest, since they are trying to conceal their insecurities to the researchers.  Under what experimental conditions are these people most likely to be honest? Are there any good studies out there that shed light on this question? "
166,Organisation as a factor for safe behavior on the work-place,"Many tools exists that allow the investigation of incidents and safe behavior on the workplace, such as the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) or the System Hardware Environment Lifeware Lifeware (SHELL) model. Both describe the importance of the influence of the (culture within an) organisation on (un)safe behavior.   These tools are used to proof whether the organisation plays a role in an incident or, in general, in unsafe behavior. However, where did these models base the assumptions on that the organisation plays a role? Was there scientific evidence that shows that the organisation can promote (un)safe behavior? "
167,Why Is It That We Have Blindspots in Our Eyes?,"   Introduction:   We humans have an eye resolution of about [tex] megapixels, but just like how nothing is perfect, our eyes have blindspots where we can't sense any information.  In fact, you can find your blindspot by covering one eye, focusing on an object in front of you, set your thumb out in front and translate it until you can't see it.     Questions:    Why do our eyes have blindspots? If we have blindspots, why do we still sense information in that area?     What I mean for [tex] is that even though we have blindspots, we are still able to pick up information (put in simpler terms, why is our vision perfectly smooth instead of riddled with ""dark"" holes where we can't see anything).  This has baffled me for some time. Any ideas? "
168,"Why do people are seeming more charistmatic or sympathic, if they are fans of old things?","I see this very often. Whenever you buy a new car, listen to new music or reading new books you will nerver get the same attention or admiration if you drive an older car, don't listen to trendy music or reading books which are older than myself. And I always wanted to know why? Is it, that you seem more cultural/intellectual if you are a fan of something, which is not that up to date? Is it that it that you seem more ""harmless"" because you are not interested, that other will admire you, but you do it kind of for yourself and swimming in nostalgia? And I talk about goods or activities which are who are not less qualitative or cost more money. "
169,How is the biological error signal in predictive coding computed?,"I am quite inspired by the results obtained by PredNet, which implements a predictive coding model using artificial neural networks. They compute the prediction error as a simple subtraction, and then split the positive and negative into two different feature maps.  Within the predictive coding framework it is believed that biological brains also uses the prediction error to communicate between different areas. How is this error signal computed in biological brains?.  Update  I am especially interested in the mechanical aspects, such as how doe does the brain compare a prediction with the true signal?. Synthetic approaches generally just use a pixel-wise error, and I am wondering if the brain does something analogously. "
170,Applications of project management techniques to managing recovery while in residential addiction treatment programs,"As some background, the Scrum process is a project management process used primarily in software engineering (it's what's sometimes called a type of Agile methodology). Its focus is on developing software iteratively. In general, a particular team will work in one to three week increments called sprints; at the beginning of the sprint, the team will select which outstanding tasks and features they are working on for the next sprint.  One major part of this is the daily stand-up meeting, which includes three questions:   What did you do yesterday? What are you working on today? Do you have any ""blockers""?   These are limited to 15 minutes at most - if there are other, non-checkin-related issues, they're discussed later.  Often, there will be a physical board containing sticky notes with everyone's tasks. Each column contains a particular status type (not started, in development, in QA, complete). People will physically move the sticky note with their particular task across the board as it becomes closer to completion (e.g. halfway across the development column = halfway done with development) and changes status (e.g. when you're done with development, you physically move the sticky note to the ""In QA"" column).  I'm curious about the applications of this to a partial hospitalization program or residential treatment program. It seems like virtually all of them will have some kind of process group, but that they follow a different format than this.  It seems like regular accountability for specific goals and results as well as the idea of iterative progress towards some kind of final outcome could be useful. It seems like this could be particularly beneficial for complicated compulsive behaviors like eating disorders and compulsive hoarding.

Is the title deceiving viewers to feel nostalgic? or is it the video that actually causes nostalgia?  Are there visual (and other sensory) methods, like these, to create a nostalgic feeling in humans?    "
172,Are any kinds of behavior proved to correlate with estrogen levels?,"Are any kinds of behavior proved to correlate with estrogen levels? Any studies done on this? Any indications of such correlations?  Various research has shown correlations with testosterone and behavior, and I suppose there should be something for estrogen as well: Are any kinds of behavior proved to correlate with testosterone levels? "
173,Which personality traits are proved to correlate with any facial features?,"I pretty certain I have read somewhere about certain  personality traits that correlate with certain facial features, but I can't remember just what or where I read. I think the personality traits may have been measured with Big 5 or something close.  I'm not looking for cranial or racial correlations, but facial feature correlations within cultures/ethnicities. I.e specific types of wrinkles. I'm also not looking for perceptions from other people, but measured personalities.   Testosterone is already proved to correlate to behavioral tendencies, which in turn is part of personality: Are any kinds of behavior proved to correlate with testosterone levels? I suppose Estrogen levels would correlate somehow as well. It would be natural that i.e people who score high at Five Factor's 'Positive Feelings' would have more smiling wrinkles. I found an abstract by Roger W. Squier and John R. C. Mew on the topic, but I couldn't access the report.   This might be a broad topic, but could someone give me some clues? It would be nice if I could see some research reports with measured correlations. "
174,What role do circular network structures play in neural networks?,"I'm developing small virtual neural networks and for the most part, the networks have remained feed-forward. When I create circular structures, it becomes a challenge to find a balance with the neural refactory period, stopping neurons from firing again for a period of time, giving them high action potential thresholds, then reducing that back down to fire again -it's tough to find a balance that stops infinite feedback loops but allows circular structures to play a role in processing.   I've done some reading on this and my vague idea so far is that circular structures perhaps allow the network to react to information based on its pattern, react to the information over time, so the C in an input series of A, B, C can be handled differently than the C in input series A, A, C.   Is that accurate, basically? What's the role of circular connection structures in a  neural network? I'm asking not only about multi-neuron circular structures like N1 => N2 => N3 => N1 but also about neurons that connect to themselves (N1 => N1) (which from my reading is something that happens if I understand correctly, but I'm unsure whether it achieves a similar affect as a larger scale circular structure).   (=> represents a neural connection)  "
175,Memories triggered by everything,"I have this property of mind where memories of every event which is slightly more important than everyday routine gets linked with apparently anything that's existing or happening at that time and place.   For example talking about something important with someone while watching television would link that memory with whatever show was on tv and get recalled involuntarily every time the same show is watched.  Doing an action with a particular feeling in mind like fear , happiness , hate or hopelessness would tie that action with that feeling and the action would always trigger that feeling again.  The inverse is true as well like begin extremely happy suddenly reminds you of a particular person or event  Similar connections with feelings and  memories can be formed with a lot of things like smell , weather, temperature and even colour.   Is this quite common ? and is this recognised in cognitive sciences ? because I'm yet to meet someone with similar experiences. "
176,How do you decide how many trials to have in an experiment?,"I'm currently designing an experiment with several conditions - how do I decide how many repetitions / stimuli within each condition?  I know that I can justify sample size with an a priori power analysis...is there any common way to choose how many trials within each of my conditions?  I was using sample size/power as an example of something where there is a particular approach to help decide.....what I am actually asking about is the number of trials i.e. if I have three conditions in my experiment, how many stimuli should I design for each of the conditions?

177,"""Cognify"". Does it describe awareness or confusion?","I understand that the term ""Cognify"" in cognitive psychology means that you are made aware of something but not yet have sufficient insight to act.  Does the term describe the insufficiency of insight or does it describe the fact of being made aware of something (which presumably will eventually become cognitive comprehension)?  I'm asking because the term is being used marketing wise at our company, and I want to make sure that it actually describes something positive.  Edit:  Which would you say is the more appropriate synonym for cognify?   Being made aware of. Inadequately understood to make a decision.  "

179,The hypothesis of a kind of life for archetypes of particular patterns in human societies,"Can concepts such as the archetype (ancient patterns) in Jung's theory have a life in human societies, and if so, can these concepts become contaminated and diseased?  A look at  religion introduces it like a virus mentioned in Richard Dawkins' talk.  A kind of life that may be a kind of clever life resulting from evolution among members of one species, perhaps Jung 's work can somehow channel this into science.  For example, can a concept like God or Satan have a life in this domain (within the collective subconscious of humans) and become contaminated by the overuse and the pathogenic look of humans, and therefore whether systems like this have a collective subconscious? Defense systems (referred to by Freud) can be upgradable. And can the poems of individuals such as sohrab sepehri or Mansur Al-Hallaj about God and Satan in this respect be somehow related to the question of the evolution and enhancement of the defense systems of these subconscious components?

180,N-Back implementation?,"I'm a programmer writing a small n-Back test/game app,and certain things are still ambiguous to me: 1-is there a standard implementation used in research(for example displaying a sequence of pictures or using a 3x3 grid) ?  2-what is the correct way to implement higher n-backs for example tri &amp; quad using a 3x3 grid like this one  ,can I use different colors for the other two stimuli or do they have to be completely different (for example A color and an auditory stimulus for dual n-back),and is it okay to use arbitrary large grids or does it have to be 3x3,and if it was okay is there any adjustment that needs to be accompany such change(for example is there a constraint based on the n in n-back that limits the size of the grid?).  3-would A letter and it's color used to create a dual n-back, be considered 2 non interfering stimuli in the same way a a visual stimulus and an auditory one are? and if not is there a resource that defines interfering and non interfering stimuli?  4-when calculating the score should using interfering stimuli be scored differently from non interfering ones?  5-would adding visual effects (for example animating the a list of pictures moving from left to right) instead of displaying them sequentially affect the result in any way, or is it okay?

181,Why seemingly all the neuronal membrane-bound receptor are exclusively GPCR or highly homologous to GPCR family?,"Nicotinic AchR is known for long to be an ion channel receptor however it has been argued whether it is a GPCR, as well Muscarinic AchR is known to be GPCR.  Seemingly many other nerve cell bound receptors like   Serotonin receptor, Melatonin receptors, Dopamine receptors, Adrenaline and Nor-adrenaline receptors, known to be G-protein coupled receptor (GPCRs). Although GABA receptors are not directly GPCR by functionality, wikipedia tells a subtype of GABA receptor. is probably GPCR.   So I have basically 2 part in this question:    Why GPCR or receptors homologous to GPCR are so common in nerve cells?  Are there neuronal receptors which do not have homology with GPCRs?  "

183,Paradoxical thoughts in complex thinking like god concept,"Concerning some of the mental states that need to be solved by a complex problem (Complex Thinking of Edgar Morion), for example in relation to the concept of God there is some kind of paradox or contradictory thought in the mental systems facing this situation, I guess There is. (Mybe ralated to old said about madness danger of thinkng in this field)   What kind of reaction can this be classified as a Psychlogical defense mechanism? Is it a type of separation behavior with an intrinsic defense mechanism in such a way that a complex problem from different angles may represent contradictory concepts, Human intelligence tries to internalize its contradictory dimensions in order to understand it and, since it disturbs one's mental equilibrium, it seeks to disassociate these dimensions, and in so doing, reaching to paradoxial thought in the mind? If the analysis is to some extent true, what tags are useful for searching the Internet ?  what is the evolutionary trend of this behavior? What other defense mechanism using in this situation? Finally dose this behavior seen in artificial intelligence? what relatice expression used for this behavior?   Thanks "
184,Does this Rat psychological developmental mechanism also work in human?,"In this epigenetics tutorial by University of Utah (Browser requires to support and allow adobe flash player); it is shown that in rat model those rat kids get little or no maternal care, whenn adult, develops aggression, lack of calmness etc. Whereas the rat kids got more maternal care and nurturing, developed better cope-up at stress, relaxed very quickly after stress. They credit this to hippocampal GR (glucocorticoid receptor protein) gene overexpression in the more nurtured rat kid (and underexpression of GR gene in uncared rat kid) as well as difference in expression in ""hundreds of genes"". (The adobe flash app even offers a ""rat pup licking game""!)    Screenshot of the app.   Does this principle also work on human? There is a common popular belief that stress makes a person more resilient to stress. But at least in the rat example at least partly that popular assumption did not apply. The rat which lacked maternal adore at childhood, developed underexpressed hippocampal GR gene throughout the rest-of-the-life, and though they have specific advantage to specific situation, they could not quckly relief from stress. In contrast, more nurtured rat kid developed overexpression of hippocampal GR gene that helped them fast recover after stress.   My question is; this principle found in rats (which is also at a contrary to a certain popular belief), does also apply on humans? Such as if a human kid get less nurturing and more struggle or stess, will she or he develop less-resilience/ delayed recovery from stress at later life? as well if a human kid get proper maternal care and nurturing then she or he will develop more adaptibility and faster recovery from stress? If yes, is it due to similar set of genes? "
185,How to measure/predict the difficulty of a conflict?,"Question  I want to conduct an experiment and I found that the difficulty of a conflict to resolve could play a factor in this experiment.  I now need an easy way of measuring the potential difficulty of a conflict, so that I can control this factor.    Own Proposal  I'm coming from StackOverflow and am used to present own proposals (since psychology is not primarily my field of expertise I wanted to have your opinion for my approach:  I thought of a questionnaire that is supposed to measure various factors that could influence the difficulty of a conflict.  The factors I thought of are:    Personal Involvement (PI): The potential change and stress that a given conflict can have on the life of a conflict party. e.g. a colleague is telling you to bring out the trash while you don't feel like doing it.  Influence of Emotions (IoE): How strong Emotions influence conflicts.  Objective vs. Subjective (OvS): Are Arguments in the conflict based on evidence or are more testimonial kind.  Risk (R): What is the probability and damage of an undesired outcome for a conflict party?  Level of Society (LoS): 1-to-1 vs. 1-to-many vs. many-to-many, also is it a conflict between countries of just a few people. personal-family-inner friend circle-outer friend circle-foreign groups-countries-cultures ... just to give some example to what that could include.   potential violence (PV): Probability and potential dangerousness of on party using violent measures.  explicitness of conflict result(s) (ECR): I think some conflicts have explicit results like ""Do Aliens exist?"" and some don't necessarily have a definite answer like ""What is an appropiate outfit for a woman? (which is answered differently in different cultures)""  conflict resolution skills of the conflict partys (CRS): This also might include negotiating and communication skills as well.  medium (M): speech, written, social network, face-to-face, etc.    I then thought of measuring those metrics on a scale of 1-7, weight them and add them add for some kind of conflict difficulty score:    Say Risk has a 10% influence on the conflict difficulty the weight, therefore, would be 0,1*(Scale of Risk).  I also think this way the result might be 2 different scores depending on the partys point of view.   I also think that some of the metrics I proposed are not needed or cannot be measured using a questionnaire like the medium for example.  But before I really go all the way to create a new questionnaire I wanted to know if I'm on the right track, if there is literature on this topic I missed, if I missed other important factors and so on.   Background  I have implemented a chat tool for my bachelors thesis, that displays emotions and handles profanity in messages differently. I know want to evaluate this software. The goal of this software is to improve communication in conflict situations and a new solution for hate speech in social networks.  I also have a software engineer background and this is my first question in the psychology sector.  "
186,"Purported exorcisms - can hypnosis cause a person to temporarily experience phenomena similar to those labelled as ""DID""?","I've seen several videos/documentaries featuring (usually self-proclaimed) exorcists, both Catholic and Protestant, who perform ""exorcism"" ceremonies in which they ""cast out demons"".    I'm personally a Christian, but I have some scepticism about the validity of these ceremonies, partly because I suspect that most of what's happening is that the pastor is inducing psychological phenomena of hysteria and euphoria in people through psychological conditioning techniques (links to more general scientific research in this area from informed readers would be welcome, btw).      What I find harder to explain is that many of these people, during the exorcism, actually begin speaking and behaving as if the actual ""demon"" is communicating.  I have posted links to videos below where people start speaking to the pastor using complete sentences, laughing maniacally and taunting the pastor, all while supposedly the ""demon"" is doing the talking.  This seems like a really extreme psychological phenomenon to be caused through simple psychological manipulation.  I should explain that this happens after the people are subjected to significant psychological suggestion, like the pastor addressing the demon and telling them to ""come out"", etc.    Is it possible that a person, in the right circumstances, could be induced to believe that they are a different entity, and to communicate as if they were that entity, in a fashion which seems similar to what I (a layman) imagine is the psychological phenomenon labelled as ""Dissociative Identity Disorder""?    I should add that I, a layman, am highly sceptical of psychiatry and the validity of labels like DID, but that's probably an unrelated topic.    Here are links to two of the most dramatic examples:   [website][website]And YouTube titles of other videos:   ""You may never see an exorcism this violent. Murders 1,000 years ago still haunt a man today."" ""John Safran vs God - Exorcism"" ""The Exorcist Claiming To Cure The Sick Of Their Demons: The Murky Truth Of Modern Exorcisms"" "
187,How do different dendritic spines experience a correlated/coupled calcium signaling?,"The following quote from the discussion in a review paper by Higley and Sabatini:     Finally, several studies demonstrate the ability of dendritic Ca   transients to herald near-synchronous and spatially clustered synaptic   activation. However, most of this evidence has been acquired in brain   slices using forms of synaptic activation that may not closely   resemble in vivo conditions. The intact brain is awash with robust and   behaviorally context-specific patterns of synchronous neuronal   activity (Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004; Llina´ s and Steriade, 2006;   Stevens and Zador, 1998).      Moreover, neurons in vivo are influenced by both excitatory and   inhibitory synaptic connections as well as state-dependent actions of   myriad neuromodulators.   Higley, M.J. and Sabatini, B.L., 2008. Calcium signaling in dendrites and spines: practical and functional considerations. Neuron, 59(6), pp.902-913.  made me pondering about the following questions:   What's the difference between Calcium signal into the spine versus ""Ca transients""?  How do different neurons/spines have a coupled/correlated calcium signal?  "
188,Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and Social-dominance orientation (SDO) in the World Values Survey,"Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and Social-dominance orientation (SDO) are two measures often used in (social) psychology studies on political orientation, see e.g. a meta-analysis of Sibley and Duckitt linking them to Big-Five personality factors, or another of Onraet et al. relating them to cognitive abilities.   On the other hand there's a large dataset from the World Values Survey (WVS) that also asks left-right political orientation questions; see for instance Geser (2008). It seems to me sociologists and political scientists rather than psychologists have more often used this dataset.   So, my questions is: are the RWA and SDO measures well correlated with some subset of World Values Survey questions? I.e., can a subset of the latter be used to stand-in for the two more specific instruments?  (This may seem like an odd question, i.e. why use a big questionnaire instead of two small ones, but the WVS dataset covers a lot of countries, in many of which one can hardly find a single RWA/SDO study.) "
189,How can I properly match subjects in my sample based on behavioral performance?,"I have brain and behavioral data for which I am comparing two groups- younger and older adults. I would like to select a subset from the younger and older group that are matched for behavioral performance, in addition to ensuring that other factors do not confound the behavioral performance, such as education and IQ. I was wondering how I can go about systematically creating these two age group subsets? I was reading a bit on propensity score matching and was wondering if this is the way to go? Thank you! "
190,Mind uploading & its constituents: Theoretically possible?,"Is it possible to remove the mind from the rest of the body and have it ""alive"" somehow as in its former known form? Mind uploading would be computerizing a mind to preserve data, memories and etc.  There are other constituents of this though that I will outline:  1.Mind uploading as in an interlink between the mind and some proxy (may or may not be computerized, but in general it might be expected) -- i.e., having the mind function in some connective/remote form that doesn't require a body but still enables the organ to work somehow -- like if you could linke neurons/axons/synapses to some feedback system that's not body-dependent;  2.Mind drive --  the ability to store NON-computerized components of the brain in some reliable method to preserve it biological function somehow (without its native body specifically at the least). Also, the idea of somehow or the same being being still technically of its former identity once this application has been made is questionable at best (when you take someone's brain and ""Frankenstein"" its ability to live and then relay it elsewhere somehow, can you argue that this is still of its natural-born identity?);  The two above differences take in to account the obvious notion that brain as a natural form is subject to decay and death as it is biological naturally (without factoring in anti-aging and other methods). The idea might stand to bring up the possibility of femtotechnology or etc. to recreate brain neural network copies and then attempting to figure what to make of the conscious bridge that forms one with mind. "
191,"""Wanting to do"" without being ""able to do""?","For those with disordered avoidance, a common theme is the inability to do something which is beneficial and, perhaps more importantly, even pleasurable.   For those that study motivation, intrinsic or otherwise...  In the situation where one chooses to do nothing or something else --not because it is preferable or more enjoyable but simply because they are unable to psychologically tolerate the object of their own desire....  Question: what does it mean to ""want to"" if one is unable to force oneself to do? And, what areas of the brain are competing in such a struggle with the self?   (Differentiate this from procrastination in which there is a preference for one active over another in the short term) "
192,What is the difference between personality disorder and other types of mental illness?,"From Personality disorders - Mayo Clinic:     A personality disorder is a type of mental disorder in which you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning and behaving. A person with a personality disorder has trouble perceiving and relating to situations and people. This causes significant problems and limitations in relationships, social activities, work and school.   From Mental illness - Mayo Clinic:     Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.   So I understand the personality disorders are more about having a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, while mental illness in general is more about mood. However, in my understanding that mood is just automatic thinking that stems from past experience, which is no differ than personality disorder. The CBT approach, which is again fixing incorrect automatic thoughts, seems to be successful in working with both of them.  So is there any actual difference between them? Or is that personality disorder just an extreme version of mental illness, in which the belief is more systematic (world view or belief system I would say)?    A minor and quick to answer question: why is personality disorder has the ""personality"" in its name?  "
193,Synchronicity relation with triangle of Conflict,"I liked to know more about scientific articles and issues, and whether impulses were related to the effects of Synchronicity (Jung theory) through defense systems such as somatization and visualization in the triangle inconsistent like this:   with hidden emotions / impulses, anxiety, and defense systems.   could It  be derived from a sort of collective subconscious according to Jung's theory that somehow uses two types of physical defense mechanisms (a particular feeling when faced with a particular situation or scene) and a graphic representation by combining a return or direction Communicating the situation with the past, trying to create some kind of energy boost Be a psycho (Libido) person?  Is this hypothesis experimental or any Ancient historical efforts could be found related this hypothesis?  Is there any scientific evidence or articles in this regard? "
194,A set of rules that defined requisites for two individuals becoming close. I can't seem to remember the rules of the theorem,"A long time ago (early in my undergrad), in one of my Psychology courses, I was exposed to this list (not sure if it was some established, well known theory or just some list that my textbook had come up with) that listed things that brought two people closer together. The only thing I remember on the list was ""time spent together"", in that the more time two individuals spend with each other, in particular alone, the closer they become.   Does this ring a bell to anyone? Do you know any sort of lists (from a source, possibly your own head) that are similar to this? I'm really just curious, it was something I thought about a lot when I was younger and want to revisit it for fun. "

196,Mental fatigue and recovery schedule,"(Complete novice here)  I am looking for some research or publications that would tackle the question of how much rest is required for good mental performance / productivity and is there a schedule that would describe the relationship of work and rest.   The problem i am trying to solve is that of optimal productivity from a one knowledge worker (e.g. me) who’s output isn’t related directly to hours worked (not call center where every minute online talking to customer equals productivity).  Empirically (observing self and colleagues) I know that working long hours every day leads to worsening productivity, but how many hours can be worked without a productivity dip? What if we measure productivity over a period of a week - is working 12 hours mon-wed and then 6 thu and fri better than working 7 hours daily?

198,Are normal external stimuli still processed by the brain during a hallucination?,"I was wondering if hallucinations could radically override real external stimuli. After all every sensory organ responds to external stimuli, but when a hallucination occurs, I suppose, the external stimulus and the false stimulus (hallucination) combine. Or do they?  For example: Let's say I'm looking at an apple and in the meantime I hallucinate an orange, theoretically the informations about the apple should still reach my brain together with the hallucination of the orange, therefore I should be able to see the apple and the orange at the same time.  Something analogous happens in the phenomenon of afterimage where the photochemical activity in the retina continues with less intensity even without the original stimulus. The new and the old stimuli combine.  Is that what happens during hallucinations too? "
199,When does a human baby develop a consciousness?,"Not to offend anyone or anything, but I've been searching up about abortion lately, and all the debate about it, and it got me wondering, when does a baby develop a consciousness?  Consciousness - the ability to sense the world around you in an independent way. You can think for yourself, and make choices that defy your natural instincts. It is what some say separates us from wild animals. Animals have a survival instinct. They do what they can to survive. Eating colourful packets of soap is not an example of a survival instinct, and therefor proves that we have a consciousness.  Definitions of consciousness  So when does consciousness begin in a baby? And before that time, how does the brain work? Does it just feel the surroundings without any response? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! "

201,Different levels of consciousness,"The answer provided by @user287279 to  When does a human baby develop a consciousness? is a great answer in my mind which scrapes the surface of what consciousness consists of.  When you look at consciousness and how there are different levels to it, I couldn't initially think of any lower level of consciousness other than described in the answer:     the ability to sense the world around you in an independent way   But there is the preconscious, where information is available for cognitive processing, but lies outside conscious awareness.  Dehaene, et al. (2006) provides a good rundown on the difference between conscious, preconscious and subliminal processing, along with possible reasons why some knowledge remains permanently inaccessible; however, it doesn't indicate when preconscious processing begins.  I wonder if there is any scientific argument where it is considered that preconsciousness could have started earlier than consciousness?  References  Dehaene, S., Changeux, J.

202,Schizophrenia relation between brain theta wave or kundalini and,"Is there a connection between the Kundalini force and the brain waves in relation to the question-based meditation link below?  Which Meditation Techniques Correlate Best with Certain Brain-Waves?  And what are the characteristics of the brain theta wave, besides is there a link between the illusions of schizophrenia and the increase in theta waves in the brain? And what if there is a new science in place of the Kundalini force instead of what they have said?  Link to an Amateur Talk about Kundalini and Schizophrenia on YouTube: [website]I found this paper with this topic:  Schizophrenia or spiritual crisis? On ""raising the kundalini"" and its diagnostic classification      Two patients are described who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic,   but had actually instead been going through spiritual crises, which in   Eastern spiritual tradition are called raising the kundalini. Perhaps   this experience is not a disease, but many--especially if not   understood by oneself, the nearest relations and the medical   profession--cause mental illness. In WHO ICD-10 the experience could   be classified as F48.8, disordines neurotici specificati alii. The   process falls outside the categories of both normal and psychotic.   When allowed to progress to completion this process culminates in deep   psychological balance, strength, and maturity.

Throughout my life, I have noticed that many people, including myself, put things in a pocket opposite of their main hand of usage (excluding ambidextrous people.) I am right handed, and I typically put my phone and other objects in my left pocket, and I take it out with my left hand and transfer it to my right hand. A relative of mine who is left-handed does the same thing, although with directions reversed.  Why is this so? What psychological reasons are their to do such an act?  This isn't really something I think is easily Googled, so I am asking here. "
204,Can calmness happen during the fight-flight response?,"In the question How do certain individuals, like Quang Duc, develop the ability to remain calm when enduring significant nociceptive pain?, one answer says that it was the high level of cortisol that numbing his pain.

205,Can reuptake absorb a selective or non-selective agonist?,"For example, a lot of antipsychotics are chemically similar to serotonin, and at least partially trigger certain types of serotonin receptors.  Is there any evidence to suggest that, because of their chemical similarity, they can be absorbed into the neuron via reuptake?  Meaning, that this agonist could be recycled and continuously partially trigger the specific serotonin receptors?  Or, possibly more likely, has there been any evidence to suggest this can happen with non-selective agonists? "
206,Is self-actualization really a need?,"Abraham Maslow's original hierarchy of needs placed self-actualization at the very top of the list. As I understand it, self-actualization can be roughly defined as realizing one's full potential.  Yet the percentage of people who achieve self-actualization is theoretically less than 5% (probably closer to 1%). Maslow himself listed about a dozen people who, in his opinion, could be considered examples of self-actualization, including Abraham Lincoln.  At the same time, I haven't met many people who really pushed themselves to their full potential. Apathy and Xbox seems to be the norm nowadays.  So we can think of self-actualization as an awesome goal, but is it really a ""need""?  To put it another way, have any studies been done on the psychological damage inflicted on people who failed to self-actualize? People obviously get depressed when they fail to get a great job or blossom into a professional athlete. Could such ""failure-based depression"" qualify self-actualization as a need?  EDIT  I'm not familiar with the psychological community's definition of ""need,"" so let's just say I'm referring to a need as opposed to a ""want."" We might think of a need as something that's necessary for a person's mental health.  Or, to put it another way, does self-actualization really merit being included with the other needs in Maslow's hierarchy, such as safety and social connections? Feelings of vulnerability and loneliness can drive people to suicide, but how many people who haven't self-actualized drown their sorrows in a bottle of beer? "
207,Negative Rewards(punishment) processing in Human Brain?,Can someone please tell me how negative rewards or punishments are processed in the human brain? Do we have a separate segment to process positive and negative reward and are the positive and negative rewards processed in the same fashion? 
208,Escapism in the Hierarchy of Needs,"I've been pondering Maslow's famous hierarchy of needs and wondered where escapism fits in.  It's more of a personal need than a type of social connection, but it doesn't really align itself with esteem/significance. So it appears to me that it could merit its own category.  Can anyone give me a general idea of the importance of escapism based on studies? Am I correct in classifying it as a ""need,"" and that depriving a person of their fantasies or other forms of escapism would have a significant impact? "
209,"Collective term for fun, relaxation and escapism","I'm pondering the nature and relationship of several things that I think are at least loosely related: fun, rest/relaxation and escapism.  They are all things that might be loosely described as ""humanistic;"" things that you associate with happiness. They might also be described as ""fringe needs;"" we have to take care of more important things before we go into leisure mode. (However, rest is an exception, as we can hardly stay sane without sleep.)  So is there a collective term for these things? Or can they be placed in some kind of category that separates them from more familiar needs, such as security, social connections and esteem? "
210,"Names of branches of neuroscience and related fields dealing with hunger, taste, attachment, and digestion, and their relationship to other perception"," I would like to know what the branches of neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and psychiatry related to what happens when the tongue touches and other possible related mouth sensors, touch, or come into touch, with food, in the mouth, possibly interacting, with saliva and salivary glands and allocation, the back of the tongue and the back part of the hard palate or soft palate, the uvula, and swallowing and interaction with the tongue while swallowing and peristalsis through the throat, other than the feeling one gets when food is being digested by the stomach, gallbladder, and bowls, and related cognitive processes and psychology. Also, what are the food and sense of taste disorders described in the DSM V? What are the interactions of attachment theory with these processes?  "
211,Correlations with alien abduction experiences,"I cannot find statistics about how many supposed alien ""UFO abductees"" have sleep paralysis.   I can't find statistics about how many alien abductees were hypnotized before concluding that they were abducted by aliens (because of the ""buried"" memories).   I can't find statistics about what emotions alien abductees associate with being abducted(good? bad?). What types of religious beliefs do those people in the study have?spiritual, christian, hells?,enlightenment?  I can't find statistics about how many ""alien abductees"" don't have religious beliefs. "
212,What is a Good Working Memory Test Online (or overall if none)?,"By good, I mean three things:     Accepted by professional doctors/psychologists/psychiatrists.   Has supporting research.   Has an established norm and can tell you where you are relative to the average.     These are the tests I found:  TEST 1: [website]This seems to be an actual medical test - it displays 12 pairs of words and then shows one word from the pair, the user is expected to type the second word. The test seems to be at least associated with some doctors (team: [website]TEST 2: [website]Just some digit span test - shows you a series of numbers and has you remember them. It seems like this is an acceptable way to test WM given:     thus, the digit span task is a common component of many IQ tests,   including the widely used Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).   Performance on the digit span task is also closely linked to language   learning abilities; improving verbal memory capacities may therefore   aid mastery of a new language.   ([website]but then there is this quote (tl:dr; Number spans can be gamed to achieve absurdly high results):     However, memory span can be expanded dramatically - in one case to 80   digits - by learning a sophisticated mnemonic system of recoding rules   by which substrings of 5 to 10 digits are translated into one new   chunk. In December 2015, Lance Tschirhart entered the Guinness Book of   World Records for memorizing a sequence of 456 digits spoken aloud at   the rate of one per second at the World Memory Championship in   Chengdu, China.   ([website]TEST 3: [website]Same as the digit span, except with convoluted images. Imo, this test is flawed because the images are fairly complex and don't necessarily represent a single, familiar ""unit"". The flaw is in the fact that WM tests are supposed to measure how many ""units"" of data you can keep in mind.  Anyway, which of these tests are best, is there anything better? If there isn't, what's a good test?  My end goal is to get a decent approximation of my overall WM to see if training improves it.  PS, I did see this post In the digit span test, why do some strategies work and others don&#39;t?, which links to ([website]Edit 2: A day in, I found a similar question here: How to reliably measure working memory capacity? I don't believe it to be a duplicate because I am looking for online tests. The third answer down is pretty good though. "
213,Training adults on how to react to social cues.,"I was researching social cues and stumbled upon this article, which concludes that:     results suggest that implicit learning is context-dependent and can be influenced by the cue type, e.g., social and object cues.   Now, that is not surprising at all, the findings that learning is context-dependent, meaning that relevant social cues improve it. However, what if the subject has to learn how to react to social cues? Say we are talking about individuals that for various reasons, (let's say, social isolation growing up or as one symptom of a disorder or other) do not know how to react to most social cues, or to more complex ones? How do you train them, given that, as adults, exposure in a cvasi-controlled environment (like school) is not possible?  I guess my question is: In adult learning, would it be possible to train people to understand or react to social cues, taking into account that you need to make the training context-dependent? * "
214,Doing PCA and ICA analysis on EEG data with 24 channels,"I am very new to this type of neuroscience research and I am trying to do some automatic artifact detection. I am having trouble understanding how I should work with my data. I have data recorded from 20 electrodes on my EEG. The outputs are all in microVolts and are recordings for only one person doing eye blinking during the recording. My question is, now that I have the data from the 20 electrodes, how would I do PCA or ICA analysis on them? Like should I apply sklearn (from python) PCA or ICA option to the whole matrix, meaning to the whole data of the 20 electrodes, at once or should I apply these options to the measurements from one electrodes at a time and then combine them?   Thanks so much for your help and let me know if more specificity in the question is needed.  "
215,How did Hermann Ebbinghaus conduct memory experiments on himself?,"I was reading about Hermann Ebbinghaus. He became interested in experimental psychology which led him to conduct memory experiments on himself which then resulted in the publication of his book: ""Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology"" in 1885.  He discovered the forgetting curve and the spacing effect. How did he do so? I'm aware that he had a list of 2300 ""nonsense syllables"" to memorize but I have no idea what his process was like. Did he play with different intervals for the review of the material? Things like that. Is the process explained in the book?   I'd like to look at the details to see the connection between his work and the now available software employing spaced repetition algorithms. "
216,Is there any theory supporting the idea that writing with your non-dominant hand is beneficial?,E.g. Could writing with your left hand increase creativity? Especially if the left hand is the non-dominant one. Could placebo effect also play a significant role? 
217,Are there psychological explanations for people being drawn to neo-nazism or other bad ideologues?,"Are there psychological explanations for people being drawn to neo-nazism or other bad ideologues?  Since surely the people are not believing in them for no reason. But what is it that they try to achieve through such ideologues? Are these people ""sane""?  Or perhaps e.g. their ""superior race"" beliefs mean that their ideologue is ""rational"" in the sense that they feel that they belong to the superior race and other races ought to be discarded in order for only the superior race to flourish? "
218,Is a person who believe that their depression is curable more likely to overcome it?,"According to the idea of the growth mindset a person is more likely to successfully change, when they believe that change is possible.  To what extend does that apply to depression? Is a person who believes that it's possible to overcome their depression more likely to overcome it then a person who believes that there's no hope overcoming their depression? "
219,average attention time and attention compensation time,"Is there any good source for statistics regarding average attention span? More specifically- what is the average attention compensation time, meaning- how long does a person need to rest in order to fully restore his/her attention? "
220,"Are hot-streaks in athletics real, and if so, is there a known psychological basis?","It is common to refer to an athlete who is enjoying a sustained period of success (e.g. a long consecutive game hitting streak in baseball) as being ""hot"", suggesting that something about their physical or psychological state is different.   However, hitting streaks and other sustained periods of success are bound to happen just by random chance. Therefore, it might be a fallacy to believe that a person is ""hot"" when really their behavior is expected by random fluctuations in performance.  Is there any research that indicates hot-streaks are real? If so, is there a known psychological basis? (For example, does confidence in one's ability actually improve performance?) "
221,How many trials are needed to estimate a response time distribution?,"I want to estimate the properties of a response time distribution (mean, variance, tail-length) for individual subjects.   How many samples (trials) do I need to collect to get reliable estimates?   Does it depend on the method of estimation (i.e. maximum likelihood versus hierarchical Bayesian)? "
222,Why can't people solve a riddle if you tell them irrelevant information?,"Suppose you tell a riddle to your friend, e.g. a situation puzzle:     A man walks into a bar, and asks the bartender for a drink of water. The bartender pulls out a gun, points it at the man, and cocks it. The man says ""Thank you"" and leaves. What happened?   Then during the question and answer phase you accidentally let slip irrelevant information:     The man was a cowboy. Sorry, he wasn't a cowboy. Actually, this is irrelevant.   Even after explicitly stating that the information is irrelevant, there is a chance the friend is now unable to clear the mind from the cowboy bit, and the thinking goes astray. The friend thinks about Wild West, saloons, duels etc, reasoning that there might be a reason why you mentioned the cowboy bit.  What is the name of this cognitive effect? Why does it happen and what are its properties? Please describe in detail. "
223,How is averaging used in calculating the Bereitschaftspotential?,"I have a question about the averaging involved in the Bereitschaftspotential. On the wiki page you can read that, because it is so small, the Bereitschaftspotential only becomes apparent after averaging.   My question: do they mean averaging over different electrodes, but in a single trial?  Or do they mean averaging over electrodes AND over trials?  Thanks in advance "
224,Is there a name for a person who looks for a name for another person's supposed faults?,"Every few days there is a new question here at Cognitive Sciences asking for a scientific term to describe a behavior that the inquirer finds fault with.  Examples include:   Is there a term for a person who moves from one field of expertise to a new field and has an inflated belief in their competence in the new field? Is there a formal name for the &quot;love&quot; of arguing? [website]Name of the bias where someone really needs something after they find out it exists Is there a name for the tendency to use proper nouns often in conversation? and so on   Reading this type of question, I often get the impression that the person asking them is affronted that the person they describe in obsessive detail did not agree with their view or follow their advice, and now want to regain their sense of self-importance by pathologizing the other. It seems to me that many, if not most, of these questions are not based on facts but on the egomaniacal deslusion of knowing better.  For example (using the first question above):   How does the inquirer know that the person moving to a new field is not an expert in it? Is he himself expert enough to judge the other's expertise? It is a well-known fact that even experts often disagree so violently that they accuse each other of complete ignorance. So how can the average cogsci.SE passer-by competently judge anyone's expertise or lack thereof?   You'll be easily able to find similar objections to all other questions.  So what is the name for that affliction? "
225,Is it possible to detect the mental flow state with EEG?,"I know that it is possible to detect ""focus"" with a consumer EEG with a single electrode and a reference point (ear clip), even without conductive gel, but is it possible to detect a flow state with any level of technology (whether it be professional or consumer)? Are flow states and focus synonymous? Is the mechanism of flow by it's nature undetectable by EEG? "
226,"If one is flexing a muscle, for any given motoneuron involved, how many action potentials occur per second to keep the muscle flexed?","Also, will the axon terminals in a given motoneuron ever run out of neurotransmitters to release if they are constantly undergoing action potentials (say in the situation outlined above where a muscle is being kept flexed)? Or is there always enough reuptake to ensure that this could never happen? "
227,Can hypnotherapy help to change my tastes in food?,"First a few disclaimers:  I am from a scientific background but a marine biology and computing one, so I apologise if I get any concepts wrong, but I will try my best. I have never been hypnotised, but I am given to understand that hypnotherapy has been researched, written up and peer reviewed, so there is clearly some efficacy to it, although I personally have no idea how much or what its limitations are, but I am curious.  I know hypnotherapy has been mooted for weight loss, and although that is my goal (I run and occasionally use a gym), what I am interested in is not so much whether hypnotherapy might help stop me liking lardy snacks, but if it can help me change my tastes in food. My issue is that I hate salad. Can't stand the stuff. I have no problem with most green vegetables and so on, although I wouldn't say I go out of my way for them, but for some reason I find lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes and the like detestable. But I can think of no good reason why beyond that lettuce is either a bit tasteless or tastes earthy.  I like the idea of eating salad, just not the reality.    Can hypnotherapy help a person enjoy the taste of healthy food that they otherwise don't? If it wouldn't work, why not? Is it because that level of suggestion simply isn't possible or some other deeper physiological reason?  "
228,Is quantum tunneling required for nerve signals to cross the dendritic synaptic barrier?,"A person says:  ""It turns out that the synaptic barriers of dendrite brain cells are too thick for nerve signals to classically cross. This means that nerve signals need to use Quantum tunneling to cross the dendrite synaptic barrier.""   This is supposed to have the consequence that all classical models of the brain are false, and that only quantum based models of consciousness can work for explaining the mind.  Is this true? Is there a way for particles or nerve signals to cross the dendritic synaptic barrier without quantum processes? "
229,Why aren't Connectionism and Dynamicism considered part of the Computational Theory of the Mind?,"In the Wikipedia article for Computational Theory of the Mind (NOT to be confused with Computational Representational Understanding of Mind which includes Connectionism), it is mentioned that alternatives to this philosophical view are Connectionism and Dynamicism (though there is some debate as to how different Dynamicism is). Why is this? Since they still use mathematical models run by computers, which still take in information and still process it, they seem to still fall under the Computational Theory of the Mind. What distinction am I missing here? "
230,"What is, formally speaking, major depressive disorder?","DSM and ICD define a mental disorder called major depressive disorder (MDD), and I suppose the notion of MDD defines quite rigorous criteria and methods to diagnose it in people. I don't know, how MDD is defined, what is its criteria, what are its diagnostic methods. On the other hand, cognitive behavioral therapy practitioners, such as David Burns, define depression through the use of rating scales.  For example, David Burns has a questionnaire, called Burns Depression Checklist (BDC). It asks you 25 questions about various thoughts and moods you experienced at least once during the week. Then it asks you to assign a number from 0 to 4 to each of them, meaning how strongly you experienced it, 0 meaning “not at all”, 4 meaning “a lot”. Then you add the numbers up, and if you get more than 10, you have a depression: mild depression (11-25), moderate depression (26-50), severe depression (51-75), extreme depression (76-100). The questions are very different, they ask if you feel sad, or discouraged, or worthless, or guilty, or lonely, or demotivated, or sleep to much, and so on. Therefore you can have different combinations of physical and emotional symptoms, and still have depression according to BDC. For example, i could put number 4 to questions about guilt, hopelessness, and self-esteem, yet put number 0 to questions about motivation, interest in work, and feeling tired; or I could do the other way around, and it would still mean i have a mild depression.  According to the study called The Epidemiology of Major Depressive Disorder, 16.2% of US citizens experienced MDD in their lifetimes. If we assume Burns's definition of depression through result of BDC scale, then this study's data contradicts common sense and my anecdotal evidence. I gave BDC to various friends of mine, and all of them showed at least mild depression. From behavior and self-accounts of many people I meet every day I can safely assume that mild and moderate depression (in Burns's definition) are the statistical norm; the depressed people are the majority of population. I understand that anecdotal evidence means nothing.  My question is as follows. What exactly is major depressive disorder? How it is defined in a formal way? What are the criteria, which a person should met, to be diagnosed with MDD? What are the methods to diagnose it (for example, do psychiatrists use rating scales like BDC)? Finally, how MDD is different from the many alternative definitions of “depression”, including the colloquial ones?  I ask this because I can't reconcile my intuitive hunch that most people around me are depressed, some of them heavily, yet studies show that depression, while serious, isn't that widespread. If MDD is defined in a very different way, than Burns's depression, then it would mean that only a minority experiences MDD, so there's no contradiction. "
231,Name of a cognitive test assessing whether a child can think independently,"I am looking for a names / examples of a tests that determine if the child is thinking on its own (I have tried searching on wikipedia topics about cognitive sciences/ psychology etc. with no luck). To be more specific, long time ago I saw a video that described two tests:  In the first, a teacher was given two cookies, and the kid just one. Teacher asked the child  ""Is it fair that I have two cookies and you just one"" and the kid replied as it was supposed to ""No"".  Teacher then has split kid's cookie in half and asked again ""Is it fair now?"" and kid stated ""Yes, cause we both have two now"".   My memory fails at accurate description of second test, but I remember that it was supposed to determine if the kid is thinking 'What I know is what everybody knows'.  It's like if you put two kids in the same room with a large amount of 'sth', and asked one, let's call it 'Martha', to leave the room. Then, you make the kid that stayed take for example two instances of 'sth' and afterwards ask him 'Do you think the kid that left the room knows that you took it?"" and kid kid replies ""Yes"" because it cannot differentiate 'Martha's' knowledge from it's own.  I'd appreciate any ideas where to seek. "
232,"Name for the need to reply “you can’t fire me, I quit”","It’s a cliché in movies. The boss fires the employee, and they reply “you can’t fire me, because I quit”. Similarly, when in a romantic relationship, one person may decide to end it and the other answers the news with “well, I have been thinking about ending this for some time” (whether true or not).  Both of these replies should be unwarranted and effectively meaningless: the end result is the same. Yet, people often feel this need to “one-up”1 one another. Does this need have a name? And do we have any formal findings (or ongoing research) as to why we have it?  1 Not exactly “one-upping”, since you’re not outdoing the first person — more like preemptively doing what they’re doing, as if life works like a MTG game, and the last thing any of you do is the first to happen. "
233,Do we have a predisposition to view visual stimuli in a clockwise pattern?,"I understand that we typically view the center of the image first and then are likely to move on a horizontal axis, but is there evidence that we tend to follow a clockwise path when viewing more complex visual stimuli?  Alternatively, for individuals who speak languages that are read and written from right to left (Urdu, Hebrew, etc.), is there evidence that they tend toward a counterclockwise visual path? "
234,How to train oneself in the art of obfuscation,"I really liked the movies Frost/Nixon, Thank You for Smoking, The Social Network and then I found this Doonesbury comic strip. I want to know how to train oneself in this art of obfuscation. I am not saying I want to be (or can be) someone like Nixon, but I am trying to look at it from the perspective of a ethical hacker. How can one learn this kind of political maneuvering, if I can call it that? Can anyone suggest any books/movies for this?  EDIT: It seems that I am being seen as a wannabe bad guy. It's not just about being Nixon. The movies Thank You for Smoking and The Social Network have depicted similar behaviour, and I liked these movies because they kept a non-judgmental undertone (my opinion).  My intention was to read/watch something intellectually stimulating. The cancer is not to be hated/feared, but studied and understood. "
235,Variables in positive reinforcement in human beings,"I've been thinking about positive reinforcement occasionally, and I've always found myself wondering about various things that can influence it.  So, I'm looking for information (results of empirical studies) about the variables affecting positive reinforcement, in hopes of finding answers to my questions and questions that I haven't even thought of, such as:   How does knowing what the positive stimulus is for affect the change? What happens if I did two things, and I don't know which one of them led to the positive stimulus? e.g. I solved a math problem and won some game, and then I received a prize, and I don't know for which one of these things   What happens If (as far as I'm concerned) I did nothing, and then I receive a prize?   If I receive a prize for something I did an hour earlier, for example, will it still change my behavior? Does receiving a prize while I do a task has a stronger effect? weaker?   Any other interesting questions (as well as answers to them) are welcome   (And since someone is probably going to make a few changes and add tags - thank you and forgive me. English is not my native language, and I don't have much of a background in psychology) "
236,How does an understanding of the brain explain why people experience strong emotional responses to major sporting events?,"Anyone know studies or theories that explain how massive competition events between countries or parties, like the Soccer World Cup Tournament finals or Olympic Games affect our brains? Why do people suffer so much over these events?  I want to understand the fact that people get so excited or so depressed about that events that have no real impact in their lives. Seeing people cry because their teams lose is incredible, and I think that these reactions are unconscious and must have an explanation involving how these events affect out brains. "
237,Best way to capture effect of making people upset?,"I am an undergrad, I am planning to do some research to see how much I enjoy it before I apply for grad programs.  I am researching the effects of a certain characteristic of a presenter making people upset, uncomfortable, aggravated or displeased during a short clip like a TV commercial. My plan is to have subjects watch a short clip with a presenter and see if they are they aggravated, upset, uncomfortable with the presenter based on that one characteristic changing and compare this across demographics. I do not have much experience with setting up and performing experiments so any help would be much appreciated.  How do I quantify how upset, uncomfortable, aggravated or displeased the subject felt?  How do I make sure that every subjects experience is the same expect for that one factor?  Do I have to do anything special because I will not be able to run the same test on the same exact subject?  I really want to know how to best perform this experiment. "
238,What is the effect of imagining doing an exercise on muscle growth?,"I recently read a study by Yue, G et al. (1992) which I found incredibly interesting. I have no background in physiology and I was hoping that someone who does can clear things up.  If I understood it right, the study had two groups of people who trained their Hypothenar eminence (pinky) muscles. One of the groups did so by doing the actual exercise and a second did so by imagining themselves doing the same exercise. The group that did the exercise improved by 30% and the group that imagined themselves doing it improved by 22%.  Did those who imagined themselves doing the exercise have a muscle increase in their muscle or did the improvement come from the brain having better control of that muscle? Also, what should I expect if I imagine myself lifting a dumbbell all day?   Yue, G., &amp; Cole, K. J. (1992).

239,Desire to climb from evolutionary perspective?,"When I go near a hill or dune, I feel desire to climb there and have a wider look on the surroundings. I know a lot of people who love mountains and want to climb higher and higher, but never have thought about why... Many people climb high building, restaurants on TV towers are very expensive, but very popular anyway.   I've recently started to think about it. From evolutionary point of view taking higher ground have made a lot of sense. Predators could be seen from larger distance, and in the era of fighting communities, higher grounds such as hills were higher to conquer.   But is such theory scientifically proven? Are there actually any researches on why people want actually to climb higher? "
240,What is the definition of pathology?,"While trying to get more information for my previous question, I found several different definitions for the terms ""pathology"" and ""pathological."" While under normal circumstances I'd be inclined to say the latter stems from the former, there seems to be heavy connotation where terms such as ""pathological liar"" are concerned.  One of the definitions at dictionary.com states:     Caused by or evidencing a mentally disturbed condition   Seems a bit vague, to me. Can anyone clarify this? "
241,How to optimize bi-tasking?,"Based on an article on brain laterization, it's said that a lateralized brain can do two tasks simultaneously.      Lateralized chicks could pick food out of the pebbles with one eye and one half of the brain while using the other eye and other half of their brain to monitor the skies for predators. Not only could non-lateralized chicks not complete the two tasks simultaneously, but their performance of the single task deteriorated. This suggests that the evolutionary advantage of lateralization comes from the capacity to perform separate parallel tasks in each hemisphere of the brain.   While multitasking might still be too difficult, are there ideal ways of doing two different tasks at the same time? What kind of tasks are suitable for bitasking?  For example, could a person read a book and then listen to another audio book at the same time? Are some people better at typing while talking on the phone than others?  What limitations apply to bi-tasking? Would one be able to easily access and store short or long term memory? Is there a significant loss to motor control and such? "
242,Predicting how long a task will take,As a software engineer I have always struggled with predicting how long a project would take by underestimating and I have noticed that all of my colleagues have the same problem.  In this video at 3:32 Luke Jones labels this problem The familiar road phenomena where people underestimate how long a task will take when they are familiar with the task.   What studies have been conducted on the familiar road phenomena? Why do humans do this and what is the evolutionary advantage?  
243,Why do we seem to have an internal drive to use different expressions(mostly when writing)?,"How come we have so many words/phrases that share the same meaning?  I suppose the most obvious answer to this would be that through communication between people with accent/language A and B, new words/phrases were added from A to B and vice versa.  I find however that when we are writing longer texts, we are ensuring that we are not using the same word/expression too often and—if we do—replace them with something else that has the same meaning. In other words: It seems to me like we have an internal drive to use different expressions.  I was wondering if there was any (maybe evolutionary) explanation for this, as it kind of adds a lot of overhead to communication:    Time: unnecessary learning of new words whose meaning we're already capable of expressing with other words Resources: necessity of a slightly bigger neuronal structure to accommodate those words/expressions  Complexity: more words need to be distinguished, which makes the understanding of the spoken word harder   How does this compare to animals? Do we know whether they also have several ways of expressing the same thing? "
244,Dyslexia and IQ,"Background Information of my questions: At the age of eight I was ""diagnosed"" with Dyslexia, I am now 47. I went from not being able to read and barely able to write to a college reading level in 9 months. I was in a program run by a Mrs. Cooper in Pennsylvania. I have taken several different IQ tests during my lifetime and found the results vary widely.  I have noted that in the last ten years or so Dyslexia seems to be an almost antiquated diagnosis and am very curious about the definition of dyslexia in current science and the correlation, if any, between Dyslexia and intelligence.  Questions:   Is there any specific IQ test that is directed at measuring the IQ's of people with dyslexia?  What is the correlation between having dyslexia and IQ?  "
245,Psychology of timbre processing,"Are there any studies concerning the psychological aspects of timbre processing in the brain, e.g. while listening to music? In particular, can any lower-level correlates be discerned when trying to answer questions like:   what makes particular timbres more pleasing than others? (e.g. a trumpet vs pure sine wave) what accounts for different preferences between people? (e.g. preference for piano sound over trumpet)  "
246,Teaching Problem Solving : Mastering bit by bit Vs Try it all by yourself?,"Background:  I'm a teacher who trains hundreds of high school students in Math, Physics &amp; Chemistry to crack probably toughest competitive exam in India.  I deal with the students who are hardworking and scored at least 70%+ in their 10th Grade.

For rest of the post when I say problem solving, I'm referring to the problems of Math &amp; Physics which are not as tough as 12th grade Olympiad problems but definitely a lot tougher than typical textbook level problems. You can see some of such problems here. Each paper shown in the link, needs to be solved in 3 hours and more than 70% must be secured.   Typical way of training: [Method1] Try it all by yourself Students are taught (it is ensured students understood the) concept. Solve 3-4 variety mid-level example problems, to illustrate application of concept to the problem and reinforce their understanding. Move on to the next concept. Do the same with all the concepts and finish the chapter. Then, students are given about 50-60 unsolved problems, no two of same model. Students spend lot of time solving these problems, they discuss with teachers and they discuss among themselves.   Problem with above method: The success percentage is very less. Its as low as 2-3%. I mean, only 2-3% of the students get through all the difficulties and finish those problems. Most of the other students find those problems too difficult to solve and are either losing motivation to solve such problems or think that they are not intelligent enough to solve the problems.  Fixing the problem: [Method2] Master bit by bit I've read few books like, Why Don't Students Like School, How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method and analyzed myself (how do I solve the problems?) and understood that we try to recollect the patterns of problems. By practicing problems we are learning the patterns of problems and when solving an unsolved problem trying to figure out our put the patterns that we already learned. So, I've broken down larger problems into smaller problems. I've arranged these problems in the increasing level of difficulty. For the patterns to be remembered properly, I've increased no. of simple problems. I'm ensuring that students are mastering problems concept by concept, level by level.  Result is, now my students are not demotivated, they feel problem solving is simple and they are doing problems well.   Problem with my method: I realized that my students are entering a dangerous zone. They are not willing to solve difficult problems and they are unable to solve unknown model problems. Did I overtrain them? I consulted my college professors regarding this and they were furious with my method. They said, that I am spoon feeding the students. They said that I must follow the method 1.  That is what is going to help them in future in their higher studies and research.    What exactly is happening? Why is method 2 failing? Why will method 1 work? Is it just about the psychological difference in feelings that method 1 guys feel more prepared for solving any kind of problem? Whats optimal way? Where can I learn more? "
247,How to adjust SSE or RMSE for the number of free parameters in the model?,"How do I adjust SSE (sum of squared errors) or RMSE (root-mean-square errors) for the number of free parameters in the model?  Is there an ""adjusted"" RMSD metric similar to the adjusted r-squared metric? "
248,Are there cognitive benefits to two hand typing versus one finger?,"I've been reading an old popular psychology book by russian psychiatrist Vladimir Levi. One of the things that he has his depressed patients try is learn to juggle. He insists that such activity brings both halves of the brain together and that the brain ""likes to juggle"". His book was written in the 1980s, and there's little science presented in the book to back the claim.  Juggling involves coordinating both hands and is automatic, if I understand correctly. Touch typing involves coordinating 10 fingers together and is also automatic once learned.  In the 1990s and early 2000s, computer keyboards were the dominant way of inputting data into a computer. If one was to type anything one used both hands together for extended periods of time (most likely touch typing with both hands). But as of 2013, more and more people report using tablet PCs to surf the web and interact with friends online. Such typing most likely involves one finger pressing the letters on a virtual keyboard. It's a much slower process, as the keyboard is too small for both hands.   Does touch-typing has any cognitive benefits? Is the effect lost if one reverts to typing with a single finger?  "
249,Is gaming more addictive than watching movies or tv shows?,"Are there studies that demonstrate that gaming is more addictive than watching movies or tv shows?

250,How does one distinguish BPD anger from ADHD anger?,"Some people with ADHD are known to have difficulties in controlling anger.  Whenever a person with ADHD has difficulties in controlling anger, how does one determine whether or not that person really has BPD? By which I mean to ask, how do we know that the anger is symptomatic of BPD rather than ADHD? "
251,How can automatic processing be estimated in an editing task?,"Is there a way of measuring/estimating the amount of controlled vs. automatic processes that takes place during a text editing task?  I know that asking participants to verbalise their actions and regard non-verbalised processes as automatic is a flawed approach. I came across the process-dissociation procedure, but this seems to refer to automatic/unconscious recollection after a learning task has taken place, and not automatic processes during the task itself.  Any suggestions of references or ideas on how to go about this? "

253,Why are the founding figures of major religious faiths credited with superhuman qualities?,"The founding figures of various religions are usually believed to have superhuman qualities, such as omniscience, ability to predict the future, impeccable control over their own emotions, invulnerability, miraculous healing powers, and so forth. An absolute conviction about the unquestionability of such beliefs form the bedrock of many religious faiths.   What is the psychology behind such compelling collective beliefs? How does one analyse them in terms of various psychological parameters? "
254,Does this recent twin study contradict Anders Erricson's view on the hereditary basis of talent?,"The Swedish Psychologist K. Anders Ericsson has published many reports stating that talent is ""made and not born"". In his book 'The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance', he has stated that ""Consistently and overwhelmingly, the evidence showed that experts are always made, not born.""  On the other hand, a recent twin study has stated that on average, a human's ability is 50% influenced by genetic factors, and 50% influenced by environmental factors. This seems to contradict Ericsson's experiment, as he has asserted that genetic factors influence a person's abilities by less than 1%.  Does the twin study contradict Ericsson's assertions, and if so, why would there be such a large contradiction? What factors could have caused these large differences in findings? "

256,Is speed up of arithmetic calculations as a result of memorisation?,"In elementary school, it is typical for a student to learn ""times tables"" to increase their speed of mental multiplication. What is the mechanism for the increased speed of calculation resulting from the repetition of ""times tables""? Is it memory based? That is, the pattern is recognized and the result is retrieved from memory. Is it optimisation based? Does the brain actually just become faster at multiplication? The same question could apply to the progression of addition as a result of memorised counting.  This is assuming a naive, limited approach without mental imagery optimisation, such Chisanbop, where a mental abacus is used. "
257,What are the most effective psychological techniques for unlearning information,"What are the most effective psychological techniques for unlearning information?  Let me given you a simple example for clarity's sake: In high school, you learn that electrons orbit around a nucleus, whereas in reality electrons are actually at every point of the orbit at the same time. How would you go about unlearning the initial fact learnt in high school? It seems that the earlier fact is retrieved subconsciously since it has become a habit.  In the case of this simple example, it seems to be easier to replace the earlier fact. However, this appears to be problematic when dealing with more advanced concepts such as unlearning a simplified version of how fMRI functions. "

260,Best ways to improve memory,"I've once watched a movie in which CIA agent went into a room just for a few seconds and on the next day he could recall every detail of that room, including what was on the monitors.  And I am wondering is there a way to improve my memory to this level?  I would also like to know if there are studied ways of accomplishing this.  There also is something that I remember reading few years ago about training visual memory:   ""You go into a dark room with a page of text and a flash light, and every ~30 seconds you turn on and off the flash light very quickly and try to recall as much as you can. And you do this for ~20 minutes. After ~30 days of practice you should have much better visual memory.""  What do you think about this method. Could it really work? And if so, could this ability disappear after some time without practice? "
261,"Does playing video games increase attention and learning agility, therefore career performance","Recently, there has been a lot of research into the positive effects of video games on cognition, As business insider reports.  I'm curious as to whether somebody should play video games purely to increase career performance based on the evidence given:  A study states that attention is increased by 14% when playing world of warcraft and another supports this hypothesis of attention and gaming.   Another study in particular states that learning agility is increased after playing action based video games such as call of duty. This is possibly explained by video games improving the performance of perceptual templates.   Though studies in this area usually contradict each other. In that case, I ask how valid are these studies in predicting effects of video games on cognitive performance.   Many high end careers require workers with high concentration and learning agility abilities, especially a computer programmer at google. In this case do video games increase performance of individuals in a career? A study linking career performance and video game play would be valuable.  This article writes the following:     video gamers were better than non-gamers in ability to fly and land aerial drones and were essentially as good as trained pilots on this skill (MKinley et al., 2011).  Another correlational study revealed that young, inexperienced surgeons who were also avid video gamers outperformed the most experienced surgeons in their field (Rosser et al., 2007).   While the evidence is there, it feels very uncomfortable to make the conscious decision to play video games, in order to boost career performance, rather than entertainment reasons. How valid are these studies, and is the decision to play video games purely to boost cognition, and career performance reasonable? "
262,Do unschooled persons think differently from us (schooled persons)? How?,"Through past experiences, I am convinced that ""unschooled communities"" such as tribals, nomads, cattle-herders, etc. (and persons belonging to such communities) have very different ways of thinking through and negotiating everyday issues. We schooled people construct our thoughts in ""a different language"", and face great difficulties in communicating and negotiating with them (aside from simple tasks such as buying their produce).  Do the schooled have thinking systems that are substantially different from the unschooled?  If so, what are the prominent differences? "
263,Effect of enactive cognition on gender,"I'm doing a PhD in archaeology and assyriology (cuneiform writing; Sumerian language), exploring the process of gendering that deities underwent during the 3rd millennium BC. I'm looking into using cognitive science to underpin part of my research into the (re)organization of memory, tradition and ideology that (I think) took place alongside the development of centralised state formation and external memory (writing). I focus in particular on the gender of deities (what exactly is it and how do we understand it?) as opposed to human gender, both from a modern academic standpoint (bias; how to overcome it?) and trying to understand the past.   Are there any books/research/researchers that would be of use to me? Especially on questions of enactive cognition, materiality, gender. "
264,Does human to human interface carry the same information from the brain,I'd like to know if the human to human interface carry the same information from the brain or it is just a signal that switch on or off electrical impulses that causes the limb to contract?  Is it even possible to take someone else signal coming from the brain and redirect to somebody else where the other person can use it for the same result or is it always going to be digital type On or OFF and not analog? 
265,Why who is aministering the power pretends to be right?,"I apologize for my english and I would really appreciate an help at improving the question.  It's very frequent that the guy who is in charge pretends that he would be ""right"" (and the other would be wrong). This happens between parents and their children, in couples, in web forums, between teachers and scolar, in the HR, in the job, on social network groups, when speaking to police officers, judges and so on. The first one tries to explain to the others why he is right and the other is wrong.  Actually the idea itself of ""beliefs"", ""dicotomic"" helps to show why it's pretty hard to speak of being ""right"".  It's enough to compare the formulation of any Evidence Based Paper to understand how subjective we are as human being. The law itself has often dicotomic formulation, the language used by lawyer is very approximative and far away from being objective. A math theorem is objective.   So why authority charged people act in this way? In social science, pretending to be right has been proved to be effective for dealing with most of people?  "
266,Why do we require social interaction/engagement?,"By requirement I mean there are so many ill side effects of isolation, and everyone feels loneliness after too much time spent alone (although that threshold is different for different people, e.g. some people can't make it a day without talking to someone, others can spend weeks or months in complete isolation, but everyone eventually will feel loneliness, and it's side effects) whereas there are so many mental health benefits of proper social engagement that it might as well be a necessity of life as much as food and drink.  Isolation is a lot more common than we might realize, just because you are not physically alone does not mean that you are not isolated many of us even fail to realize they are living in isolation (mostly because of the notion that isolation only comes in the physical form of being a shut-in). After isolation when the loneliness starts to kick in, Introverts turn to online communities (often gaming, facebook, or some forums) and extroverts have a tendency to turn to partying (MORE PEOPLE!) and often as a side-effect, alcohol and drugs, both confusing these activites with fulfilling social engagement; while they're really just turning into addicts of their own escape mechanisms which are only momentary reliefs from their feeling of loneliness, always feeling deep down inside like something is missing. The introverts that are isolated are usually physically isolated (shut-ins). While the extroverts that are isolated tend to be isolated mentally (closing themselves off; often without even realizing it) building superficial relationships that do not fulfill them.  We all have an instinct that tells us to interact with other people, an instinct that disregards whether that interaction is positive or negative (as we see for example in ""attention seekers"" that attract as much attention as they can without any regard for what kind of attention it is)  There is some need every human being has to express themselves to other humans.  Why do we so actively seek social interactions? What exactly are we seeking from these social interactions? Acceptance? Acknowledgement? Approval? Understanding? All of these? None of these?  I need to know the full answer to this because I am wondering what kind of social interaction will most fully satisfy our needs. What kind of environment to look for to truly overcome the isolation element, and the long term loneliness that follows and plagues so many of us. "
267,Children's progression from counting to addition,"How do children progress from counting to addition?  I understand that an grasp of counting is achieved before an understanding of cardinality (size of a set of objects). Thus, there does seem to be some division between procedural understanding and conceptual understanding of counting. However, how does this carry on to addition? Is addition also typically learned procedurally rather than conceptually? "
268,Effects of quantity and quality of breaks on learning,"Are there papers which discuss the effects of quantity and quality of breaks during learning? Do state of the art papers have a common ground?  So far I have found these papers:   The Fourth R: Recess and Its Link to Learning The effects of different recess timing regimens on preschoolers' classroom attention   Unfortunately, both focus on kids and learning in school. The second article even on preschoolers. So I'm not sure, if the hypotheses also apply to adults. Also they're from 2007 and 2008, resp. "
269,Drawbacks to the method of loci for memorization,"The method of loci is a famous way of memorizing information by associating each memorized item in a spatial way.  There's plenty of content out there describing how to do it.  I'm wondering what the drawbacks might be.  Has anyone done any studies into issues that arise for people who memorize details using the method of loci?  For example, perhaps there are sets which one cannot memorize because one already memorized a related set and committed it to memory?  Or perhaps one might create hazardous paths which contain harmful memories which one would like to unlearn but cannot, causing trauma?  As a non-scientific reasoning, it strikes me as there must be some drawbacks, or society would have figured this out long ago and would have taught us all to memorize everything this way. "
270,Is a drop in intellect necessary for one to be diagnosed with psychosis?,"Some psychiatrists claim that when someone has psychosis, there is usually a drop in intellect. Does a drop in intellect always happen, or are the boundaries for psychosis not as discrete? Why are they sometimes confused in the absence of a drop in intellect? "
271,What are external factors which can influence the clarity or early-prevailance of a person's earliest memory/memories,"Are there any external factors (i.e. with less focus on the genetic make-up of the individual persons) which can, in let's say, an average human, generate earlier and perhaps more clear earliest memories?  I would be very interested in any non-retrospective research in this area. That is: intervention studies, which I would guess probably need parents' approval.  So, I would be interested in both what types of events (I would naturally assume trauma is one, as well as perhaps general high emotional association in general, but I might be very wrong and would be equally interested in other ones), as well as perhaps if pedagogy or any other factor influence the ability to generate early childhood memories.  In particular, I am interested in whether or not this has anything to do with an early onset of self-conscience, or any other amenability between the individual and its environment.  To wrap up, and state my question briefly: can an early onset of childhood-memories be fostered? "
272,What is the difference (in a recording) between speech and a sound? What makes the difference to the brain?,"How does the brain cognitively differentiate between speech and a sound within a recording?  I am asking this theoretical question for speech synthesis, i.e. Making a voice with just waves (no recordings). Is this even possible? "
273,Can the stress response from neonatal circumcision cause cognitive impairment?,"Numerous studies have shown that severe early life stress can cause long term cognitive and learning impairments (ex. [website]But I have not found any studies that look into circumcision and cognitive outcome. The only study I've found is this recent German study: [website]Some tell me there are methodological flaws (such as small sample size and ineffective means to measure stress-related disorders). I personally can't spot any problems, but I'm not a neuroscientist.  What do you guys think in regards to this? Can an acute but severe bout of stress to a neonate cause any permanent neurological changes and cognitive impairments? "
274,What kind of data structuring is conducive to healthy debate?,"I was just thinking, if we as humans want to sort out our differences of opinion on, say, politics or religion, what would be a good means to debate such a concept while at the same time make everyone feel they're on board?  Most sites on such things are either:   Biased or unbiased (but usually persuasive) writings or studies that are written by a single individual or group (one way communication) Organised Q&amp;A, forums, expert's opinion, etc. (two way communication, but often between those who have a good understanding and those who do not) Unorganised and random chatting between fellow users (one to one communication, or group chatting within a small group/anonymous users)   Has there been any research or thought given to the idea of a collective idea generating mechanism, where everybody provides their inputs, and is more likely to accept the results of such a debate (if results do come up)?    Maybe a huge online wiki organised as a nodal network, where claims are supported or questioned. Evidence is put up on both sides, and further threads can be opened to debate the validity of given evidence. Bigger claims are made based on the validity of smaller claims, etc. etc. (But that's just my thoughts) "
275,What makes a book easier or harder to read?,I am interested in books by academics that examine the following. How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading is the only relevant one that I found.  Suppose a reader to be deciding which books to read about a topic. Why do some readers:   judge some books easier to read than others?  comprehend some books faster and retain more than others? What do authors (not) do that affect 1 and 2 above?     
276,What makes something relevant to an argument and how can people improve in determining relevance?,Are there any books that examine questions about relevance in general like the following? Relevance Theory seems something else and inapplicable.   What makes something (ir)relevant to an argument or discourse?  How can humans improve on deciding whether something is (ir)relevant?      
277,"In which way emotional ""interference"" affect the brain / the behaviour?","Think of two different scenarios. In both scenarios the subject is looking at emotional images, but in the first one emotional stimuli ""interfere"" with the behaviour, while in the second one emotionali stimuli are related to his/her goal.  In the scenario A the subject looks at emotional images but is not focused on the emotional content (for example, his/her task is to pay attention to the size of the image).  In the scenario B the subject looks at emotional images and is focused on the emotional content (for example, his/her task is to rate the image).  Which psychological processes would you think are most different between the two scenarios? In which way the brain is differentially affected by this ""emotional interference"", in your opinion? "
278,Low crystalized intelligence- failure to transfer skill from Hippocampus to cortex?,"We know that when we process some information or solve some problem, we need to pull information from long term memory to working memory. There are few factors known to me that can cause a failure during retrival:   Working memory shortage poor temporal context The memory was never transferred to long term memory to begin with   Low working memory is something that can be easily diagnosed with Dual n-back tests.  A study on anterograde amnesic patients have shown that they do not appear to have poor temporal order (5), which indicates that maybe temporal context is not to blame when people forget things. However, it is possible that this does not apply on all cases.  This leaves the third possibility: that short term memories do not always get transferred to long term memories. Is this a possibility? If yes, then why does it happen?    Sources:    Types of memory Role of working memory Temporal context How is information transferred into long-term memory? Anterograde amnesia and temporal order Dual n-back test  "
279,What is the basic memory-making algorithm?,"What are the fundamental criteria that determine the hierarchy of saved information in the brain?  I've discovered that our languages reflect some of those factors. One of them can be sex identification - I've noticed this when I was reading The story of your life, I couldn't really imagine the character of the main hero without the knowledge of her sex.  Another criterium could be time. In many languages, an event cannot be expressed without the knowledge of the time it had taken place.  Do we know what is the fundamental hierarchy of creating memories (I accept a very broad answer :)? "
280,Interaction between caffeine intake and biorhythm on alertness,"Throughout the day, people's wakefulness and attentiveness varies, as modulated by one's circadian biorhythm. Whereas in the morning people are less awake, just before noon and around 15:00 people appear to experience peak performance.     As nicely discussed in an older question, taking caffeine also seems to generally improve cognitive performance and alertness (Does caffeine improve performance for habituated consumers?).   I was wondering if these two factors may interact. For example, if you are in a ""dip"" in the circadian cycle, will coffee be most effective on attentiveness (because there is more room for improvement so to say)? Or will coffee be more effective when your are at a peak in the cycle, where the caffeine and the cycle amplify each other's effect?   Is there any scientific literature that investigated the interaction between caffeine intake and the circadian cycle? "
281,What neural mechanism is responsible for our identification with a group?,"Why do we need to identify ourselves with a group? Is there naturally a hormone/neurotransmiter reward? Or is it based on more complex mechanisms like finding the ""deeper"" meanings of our actions? "
282,Is there research on effectiveness of teaching with high extraneous cognitive load?,"Background  While researching a particular author's mathematical exposition, I found out (directly from a primary source) that the author was probably intentionally using overly complex syntax. Purportedly, the idea was that   by producing a high extraneous cognitive load the student would be subject to more ""mental exercise,"" deepening understanding and cementing concepts. This led me to the following line of inquiry.  Question  We all probably agree that cognitive load is the very nature of education, at least, intrinsic cognitive load is unavoidable. But does additional extrinsic cognitive load improve the learning outcomes for students? Doesn't it seem preferable to minimize extraneous cognitive load at all times, while ramping up the level of required intrinsic cognitive load?  However plausible the idea of ""more mental work means more mental muscles"" might be, I have to question its effectiveness. The success of students under these conditions might easily be explained by other traits such as grit.     Is there research that says high extraneous cognitive load (e.g. intentionally complex exposition) either improves or degrades learning outcomes (such as recall and retention) in some situations?   Examples  I have two minor expository examples, but I hope they don't limit what you, the reader, may also have encountered like this elsewhere.  For example, something might be defined with a ""double negative"" pattern where there was already a (seemingly) simpler positive pattern:      A set [tex] is called closed if there is no limit point of [tex] which is not in [tex]   (Compare to: A set [tex] is called closed if every limit point of [tex] is in [tex].)     if there exists a number [tex] which is not less than any element of [tex], then there is a least number which is not less than any element of [tex].   (Compare to: if there is a number [tex] which is greater or equal to every element of [tex], there is a least number which is greater or equal to every element of [tex].)  Another example is that some things are stated two or three layers deep: having a list of hypotheses, of which one bullet point is another list of hypotheses.  An example of that is a pattern of the form ""element of the set [tex] such that for all elements [tex] of the set [tex], [tex] has the property that for every element of the set [tex]..."" (I still owe a better written example of this from what I was reading.) (I think something like that is usually simplified by modularizing definitions in a different way to bundle the layers separately before stacking.)  PS  I've just discovered the wiki on desirable difficulty which may also be helpful for me and for anyone offering a solution. "
283,Why Bayesian Cognitive Modeling?,Recently i read an article on Bayesian Program Synthesis. It says that Bayesian cognitive modelling would help AI systems to learn from few examples in comparison to deep learning. But i was not able to understand the advantages of using Bayesian vs other formulations in cognitive modeling. I would like to understand why this Bayesian approach stand out ? What are the drawbacks of current approaches to cognitive modeling ? 
284,"Erik Erikson: ""We live in a continuous process of making the present 'former' ""","I'm reading Identity: Youth and Crisis and I was particularly struck by this passage:    However, I'm completely lost by the idea that we are in constant process of making the present into the past - I don't believe I've seen this idea before, and I had an ever harder time trying to find it explained anywhere.  What does Erikson mean by ""constant process of making the present 'former' "" ? What is he referring to here? "
285,Why is depression a diagnosable issue?,"To me, it seems strange that something such as depression, which anyone can feel at any given time, is diagnosed and treated medically as if it is a mental disorder. I believe depression should be treated with constructive sessions, communication and through giving people a sense of meaning.  Why is depression being treated as if it is a medical problem when it's a problem of thought?  In my opinion, diagnosing a person as being depressed may re-enforce their negative ideas, while the more obvious approach would be to positively re-enforce this person?. "
286,Are there any variants of pathological lying?,"Are there any variants of pathological lying? As far as I understand it, that means either lying for no discernable reason, or to your advantage but a lot.  Are any other verbal behaviours themselves pathologised: pathological false confession, or pathological irony? "
287,Shape versus numbers,"Do adults recognise numbers or shapes quicker? Have there been any studies on this?  If an adult was asked to press a corresponding button when presented with a shape or number, which would they respond to quicker? "
288,How do congenitally deaf and mute people think?,"If a person is born deaf and dumb, how can they think? In ""what language"" do these people think? Do they develop their own inner language?  Unfortunately I have not found an answer, and I actually doubt it has ever been elucidated.  "
289,What is the bias called when listening to the same sound repeatedly?,"When people are made to listen to the same sounds repeatedly, it can trigger placebo effects, i.e., they think they've heard something new or different the [tex] time around, when in fact they haven't.  What is the name of this ""bias""? And are there any research papers on it?  I've stumbled across the 'Focusing Effect' but I don't think that's what I'm looking for "
290,At what time in a psychophysical test are catch trials preferably presented?,"I am designing a tone-in-noise detection task (specifically a high frequency N0Spi task). For various reasons I need to use a yes-no paradigm and the method of constant stimuli. I am severely limited on the number of trials that can be presented (total of 20 trials) and the presentation order must be the same for all subjects. The subjects will be completely naive and be unfamiliar with the stimuli.  I was thinking of giving them two ""practice"" trials: one with a clearly audible signal (if they knew what the signal sounded like) and one that is noise alone. I would provide feedback on these trials in the case of an incorrect response. Is there any literature on if the signal or no signal trial should come first? In a run of 20 trials, is there an optimal number of catch (no signal) trials? Is there an optimal place in the track to put these catch trials? "
291,Can we learn to adapt to image-reversal when being intermittently exposed to them?,I know that human vision can get accustomed to reverse vision when wearing reverse glasses for several days. But does it work when we see the reverse image just in certain moments throughout the day? Would it be easier or more difficult for humans to learn use a reverse mirror? 
292,When did dyslexia emerge as a neurological difference?,I am wondering if dyslexics have one common ancestor? And when did dyslexia emerge as a neurological difference? 
293,Can some one operate 15 points lower during some part of the day and then return to normal?,"Few days back I took an IQ test (online mensa norway) and found my IQ score to be 85. I actually had my IQ professionally tested 16 months ago by a psychologist when I was 18, and found out that I am pretty average (I got a score of 101).   I know that online tests are not valid, possibly explaining the lower score of 85. Nonetheless, mensa seems OK,as they claim that their test was correlated with other standardized tests.  So my question is: can IQ within- test (i.e.., test / re-test scores) vary over periods of time (say months to a few years, or even from a day to day basis?), or are the differences observed here better explained by between-test variability? "
294,How to reduce the chance of being manipulated?,"What makes some people more suseptible to manipulation and having their opinions swayed relative to others? Are there character traits which highlight who might be more easily manipulated, or is it a frame of mind?  And in either case, how might someone that is easily manipulatable change their behaviour and/or frame of mind to protect themselves from being so? "
295,Does the way you perceive something for the first time have a big influence on future perceptions of similar stimuli?,"You find yourself in a certain situation A. You perceive the situation: perceive objects, actions of people involved...You develop an opinion on the situation, and it was the first time you perceived an example of a generalization of such situations.  Then, you find yourself in situation B, which is another example of some generalisation of A. Let's say that A was you having a crush on someone, and so was B (only the two crushes were different people).   To what extent does your perception and opinion of A influence your perception and opinion of B? Will you always compare (for example) the crush B to crush A? Or is it possible that the influence of A on B is limited, and your view of B won't necessarily be biased in such a way? Can your generalisation of beauty differ a lot from the first 'beautiful' thing you perceived? Are the first times you receive stimuli decisive for future perceptions of similar stimuli? "
296,"""Golder standard"" RNA-seq datasets for neurodegenerative diseases","What's your favorite and/or ""gold standard"" RNA-seq datasets for neurodegenerative diseases?  I come from the field of computational cancer genomics where there are some datasets that are well-known as ""high-quality"" ones in cancer. I want to benchmark some of the computational tools I'm currently developing on RNA-seq datasets for neurodegenerative diseases: I want to make sure I can identify known regulators with the tools I am testing. Therefore, I am looking for high-quality RNA-seq datasets for neurodegenerative diseases. Any advice on where to find such datasets? "
297,"How is ""socially gifted"" or ""social intelligence"" defined ""in a scientific way"" or ""semi-objectively""?","Something that has puzzled me is the concept ""social intelligence"" or ""social giftedness"".  Partial illustration of problems:   There do not exist consistent general values.   implies: e.g. both ""being good with people"" and ""being bad with people"" may be regarded as ""social intelligence"", just that their goal is different.  both intelligence and giftedness are somewhat vague, because e.g. valuation of them is subjective and because people may not display these traits consistently (""a Ph.D. with 20 years of experience can still be wrong""). That which is intelligent for someone else might not be that for someone else. Unless one can devise some ""semi-objective"" measure (which is what I'm asking here). Some people regard these concepts as ""being good with people"" or ""using right kind of communication techniques"". However, I find that these are not necessarily suitable for semi-scientific definition, because from these it's not a very long distance to rhetorics.   How is ""socially gifted"" or ""social intelligence"" defined ""in a scientific way"" or ""semi-objectively""?  Can there exist a ""right type"" of ""social intelligence""? Judging by that some people exhibit that there exists wrong forms, like bullying, would suggest that some people think there are right and wrong types. However, if this is subjective, then its point is (since I can still disagree)? "
298,What is the state of the art research of the conscienceness level for high-level cognitive activity?,"Everybody knows situations where activities requiring concentration and high level consciousness can over time become a ""background"" task.  For example:   you read a text aloud but think about other things you drive a car but it just ""happens"" and you can listen to the news   Question: is it measurable to demonstrate how an activity ""goes background"" in the brain? What is the current state of research, or at least what are proper neuroscience terms to look for in this context? "
299,Choice of Occupation and Negative Childhood Experiences,"Is there any evidence to suggest that individuals that were bullied in school as children select occupations that are a means of making people obligated to respect them? For example people that join the police?  My premise is based on observations of a majority of individuals in law enforcement having personality traits that are consistent with the descriptions of the Authoritarian Personality, and I felt that childhood experiences of being unable to cope or predict norms of their social environment may be a good explanation as to why they choose a career that enforces a consistency in the accepted social norms of the society. "
300,Did research in psychology lead to any useful technology?,"Research in physics allowed us to build bridges, computers, put people in space. Research in chemistry led to the discovery of all sorts of new materials which we use everyday. Research in biology led to many the discovery of many drugs that save millions of people every day. [Fill in more examples of game-changing technology based on hard sciences here.]  Did research in psychology lead to any useful technology? If yes, what are your favorite examples? "
301,Inability to associate a face with a name,"I know there is a medical condition called ""Prosopagnosia"" that is described as:     a cognitive disorder of face perception in which the ability to recognize familiar faces, including one's own face (self-recognition), is impaired.   Knowing this, I was wondering if there was also a word/medical condition that would describe:     a cognitive disorder in which the ability to associate a name with a face is impaired.   In this scenario, when the person sees someone, they remember every fact about them (what do they for a living, if they have a significant other, if they have children, etc...) but are incapable of remembering the person name.  The person having this could be described as having ""a bad memory for names"".   So, does such a medical condition exist? Is there a word for it? "
302,Becoming an expert with accumulative hours of practice much less than the average expert?,"Anders Ericsson's work is famous for creating the idea of ""deliberate practice"" and its creation of experts, but Anders also talks about how long hours are inevitable in becoming an expert. Let's examine this on the standard of running. In 1960 a less than 5 minute mile was impossible, but now it's impressive but having a closer to 4 minute flat mile run is more impressive. We can maybe assume people didn't train as long as people do now to achieve that which would support Anders, but what if the variance in time spent training between 1960 runners and now is about the same, just that our training methodologies have allowed runners to easily surpass that speed. My question is what allows someone to become an expert in shorter time? What features of training methods IN ANY field (not just running) allows someone to acquire expertise in a field faster than other methodologies? Can we evaluate such methodologies? "
303,Perception Cardinality,"While reading a science fiction book, Calculating God by Robert J. Sawyer, I came across the following lines:  “Well, if I showed you one object - one rock, say - you would not have to count it. You would just perceive its cardinality: you would know there was one object. The same thing happens with two objects. You just look at the pair of rocks and in a single glance, without any processing, you perceive that there are two of them present. You can do the same with three, four, or five items, if you are an average human. It is only when confronted with six or more items that you actually start counting them.”  “How do you know this?”  “I watched a program about it on the Discovery Channel.”  Assuming this is a real psychological phenomenon, is there a name or reference for it? I have contacted the author but have not received a response yet. "
304,Memory Retention : isolated information vs emphasized information in a heap,"I have observed that when learning new words (vocabulary building), if we are presented with, say, 5 new words in these 2 manners:   only 5 words presented in isolation 40 words presented, with 5 words emphasized   then, the retention of those 5 words is more in the second case.   Similarly, if we are studying some subject, and we are presented with a summary of important points in one case, and a collection of several points with important points underlined, then there is more retention in the second case.  To generalize the observation: Memory retention is more if information is presented accentuated among a heap of other information, than when it is presented in isolation.  Is my observation correct? Have other people witnessed it in some form? And why does this happen?  Further, can someone point me to some references if research has been done on this? I couldn't think of a keyword to search for this on the web.  "
305,Research shows that doing anything in bed other than sleeping can disrupt sleep. What if these other things are done on another bed?,"I read this and some other articles stating that you should not do anything in bed except sleep. This includes studying, eating, and watching T.V, because your brain will have a difficult time associating what exactly your bed is for, which can lead to insomnia when trying to sleep.   So my question is, can I do these other things on a bed on which I do not sleep in (in another room)?  Contrary to what the article says, I just don't want to study on a desk, I find it very hard to focus (eg. in school) because my body position from sitting on a desk is not ideal/comfortable for me. I prefer to lay down as this helps me relax and thus keeps me concentrated. Would it hurt my sleep if I switched to studying on a bed that I don't sleep on? "
306,Are people better at interpreting CNF or DNF?,"We have a development in our application in which our users can create a report based on different parameters, say ([tex]), with each [tex] taking values in a set [tex].  The report can take as input any type of logical formula of the form [tex] where [tex] represents a disjuntion [tex] or a conjuction [tex] ([tex]). The report will return a population whose features under the formula are true. For example, I can input the formula [tex] and I will see all the results with those parameters satisfied.   A known result in Boolean logic says that any type of such formula can be respresnted in DNF or CNF form ([website]I'm wondering, do you know of any research on the question of whether humans are better at interpreting logical formulas in CNF or DNF versus a less structured form? Moreover, is there any research on whether CNF or DNF is more intuitive than the other? "
307,Neurostimulation DBS-ECoG,"How many cortical and subcortical areas can be stimulated during one operation, using Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and ECoG (Electrocorticogram)? I understand it depends on the disorder and the specific patients case, but according to your knowledge, what was the maximum of brain areas you have learnt/heard of being stimulated?  brain area: tissue with dimensions of less than 5 cm3 "
308,Waffles or Pancakes?,"if this is not the right place of my question please let me know , I remove or move my question into another stack.  I'm a software engineer and in one of my interviews they asked me this question :      Do you prefer Waffles or Pancakes?   I don't know are they ask this question to reduce stress from me or something behind it? like how I thinking, I don't know , I try to search but nothing I can find. so I decide to ask it here. this question is interesting for me because I find that some other companies asked this question for product manager role or front-end developer, and my answer is Waffles  "
309,"Is the ""Spend it All"" psychology a known traits of human?","Whenever I have a paycheck or when I have a \[tex]8000 of limit, I found myself wanting to ""spend some"" or even ""spend it all"".  With the paycheck, at least it is better because I am spending the money that I have, but with credit card, it is worse because I can be spending money in the future and I could be paying the dream interest rate of 14.99% or 22.99% to people who would be ecstatic even when they can get 10% in their long term investments.  Is this ""itch"" a known psychology of human?  How is it known in the academics?  Maybe it is related to monkeys, primates that lived in caves some 100,000 years ago, and when they have a lot fruit or animal in their caves, their natural instinct is to eat it all? "
310,How to forget faster? To free up neural real estate,"How to speed up the unlearning process?  In regard to a specific cluster of skills, environments and other types of memories, all relating to a specific thing (a competitive game I played too long)   Do I want to starve the whole cluster? or  Find ways of ""repurposing"" it?   Would finding ways of repurposing tell my brain to overwrite memories and prune connections of the old ones? e.g. Use a different keyboard, mouse, think of ""lessons"" &amp; closure-like mentality, and highlight few key memories to keep (so the rest is 'unimportant').  Or just Starving the whole thing, by removing as many references and connections as possible. e.g. change the environment and routines, change my chair, headphones, even stop using the PC (or at least start using a laptop) etc.   Is there enough science to back up a particular approach?  I guess it is more complicated than the way I framed things, and I'm aware that there may be some false dichotomy and vagueness here.  Interesting idea about punishing information to unlearn it "
311,Psychological name of underground communication in dialogue based on respect and scientific references,"I am familiar with some of Jung theories like collective unconscious, shadows, synchronicity and some theories of freud like the inner child and become more sencetive about my around connections  and my self reactions, so I have tried to respect for what I am and listen to myself my be similar of sentences said in Krishnamurti meetings with Nehru:     Krishnamurti elaborated at length on the teachings, saying in one   instance, ""Understanding of the self only arises in relationship, in   watching yourself in relationship to people, ideas, and things; to   trees, the earth, and the world around you and within you.   Relationship is the mirror in which the self is revealed. Without   self-knowledge there is no basis for right thought and action."" Nehru   asked, ""How does one start?"" to which Krishnamurti replied, ""Begin   where you are. Read every word, every phrase, every paragraph of the   mind, as it operates through thought.   So after years I have some experiences from testing myself into some of theories, though base space, for example attention to myself based of my last unconcerned, shadows ( my  and collective Unconscious  mind ) changing my sight of viewing by, for example, trying closing my right eye. (based of using more right part of brain, which is more functional related to sensing being the same with universe and less ego control), and seen the some reflection in meeting with others like some of them (more in contact more reflect) also scratching their right eye at this moment based of some attraction for example at The loving relationship between teacher and student ...   Also in this example when a question (maybe not related too much to class, subject)  arose in my mind, I thought is better to respect to the my teacher time and ... and try to find the answer by myself and via my mobilephon via internet or by searching for my old knowledge or trying to use some my Methods which found based on my experience (like focusing on my last 5 until 7 or more last thoughts and trying to find why this question arise in my mind and be awaring to my body since Like sounds, words, Internal emotions at this time) at some times I found the answer and become surprised that the The speaker of the opposite dialogue is going to answering the Not stated (not asked) some times Implicitly or suddenly the dialog have changed to the answer of this question more clearly.   Is this example could be related to jung archytype complexes (maybe The wise ignorant child and the ignorant old man complex which I seen somewhere already) and relationship between peace and respect  From inner on these archetypes and correlation by ego (maybe Parent part of Freud's trilogy of personality) peace and... With them which creating some correlation behavioral experiment in that relationship (if we could say Jung Synchronicity here)?  I have also seen some this complex archetype solving god and evil complex (As far as I can remember by inserting  respecting to evil for assuming it as the first love of god which don't afraid of god when it thought god is doing mistake by creating the human and warned god) in Mansor halaj life when he said:      I saw my Lord with the eye of the heart I asked, 'Who are You?' He   replied, 'You'.   Could it  be related to sacrifition and respect?  Is this complex have effects in the real world and could be assumed simply alive like viruses which could be spread and trying to solve themselves by consuming... And reflection to some Behavioral characteristics like respectation, sacrifization and... ?  So This questions has arisen for me and   trying to find that are these experiments Have been named in psychology science?   If yes, it could be useful to search via google and papers to understand why this happened to me or ... , when it could be an illusion and in which condition it is more real and what condition changing the election or  Delicate underground connection.  I know i asked more but thank you for your attention and your possible answers to this question. "
312,Assertiveness - should I have feeling that someone need to do something for me,"I have seen a assertiveness training videos and there is said that the person should show assertiveness with ""I"" statements.  For example : I feel seed due to the way you just spoke to me.  My problem is that I see that this can't be used, as in my opinion it is just a manifestation of weakness. If there we split all possible situations in just 3 :   in family or with love one at work on the street   The only place where this type of place where this type of sentence would not be seen as a weakness is maybe only in first case , so the question is, why is this so ? Am I wrong or the world is wrong ?  Second example : I feel that you don't invest enough of time in keeping the apartment clean.  In this type of assertive sentence, I see the problem that someone is saying what they feel or what they think but the only way to fix that is that other person do something about it. This one way view of this is also a major brake in using sentence like this one. The second problem is that if somone would use this type of sentence offten, he would be a needy person ? And also here is the same question. Am I wrong or the world is wrong ? "
313,How to deal with APA in-text citations in long texts?,"In APA referencing style, the first in-text citation of a work by three to five authors must include all the authors, while the subsequent citations should only mention the first author followed by the expression ""et al.""  Does this apply literally to a long text such a thesis (in my case, 25 pages)? Or is there some kind of reset, say, for each chapter? "
314,How to explain individual ignorance towards people wanting to help?,"Please allow me to introduce the context of the situation first before asking my questions.  This week I was taking part in a non-violent occupation of a public place (in Paris) within the context of an international movement (you may have heard of it or not).   Part of this occupation was blocking a bridge for car traffic, still allowing bicycles and pedestrians to pass.  At one point in time, the authorities decided to completely close one side of the bridge by using thick and high metal fences, no one could pass through any longer - and they were patrolling on the other side of the fence.  The event organizers decided to deploy ""peace-keepers"" on the other side of the bridge (the open one) so that people would be informed that it is really blocked - it was not really visible before almost traversing the bridge completely - and they were given a deviation-possibility and other help - friendly and non-violent!  What did I observe with individuals and couples (very biased of course):  Tourists (non-french) were very open and happy to be there, asked what all this is about and so on - no problem for using the deviation, some even participated in the event for some time.  Young, ""native"" people were partially very open, partially they did not want to listen (up to ignoring) to the help and had to learn it the hard way (when facing the fence).  The ratio of those strongly ignoring any help seem to raise with age and status. From ""Don't worry, I'm a lawyer, I will pass"" up to getting a hysterical crisis of one individual when realizing that one cannot get through.  I wasn't observing a female/male variance.  It was quite disturbing to us to see so many people ignoring our advice as it was well meant and the situation was not caused by us.  Is there any study concerning this kind of behavior? Does it have a name?   Ideally I would like to know what makes people behave in this way. Why are some open, why are some so stubborn?   How much is it depending on the culture of the society?  Is there a method which could help to improve our impact? "
315,I can't understand the comparison made by Kahneman,"The chapter ""Risk Policies"", in Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"", opens with this example, which makes vivid the pitfalls of relying on our intuitions in choosing between bets:  Imagine that you face the following pair of concurrent decisions. First examine both decisions, then make your choices.  Decision (i): Choose between   A. sure gain of $240   B. 25% chance to gain $1,000 and 75% chance to gain nothing  Decision (ii): Choose between   C. sure loss of $750   D. 75% chance to lose $1,000 and 25% chance to lose nothing   Most people, looking at both concurrently, choose A and D. Now consider this second choice:  AD. 25% chance to win [tex]760  BC. 25% chance to win [tex]750   Clearly, any sane person will choose BC here; it dominates option AD.   However, AD is exactly the combination of options A and D, while BC is the combination of B and C.  But I cant understand how ""sure gain of [tex]240"" and why these suggestions are equivalent? Am I missing something?  "
316,Mechanism for deleting old memories,"Do we have any mechanism for deleting neuronal connections?   That is, if I learn a better version for doing something, I assume the brain will create a new neuronal connection, and we will use this connection. However, what happens to the old, non-used version? Does it fades away after a while? or is it enough to have a better, stronger connection to have the older version ignored, even if present? "
317,How do I handle contradicting study results?,"A foundation of my psychological work is the body. Simply put, I work on a big part with embodiment to diagnose, as well as to intervene and to integrate.  One illustration, or rather one important reasoning for embodiment seems to be the so called facial feedback test. I have read about this test over and over again in literature.  In 2016, there have been efforts to reproduce this test, and these efforts did fail. See here:  [website]All this is rather new to me, so I don't know how to handle this situation. My intention is to do honest work. I am wondering:   Is it careless to still cite the facial feedback although it cannot be reproduced?  Or is it only careless to still cite if several studies proved it explicitely wrong? How do I talk to clients about the facial feedback? Should I simply try it myself and choose to belief what I want?   Please note that I am not asking for opinions. My question finally is:     As an ethic worker in the field of psychology, how do I handle contradicting study results, based on the example of the facial feedback?   The example of facial feedback implicitely includes a) the contradicting study results and b) the contradiction becomes visible over time. "
318,Has sharing non peer reviewed sources decreased or increased beliefs in pseudoscience?,"I haven't found a detailed study of this, but here would be an example. If people shared a site that talked about the dangers of global warming, but wasn't peer reviewed, does this increase awareness, or does it actually give more credibility to global warming denial sites, since they are on equal footing, both being non peer reviewed? A global warming denialist argument is that a debate still exists, which has been good enough to cause skepticism and lack of action.  I know sites generally have incentives to get their articles or videos shared, so they would rather make their own summaries of scientific results, rather than just link to proper references. But pseudoscience sites can also reference peer reviewed sources, they just give their own interpretations of them. But why should anyone believe one site over another, since the standards for credibility are gone (which all of these sites perpetuate, pseudoscience or not)?  Or is it the case that non peer reviewed sites draw attention to issues in a way peer reviewed sources don't, and while there may be some collateral damage with lowering of standards, people are being swayed by pseudoscience sites either way?  So the main question is, has sharing non peer reviewed sites caused more damage than good in combating pseudoscience (including this site)? "
319,An example from Health Psychology,"Is bolded ""less"" right? Shouldn't it be more?  Now, let's suppose we did our cross-sectional study and found that the cholesterol content of adults' diets decreased with age. We would then like to know why this is so. One possible answer is that people change their diets as they get older because they feel more vulnerable to heart disease. So we asked the oldest group, using the retrospective approach, if they feel more vulnerable and eat less high-cholesterol food today than they used to. Sure enough, they said yes. But another reason for the current age differences in diet could be that the older adults never ate diets as high in cholesterol as those of the younger adults. So we asked the oldest group to describe the diets they ate 10 or 20 years ago. The diets they described contained less cholesterol than their current diets (which we already knew) and the current diets of the 35- and 45-year-olds in our study! This finding reflects the fact that the older subjects grew up at a different time, when food preferences or availability may have been different.  Sarafino, E. P., &amp; Smith, T. W.

320,what causes an action potential to propagate exactly and why should it propagate?,"Hello I am taking a neurophysiology course and learned about the action potential and that it propagates in one direction from axon hillock down along the axon.  I understand that action potential is simply the voltage difference caused by influx of Na+ ions causing the inside of the cell relatively more positive  My questions is why/how does action potential propagate? why should it propogate?  If at one site where a sodium channel opens to depolarize, and k+ channel polarize the cell to membrane potential at that site, how does this affect the next neighboring ion channels down the axons to open and close? Why doesn't it just cause an action potential at one section of the membrane and stop? What exactly causes the neighboring ion channels to open continuously as well after the previous one open and closes?   Textbooks just says 'it propagates down the axon' but never mentions why it should and why should the previous ion channel configuration affect the next region of the membrane.

321,What is the current view of which emotions exist?,"I had previously drawn a map of which emotions exists based on this paper: [website]But now that I opened my college textbook 'understanding motivation and emotion' by Johnmarshall Reeve I find that he uses another set of emotions such as anger and contempt (basic emotions) that isn't a part of the above mentioned paper's model. I find in the book's references that his writing is based on papers older than the one I have linked, but the book is of an edition written more recently than the paper. He mentions that he has spent his entire life in the field of emotion and motivation, so are the ones in the paper i linked still debated?  What is the current view on which emotions to exist, as an industry standard and/or are the most accurate, and that I should model my view of human emotions to fit?  Vincent-Emil "
322,Are there disadvantages to spaced repetition?,"In his essay Michael Nielsen talks about his way of learning about new field of study. He's using spaced-repetition to remember things he learned. It seems that he adds a lot of information into his system.  Example of two questions he adds to his system, after reading one paper is      ""What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?” (Answer: 48)      “Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?” (Answer: Jones 2011)   Are there any disadvantages from trying to remember so much information? I don't mean the obvious ones like time it takes to create cards / test them.  I think I read somewhere that there is a tradeoff between memory flexibility and amount of information you can learn but I can't find it now. "
323,What is the best way to overcome: Why facts don't change our minds?,What is the best way to overcome: Why facts don't change our minds?  [website]I want to get climate change deniers to seriously consider the possibility that they may be incorrect. It is very important that we achieve a sufficient quorum of public support so that we can implement the required changes.   I have spent hundreds of hours carefully proving that severe anthropogenic (human caused) climate change is a verified fact that does not even depend on expert opinion. The actual raw uninterpreted climate data proves this all by itself.   I was thinking that this would break through to the remaining 33% climate change skeptics that do not have a financial incentive to lie. What is the expert opinion on changing peoples minds on the basis of irrefutable facts?   When there is a difference of opinion even when one disagrees with an expert it is possible that the expert is incorrect. When one rejects verified facts one is impossibly correct. The former seems to be within the range of normal behavior whereas the latter seem pathological.

325,Noise in EEG Electrodes,Hello I'm desigining a home-made EEG and I have a question about noise interference in electrodes.  I understand that the noise picked up by the electrodes tends to be much larger than the neural signals themselves. Is the noise itself constant across the scalp? To what extent would noise from the front of the scalp and the back be the same?  
326,What could be the cause of behavioural or personality change?,"One of my close friends is having a behavioural or perosnality change. He used to be polite and civil but these days (since about 10 months) he is very aggresive and mean. He has been recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and is on medication currently. I do not know if thyroid disorder is causing this or not. We used to discuss a lot of things. We loved to discuss a lot of things. We never had problems. We both were open minded. But nowadays, he ,especially in discussions, is very aggresive. Even if presented with facts or his own previous assertions he become very agitated. He tries to put the blame on others. What is more shocking is that he accepts the evidence and says the evidence supports him even though it contradicts him. This is not a one-time incident. It is happening everytime. We are so exhausted. There is no way for us to compromise either. He comes up with different line of arguments. Even if we decide not to argue on a particular stuff he accepts and immediately comes up with arguments. Literally, anything becomes an argument aggresively. If I make a remark like, ""there is too much traffic today"", then he immediately picks up and yells at me. He asks, what do you think is a city? don't you know there are traffic jams? Don't be the frog on well. Don't you learn anything ever in your life? Did you ever stepped out of your home? If I apologize. He would accept and again after few minutes or later the same day will send statistics on traffic jams in city and reignite the arguments.   He was not so back then. Is it a problem? Does he need a clinical evaluation? Can anyone guess what is the probelme if any? "
327,Purchasing and Using Encephalogram (EEG),"I am going to purchase an EEG and conduct a series of studies for my MA work.

I have a few questions, please, explain to me like I am five:   What are the cheapest / best options for a beginner such as myself to start with? Will I need any other devices/accessories except the EEG machine and a computer?  What's the best software to store the data and analyze it? Are there any good how-to books that cover all the important details and nuances that I will require to educate myself?  "
328,Do schizophrenics tend to believe they were gaslighted?,"It would seem to me that it would be hard for a single person to manipulate a mentally stable into thinking they have schizoid problems. One might quickly become suspicious if the supposed delusions are only tied to a single acquaintance. But for people who are already slightly schizophrenic, it would be much easier to exaggerate their symptoms. Aside from cases of actual intentional gaslightings, schizophrenic people may tend to be paranoid and form beliefs that they are manipulated.  All that is slightly different from the more common situation where a schizophrenic person thinks he is lied to by psychiatrist, psychotherapist or another mental health worker.  Is there any research on the schizophrenic people believing they were gaslighted by friends, family or another acquaintances? Or at least some case notes or the mental health workers speaking about that issue? "

331,Correlationships between food choice and personality,"There are known attempts to correlate the personality of an individual with their choice of a color or a shape - something which I have asked about here and am using in an app that I am delveoping.  I am now starting to ask myself whether there are any formal studies that attempt to correlate common food choices with personality.  I have come across a few useful ideas by simply googling for ""food choice and personality"".  e.g. Keller &amp; Siegrist (2015). and Zayed (n.d.)  However, neither of those articles to my mind comes close to being a formal study of the subject.  In the context of my own app I am wondering whether I can augment its understanding of its user by adding - to an existing list of personality acquisition questions - a request to select from, say, images that show   A burger An apple A chocolate bar A chili pepper   Given that I am using many other personality assessment measures I would imagine that even without any known prior art on the subject I will in due course be able to glean something useful from an answer here.  However, I would be most grateful to anyone who might be able to point me to any formal, peer-reviewed studies on the subject.  References  Keller, C., &amp; Siegrist, M. (2015). Does personality influence eating styles and food choices? Direct and indirect effects. Appetite, 84, 128-138.DOI: 10.1016/j.appet.2014.10.003 PMID: 25308432  Zayed, A. (n.d.)

332,Inducing error-related negativity,"Which tasks induce the strongest error-related negativity? I'm trying to build a classifier that measures EEG signals to detect when a subject observes an error being committed by another subject. It seems to me that the strength of the ERN may vary depending on the task, so I would like to create an experiment that evokes a signal that is as strong as possible. Has such a comparison between the strengths of the ERN elicited by various tasks been studied?  Edit: Table 1 of this paper seems relevant. "
333,What techniques can be used to differentiate between correlation and causation?,"Psychology is unique among other medical sciences in that it cannot ask test participants to like, prefer or support something. As such a vast body of psychological studies are purely observational and can find correlation but not causation.  For example if there is a link between self-awareness and empathy, how to test if being more empathetic increases self-awareness, being more self-aware increases empathy, or, let's say, level of some hormone control both and they are otherwise independent of each other?  Problem  Let's compare those two situations:   A study found that people who eat a lot of sugar are fat. How researchers can test whether a) eating sugar makes people fat b) being fat makes people eat more sugar or c) both sugar consumption and body fat are influenced by the same external factor? A study found that people who like yellow color are more likely to be psychopaths. How researchers can test whether a) liking yellow turns people into psychopaths b) being a psychopath makes people like yellow c) being a psychopath and liking yellow are both influenced by the same external factor?   In first scenario the answer is easy - split test subjects into two groups, force one group to restrict sugar intake and monitor their weight, help second group lose weight and monitor their sugar intake.  In second - I cannot find the answer. Because psychology generally concerns itself with what people are as opposed to what they do, the standard approach in medicine described above cannot be utilized. Researchers can't force someone to like yellow, neither can they turn someone into a psychopath.  Question  When researchers find a statistical correlation between character traits or preferences, how do they test whether there is a causal relationship between those characteristic, if traits cannot be adjusted? "
334,Timing accuracy in presentation of videos with different frame rates (with COGENT),For our fMRI study we want to present videos of 3 seconds duration. The videos have different frame rates:   48 videos were recorded with 50 fps 16 videos were recorded with 25fps 64 videos were recorded with 30 fps   I'm now faced with the problem that the videos are not presented for 3 seconds. The videos are either extended or shortened:   48 videos (50 fps): extended  (maximum extension between +6ms to +10ms) 16 videos (25 fps): shortened (maximung shortening between -17ms and -20ms) 64 videos (30 fps): shortened (maximung shortening between -17ms and -20ms)   For this reason I assumed that the problem is caused by the different frame rates of the videos. But then I discovered that the extent of the extended or shortened presentation is changing from presentation to presentation and independent of the videos. So for example: Video1 is presented for 3006ms instead of 3000ms during the first presentation. During the next presentation Video1 is presented for 3008ms instead of 3000ms and so on.  Another problem is the presentation of a blank screen between each stimulus. It is set to range between 3000ms and 5000ms in varying steps of 250ms. Here I noticed an extended presentation ranging from +16ms up to 30 ms.  Questions   Any ideas what might cause this timing deviation? Does this have to do with the hardware of the stimulus presentation computer?   The refresh rate of the stimulus presentation computer is set to 60Hz. The computer is connected to a projector for the fMRI measurements (but the timing deviations do also occur when I present the stimuli full screen on the stimulus presentation laptop). 
335,What science-based strategies can slow down dementia?,"What are some science-based strategies that could slow down dementia?  For example, do cognitive demanding tasks like solving crosswords, playing with the Rubic's cube, chess, or perhaps stuff like gardening help against dementia? "
336,What are science-based methods to memorize large sets of best practices?,"I am a writer. In every book about writing fiction there are some recommendations, which I need to remember during the process of writing. Examples of best practices may include:   In every scene, it is necessary to describe where the characters are, what they look like (incl. how they are dressed), what time is it, plus information that competing media cannot replicate (smells -- books compete with movies and describing smells is one way to make a book more immersive than a movie). Balance of description and action: Two paragraphs of description, then something must happen. You cannot just tell what happens like a journalist. Instead, you need to paint a picture by using metaphors and comparisons.   What are scientifically proven strategies to memorize long list of items (best practices in this case)?  I know I could do a giant checklist of text improvement processes and go through it while editing every chapter. I already tried that and it didn't work that well. There were over a hundred methods from different books, organized by writing stage (ideation, plotting, writing first draft, editing).  I'm using Anki to increase my vocabulary (I'm not an English native speaker) and would like to have something similar for lists of best practices. However, Anki isn't really suitable for this purpose because it trains your ability to give correct answers to questions (not remember a set of best practices at a certain stage of writing).  In another question the use of flash cards was suggested. If I understand it correctly, this method requires me to create a flash card with following data:  Question: What things do you need to do at the beginning of chapter design phase?  Answer:   Define the event that the chapter is describing. Write down the beat sheet. Find on the Internet the images of places and objects that are featured in this chapter. Write down the goals of the chapter.   This is fine, if the list of items is relatively small. But what if there are 40 or 100 things that I can do at the beginning of a phase (chapter design in this case) and I want to remember them all without a checklist?  An answer to this question suggests attaching emotions to the things I want to memorize. I probably could invent some stories to memorize. But I still don't feel like this is the ""full solution"" (even if I invent stories that trigger my emotions for every of the 100 best practices, I am still not sure that I will remember them all). "
337,"Are there official guidelines to provide ""mental first aid"" to people attempting suicide?","I wonder if there are any official guidelines on how to act in case of an attempted suicide as a civilian (i.e. trained in first aid, but untrained in rescue, mental health etc)?  How should a regular person react in order to prevent the suicide attempt? Obviously -   By not endangering myself By calling 911 (or a local equivalent)   being the obvious first steps. However, WebMD as an example is pretty bland about the rest one can do. I have also learned that keeping them talking and asking open questions about the suicide thoughts.   However, there must be some official guidelines (that I just couldn't find).  I should point out that this is not about suicide prevention, put about what to do when one witnesses a suicide attempt (so the plan has already been made and is currently starting to be put into action, i.e. the patient is already standing on the roof-top about to jump or starting to take other means of committing suicide "
338,Is the belief that a consultant knows more than the team a form of cognitive bias?,"I've noticed that many people assume that consultants know more than they themselves do and/or more than their team does.  That is, when a team is stuck on a problem, some people believe that a consultant can figure it out even without knowing that consultant. True, more heads might help, but I've also seen teams who believe everything a consultant says, especially at the beginning of the relationship yet scrutinize the people they work with.  Why?  I've read about the halo effect in Wikipedia, which contains the statement, ""The halo effect is a type of immediate judgement discrepancy, or cognitive bias, where a person making an initial assessment of another person, place, or thing will assume ambiguous information based upon concrete information.""  This would suggest to me that any concrete information can bias someone when filling in the ambiguous information.  However, reading more about the halo effect, it seems mainly focused on how people look.  So my questions are, what goes on in people's minds to create the belief that a consultant knows best when they don't have evidence to believe so?  Is it a bias?  If so, which one?  Or just human behaviour?  Something else?  Does it depend on the situation?   "

343,"How can we get rid of the problems of misconception, assumption, and expectation?","I watched a TedX Talk that called ""The Surprising Secret of Solving Problems Quickly"" by Collins Key, about 3 problems that most greatly hinder our ability to solve intriguing problems. These 3 problems are Misconception, Assumption, and Expectation.  Misconception, as he explains, is when we misunderstand a certain part of a problem because of how we are used to seeing it or because of how it is presented.  Assumption is when we assume something about part of the solution that we have little reason to assume, but it seems to us as if we do have reason to assume this.   Expectation is when we expect the solution to go in a certain direction, thus stopping us from thinking in other directions.   If you do not understand the exact differences between the three in this context, please watch the Ted Talk.   My question: How can these complications be eliminated? How can we check to make sure we have no misconceptions? How can we block ourselves off from assuming something? And how can we ""mindblank"" ourselves enough to not expect anything, without entirely blocking off our thinking process? "
344,Resources for reliable psychology research,"I'm looking for resources of reliable research in psychology. I mean 'reliable' in the following two senses:  1. Replicability  It seems more and more of the famous effects that I, as a psychology-curious layman, learned about by watching intro psych lectures or in popular media fail replication. It starts to seem like anything one believes to know about psychology is as likely as not to be false. As a layman it is quite difficult to track down all of the possible effects and replications thereof. Is there some resource which tracks the replication status of psychological research and collects the different effects which are reproducible (and which aren't)?   EDIT: I was able to find the following which is actually pretty close to what I was looking for. This is not a complete list but it is the kind of thing that I am after.  [website]I found this through the links in the accepted answer to this SE question, which was suggested by a commenter below. However, now the comment is gone for some reason so I cannot give credit.  2. ""Bi-partisanship""  Some areas of psychology are politically charged. Things like gender, race, intelligence, etc.,  are understandably controversial. It seems that often professional psychologists fall down on either side of a given issue, each insisting that it was settled by the scientific community long ago in their favour. As a layman, this is rather frustrating to make sense of. Is there some ""common ground"" resource which tracks the research that all sides agree on? "
345,fMRI ROI analysis: independence,"In a 2x2 factorial, is it appropriate to look at an interaction at the second-level, group analysis (e.g., using SPM) and define this as an ROI to restrict follow-up main effect contrasts? Or is this an example of a circular, non-independent analysis? "
346,The computer model of the brain,"I am a computer programmer or computer engineer, and am interested in comparing the brain to a classical computer in some way.

347,Research operationalizing so-called strategic thinking?,"Is there contemporary research in trait psychology, which attempts to operationalize the structures behind a strategic thinking style? I'm thinking of a style of problem solving as taught in officer training, and to a lesser extent, manifesting in strategically-oriented games like chess.   I realize that this sounds perhaps a little vague. However, in common usage it's not unusual to refer to a person's being a ""strategic thinker"" or a ""problem solver"". I wanted to know whether these traits have been studied or deconstructed in a more formal capacity, so as to define them in a manner consistent with trait psychology.   Are there scientific definitions of strategic thinking with empirical support? "

My plan is to have subjects watch a short clip with a presenter and see if they are they aggravated, upset, uncomfortable with the presenter based on that one characteristic changing and compare this across demographics.  I do not have much experience with setting up and performing experiments.  How do I quantify how upset, uncomfortable, aggravated, or displeased the subject felt?  How do I make sure that every subjects experience is the same except for that one factor?  Do I have to do anything special because I will not be able to run the same test on the same exact subject?

349,Why only 16 Jungian types? Combinatorially it should be 2 * 4! = 48,"The seeming elegance and symmetry of the table of functions prompted me to use a technical side of my brain to ask a ""what if"" question about the other possible Jungian functions.  I used combinatorics(math) to calculate all possibilities of arranging letters F,S,T,N as well as adding an alternating i/e ""flavor"". There are two options for the flavors (once we know the i/e ""flavor"" of the first function, the rest are determined because they alternate).  For illustration, I enumerated one quarter of all possibilities (only those starting with an F but you can keep going yourself if you like). The original 16 types are listed below that. As you can see, there are many gaps - only 4 of 12 used here and 16 of 48 used overall. So, exactly 1/3 utilization. The mathematical elegance is a tease, makes me think that this theory is based on something real, but is it? Could it be an elegant accident or an elaborate hoax instead?

351,Importance of Neural Synchrony to Cognition,"Is there a consensus on whether computation using Neural Synchrony is reasonable or not? In ""How to Build a Brain"", Chris Eliasmisth cites Yuko Munakata and R. C. O'Reilly as saying that ""the available evidence does not establish that the observed synchrony of firing is actually used for binding,instead of being an epiphenomenon"" to dismiss current architectures such as LISA and DORA which use synchrony. Yet, there still seems to be papers published on using neural synchrony for computation. Additionally, Thagard still seems convinced of their importance saying that ""spiking neurons have psychologically important qualitative properties such as becoming synchronized with each other, and neural synchrony has been proposed as a crucial ingredient in inference, analogy, and consciousness"".  Are the authors of these new papers naive or is there convincing evidence for the meaningfulness of synchrony that Chris and I are missing here?  References:  O’Reilly, R. C. &amp; Munakata, Y.

If not, should we transform the data since analysis of these data is based on the normality hypothesis?  "
354,does getting top marks and ranks in school or college make one intelligent?,"Please do not discuses about IQ tests that have problems like: 2,4,8,16,... what is the next number? having the answer as 32, because one can relate any number of random numbers mathematically! Whenever I ask this question to someone they would just say: yes!  getting top marks and ranks in school or college does make one intelligent because they could just score a top rank in IQ tests!  This paradox about such IQ tests not being correct can obviously be reasoned, but are top rank holders in proper subjects at school or college more intelligent than the rest of the students?  I agree upon the fact that there can be diverse definitions for the word ""intelligent"". The definition I use for the term intelligent is: a person who has the ability to learn any kind of subject that involves reasoning and extend his abilities to be able to develop that subject**; time frame is not a problem in my definition. To be elegant, I believe that one who has the ability to learn and research on any subject is intelligent. I do not consider people who could do stuff any computer program can do, as the existence of an algorithm to solve that task makes that task less imaginative but could involve high calculation ability (a weight lifter is different from a martial artist) . Scientists haven't achieved human level intelligence in machines and that makes me set machines as my reference point for intelligence.       please provide references enough to convince me and others on your answer.  *lets imagine relating a series 2,4,8,16,111; to do this we would first have to define a 5th degree polynomial with unknown coefficient values. equate: [tex]. Its obviously possible to solve and get 4 values for each coefficients and the rest 2 coefficients end up being linearly related to each other (substitute any value other than zero for one and get the other). So hence you have a polynomial relating 2,4,8,16,111!   **when I say ""develop that subject"" I do not mean writing books and teaching, but I refer to the method of using one's creativity to enlighten themselves on the deepest regions of that subject.      P.S. also please suggest the best possible ways to measure one's intelligence.     update:  could you also please explain why we rely on tests that do not have defined answers to its questions for measuring one's IQ? Whenever I see a question that first gives a series like 2, 4, 6, 8. ? and ask for the missing number, I would be tempted to write 15356346546434 instead of 10 and form a polynomial relation that expresses the term in the series given its term number (like [tex] would express the [tex] term).   I have also seen IQ question papers with questions that has a star drawn on with random numbers displayed within each blank loop we find within the star and a question mark in one of the blank loops which asks for the answer. Even they have arbitrary answers.      "

The experiment could be something like: take few monkeys/people, show them bunch of gratings with different orientations and record gamma. The orientations which induced highest gamma level is what I want to know.  2: Which grating frequency induces most gamma? The experiment could be something like: take few monkeys/people, show them bunch of gratings of different frequency patterns and record gamma. The frequencies which induced highest gamma level is what I want to know. "
356,Manipulating cognitive load in online experiments,"I'm under the impression that standard cognitive load manipulations (e.g., remember a 7-digit number while completing some other task) wouldn't work for online subject pools like Mechanical Turk. Are there other cognitive load manipulations that might work online? Time pressure is an obvious one, but anything else? Thanks!  "

358,How does the timing work out for dopamine to affect the development of long-term potentiation?,"I just recently learned (indirectly from this source) that long-term potentiation/depression only takes place when you have large/small amounts of dopamine present at the relevant synapse. However, my understanding is that early in the process of learning behavior, dopamine isn't released until after a reward is received. If I'm a monkey who has to look one way or the other to get some juice, by the time I drink the juice and get the resulting dopamine, the neurons I used to move my eye are presumably not firing any more, right? So then how does this work? Is it that:   There's a slow bootstrapping process. Something like: first the monkey has to learn that the taste of juice leads to the reward of sugar. Then the monkey has to learn that the sight of juice correlates to the taste, and extend the chain one step further, etc., etc., such that by the time you actually have the monkey in the lab there's a very small inferential step needed to plug into a larger reward chain. The neurons don't actually stop firing. There is some sort of system in play that keeps the neurons firing afterwards, waiting for fluctuations in dopamine level to tell it whether or not it should increase or decrease long term potentiation. Something I haven't thought of?  "
359,How does hPES compare to the learning rates of ANNs?,"The primary learning mechanism of artificial neural networks (ANN) is back-propagation, which is not biologically plausible [2].  Trevor Berkolay created an alternative to this learning with the Neurological Engineering Framework (NEF) and Nengo called hPES (Homeostatic Prescribed Error Sensitivity) [1]. But how does it's learning capabilities compare to the standard supervised and unsupervised learning of ANNs in terms of computational power required and speed of learning?  [1] See also, ""How to Build a Brain"" by Chris Eliasmith chapter 6.4  [2] Further details around this claim can be found in the question ""Is back-prop biologically plausible?""  Note: This question portrayed ANNs and the NEF as adversarial, which really isn't the case. Spaun the brain model, which is kind of the poster child of the NEF, uses ANNs (Convolutional Neural Networks specifically) converted into spiking neurons in it's vision system. "
360,"OCD Motivation and Dopamine Motivation, is there a connection?","I understand that OCD is something that causes sufferers to perform irrational behavour consciously, I also understand that the motivation comes from performing the irrational behaviour/behaviours to release the anxiety experienced.   Although, what causes sufferers to pursue specific goals whether it be career choice, physical achievement, etc. ? According to my (hopefully trustworthy) sources the neurotransmitter ""dopamine"" plays a huge part in motivation, setting the bar high and making people do whatever it takes to reach that goal of ""happiness"" or ""achievement"".   I believe OCD is somewhat related with ""serotonin"", but all I know is that there is an allele gene Alpha 2 which causes some sort of susceptibility to a few different disorders, OCD being one of them. Does OCD motivation have any correlation with the neurotransmitter ""dopamine""? Thanks in advance! "
361,What hardware setup is commonly used for low-latency audio stimulation?,"I need to carefully control the latency and timing of auditory stimulation in an upcoming experiment.  Some of this depends on software, but my question is specifically relating to hardware, drivers and OS kernel.  In other words, I'm not looking for advice on programming languages; I have that part covered.  Driver &amp; OS  I'm somewhat familiar with the ASIO4ALL driver suite in Windows, but I was weighing this against the option of using a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) with a real-time kernel installed.  My concern is that sound is notoriously problematic in Linux.  I seem to recall real-time audio being all but impossible if you're working with ALSA.  Is the same true of Pulseaudio?  Has anybody successfully set up low-latency audio output in Linux?  Hardware  What sound cards are commonly used?  Can anybody suggest some specialized hardware?  Ideally, I'd like to stick with a PCI card of some sort and not have to resort to bulky external sound cards, but I could be swayed if these cards offer significant advantages.  Thanks! "
362,What are the effects of visual deprivation on mental health and the other senses?,"How do blind people who haven't always been visually impaired deal with their day-to-day lives? I've heard rumors (very, very unreliable rumors) that once you stay in the dark for too long you'll start to go insane, but I haven't met one ""insane"" blind person yet, nor have I ever heard of one.   However, it's proven that low levels of dopamine result in depression, anxiety, etc. And low levels of dopamine just means a lack of production or intake by the dopaminergic receptors. If the lack of happiness results in disorders such as depression, what would a lack of light do?   Also, why do their other senses strengthen? I read a question earlier about how someone trained themselves to write and read upside down, but then had trouble writing b's, p's and q's, apparently this was due to a process called ""negative transfer"", does this have anything to do with it? Less energy used meaning more available to enlarge the other's capabilities? "

368,Body Language: Why do we give each other the grumpy/frowning fake smile?,"I've recently become aware of this - I kinda knew I was always doing it, but just now it got me self conscious and thinking about it:  When crossing paths with a stranger, you are supposed to be friendly and smile at them, acknowledge them through a nod, and so on.   This is particularly the case in many service industries:   grocery stores - associates and customers acknowledging each other (not during checkout, but just walking around in the store)  fellow gym members as well as staff and members (again only walking around, not during particular business related interactions)  Another example might be you walk in a public bathroom and someone just comes out the door, you'll look each other briefly in the eyes, ""smile"", nod, acknowledge each other, and move on.  Now here's the thing I've become aware of, and mostly guys do this:  We don't actually smile.  In fact, we are kind of grumpy looking. Our mouth and eyebrows go into a frown, we press our lips together, and the only thing close to a smile that we do is to create a crease on the sides of our mouth.  Hard to explain... And hard to find actual pictures of this...    besides that he looks in the distance and he looks concerned, but imagine he looks at you and gives you a nod like that. pretty close!    he looks slightly more surprised, and worried, then what people usually look like, especially because the eyebrows are going up.    he's got too much ""darnit!"" on his face, and his eyes are sad looking, but again, the general idea comes across.    he has an actual upward curved smile going on, but definietly the lips pressed together like that  So again:   Mostly guys do it it is done for acknlowledgement/politeness when you cross paths it usually goes with a nod and brief eye contact, whereas the nod goes down the eyebrows might seem kind of like a frown, since you're noding down, while looking upwards in the persons eyes your lips are pressed together often the mouth will actually go into a reverse smile curve (meaning frown) the mouth gets kinda pulled to the sides, like we're making a wide mouth, just like when smiling.   First of all: Do you know what I'm talking about? Do you do it? Has it been done to you?  Does it have a proper name?  Why do we do it? Why don't we actually smile? We do we look rather grumpy when smiling like that?   I've noticed that we do a similar face in many different situations. Sometimes someone might tell you something that might make you smile or even laugh, but to them it's rather sincere, so you press your lips together, trying to make a frown, but you still can't help to smile a little. There are many expressions that this kind of face can express (as you can see in the pictures), they all have a certain subtle difference to them, and definitely very different meanings, but I feel as if the mouth pressed together and kinda mixing a grin with a frown remains constant. The particular facial expression I am talking about is also accompanied by a nod, making it distinct.  Why do we do this so often?  Are we hiding something? Is this some sort of a default expression?

370,Can reading [self-help] books aid in therapeutic treatment of the narcissistic rationalization pattern?,"I've dealt with a few people having a narcissistic personality trait / disorder.  For me it's interesting to see the defense pattern they adopt through rationalization to defend their self-image and to avoid changing their beliefs (confirmation bias).  The pattern seems to be almost identical in the various subjects.  My question is: could be functional to these subjects to read a book which tries to change their beliefs? At least could it be used to speed-up the therapy?  It could be described as follow:   The subject feels ashamed, weak or ""bad"" on some area. He develops the belief to be superior to others on another area (strong, very rational). The subject feel a strong need to defend this superiority. Any attempt to change his belief is perceived as an aggression. The strategy of defense include: use of cognitive distortion to confirm his belief, discrediting of the other idea, personal offence or provocation, getting annoyed and emotional, focusing on everything but his error / responsibility / distorted belief The subject usually raise the level of the argument in an emotional way. He appears completely stubborn or use verbal strategy to obstacle the interlocutor. He appeals to any formal argumentative error. The subject claim to be unique and use typical ""excuses"" connected to relativism like: ""why should I change?"". But actually he use relativism only when it comes to be useful to justify his own belief. Otherwise his beliefs appears very absolute and dichotomic.   Is it correct to suppose that million of narcissists share the same ""defensive"" pattern? Has it been already studied? "
371,"Can the Philosophy thought game ""The experience machine"" be answered by Positive Psychology?","In Philosophy, a thought game exists called ""The experience machine"" {1}. In summary, it's a machine you plug into that enables you to always experience positive events, and never negative ones.  One of the common arguments not to plug into this machine is that if you never experience lows, you can't appreciate heights, since they would become the norm. This line of reasoning is known as the Hedonic treadmill.  In Positive Psychology the concept of a Baseline level of happiness {2} exists. It has been shown {3} this baseline can be raised, or lowered, but the research I know of does not discuss the effect of removing negative experiences to increase the baseline. It focuses on other factors, like intrinsic motivation, self-esteem, and so on.  Knowing about baseline happiness, and the trend to fall/rise back to it; what would happen if you never had negative experiences? The argument against using the experience machine basically assumes the baseline would plummet if there are no negative experiences, or at least become quite low.  My line of thinking, and hypothesis is that there is no need for negative experiences in order to appreciate positive ones. Since, if you don't experience anything negative for a week, you can still experience joy that week, a month... a year... a life? If you are never unpleasantly hungry, you can still appreciate a good meal.   Now to the actual question(s):   Is there any research that shows the effect of ""lack of negative experiences"" on the baseline level of happiness? Are you better able to enjoy nice experiences in the light of negative ones?  Is there research on the relation between the two? Has this research ever been applied in Philosophy to try and answer the Experience machine puzzle?   {1} Nozick, R. (1977). Anarchy, state, and utopia (Vol. 5038).

372,Is the eye direction language dependent on the direction of writing?,"I've read from various sources about the eye direction language. What is of my special interest now, is:   looking right means thinking (about future, new ideas etc.) looking left means remembering (looking into past)   When I've thought about it, I've noticed the possible explanation in our writing.  We write from left to right, so:   the future is on the right, looking right means looking into future the past is on the left, looking left means looking into past   Is the eye language dependent on the writing system? Are there any researches about the differences between western culture, and, say, Arabic, where people write from right to left? "
373,Does empathy extend to animals?,"I've read that humans are able to empathize with other humans, to feel as another person does, through mirror neurons. I'm guessing that they're able to empathize with primates too, as they share similar brains, have similar limbs, faces, etc. So, when someone watches a monkey or child drink juice, they can empathize some of the joy of drinking juice.  But what about a human empathizing with less humanoid animals? Can a person who has developed a personal bond with say, a horse, 'feel' the same way as the horse does? Can one understand the joy of a cat eating its favorite food?  Do mirror neurons apply between humans and animals as well? "

375,What computerized EEG analysis algorithms are there?,"I got a commercial-grade EEG headband and am trying to look at the data it outputs. The headband quantifies raw EEG signal from a single forehead dry sensor into a range of EEG bands (alpha, beta, etc). The issue that I'm running into is that the values of the EEG bands jump rather significantly from one data point to the next (0.05 second reading intervals). Additionally, there are eye-related artifacts.    I would like to apply some sort of algorithm or statistical analysis to see how the EEG bands behave over some time interval.  I'm hoping to see if some EEG band statistically rises or is suppressed over 5-15min time period. Seeing instantaneous jumps in individual readings does not convey this information.   For example, I know that for Actigraphic studies, there are sleep scoring algorithms, like one by Cole that looks at the previous 4 minutes, the current minute and 2 minutes in the future to score a minute of actigraphy data:    SleepScoreConstant* (550*4minAgo + 378*3minAgo + 413*2minAgo + 699*1minAgo  +1736*CurrentMinute  +  287*1minAhead + 309*2minAhead)   Are there some similar algorithms for EEG band analysis?  Alternatively, it would help if you can suggest the realistic time window over which EEG bands may be statistically analyzed in awake subjects: is it 20 seconds? 5 minutes? 90 minutes?  "
376,What is the upper bound on rate of learning in young adults?,"I was wondering how a normal adult in their 20s could best structure their life to make best use of their capacity to learn. I am no expert in cognitive science, so I assume just a really common definition of ""learn"" here. We might measure this by, for example, hours of sustained, intense study per 24 hrs. I realize my question might be a major oversimplification, leaving out factors like stress.  If there is some upper bound on how quickly learning occurs, then there may be little point in studying more than, say, 6 hours per day.  Does anyone know of any research which shows some general, asymptotic upper bound for learning in adults (20-30)?  Anectodal examples might also be useful. What are some examples of how highly accomplished adults structure their days? "
377,"What is the influence of ""effort put into pursuing wealth"" on happiness?","As presented in the TED talk by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (3:30) repeated research has been unable to show a correlation between happiness and level of material wealth (above a certain minimum threshold).  As a result, a line of reasoning that is often made is:      ""We should stop pursuing more wealth, since attaining it will not make   us happier.""   While i agree that we can conclude from this research that attaining more wealth will not make us happier, i don't think we can conclude that the amount of effort we put into pursuing more wealth has no influence on our happiness.   There is anecdotal material to show that putting less effort into the pursuit of wealth makes you happier, take Zen monks for example, but there are a lot of other factors that could be causing their increase in happiness.   What research has examined the merit/effect of detachment from material wealth? To what extent is pursuing or not pursuing wealth related to happiness?   EDIT: Happiness, as roughly defined by any of the known measurement methods. "
378,Is there a metric of the overall excitation of the brain or nervous system?,"I'm thinking of a way to describe what's happening to a single channel EEG/MEG sensor output. I've noticed that there is significant difference in the readings from a quiet observations, versus a person who's engaged in a conversation. I'm looking for some way to quantify the two distinct states, so a computer algorithm may have a chance of distinguishing the two. Potentially, in the future I would like to compare readings from one individual to the next, or compare the arousal of two individuals engaged in a conversation.  It would be helpful to know what are the names of metrics that may be used to measure the overall arousal/excitation of a person, that person's nervous system or brain. I can think of Actigraphy (the study of human motion) as one, its units are arbitrary activity count, or m/s^3. These are scored as ""zero point crossings"", or ""area under the curve"" of an accelerometer graph. But are there any other metrics or units of human activity/excitation? Maybe some of them are related to an EEG/EMG readings? Like an obscure algorithm named after some scientist? "
379,How does knowledge about a subject aid in its recall?,"I've experienced it many times with my students and also with myself. Let me illustrate with example:  When I'm teaching, I say something like this:     Gastrointenstinal Track has following sections         Buccal Cavity   Pharynx   Esophagus   Stomach   Duodenum   Jejunum   Ileum   Caecum      To help them remember I repeat above thing multiple times. But still they don't remember much of the list.  Alternatively instead of just saying those things (even though that's all I need my students to remember), I spoke about each of the above item for few minutes. i.e. I gave more details of about each of those things. Result is that, now my students do not remember most of the details about each of those items, but they could remember the list. Which is exactly I want.  Whats happening here? Whats the science behind it? Is there more to what I'm describing? "
380,Learning of new concepts being impeded by an error in previous work,"Note: I'm framing this question in terms of tutoring math since that's what I tutor most, though it applies to a wide range of subject matters.  I do a decent amount of tutoring, and this is one phenomenon I see popping up constantly, and I occasionally catch myself doing the same thing, though less often since I've become aware of it  What happens is a student learns a new concept/formula/algorithm in class and then does practice or assignment questions. They will then come up to me and ask me to check their work because the answer they are getting doesn't make sense, or doesn't line up with a known answer. Sometimes, they will even have spent hours double or triple checking their work on this new formula.  I will look over their work and confirm its correctness. I have learned to ask ""Can I see the work you did to get to this point?"" They then show me this work, and most of the time, there is a simple arithmetic error or oversight (and if its a misunderstanding of previous material, then its a whole other issue).  What has happened is that the assignment question involves multiple steps, the student makes a simple error in an early step, and assumes the error to be in the later steps involving the newly taught equations, and wastes hours looking for an error there.  My related questions are:   Does this phenomenon have a name, and if so what is it? What are the psychological processes behind this, i.e. why does the student not double check all of the work? Is there any way to mitigate this behaviour besides simply being aware of it?  "
381,"What is the bias/thought process that results in distrust of ""formal"" knowledge in favor of ""folk"" knowledge?","An interesting effect I've noticed is that certain groups of people seem to accept ""folk knowledge"" and value it over significantly better founded ""formal"" or scientific knowledge. In particular this is notable in many discussions of Psychology and vaccinations. Scientific evidence is clearly on one side, but an odd distrust seems to exist for some which makes the unproven or disproven ""folk"" knowledge more acceptable to them.  This effect seems sort of like Illusory Superiority, but it seems to not quite be that; Illusory Superiority is the tendency of one person to overestimate their own abilities or knowledge. It's possible a number of biases are at work but I can't think of a single one which fully covers what's at work when one outright rejects facts based solely on other sources, rather than one's own experiences or topical knowledge (which certainly influence one's willingness to believe facts).  Is this a known/named effect? Is there anything that drives these oddly specific examples of distrust against logic-based evidence? "
382,What are the effects of social rejection on the brain?,"What are the effects of social rejection on the brain?  If the external circumstance can not change, how can the impact on the brain be reduced?  What is the average sensitivity to social rejection and are some not effect by it?  Any points in the right direction are helpful.  So far I have found only 1 study (Eisenberger et al., 2003) summarized as follows (but unable to make any conclusions):     A ball is passed to a group of students except for one student, who   does not know what the experiment is. When the ball is not passed to   the ""excluded"" student, the brain of that excluded lights up in the   same place as in physical pain.   References   Eisenberger, N. I., Lieberman, M.

384,Does associating a color with numbers improve math learning?,"I have heard a number of reports that some mathematical savants associate particular colors with numbers.  It got me wondering, if colors are associated with numbers during mathematical teaching, would this improve ability?  For example, if every time I showed my child the number 2, it was colored red, and every time I showed her 3, it was blue, and so on, would she learn arithmatical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division faster?  Further, would it matter which colors were associated with which numbers?  Should 5 be purple? "
385,Should fantasy distractors be avoided in multiple choice questions,"Is there any reason not to include fantasy distractors (made-up wrong answers) in multiple choice tests.   Examples:  What is the name of the compound HCl?  a) Hydrochloric acid  b) Chlorohydride acid  c) Chlorohydric acid etc   What is the term for a parasite that cannot complete its life cycle without its host?   a) Obligate parasite (correct)  b) Parasitic obligate (fantasy word)  c) Mandatory parasite (fantasy combination)  Fantasy distractor definition: Usually one chooses distractors that a student could confuse with the correct answer, based on knowledge of common cognitive models of the field. I call a fantasy distractor a distractor that is a made-up word - typically it would be used for testing/learning complex terms that consist of a combination of etymological roots by rearranging them or mixing them up.  Potential concerns: How high is the risk that students remember the fantasy distractor? What is the best practice on  such fantasy items?   Rationale for having fantasy items: The reason for asking is that it seems having a greater number of distractors can make the test more of a retrieval test than a recognition test. Getting plausible non-fantasy distractors (eg in chemistry can be tough).  "

387,Why do people feel the need to make changes to a solution presented by another person?,"There is an interesting phenomenon I have come across several times when working with groups, and that is the need some people have to make changes to a solution that someone else created.   The change is often superficial or doesn't substantively change the solution, however the person making the suggestion is often adamant that the change is vital.  In a question on the User Experience SE, some comments were made about how to plan for and mitigate this:     People are natural complainers. So next time you present a design make sure there are 1 or more subtle defects you're sure they notice. They'll complain about those, you say ok and fix them. if you present a perfect design, they'll still find stuff regardless.   And:     That reminds me of the Battle Chess duck - It was well known that producers had to make a change to everything that was done. The artist working on the queen animations came up with an innovative solution. He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the ""actual"" animation. Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen. His comments, ""that looks great. Just one thing - get rid of the duck.""   Is this a known phenomena in Cognitive Sciences?    It seems to indicate a need/desire on the part of the person making the suggestion to exert some control over an external process but I wonder if it is more elemental/basic than that? "
388,At what point do multiple personas for social context cross into multiple personalities disorder?,"Recently I took part in a conversation about the difference between the ""many hats"" of a successful corporate executive, and ""multiple personality disorder."" Although humorously bantered, the ideas shared in that conversation shed a light on the fuzziness between when consistent multiplicity of personality characteristics is useful and good (to better adapt to a variety of environments), and when is it counter-productive or self-defeating, and labeled multiple personality disorder? What are the ""cross-over"" points?    Multi-tasking in executive management positions require being able to speak in the vernacular of many stake holders and to be able to communicate effectively with a wide variety of groups and collaborators. Corporate cultures vary between industries, countries, even regions, and size of the enterprise, etcetera, and yet, a successful corporate executive can walk in any of these with ease. How can the effective use of these ""chameleon expressions"" be distinguished from split personality?  I use this example tongue in cheek, but Mitt Romney is the perfect example of someone whose personalities clashed in company with one another (fund raiser, 47% vs. 100%). He is a very successful businessman, did his changing faces in the media unravel a persona that didn't really exist?  "

The hypothesis is you would expect a normal distribution ('Left' =38 and 'Right' = 38). So the question is 'is this distribution a coincidence?' The p &lt; .029. By seeing this outcome I thought there is that is no coincidence that there isn't a normal distribution and it must be due to a variable.

In layman's terms, I'm trying to answer the question: which behavioral traps are the most common?  I'm aware that this is a loaded question in that different sociocultural influences can have a huge impact on what is ""common"". Any pointers much appreciated!  Thanks. "
391,How to measure dominance and submissiveness?,"Introduction  Interpersonal dimensions of personality (Sullivan, 1953) have been described in a circular model, the interpersonal circumplex, since Leary (1957). The two dimensions that define this circumplex are warmheartedness(pleasantness) versus coldheartedness and dominance versus submissiveness. Two better known measures based on Leary's concept are Mehrabian's Trait Dominance-Submissiveness (Mehrabian &amp; Hines, 1978) and Trait Pleasure-Displeasure Scales (Mehrabian, 1978) (which combine with a Trait Arousability Scale, Mehrabian, 1977, into the PAD; Mehrabian, 1996b), and the Interpersonal Adjective Scale (IAS-R; Wiggins, Trapnell &amp; Philips, 1988).  If you analyse the dominance/submissiveness scales from these instruments, it becomes clear that dominance is here understood to be the ability to assert oneself, while submissiveness is the complementary inability:     The 26 items of the Trait Dominance-Submissiveness Scale ... assessed the generalised feelings of control and influence over one's relationships and life circumstances (e.g. 'I control situations rather than let them control me' (+), 'I work best when someone has outlined a job for me' (-), or 'Domineering people don't intimidate me' (+)). (Mehrabian, 1996a)   The adjectives related to submissiveness in the IAS-R make this negative construct of submissiveness even more clear: timid, bashful, shy, forceless, are four of the eight self-descriptors from this scale.  Contrary to this perspective on submissiveness as incompetent and powerless, other conceptions are possible: some egalitarian individuals might not be unable to dominate others, but simply unwilling; some loving individuals might find fulfillment in selfless devotion; and with the ever expanding service economy, hopefully professional service providers enjoy serving their customers – it would be a dismal life for a majority of us, if we didn't.  Submissive pleasure is an important factor in certain forms of romantic relationships, from the wife choosing a traditional provider/facilitator-household in feminist times to the happy spanking BDSM couple.  Question  Are there measures, scales or instruments that measure a positive, joyful concept of submissiveness, as it is conceived by BDSM?  If not, is there a measure of the ""service provider personality""?    References   Leary, T. (1957). Interpersonal diagnosis of personality. New York: Ronald Press. Mehrabian, A. (1977).

392,Relationship between processing speed and IQ in twice exceptional children,"How come some twice exceptional children (i.e., intellectually gifted children who have some form of disability) have high iq, but low processing speed? Isn't processing speed a factor of intelligence? If not, why do iq tests have a time limit? "
393,How does psychoanalytic theory explain the way in which projection works?,"According to psychoanalytic theory, people sometimes defend against their own unwanted motives, conflicts, and behavioral tendencies by identifying them and decrying them in other people. This has been called projection.  I don't understand the reasoning behind  Projection as a Defense Mechanism. I mean, why tell someone they lie when you are the one prone to lying? Why accuse other people of something they haven't done but what you most likely would do if you were in their position? In what way does this tendency help to deal with inner conflicts according to psychoanalytic theory? "
394,Why people assign blame to deliberate act?,"Say we buy stocks. Then stocks either go up or down. Neither is deliberate. No body deliberately buy the wrong stocks.  But free market assign full responsibility.  However, if someone accidentally committed manslaughter against a kid, he'll get lower sentence than if someone deliberately murdered a child.  Why do we feel that way (and yes most of us do feel that way).  Do we take into account that deliberate mistake are often repeated? Those who deliberately rob us must have rob so many people so many times? Do we recognize that giving huge incentive do not reduce ""undeliberate"" mistake?  What happened?  Is there a math model or evolutionary model for that? "
395,"If we do not consciously perceive a sound at a time, can we sometimes still later consciously recall it?","You all probably know the thought experiment, 'If a tree falls in the forest and no one is their to hear it, does it make a sound?'. But if we take that one step further and ask 'If we are not consciously aware of a sound do we hear it?'. This question as it stands is very broad so let me specify what I mean.   By consciously aware I mean that we are actively thinking about that sound when it occurs and by hear I mean at some later time, (perhaps with prompting) are you able to recall that there was a sound?   (Of course the question can be phrased not just concerning hearing but also things like pain, etc). "
396,Drawing Parallels Between Finance and Psychology: A Psychology Metaphor,"This question starts out with some finance theory to set the scene:  Background  Let's consider the stock price of Google (the value of holding a share in Google). The volatility in Google's stock price is the degree of variation in that price. An implied volatility can be derived from the market price of an option.  An option is an instrument which gives the buyer a right to buy or sell a particular stock in the future at a particular price, if they want to. Volatility is one of the inputs required to price (determine the correct value) of an option. It is the range in which a a stock price is expected to fluctuate.  Organisations are often considered as organisms. Organic metaphors are often used to describe how organisations work.    Question  If I was to use psychology to create a metaphor for volatility, what theory could I use?  If stock price is an individuals self worth or self esteem and an option price is their outlook on what their self worth might be at a point in the future. Finance theory would suggest that a correct view of future self worth would require something comparable to volatility.  Does it sound reasonable to consider volatility as emotional modulation? Emotional dysregulation at one end of the scale, a level head at the other? Is there a psychological term for level head?  Any good reading you would suggest to help me continue this comparison/analysis? "
397,What's the opposite of major depressive disorder?,"Bipolar disorder, BD, involves manic episodes and depressive episodes.  If someone has a depressive episode, that person may have major depressive disorder, MDD or BD.  If someone has a manic episode, that person may have ___________ or BD.  So, what is the opposite of MDD?  It seems that ""mania"" is a term that describes an episode. So ""mania"" is the opposite of ""depression"" rather than ""MDD"".  Is there a major mania disorder? I have heard of kleptomania and pyromania which appear to be classified as impulse control disorders but nothing that appears to be analogous to major depressive disorder "
398,Can one depressive episode be enough to prescribe antidepressants?,"Suppose someone were to see a psychiatrist, explain their life problems and such and then their psychiatrist concludes they are currently in a depressive episode. Their psychiatrist doesn't yet know if they have major depressive disorder - MDD - bipolar disorder or no disorder.  Are there situations where someone in such scenario might be able to be prescribed antidepressants or any kind of medication? I can tell such situations are rare since doctors would probably want more information before prescribing medication.  The context of this question is what we can conclude from those who are prescribed antidepressants. Does the fact that they have been prescribed such medications imply that they have been diagnosed with or highly thought by a doctor to have a mental illness instead of simply having an ""episode"" or a temporary mental health problem?  Sorry if the assumptions of my questions are wrong. I'm assuming that there are cases where mental health problems are temporary much like having a fever and some are permanent much like being farsighted. To my knowledge, people can experience a depressive episode without having MDD or bipolar "
399,Neurotransmitter detection in the brain,"How are the effects of drugs in the brain, in terms of neurotransmitters measured? For example, Selective Seretonin Reuptake Inhibitors are a class of anti-depressants. How was and is this type of information about hor neurotransmitters act obtained? "

401,Can speech dysarthria occur in schizophrenia without other neurological or medication-induced disruptions?,"As I understand it, acquired dysarthria of speech is caused due to problems with motor neurons or other neurological, cerebral and peripheral, conditions in the CNS affecting those. And schizophrenia is primarily a problem in mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic pathways, amongst possibly other problems. Can a purely schizophrenic or psychiatric condition without neurological diagnoses cause dysarthria as a symptom by itself? Or is acquired dysarthria always a sign of a comorbid neurological diagnosis? "

403,What factors influence a person or group of people's empathy toward another group?,"The recent Paris terrorist attack highlights the discrepancy in the levels of empathy that Western people feel toward other Western people, compared to the empathy they feel toward Middle-Eastern people for example, who suffer such attacks regularly.   The question is:   How can a person or group of people's empathy be measured? What factors influence this level of empathy?    Have any studies been done on this subject?  "
404,Literacy and other traits of social network users vs. the larger society,"Have sociological researches been made on the levels of literacy, culture, shared ethical values among the users of the many existing social networks compared to the larger national societies the users belong to? What about researches on the proportion of people with racist, homophobic or religiously intolerant attitudes on social media compared to the society as a whole?  I have begun wondering about this issue because I used to have an account on Facebook for a short time and I discovered a reflection of the society of my country, Italy, that I wish I had never discovered: although I am interested to socially interact with the opposite typology of people , I found an overwhelming majority of users, among my co-citizens, plagued by an alarming level of illiteracy and the incapability to understand anything not down to earth, full of racial hatred (which is being sed in my country by some politicians and television channels owned by people politically allied to the far right) and lacking empathy and ethical values that I thought to be shared by almost all mankind, such as respect for the life of drowned refugee children. I hope that the average of my co-citizens having an account on Facebook is worse that the average of my co-citizens as a whole. "
405,How do children understand the concept of number size?,"How do children understand that one number is larger than the other? For example, given the numbers ""8"" and ""9"", how do they learn that ""9"" is the larger one? This apparently develops as a precursor to addition. Is it memorized like the result of simple addition? "
406,cleanIAT function in R IAT package,"Has anyone used cleanIAT (function in IAT package) to compute D-scores for their IAT data? Have you noticed any discrepancies between your D-scores and those of colleagues that used another program (e.g., SPSS) to clean the same data? Can anyone describe each column in cleanIAT s output?  While the manual says:     ""Outputs a dataframe that must be saved to an object. The variable IAT is the    calculated D-Score for each individual. SUBEXCL notes any exclusion   criteria, with 0 being inclusion data, 1 for exclusion due to fast   response, and 2 for exclusion due to missing blocks. C indicates   standard deviation for combined blocks (correct trial only), while A   indicates standard deviations for combined blocks (all trials). M   (mean), E (percent error), N (number of trials used), and F (percent   fast responses), are reported for each block included in the original   dataframe.""   There are a number of columns that are in the output that aren't explained in the documentation. For example, there are three IAT scores (3 D-scores?). And there are 2 S scores and 2 C scores.  I'd like to start an ongoing discussion about this because the package isn't mentioned at all in forums and ""cleanIAT"" gives zero results in Google Scholar. "
407,"What are some things that may explain feeling on ""auto-pilot"" the majority of the time in life?","Assuming an individual is physically fit and does not experience abnormalities related to lack of circulation, obesity, or immune disease...what on a neurological level is the basis for feeling like life is on ""auto-pilot"" for most of the time.    &nbsp;  A case study who is well known, is an intelligent individual. He is a male, Caucasian computer scientist under no duress such as financial problems, lack of romance or friendships, lack of nutrition, etc. This individual has the ability to learn things quickly, solve problems robustly, and can pick up spoken languages quickly. However, from experience, any small perturbations in his sleep cycle will cause him to be very, very agitated, very impulsive, have anxiety, and crash/melt down if sustained without sleep for long. By slight perturbation, I mean not an all nighter, but something many people around the world go through from time to time, like two back to back 5 hour nights. In detailed interviews, the person has admitted to feeling like life is on ""auto-pilot"" most of the time. They cannot explain their actions for every day tasks, and although self admittedly pious (but not overly extremist), wonders if their life is just a multivariable system, one in which everything around them from their coffee cop to their car are just ""elements"" in a set they call reality, with in their own words, ""have properties that detail information relative to to other elements"". This person communicates very, very well with others, to the point that they are seen as one of the most social people in mutual inner circles. This person is non violent and does not have any habits or crimes. This person has a high libido. In times of stress, or at random times, this person randomly will text a few close loved ones, ""Do you love me?"" or ""Are you mad?"".    &nbsp;  Note: This is NOT a real case study nor a request for a medical diagnosis of an individual, as I know both are highly unethical to post here on online. This is part of an educational journal club at a neurophysiology and psychiatry institution. I have submitted my response as it was due last night at midnight. I understand asking others to help me with work is also highly unethical.  However, I was just curious if I could sample the waters and see what others think. I am genuinely curious as I thought it was interesting, and I thought it was an interesting case and I had to spend quite a bit researching and explaining my views. Answers are welcome from psychology, neuroscience, psychiatry, biochemistry,, and other offshoots relatable to the cognitive sciences.  "
408,Can good life experiences make for great life achievements?,"I've been reading up on Kurt Cobain's life story and his achievements, and these observations/questions came to mind.  There are plenty of examples of people with unhappy childhoods or life in general that have experienced exceptional professional success later in their life. But is the reverse true as well?  Can a happy childhood/life make for similar (or even greater) professional success? Has there been studies whether there's a correlation? "
409,link between top-down (bottom-up) processing and cortex layers,"What are the relations between top-down and bottom-up processings and the flows of information in the brain? For example, does top-down processing start from some layers and go to lower layers?  If so does the information remain in the same area of the brain or can it travel from a layer of one area down to lower layers of an others areas?  Also how are feedforward (feedback) pathways related to bottom-up (top-down)? "
410,Threshold time for stimulus to be consciously perceived. Why?,"A visual stimulus must last longer than some threshold duration to be perceived consciously. For example, a light dot flashed for a duration of 10ms can't be consciously perceived. Why? What prevents a sub-threshold flash to be consciously perceived? Does this mean the relevant neurocircuits have to keep on firing for some threshold time in order to reach consciousness? If so, why? "

412,Can color blindness be treated with image filtering technology?,"Using image color-filtering techniques we can simulate the way colorblind people see:    The aim of this question is to know whether the opposite process could be possible, namely can a colorblind person experience normal trichromatic vision using a  vision enhancement device? Could the deficit in the cones be corrected via this system?    Taking this one step further, if this process is possible, is it possible that humans could experience multi-cone vision as the 16-cone vision of the mantis shrimp? "
413,What Makes a Concept Good in Cognitive Science?,"Are there any frameworks to evaluate the quality of a theoretic concept in cognitive science (ideally with references)?

414,Why the brain region with less activity is not more responsible for some action?,"From my naive understanding, it seems that when people try to find correlations between a human action and a certain pattern of activity in the brain, they measure the brain activity with some device  designed for that while a group of people perform that action. It seems that it is usually deduced that the brain region that shows more activity is more responsible for the action under investigation.   What is the proof that the relation is not inversed? That is: Why the region with less activity is not actually more responsible for the action under investigation? "
415,"Basis for ""we make 35,000 decisions a day"" statistic","In an advertisement by Microsoft for their To-Do product they use a statistic that we ""make over 35,000"" decisions a day.  Unsurprisingly, they don't cite a source.  Is there any scholarly basis for such a figure?  Even though there are usually 86400 seconds in a day (that works out to one decision every ~2.5 seconds if you include time sleeping) you could reasonably make an argument for that number.  I say that, however, without a good operational definition for ""decision"".  Executive function researchers may outright say that figure is bunk.  Q: Careless usage aside, is there a source for this statistic and/or a more scholarly correct number for the ""number of decisions we make each day""?  Apparently the statistic is widely ""cited"" (without proper citation) online.

417,Mental Health Optimisation and the Macro Environment,"I'm studying the below questions. I appreciate they're rather broad - the purpose of this post is to get guidance on where I might start. I'm hoping someone can provide more focused examples of related studies which will help me move forward.  To what extent does a high level sense of direction weigh on day to day mental health optimisation?  In other words...  How is the economy relevant to mental health optimisation and does progression at such a macro level support individual psychological health progression?  By 'high level sense of direction' I mean the level of optimism in our environment - whether that be from growing financial markets, an evolving political landscape, levels of world conflict etc. (I'm talking vision/risk appetite/optimism. Perhaps there is an academic term within the cognitive sciences for this? Behavioral Ecology?)  I'm looking to analyse how our global connectivity and processing of world news/events which highlight sometimes far-removed changes in our environment, directly impact our mental state.  Ideas:    Have there been any studies into the relationship between economic performance and anxiety? Maybe the psychological outlook of Millenials who experienced a very difficult economic environment during 2007 to 2013 (credit crisis) whilst trying to enter the workforce? Many didn't and lived with parents longer, haven't bought houses etc.. Perhaps the relationship between proliferation of social media news services and psychological health?   Please provide reading suggestions and advise if I'm not using terms recognised in the realm of cognitive science/psychology. Please add relevant tags to my question as not sure where this fits in; looking to bridge two worlds here.  "
418,What's the psychological issue name of fear of people?,"With the issue of being afraid of doing anything before people, one has to work hard on self control to prevent the body shaking on every tiny action, like hold a pen, drink water, etc, and when there's many people looking at him/her, it becomes almost impossible to hold shaking, to speak normally, or to think. This person is subconsciously in fear of people unhappy(?) with his actions, even though he knows there's nothing wrong with his behavior.  Is this a typical case in Psychology? Is there a name for it?  Scenario for some background information his mother died when he was very young, his father don't like him, never talked to him except call everyone dinner, never smiled to him, never spent time with him, never gave any recognition even he got full marks, curse and beat him on whatever excuse when not in good mood.   He lived in a room with a big window in the wall next to the living room(a request for curtain was rejected), he had no idea why father dissatisfied with him (he's always one of the best in his class during student period and never asked for anything from his father, if exclude care), but been used to keep an ear out on his father all the time when at home, for whenever his father step into the living room where he would be seen through the window, he could sit as straight as he can before his desk and try not to move a bit, he didn't want to give him any excuse to curse, to beat. "
419,Family happiness Vs Career happiness,"Common knowledge accepts that there are two conflicting types of happiness, one attained through a good family and a second one attained through a successful career. These paths of happiness, since they require the same resources, are conflicting and somebody must choose the one over the other. This point is best illustrated through the movie The Family Man. Of course there are exceptions where both types of happiness are combined very well.  Please can you provide research or theories that can facilitate the clarification of the following questions:  Do we really have two different types of happiness?  Are the two happiness qualitatively different from each other?  And the most important question, is one of them much more superior than the other type? "

Iv'e read that each neuron can manufacture just 1-2 neurotransmitters, and from what I understand only these are released from his axon terminal.  Does it mean that this neuron can only receive these ones through its dendrites?  if so, does it mean that neurons interact only with neuron of the same kind od neurotransmitters?  Thank you, Liron "
423,How do I find Computer Science-Focused Cognitive Science Labs for Research?,"I'm applying for Master's in Computer Science programs with the goal of gaining research experience and moving into the field of Cognitive Science to one day get my PhD.  I'm trying to find labs and professors right now that conduct computational cognitive science research, my interests right now are pretty broad, but I'm looking in general for Artificial Intelligence related research that leverages insights from psychology and neurology in order to develop more efficient algorithms.  My interests are also pretty broad in the field of Computational Cognitive science because its really important to me right now to make sure I find a good advisor/ professor to work under while I develop what my more specific interests are.    Can anyone give me some names of labs or professors to look into?  Or where would be good places to look for such labs?  Its really overwhelming because many of these labs that I've found (for example, from this site) seem to be in departments such as Psychology and Neuroscience, I'm not sure if I should just be looking for labs that fall under the Computer Science department since that is what I will be under, also I noticed a lot of the labs have mostly Psych or Neuro students as well as opposed to CS, not sure if that means that lab doesn't tend to accept CS students?  I was wondering if anyone can give me advice about how to best find research labs that fit this interdisciplinary theme that would accept computer science students to work under?  Just looking for some guidance if any former or current graduate students who came from a Computer Science background about which labs offer Computational Cognitive Science focused themes.  Thanks so much!   tldr; Need computational cognitive science labs/ professors/ resources for a prospective Master's student with a Computer Science background looking to move more into Cognitive science.

424,Is depression part of who a person is?,"I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, commonly known as depression.  Some days ago I had a discussion with my therapist about whether or not depression is part of the person I am. She says that indeed it is and that I should accept it as a part of my being. I should not fight it, but rather accept it. I should not see it as a ""demon"" trying to mess with my life, but rather as a part of me asking for attention, rising from the dark depths of my mind where I try to bury it. It is a helpess child, my own inner child, crying and asking for help for only apparently no reason, and I should not ""beat it up"" and yell at it to ""go back into its room"", but rather ask what's wrong and cuddle it.   I disagree, as I think that I have depression, but I am not my depression. I'm suffering from a depressive episode, but I am not a depressed person, as I am a completely different human being when I'm not going through an episode. I have an illness, I am not my illness. I might come to terms with the fact that I indeed have depression and that I have to deal with it, but this doesn't mean accepting it as a part of me. I fight it as I fight a flu or a cold. I accept the fact that I have come into contact with the virus, I can't be mad for that, I can't just willingly remove it from my body simply because I don't want it, but that illness is not a part of me, though it affects my everyday life and forces me to feel and act in ways I'd rather not.  You might ask to clarify what I mean with ""part of who a person is"", so let me try to explain further: is depression part of someone's personality, consciousness, temper, character? Or is it, as a disease, a negative and abnormal influence on someone's regular and healthy behavior? Am I someone who tends to be negative, irritable, hopeless, unexplainably sad and tired, self-loathing, apathetic, suicidal, because that's who I am, or do I suffer from such symptoms of my illness?

426,Multistable perception with three possibilities,"I know that multistable perception refers to the phenomenon that occurs when we look at an ambiguous image like a Necker Cube or some sort of positive/negative space art, and we can’t perceive both possibilities at once, but rather waver between them repeatedly. However, all of the visual examples I’ve seen of this phenomenon only have two possible interpretations (of course, putting two Necker Cubes next to each other leads to [tex] possible interpretations, and three Necker Cubes gives [tex] interpretations, etc).  However, does anyone know of a well-known ambiguous image or piece of art with exactly three different interpretations between which the viewer switches back and forth? If not, can anyone construct such an image?  Thanks! "

Knowledge Management &amp; E-Learning: An International Journal, 7(1), 6-19.  This paper was published in 2015 by the inventors of Concept mapping. In this paper, they have listed 7 Criteria for good concept maps. One of these criteria is:     Concept labels in maps should be only one or a few words labeling a specific   concept.   What is the rationale for this criterion? Is there any empirical study on it? I'd appreciate it if you inform me of studies that have tested or explained why nodes should be small. "
428,"Which features of concept mapping are more helpful than outlining, or vice versa? and why?","Please let us know any studies that compare features of concept mapping with outlining. Many studies have reported both outlining and concept mapping helpful for learning and assessment, but they looked at them as black-boxes. On one hand, although outlining has been around for longer, there are significantly more studies that indicate the effectiveness of concept mapping for learning and assessment. On the other hand, outlining is more widely used among students and researchers. Then, what are the features that differentiate them? Are there specific features that are helpful for some applications but not others?  Here is what we already know: Miyatsu et al. [1] define the following procedure for outlining:   Read the entirety of the original passage. Keep in mind how the author structures ideas. Identify main ideas. Structure main ideas in the outline. Use outline as a cue to retrieve information.   These steps are very similar to the procedure advised by Novak and Cañas [2, 3] about designing a good concept map. Especially, steps three and four in the outlining procedure correspond to the progressive differentiation and integrative reconciliation processes defined in Ausubel's Assimilation theory [4], which are the foundation of the concept mapping. Mayer [5] found outlines as ""advance organizers"" helpful to facilitate ""bridging,"" i.e., the thinking process one goes through to connect the new knowledge with what they already know [1]. This thinking process results in meaningful learning that is shown to be improved through concept mapping [2]. Lehman et al. [6] compared outlining with concept mapping, but found no significant differences between their uses, although results were leaning towards greater improvements with the mapping condition. Also, Bui and McDaniel [7] compared the use of skeletal outlines to illustrative diagrams in improving free recall and short-answer questions; while both conditions were significantly effective for free recall compared to a control, those using illustrative diagrams had performed significantly better than students using skeletal outlines, particularly for low-ability learners. Therefore, free recall may not depend on how students organize or visualize information, but it does effectively change improvements in short answer questions. Kiewra [8] compared using matrices against outlining on comparative information, with the former having visual properties that allow users to create relationships between different categories of information that the latter often overlooks. Hansell [9] suggested the use of ""post organizers"" or ""arrays,"" which use a combination of ""words, lines, and arrows,"" similar to that of concept maps. This was shown to have significantly improved the ability for students to outline as it focuses on ""identifying relevant ideas and fitting these into a meaningful pattern."" As a result, the visualization of information may have played a large role in enabling students to process information to a deeper level.  References:  1- Miyatsu, T., Nguyen, K., &amp; McDaniel, M.

429,"Confidence helps me, a lot. But why/how?","I'm a competitive shooter (clay pigeon shooting). Performance in this sport is hugely dependent upon many different facets of a shooter's mental approach. I've realised different parts of my mental state at that time really influence my ability to get into that 'flow state' and effortlessly score high.  One of the biggest aspects I've started playing on lately (with significant results) is confidence. I've found telling myself to relax because this is an easy shot for me, and convincing myself I'm the best in the competition and the targets are easy is usually self-fulfilling.  What are the mechanics behind this being so effective?  I've read various articles and watched videos regarding 'hypofrontality' whereby the pre-frontal cortex being too active can cause you to overthink something that should be instinctive. I'm interested in how, specifically, this is the case.  How is our instinct more capable than our conscious and how (specfically) does that over-conscious type of approach influence instinct so much? Is it that we're only capable of taking one approach (either conscious or sub conscious) at a time and choosing the former means we're not maximising performance? "
430,"Common latent feature among all ""memory techniques""","So I've been delving into ""memory techniques"" and people who compete in memory competitions(memorizing and reciting a poem in a small amount of time, memorizing a deck of cards, memorizing pi, etc). I've read books written by competitors as well as blogs in the community and have up with this list of techniques that are generally accepted as used in a competitive setting.   Memory Palace: You allocate what you're trying to memorize into a visualization of a place you are familiar with Pegging: You link one piece of information to another by getting an association even if the two subjects are not related(memorizing your grocery list by remembering your first item in the list is ""pickle"" and that rhymes with ""sickle"" which is used to cut grain so you deduce the 2nd item is ""rice"") Projecting: A method used by some to memorize poems or story is to place themselves in it and see it firsthand in their mind   These are just a couple examples to prove a theory. My theory is all memory techniques are just spreading new knowledge across many neurons. In theory our brain works by when a neuron fires off, adjacent neurons fire off and we remember something.   So my theory is that all memory techniques just exploit this by embedding new knowledge into a breadth of neurons. Any thoughts or opinions on this? What makes a good ""memory strategy"" that is supported by what we know about the human brain? "
431,Are our human brains programmed as materialistic as one can be?,"First of all, not all human beings are materialistic. I strongly believe that.  We tend to not be happy with what we have but what we want. We desire for more.  There is a saying that says that the other side of the lawn is greener.  We are inclined to compare ourselves with other human beings. Sometimes I have seen humans become so envious and jealous that they become their only barrier.  Why do we behave like so? We know that we can never be like them. Still, we want to have that kind of car, that kind of house and the list goes on.  Not only that. I have detected a feeling among humans titled A feeling of deprivation and replenishment.  Today we have an $80 Nokia Lumia 630 cellphone. Tomorrow we will see a commercial on an android phone. Little more expensive. Still, we want that. Then the market introduces the next-gen iPhone. We want that too. Then an iPad. Then iMac. Then iDesktop. Then dual-processor Xeon 21 cores the best desktop. Still, something will be missing tomorrow as soon we see the commercial of the next-generation TV with THX certified 8.5 channel Dolby Digital surround sound speakers and subwoofers.   Why does the human brain act this way? Is it right or appropriate to act this way? Is our human brain programmed for materialism and as soon as it perceives that object with its five senses and even though we don't need it we want it anyway? Why doesn't our sixth sense kick in and say hey enough already?   I have also seen in certain conditions and circumstances the sixth sense of homo sapiens automatically kicks in psychologically and it happens to support the lost or damaged senses. For example, when a visually impaired person is walking on the streets, right at that moment they can feel their sixth sense.  So the question are we materialistic by nature and why doesn't our brain have some sort of protection mechanism to protect us from that instinct?  "
432,Administrating a norm-referenced test to someone with bad command of the language,"Context  We regularly administer tests in Greek that have (almost always) been developed in English and then translated by a corresponding Greek group and the norms re-calibrated.  We found that the Greek translations for a few of these questions can be anything from slightly misleading/vague to outright wrong, but we're still administering the tests unchanged, since this is what the norms have been calibrated on.  Problem  We want to assess a child that has a better command of the English language (due to bilingual family environment) and is finding the Greek version difficult to understand*. However, the child does live in the mostly Greek-speaking area in which we operate, and we want to use the Greek-version norms to have a meaningful comparison to its peers also taking the test.  We would be inclined to administer the English (original) version of the specific test, so that the child can understand and answer more comfortably, and then score it against the Greek norms, which I realise is not ideal, but would be preferable to scoring against a reference group from a completely different context and background, and would also allow us to make a comparison to the child's peers.  However, due to the translation issues I mentioned earlier, this solution does not work (i.e., in some cases, the child would be answering, essentially, different questions than its peers would be in Greek).  Question  What's the best way to approach this and why? Would it be better to:   Administer the English version and score against the English norms? The results would not be directly comparable to the child's peers, and the reference group might not be very representative anyway. Administer the Greek version, translated back into English to preserve the exact meaning of the Greek version, and score against the Greek norms? In this case, most questions would be identical to the original English version, but a few would be different in order to preserve the meaning of the mis-translated Greek questions. There's a question of how valid the norm would be due to the change in language. Have the child take the proper Greek version with limited understanding? There's a question of whether the results would be accurate or a result of misunderstanding. Accept that a meaningful comparison using this test is impossible in this case?   N.B., I've listed the above as an indication of what we've been considering and our concerns, so any better alternatives are obviously welcome, but in any case, please explain your answer.  * To be clear, this is a behavioural assessment, not IQ or anything similar, so understanding of the questions is not really part of what's being assessed. "
433,About conflicts in archetypes,"One of the issues that is interesting to me is  about the  conflict that can lead to chaos:   How serious are the antagonisms in the archetypes, like said here  for example, how much percent of the archetypes of the original patterns ate  engaged in this situation  (eg God vs evil, etc.)? What does it have an effect on humans (from the unconscious side if it exists), for example, how it disrupts the functions of the left brain such as seen in the eyes of the other side? ( any scientific source...) What treatments are known for this condition and by what criteria do they rank, for example, to my knowledge of the defensive systems introduced by Freud and his daughter in this category, which have higher degrees of maturity? have? Can the old Dawkins meme gene theory be described as having a quasi-physical behavioral existence and can be described as viruses or parasitic or other symbiotic models such as peaceful and ... ? Does the contrast in the archetypes lead to some kind of heroic journey in life, and what is the difference between the other heroic, treasure and maiden trips? In the process of upgrading Freud's defense systems? What is the breakdown process for those involved in solving this conflict? (It is interesting to discuss the scenarios of failure on the championship journey and the severity of the suffering and the length of stay at each stage.) What real historical examples of individuals or communities trying to resolve or exacerbate this conflicts do you have (perhaps Mansour Hallaj and Conquest of Seeing Love as the element that came to resolve the contradiction between God and evil  in his story  And seeing this love everywhere and the way he used it along the way ...) does this conflict in meme gens  has had levels and could reach to universal archetypes, and is there any definition like level of defensive systems of fraud in this area? what social  organizations (religional organization  or  ... ) are more engaged with this situation and is there any conflict between them, can do we use this field information to bring this situation more clear and why or why not? what is the relation of this  situation related to chymra creatures and who or what part of psyche  tried to do this and why?   Thanks for your attention and time  to see my many questions and I hope to ask more qualified  question according your view points.  "
434,Did McClelland ever mentioned about two aditional needs in motivation?,I've been getting classes on psychology of the motivation and my intructor mentioned about McClelland's theory of needs.  Although the wiki entry on the subject is somewhat clear about it. It doesn't mention about the necessity of determination neither the necessity of competence.  In my class my intructor attributed this to McClelland to which him defined those as:  Necessity of determination:  Tendency of to feel protagonist of your his or her own destiny.  Necessity of competence:  Tendency of a person to measure one's own performance with that of others.  I'm not sure where did my professor got those or if McClelland ever mentioned those in his theory.  Perhaps someone with experience in this field can offer some guidance on what's difference between them and how does exactly apply to a person's motivation?. Does it exist a hierarchy here as with Maslow's?.   
435,Is there any evidence in neuroscience that suggests visual thoughts (possibly others) or some aspects of the mind occupy higher dimensions?,"We think anything as real if we can perceive it through our senses. But I think generally speaking, anything is real if it occupies space (ie familiar 3D world/space)&amp; have a 2 way to &amp; fro interaction between it &amp; us. So the latter definition excludes things in the past &amp; future that were or will be real. So what about our thoughts or the mind? Mind is the arena where we have thoughts. The thoughts we have in our mind can be visual/tactile/auditory /olfactory/gustatory, etc. For instance, we can reproduce an image of a real world object in our mind. We know that the imagery is in our mind &amp; not in the real world, though there is an exact replica in the real world. These imageries can be static or dynamic according to we wish. I mean we can even run a movie in our mind in such a way that's virtually indistinguishable from reality. Just think about dreams. Sometimes after waking up, we think the events that occurred in our dreams really did occur. The complicated biological processes happening in our brain cells create what you call as thought. These biological processes can be thought of as an information or information changes. This information hence definitely occupy space. They occupy space in our brain cells. But where does the imagery or the virtual 3-D hologram itself that this information produces exist? For sure this imagery doesn't exist in our familiar 3 dimensions.If it did,it would be real as any other real object. But we know our mental imageries are 3-D.So why I believe these visual thoughts has to occupy some dimension or space? Because we experience it.Experience is mediated through interaction by some signal.Signal can travel through some medium only. By medium I mean space or higher dimensions; not a physical matter substance. So I think even though on how to produce an imagery in the mind is encoded as information in our brain cells, the information about the imagery itself has to geometrically occupy space &amp; time. That space maybe the higher dimensions. Thats why even though we don't feel these visual thoughts to be real, it appears as if they are real.In short I think they aren't real because of my definition I believe of  whats real  (anything real should occupy our familiar 3D space &amp; have 2 way to &amp; fro interaction). So in short this is what I want to know- is there any evidence in neuroscience that suggests visual thoughts (possibly auditory,tactile,etc) or some aspects of the mind occupy higher dimensions?  "
436,Is there a difference between physiological stimulations and psychological stimulations?,"From what I understand, physiological stimulation (or stimulus or sensation) ""refers to sensory excitation, the action of various agents or forms of energy (stimuli) on receptors that generate impulses that travel through nerves to the brain (afferents)"", while psychological stimulation (or conceptualized stimulation) involves cognitive process like perception, reasoning, emotion, experience. However, reading the Wikipedia page of stimulation, I feel like the two concepts are the same.  Are they the same or different? I guess we can say that psychological stimulation is physiological stimulation because it can explain (or be explained by) these phenomenons:   Brainwaves are combinations of harmonic oscillators range from 0.5 to 700 Hz Synesthesia, when some people can literally see an orange triangle in space when they hear a trumpet   If so, how does this energy change in the brain related with perception, reasoning, emotion, experience?  Is there any experiment that support or against this?    FYI: Physically, when the oscillators aren't aligned, the wave will not jump:   But if they are aligned, the wave will jump:     Related: • Does neurodynamics have any relation to psychodynamics? • Why do brains oscillate within specific frequency ranges? • Is there a relation between large-scale oscillations and small-scale oscillations? in Physics "
437,Uses of the Brief Anxiety Scale,"I am currently completing my undergraduate research thesis on self-affirmations measured with anxiety. I am trying to see if the self-affirmation task reduces anxiety after. I found the Brief Anxiety Scale and am trying to find out what it is best used with, but my search of articles has not made the uses clear to me.  For what is the scale best used? Are there different scales that might instead be recommended for my research?  Thank you in advance to anyone who can provide assistance! "
438,Brain computer interface Final year project,"My professor told me to collect data for the states we want to to use to control the movement of our robot i.e., thinking, meditation and other emotional or physical states using an Emotiv EEG headset which I don't have at the moment.  Is there any alternative software for acquiring and visualizing these signals without the need for headset right now? How many samples need to be taken for the training of the neural set or any other classifier? What sampling rate and which file format must these samples need to be saved?  Is there any online free simulator for analyzing the data and map it’s working on a simulated robotic object? Which embedded hardware is ideal for the project Arduino or Raspberry Pi for a 32 bit Windows 7 operating system.  What online tutorials, research papers and books would assist in taking this project to completion and creating artificial neural networks? "
439,How are musical hooks defined/studied in psychology?,"I know about the common concept of a 'musical hook': a ""short riff, passage, or phrase, that is used in popular music to make a song appealing and to 'catch the ear of the listener'.""  The Wikipedia article mentions how it is studied in marketing research, and provides two links to websites of organizations which study the 'hook' ('Hooked on music' and 'Hooked!'). However, I am not interested in marketing research and the two websites linked to as 'scientific research', at a glance, do not provide any insight into the research they are conducting.  Is this concept studied within the field of psychology or neuroscience? Is there any domain-specific terminology used to refer to what makes music appealing or 'catch the ear of the listener'? I would like to start reading into this literature but currently do not know what to search for. "
440,What hormones stimulate non-sexual intimate behaviour?,"From wikipedia article sexual motivation and hormones, it is said that testosterone/estrogen, oxytocin and vasopressin are stimulating sexual behaviour. But I'm wondering if any of these hormones are linked with physically intimate non-sexual behaviour, like hugs, kisses and cuddles. Also, is there any link through them with having pleasure from these activities?  Is there any research on that and are there gender (sex?) differences? "
441,When and how did public nudity and sex become shameful and unacceptable?,"I am thinking about it from the evolutionary perspective. For nudity, I thought that maybe nude bodies may be associated with a higher probability of infection and diseases due to exposed parts. I also thought that maybe there's a social reason such that it's considered a better social status to be dressed; as an indicator of wealth and security.   But then when you think about it, it's not necessarily nudity that is frowned upon, it's the exposure of private parts. Considering that our reproductive organs are also used to dispose bodily waste, it makes sense to associate some sort of negative emotion with them. But then again, why would female breasts be considered indecent?   Also, when it comes to sex, clothed intercourse is still considered shameful. Sex is not only considered as a private activity, but also as a sin by lot many religions; it's also associated with morality. Gluttony, also being a function of our greed and bodily pleasure, doesn't receive the same amount of repulsion as does sex. Wouldn't it make more sense for the society to promote sex considering that it increases the probability of the continuation of our species? "
442,Use of Botulinum toxin A (botox) to treat depression and its effect on fight/flight repsonse,"Over in Health.SE, @faustus provided a couple of references to papers which suggest the use of Botulinum toxin A (BTA) - otherwise known as botox - to treat depression — Magid, et al. (2015a) and Finzi &amp; Rosenthal, (2016)  Magid, et al. (2015a) states that     a single treatment of BTA in the glabellar region can produce a strong reduction in the symptoms of major depression      Figure: Improvement in BDI score. The figure shows absolute reduction in the BDI scores (14.3 vs. 5.1±standard error of the mean) from the baseline to the primary end point 6 weeks thereafter in the combined sample (n=134) for the BTA (n=59) and the placebo group (n=75), respectively.   whilst Finzi &amp; Rosenthal, (2016) states that     In an initial case series, one of us (EF) injected BT into the frown of ten depressed patients, eight of whom went into remission after one treatment (Finzi and Wasserman, 2006; Finzi, 2013). The study was limited by its small size, lack of controls, and lack of blinding. In three subsequent randomized, double blind and placebo controlled trials, we and other researchers have found response rates of 50—60% in major depression, with about one third of patients going into remission (Wollmer et al. 2012; Finzi and Rosenthal, 2014; Magid et al. 2014, 2015b). BT showed antidepressant effects both when used as an ancillary treatment and by itself.   However, they then go on to say     How might injecting BT into the corrugator muscle influence the emotional brain? FMRI imaging has shown that subjects who received BT injections into their frown muscles had amygdala that were less responsive to negative stimuli (Hennenlotter et al. 2009). Recent work has confirmed that amygdala activity in response to angry faces was decreased when the frown muscles were paralyzed by BT injection. Furthermore, amygdala activity returned to its original inducible state after the effects of the BT injection had worn off, confirming that BT reversibly severed afferent feedback from the corrugator muscle to the amygdala (Kim et al. 2014).   With the decrease in amygdala activity in response to angry faces, am I correct in thinking that this could have a detrimental effect with regard to the flight/flight response in potentially dangerous situations?

443,NEO-FFI vs. NEO-FFI-3: What's the difference?,"I just ran out of a large shipment of NEO-FFI booklets, so I went to order more from PARinc. This shipment has lasted since 2014.  It seems that the original version of the NEO-FFI that I was using (from 2003) is now out of print and has been updated with the NEO-FFI-3.   Is anyone aware of the differences between the two versions? I can't really find much information on the change between the two, so I assume they're not significantly different? "
444,What forms of human thinking are present on animals and protohumans?,"General idea   I'm trying to see what characteristics of human thinking  are present on animals and protohumans. In other words, how our thought depends on previous forms of intelligence  (because of evolution and particularly that of brain structure, I suppose).  Background and problem   Some days ago someone said on the streets:     Measuring means comparing.   And it became clear to me that comparison is fundamental for the way we relate to the world, for the way we think and see he world. Why A is bigger\taller\better that B?  Another way we relate through the world is by analogy.  Analogy and for extension metaphor are on the beginnings of language; comparison between one thing or another seems also ancestral. So there are two ways of thinking that might be identified with animals thinking.   The question   Are those ways of thinking present in earlier human beings or monkeys?     I don't expect a complete answer but some help for me to start. Links\recommendations of videos, essays, papers orr short books are very welcome. (I don't believe in long texts, I apologise for this) "
445,Is this an example of objectification?,"Here is the scenario:  A man and a woman meet at a conference. During a small talk, the man says ""I will try to determine the sport you played by looking at your body type."" Then he backs up, looks at the woman from the top to the bottom and says ""you probably played tennis.""  After the event, the woman says that she was objectified and avoids the man for the rest of the conference.  Questions:  1) Is the behavior of the man an example of objectification?  2) Is the behavior of the man an example of sexual objectification?  3) Was the man's behavior sexist?  Any help/comment/opinion would be greatly appreciated. "
446,Do we know a priori any rules about the world?,"1) Is there any set of rules that human beings or, more generally, other sentient living beings know a priori before any learning process? In other words, do sentient living beings always were born knowing some causal relations about the world?   For instance, a newborn baby may not know that walking from a high place in direction of an edge may result on him falling due to gravity. Maybe he doesn't even know that he can move its arms and he only learns that after performing fortuitously an impulse that generates such action. Maybe he doesn't even know that he must breath in order to survive and he only learns that after feeling the discomfort and pain caused by the lack of oxygen.   As a disclaimer, I'm excluding here tautological logical syllogisms such as the principle of non contradiction and other axioms of logic. I'm also excluding here any synthetic a priori knowledge that can be derived from these (if you believe in synthetic a priori).  2) In the positive case, how complex can these causal relations be (maybe a measure or an undeniably remarkable complex a priori knowledge)?   I'm particularly interested in a priori knowledge about normative judgements mainly related to social mores. "
447,Rubik's Cube and building 3D visualization abilities,"I recently picked up a Rubik's Cube, intending to refine my ability to mentally work with three-dimensional representations.  But it seems there are two ways of solving the Cube: just play and play and seek patterns on your own, or memorize some algorithms which teach you to efficiently solve the puzzle.  Neither seems satisfactory, since both only incidentally will provide practice on 3D visualization, but without any guidance to focus my effort more forcefully on that aspect.  Specifically, I'm trying to improve my 3D visualization skill via the Rubik's Cube. I believe that would be the same cognitive skill that is tested as the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotations Test, although if there are distinctions, I'd be happy to learn about them.  If there's research that indicates other ways spatial reasoning can be practiced and improved, I'd appreciate that as well.  Does anyone have any recommendations, or pointers offsite? "
448,Fetish development through classical conditioning?,"In an older, fairly upvoted, but unreferenced answer it's been said that Classical Conditioning is a posited mechanism for fetish development.  One review seems to suggest that you can't ""normalize"" people this way (conditioning):     It should be noted that, as previously mentioned, there have been clinical   treatments based on the notion of pairing a CS with masturbation to enhance   responding to normative sexual stimuli, but with little long-term success (for   review see Laws &amp; Marshall, 1991b).   So that rather casts doubt of the conditioning theory of fetish development, but are there experiments arguing for it?  A bit more googling found a popsci article:     In the 1970s, scientists wanted to know if they could condition a sexual reflex in men. First they got volunteers and hooked them up to a device that measured tumescence. Then they showed the men slides. The sequence of slides was always the same - naked women, and then boots. Naked women, and then boots.      After some time, the scientists were pleased to see that the men responded to pictures of boots without ever seeing the naked women. Some of the men even showed response to sandals and high heels. They managed to instill fetishes in human beings. It would be interesting to see how deeply the fetishes ""took."" Was it specific to time and place, or did the scientists engineer a lifelong fetish in people?   But it lacks further details on the actual studies, and I wonder if the studies withstood scrutiny over time (methodology, replication, etc.) "
449,How to report a quasi-experiment in APA?,"As one reads the psychology literature (e.g. social psychology), it seems to me, and I hope I'm not wrong, that such a discipline is highly dependent on quasi experiments (correct me if I'm wrong please).  Yet, one is most likely to read ""we carried out the experiment/study with N participants... etc."", and never ""we carried out the quasi-experiment with N participants... etc."".  The idea is, there seems to be systematic avoidance of declaring the name of the design. One has to use a kind of induction from experience to discover the design procedure.  My questions:  1 - Why?... I'm a naive undergraduate and I need to know what is the design in a clear and declarative manner that doesn't confuse me.  2 - What is the official reporting procedure for reporting quasi experiments in APA (if such a procedure exists)?... Do I need to report the details of the design? and if so, how much details? "
450,Is there evidence for people being afraid of something they cannot pinpoint?,"A recent question here has highlighted a fairly common cliché in entertainment: a purported inability to identify/pinpoint the source of one's fears or anxiety.  In psychology there's an somewhat accepted phenomenon of alexithymia, the ""inability to identify and describe emotions in the self"". But is it really the case that one can identify the emotion as fear or anxiety but not be able to identify its source?   And yes, I'm aware of the ""fear of the unknown"", but the unknown (as a concept) is an identifiable source in that case; I'm not asking about that. What I'm asking about is whether the following scenario can happen in some case of psychological or neurological condition:   Patient: Doctor, I'm very afraid! Doctor: What are you afraid of? Patient: I don't know!  "
451,Ability of fixed-effects analyses to enable generalisation of results,"Is it correct to say that, when making inferrence on the results of an experiment, using a random-effects (RFX) rather than a fixed-effects (FFX) model merely makes the results more generalisable, as the quote below (from the fMRI study by Leaver et al., 2009) seems to suggest?     Random-effects models attempt to remove intersubject variability,   thereby making the results obtained from a limited sample more   generalizable to the entire population (Petersson et al., 1999). Thus,   we used random-effects models in our analyses. In a single instance,   we additionally considered results of a fixed-effects model, in which   intersubject variability is not removed.   These authors later make the claim that those brain areas identified with the RFX analysis are more reliably/consistently involved.  I'd have thought that, with FFX, it is not the case that the results are simply ""less"" generalisable, but instead that they simply do NOT allow generalisation in quite the same way, since you are not accounting for the sampling noise added by the random selection of subjects to the sample. In other words, that there is a step jump rather than a gradual increase in reliability.  Furthemore, in my mind, this sounds like a fallacy somehow comparable to making inferrence on p-values that were not corrected for multiple comparisons: it's not that the corrected values are ""more reliable"" against false positives, it's simply that the uncorrected ones are UNreliable.  Does this analogy (or some other one) apply here, when using FFX (and not RFX) for sample-to-population inference? "
452,Why do brains oscillate within specific frequency ranges?,"Why do brains oscillate within specific frequencies?   I have two specific questions:   What are the physiological mechanisms which generate the oscillations within these very frequencies?  What would go wrong if the frequencies were magically changed? I very strongly assume that this would go badly rather quickly, but I'd like to have a little more detailed information.  "
453,ADHD and the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC),"The cingulate cortex plays a significant role in mediating cognitive influences on emotion (Stevens, Hurley, &amp; Taber, 2011).     Lower-than-normal activations within cingulate cortex have been reported for several conditions in which emotional numbing and/or suppression of emotions are common symptoms. For example, a metaanalysis of functional neuroimaging in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found reduced activation in both sACC and aMCC during fear conditioning (Etkin, &amp; Wager, 2007). The authors proposed that reduced activation in sACC may indicate impairment in emotion-regulation and fear-extinction, whereas the reduced activation in aMCC may relate to reduced experience of negative emotion.   My question surrounding this is related to the fact that (Answer provided in Do ADHD drugs harm the brain?)     [Long-term use of ADHD stimulants in individuals with ADHD] appear to promote ""normalization"" of certain structural deficiences. Not all deficiences, though (i.e. effects visible on the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) but not on the left ACC).   Whilst this is a great answer to the initial question, it is difficult for me to pick apart from a neuropsychological basis.  Would there be significant improvements to ADHD symptoms with the “normalisation” of the ACC or would there still be significant problems?  Also, are there differences in function between the left and right ACC?  Plus, if there is little or no improvement in the left ACC, would the right ACC take over the functions of the left or would the left affect the right?  References  Etkin, A., &amp; Wager, T. D.

454,Is there a name for the idea that completing a simple task increases the likelihood of completing further tasks?,"In a graduation speech to the University of Texas, Naval Adm. William H. McRaven made the following statement:  ""If you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another.""  In case further context is needed, the full transcript of this speech can been seen at the following link:  [website]I have also found that completing a simple task can ""get you going"", and imagine this quite a widespread observation.  As a result I wondered:  Does anyone know if a formal name for this general phenomenon exists?  Eg ""The McCraven Effect""?  Or if it could be considered as an example of a broader principle, eg ""Task motivation bias""? "
455,Ignoring someone can be considered aggressive?,On social networks I found many people who don't answer to some polite questions. In real life it would be considered unacceptable.  I've read an italian resource where it calls this way of behaving denying. Like I deny that you exist by not answering you.  I've read that it's also a manipulatory technique used by narcissists and borderline. Can you help me to make this statement more scientific?  This other question can lead to the answer: Why being ignored is &#39;painful&#39; for human beings?  It can be useful to check also silent threatment 
456,"Is there a formal name for ""I'm right, don't try to challenge me"" / ""if you push against me I will be 100x more stubborn"" personality trait?","Some persons gets really annoyed if we try to demonstrate our thesis to them or to put in light that they are behaving in a childish way.   Dale Carnegie, in his most famous book: How to win friends and influence people, wrote that it's almost completely unuseful to try to criticize others even if we are completely right. Even if we are trying to help them. The psychological reason behind is that we hurt their self-esteem / ego.  But when does this come to be extreme? When people are extremely stubborn and any attempt to change their mind or to show a different point of view becomes like a fight with them?  (Of course this definition is usually related to some of their belief on which they can become oversensitive).  It can happen when they have a strong need to confirm their beliefs, but also if their belief is that to insist is disrespectful.   I think this trait is very frequent in Narcyssistic (which thinks to be super rational).  This trait can be explicitated both in an aggressive way and in a passive resistence. The description provided by wikipedia:     In psychology, passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a   habitual pattern of passive resistance to expected work requirements,   opposition, stubbornness, and negativistic attitudes in response to   requirements for normal performance levels expected of others. Most   frequently it occurs in the workplace where resistance is exhibited by   such indirect behaviors as procrastination, forgetfulness, and   purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by   authority figures, but it can also occur in interpersonal contexts.  "
457,ADHD Symptoms Emerging in Adolescence or Young Adulthood,"I recently read a fascinating article about the pattern of young women receiving ADHD diagnoses after first displaying symptoms in their late teens or early twenties, typically corresponding to college and post-college years. While very interesting, it was written from an informal, personal perspective. I'd like to know more about the subject from a research perspective.   Has there been much research regarding gender differences in ADHD, specifically about different presentation and age of onset? Within this subject, has there been any research into the effects of estradiol levels on ADHD-like symptoms? I know that consensus is not very common in the research community, especially with a diagnosis as controvertial as ADHD, but I would still like to know whether late-onset in young women is at all commonly accepted.  "
458,Is there really a Shiny Object Syndrome?,"The term ""Shiny Object Syndrome"" is used to describe the tendency to start new ideas without thinking them through, especially in business.   Does this phrase represent an actual clinical diagnosis?  Are there people who are more likely than others to be distracted by ""shiny objects""?  Can ""shiny objects"" cause further effects other than distraction?  "
459,Do people who lose their faith tend to replace it with other non-evidence-based reasoning?,"I was watching this talk by Phil Plait given at TAM(The Amazing Meeting) 8. You can find a partial transcript here. It will help provide some context.  In the talk he makes the following claim:     Studies have shown that people who lose their faith tend to replace it with something else, with a different type of belief. If you start out religious and lose your faith in God, you’ll replace that with something else, some other non-evidence-based reasoning.   My questions:  Q1: Which studies is he referring to?  Q2: How much evidence is there to support the claim ? "
460,What is the source for the W3C's Contrast Ratio formula?,"The Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has a formula for the contrast ratio of any two arbitrary colors, which they use to set minimum standards for text legibility: [website]Step 1 of the process is relatively straight-forward - it uses a well known conversion from sRGB to XYZ and keeps the Y component for the next step. Step 2 is the same for the second color.  My question comes in step 3, where the ratio is determined as (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05) with L1 and L2 being the luminances of the lighter and darker colors from steps 1 and 2. Where does the magic constant 0.05 come from? It's obvious that some constant offset is needed, otherwise pure black would have infinite contrast against every other color. But how is it derived?  Also, does this contrast ratio reasonably describe how easy it is to discern text against a background? Or is there a different formula that would be better?  I ask because it seems to favor black over white - where I see better results with white text, the formula suggests black is better. I'd like a clearer understanding. "
461,What is a semantic cognitive map?,"Based on: J. P. Carvalho, ""On the Semantics and the Use of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps in Social Sciences"" (WCCI, 2010 -- PDF) and Richard Dagan's web page Cognitive Mapping.  A cognitive map consists of nodes representing concepts and ties indicating relationship between the concepts.  In Carvalho section IV, the semantics is used in perspective of the presented model. Dagan's definition of semantic map is that it is a tree like structure branching from a main concept.   Also, the answer [website]I am unable to find significant difference between concept map and semantic map. Can somebody please explain in simple language? Thank you "
462,How do laypeople form a judgment that another person is smart or intelligent?,"I am curious: When do we label a person as being 'intelligent', 'smart' or 'clever'? This is subjective, and it seems unlikely that it is possible to reach a bulletproof definition. A high IQ has been used for some time, but it seems that taking IQ tests is a learnable skill as any other, see 1 (other sources contradict this fact, however, see 2). But when do we say when somebody is 'smart'? It is not rare to hear people utter 'Wow, he's really smart!'. Does he have a high IQ score? Does he know all the capitals of all countries in the world? Does he play piano extremely well, have a Ph.D. in mathematics or paint incredibly beautiful paintings?  So the question is:  How do laypeople form a judgment that another person is smart or intelligent?  References:   [website][website]"
463,Are there NP-Hard or NP-Complete problems that humans a really good at solving?,"It has been noted that humans are good at solving the travelling salesmen problem under certain constraints. Are there other NP-hard or NP-complete problems that human beings are good at solving? Has there been other research (psychological, neurobiological) on this?  One lead I'm currently investigating is how humans are good at playing Minesweeper, despite the fact that is it is NP-Complete. "
464,What is the difference between biological and artificial neural networks?,"I read that neural networks are of two types: a) Biological neural networks b) Artificial neural networks (or ANN)  I read, ""Neural Networks are models of biological neural structures,"" and the biological neural structure referred to the brain in the context of that text. Is the brain called a biological neural network? If not, what is the difference between the two terms? "
465,How does the frequency of a visual stimulus affect the steady-state visually evoked potential?,"I want to make a project for EEG signal processing, and in my research I found the concept of SSVEP, which means that if you have a stimulus with low frequency applied to the eye, the electrical activity (measured via EEG) of the brain will change.  My question is whether is it known how the electric activity of brain will change? And a second thing, does it mean that each frequency applied the eye has a fixed reaction for the brain? "
466,"Is attraction between two people just physical, not neurological/psychological?","In the Richard Morgan's sci-fi debut Altered Carbon, the technology exists to separate a person's consciousness and put it into another body or ""sleeve"". The protagonist Takeshi Kovacs, is downloaded into the sleeve of Elias Ryker, who was romantically involved with Kristin Ortega before his own consciousness was put in storage. Kovacs, through Ryker's body, is attracted to Ortega, and the two become a pair. Then, when Kovacs leaves Ryker's body, he no longer feels attracted to Ortega, and suggests that this is because the attraction was between Ryker and Ortega's bodies, not their minds.  The question is, is there anything to support this notion that attraction is purely physical? Is the brain involved at all in sexual/romantic attraction, and if we separated the mind from the body, do we think that we would still have the same feelings? "
467,What are the neurobiological factors associated with intelligence in animals?,"For example, is there a well-defined relationship between ""number of neurons in the cortex"" and some measure of ""intelligence"" in animals?  I'm familiar with the encephalization quotient - that is, ""the ratio between actual brain mass and predicted brain mass for an animal of a given size,"" which is hypothesized to be a rough estimate of an animal's intelligence.  Are there any other similar concepts?  Or, are there any brain structures or measures of complexity that are only present in ""higher functioning"" animals? "
468,Is there a way to make oneself more sleepy?,"Background motivation: Is there is a way to correct sleeping patterns to go to bed at least at midnight, not later than that? If I do not feel tired/sleepy enough, can I ""prime"" or ""cheat"" myself to fall asleep earlier?  Is there any kind of method that works for someone who is not tired enough to fall asleep? I tried waking up earlier, but then when I get tired too early during the day and decide to wait for a time to sleep, somehow I get energized again. I get a new kick of energy, and I'm not sleepy until 2 AM again.   General question:   Are there any effective methods for moving the time you fall asleep back by a few hours? Are there any effective methods for falling asleep when you are otherwise not tired?  "
469,What is the name of the condition where you feel like you have been somewhere before?,"It happens many times when you visit a place you have never been before, you feel subconsciously you have been there already. And the events and people you are meeting and experiencing have already taken place sometimes back and you are just re-experiencing it.  What is this condition called? Is there any scientific study on the same? "
470,Does referring to each other by number in group meetings lead to better results?,I've learned that the pilots of the Red Arrows never refer to each other by name but by number in the briefing room in order to avoid conflict. Is there a name for this trick? Do any studies say this kind of psychological trick leads to better results? Are there any applications in other fields? 
471,What to do when you have a speed-accuracy trade-off in your data?,"Many studies report that a speed-accuracy trade-off (SATO) did not occur in the data since there is a positive correlation between RTs and error rates. In other words, people took longer to respond for the trials that were more difficult, i.e. the same that elicited more errors on average, rather than trading speed for accuracy or vice-versa, a participant behaviour seen as undesirable. The absence of a SATO is then strongly indicative of a participant having given their best during the task, i.e. correctly following the usual instructions to give fast but accurate responses. A certain level of skill is then said to characterise a particular SATO curve, and this parameter of the curve can change as people become better at the task.  However, rarely if ever have I seen papers that DO report a SATO, i.e. a negative correlation betewen RTs and error rates, or, in other words, participants that remained at a relatively constant level of skill but simply moved ""up and down"" their SATO curve. Clearly this is not a sign of ""good data"", but still, what is the correct analysis to perform in such situations, assuming that you can't just proceed to do analyses on RTs and error rates the way you normally do (in the absence of a SATO)?  Also, the above two paragraphs refer to the cases where a RT-errors correlation exists and is positive (1st para) or negative (2nd para). But what if there isn't a significant correlation at all?  A good paper discussing this phenomenon is Pachella's 1974 Unclassified US Air Force paper The Interpretation of Reaction Time in Information Processing Research. However, I don't believe it addresses my questions above.  References  Pachella, R. G. (1974). The interpretation of reaction time in information-processing research.

472,Can drawing a duck define a person's hemispheric dominance?,"When I was on 7th grade, our math teacher asked every one of us to draw a duck. In the class of 34 students, a large portion of the students drew a left-facing duck.      The teacher said that it’s a simple test to figure out if a person is either right or left-brain dominant. So the people who drew a duck facing to left is a right-brainer, and vice versa. Apparently this Duck-test was quite popular in middle school.  Some even say, people who often draw a duck who faces left side is a left brain (instead of right). Although some says it's just muscle memory/ tendency.   My question is- is this mini test legit?  Can you get a glimpse of someone's brain dominance by drawing a duck? "
473,Does the brain's reward system also work when the reward comes before the experience?,"Here's how I understand how the brain rewarding system works, as described by behaviorism:   When I eat a chocolate after learning, there's a chance that I'll connect the learning with the pleasurable experience of eating chocolate, which can eventually make me love learning.   Does this mechanism work even when I eat the chocolate before the learning? Is the brain connecting of cause and effect time-dependent? "
474,Cultural psychology: Japanese culture and meaning systems,"I'm writing a paper for my cultural psychology course. The paper is about Japanese child care, focused on the moral and cognitive development of Japanese children from their own traditional/cultural perspective. It is mostly an archival research on Japanese culture which I am supposed to write up and present as a realist ethnography.    Is there any place online where I can conduct an interview with Japanese people who reside in Japan and are familiar with their own culture.  How can I identify actions, activities, and goals of the culture in order to construct a meaning system so as to understand and interpret the relationship between the actors (culture), tools (e.g., appraisal of the child's actions), activities, scripts, and goals? Do you have any tips on how to write an ethnography?    "
475,"Standard Academic set of emotions, and cognitive functions","As far as modern psychology is concerned, do we have a ""standard"" set of emotions agreed upon by academics? For example, happiness, anger, sadness, etc. Is there a single list that contains all emotions?    Also please pardon my novice understanding of psychology for this next question, but is there also a standard set of cognitive functions?  For example, Carl Jung proposed the following:   Extroversion: An attitude defining the self in accordance to the standard of the external world.  Introversion: An attitude defining the outer world in accordance to the standard of the self.  Intuition: Abstract perception of the environment.  Sensing: Concrete perception of the environment.  Thinking: Impersonal assessment.  Feeling: Person-centered assessment.  Is there a more modern understanding of these functions? And has academia been able to agree on a particular set?  "
476,What's the correct way to use 'schadenfreude' to describe a person who has/uses/suffers from it?,There are examples at dictionary.com on uses of 'schadenfreude'.  But what is the correct way to describe a person that has/uses/suffers from schadenfreude as part of a personality disorder/mental illness?  She suffers from schadenfreude? She's diagnosed with schadenfreude? She delights in schadenfreude? (probably not as the word itself tells us of the delight) She engages in schadenfreude? She commits schadenfreude?  I've no idea how to describe someone's mental illness where the primary symptom of this illness is schadenfreude.  What is the correct way to say this?

477,Is autism caused by genetics?,"Is autism and Asperger's syndrome caused by genetics or some other factor such as the environment?   I am aware about the Neanderthal Theory of autism, Asperger and ADHD, but am not interested in this due to it appearing too broad and to me seems based off of opinions like preferring the cold to the heat which is not always the case, a the term ""lack of social life"" seem's very broad and not clear nor specific in the aspects of socializing that they are not good with. The aspect of having big brains is also very broad and does not cover in any detail about what it means by that, however if it means intelligence then this is a development from back when we needed to hunt for food as we started to create things and fleeing particular pray on sight became instinct. The section about being meat eaters does not conclude anything as many autistic people are vegans the same as neurotypicals so does not lead us anywhere. The section about woman being more submissive sexually is also not conclusive as most autistic people are asexual so there is no real dominance by both genders as most do not even partake in sexual activities. The graphs included are also questionable as they all seem to be in favor for aspies as they score higher on everything which i would say for things like the chances of having OCD they would be very much correct as the chances of having this when on the spectrum is 40 times more likely. A lack of organization is mentioned which to me does not seem right i feel that we over plan and organize. These category's specified do not cover everyone on the spectrum so therefore is not conclusive.  "
478,What genetic polymorphisms are linked to aggression or violence?,"Anecdotally, there are reports of varenicline causing agression, but larger studies tended towards the finding of no effect over controls.  This got me into thinking about possible genetic polymorphisms that are implicated in aggression. Varenicline acts as a partial agonist of α4β2-nicotinic receptors -- maybe if you did a study of a prison population, you'd find those some polymorphism in this receptor among those incarcerated for a violent crime? (There isn't).  More broadly, are there any good candidate genes implicated in aggression/violence? "
479,What would be areas of ethical or safety concerns with a smartphone app interacting with people sleeping?,"The BBC News article Hi-tech dreamcatcher defeats sleep amnesia mentions a recent talk by Adam Haar Horowitz and then describes some limited tests of an apparatus called Dormio at the MIT media lab, that detects when an individual is in hypnagogia and then initiates interaction with a ""social robot"" rather than another person.  The interactions can include ""verbal"" prompting and suggestions by the robot!     The Dormio gadget is connected to a smartphone app or robot, which speaks word prompts to the subject as they slip into deeper sleep. These words can be used to influence their dreams or to knock them back into lighter sleep.      ""We have found that in the subjects we tested, those words reliably entered the hypnagogic dreams as dream content,"" said Mr Horowitz.      ""After this slight wake-up, we initiate a conversation about dream content with users via the Jibo social robot and record anything that is said, as hypnagogic amnesia is reported and we don't want people forgetting their useful ideas.""      After this conversation, the system lets users drift back towards sleep, interrupting again when the biosignals suggest they are falling into deep sleep.      ""This is done repetitively to intercept dreams and extract dream reports,"" said Mr Horowitz.   The BBC article notes some skepticism:     Antonio Zadra, a psychology professor at the University of Montreal, believes that dreams are designed to be forgotten.      ""We spend six years of our lives dreaming, of which we only remember a small sliver. If we were meant to be remembering more, that would be a colossal waste of time,"" he said.   as well as a bit of foreboding by Horowitz himself:     Mr Horowitz admits there are ethical questions that need to be thought about before engaging with this enigmatic part of our daily routine.      ""How much of yourself do you want to access?"" he ponders.      ""How much power do you want to have there? How much do you want to be careful about messing with your own biosignals?""   The idea of letting your own potentially internet-connected smartphone interact with you in your sleep (during hypnagogia), while Siri, Cortana, Alexa, or even hackers may be running at the same time just seems slightly frightening to me.   While there may be various guidelines and even regulations that apply to scientific medical research, this is MIT's media lab, and the indirect results  could include someone selling a gizmo you buy on Amazon and connect to your phone and then go to sleep.  Question: Based on current understanding and ethical principles regarding interactions between sleeping subjects and human researchers or experimental apparatus, what would areas of ethical or safety concerns be about allowing a phone to interact with sleeping subjects?  "
480,Is there a relation between the ability to recognize faces and the number of people one meets daily?,Does the average number of different people one sees daily affect one's ability to recognize faces?   Compare a person who lives in a crowded city (and thus sees many different faces daily) with a person who lives in a small community like a village and sees few people daily (all of them familiar). Based on this alone would the general ability to recognize faces be different?   Has there been any research done on this topic? 
481,Are there any benefits to having Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?,OCD is a chronic mental health disorder. It is a major handicap when trying to lead a normal life.  But are there any positive effects of having the disorder? Is there any such thing as high functioning OCD? 
482,"Research on how problem, presented in practical, real world format, is solved much more easily?","I read a description of this phenomenon in a book (can't remember which one).   Basically, if a problem is presented in a dry, academic format, it's MUCH more difficult to solve than a problem presented in a real-world format.  The example from the book was something like this:    Problem presented in academic format - 10% of people are able to solve it:  You have 3 cards. One side of each card has letters, the other side has numbers. 2 cards are showing - one shows an A, the other shows a 3. How many cards do you have to turn over in order to figure out if all of the numbers are even?  Problem presented in real-world format - 95% of people are able to solve it:  There are 3 people in a bar. One of them is drinking a coke. Another one is a senior citizen. How many people's ID's do you need to check, to see if they're of legal drinking age?    This isn't exactly right, but it was along these lines. You'd remember if you read it as well, it was a very striking and very believable difference in people's ability to solve the exact same problem (logically) but just in different formats.  Can somebody remind me of where I found this, and what it's called, maybe the book it came from or something? "
483,Difference between valence and sentiment,"Can someone please clarify for me the difference between valence and sentiment? I am from a computer science background. In our literature they seem to be used in the same sense.   Currently I am doing some natural language processing where I estimate both valence and sentiment using two separately established lexicon data sets. Surprisingly, for my data, the valence and sentiment scores are very different. Are they really the same?  The definition of valence as given here seems very similar to sentiment (intuitively). Here valence is defined as one aspect of sentiment (referring to a publication by Russell, 1979).  "
484,Are societies capable of sacrificing time and energy exclusively for the benefit of future generations?,"I was thinking on how environment conservation efforts might be enhanced or enforced and I was reflecting that people have to develop a colective conscience that would allow them to spend extra time and work for the good of the community and for the future generations, and not necessarily for an immediate benefit.  The question I keep asking myself is whether people are actually capable of this mindset. Are there any documented cases in history where a society has altruistically created or conserved something exclusively for the benefit of next generations?  An good example of such behavior would be the following: the inhabitants of a region discover a deposit of gold and instead of going full force with the extraction, they rationalize thinking that the gold might benefit their children.  I regard building cities as a method for the aim of satisfying day to day needs and art as a mean to not be forgotten.  Can this type of altruistic behavior propagate even in a society that doesn’t meet the best quality of life standards and where most members are not highly educated? "
485,Are there advantages of psychopathic traits?,"After watching a fairly engaging 2016 TEDx talk titled ""Psychopaths and three reasons why we need them"" I was hoping to read more systematic/traditional research output from its author, Armon Tamatea. But looking through his publications list I was rather disspointed there wasn't anything obvious since that talk. So, in my vague summary of the talk (I didn't take notes), he mentioned that psychopaths have some useful traits, including    coolness under pressure being good at spotting vulnerabilities in people or organizations superficial charm that can oil the social machinery in many occasions   and probably some I've missed.   I see there's a pretty similar talk ""Your Friendly Successful Psychopath"", which makes reference to The Wisdom of Psychopaths, but I'm not familiar with the book... but a summary in The Guardian goes like:     Dutton's book at any rate supports the idea that to thrive a society needs its share of psychopaths – about 10%. It not only shows the value of the emotionally detached mind in bomb disposal but also the uses of the psychopath's ability to intuit anxiety as demonstrated by, for example, customs officials. Along the way his analysis tends to reinforce the idea that the chemistry of megalomania which characterises the psychopathic criminal mind is a close cousin to the set of traits often best rewarded by capitalism. Dutton draws on a 2005 study that compared the profiles of business leaders with those of hospitalised criminals to reveal that a number of psychopathic attributes were arguably more common in the boardroom than the padded cell: notably superficial charm, egocentricity, independence and restricted focus. The key difference was that the MBAs and CEOs were encouraged to exhibit these qualities in social rather than antisocial contexts.   Of the one more clearly identified research, the analogy with the CEOs sounds a bit doubtful to me in view of research of Fred Kiel finding the opposite being true, i.e. psychopathic-like CEO traits producing negative outcomes in business. So, yeah, I'm curious of the meta-analytical status of such claims, assuming there's enough research for review-like works.  Is there some systematic research that finds there [or other potentially desirable traits] are really more common in psychopaths? Of course for some of the traits one needs to ask ""advantageous for who?"" or ""in what context?"", because they may be advantageous in the short run for the self, but might harmful for society/others, so there may be negative consequences for the self in the long run as a result. So I'm guessing a more sophisticated question would be if there's some kind of evolutionary stable strategy that favors a percentage of psychopathic traits... "
486,Is there any publicly available algorithms for Neurofeedback using EEG?,"How do these software work? Is there a clear algorithm I can follow to make one by myself?   I can make software for Mac, Web and Mobile. I also have two EEG headsets: Emotiv Epoc and Neurosky MindWave Mobile. I can connect with these, record EEG and so on using Python and Objective C. But I cannot find out how a Neurofeedback software decides when and what to modify in an audio or video play back to train the brain. "
487,"The article ""Vector reconstruction from Firing Rates"" of Abbott and Salinas","Is anyone familiar with this article?  I am reading it, and it is basically very clear. But still, some points are not clear to me.  For example, how is equation (7.1) in page 12:     [tex]   It it said there that      ""By rotational invariance, the correlation matrix element [tex] and the corresponding inverse element [tex] can only depend on [tex]"".   Does anyone here, by any chance, know what is ""rotational invariance""?  Thank you! "
488,Could brainwaves be the fenomena gives rise to consciousness,"I have speculated for a long time that brain waves could be the ""location"" of human consciousness or indeed the ""soul"". My argument for this is the following:   They vary with different states of consciousness, like dreaming. They cover the brain as a whole and have provides coherence like the perception of time I heard about an experiment with a man with severe secures that had his brain cut of in two with no neural connections. He didn't get a split personality and could perform functions that involved both halves of the brain. That told me that there couldn't be a completely neural explanation to consciousness. So which other mechanism do we know that could bridge that gap and provide a coherent self awareness combining the two brain halves: brain waves. They may appear simple on the outside of the scull but on the inside they could display very rich characteristics. Neural nets does not have brain waves and doesn't exhibit any signs of consciousness even though they have some kind of intelligence.    What kind of experiment could validate this hypothesis?   What does research say on this matter?  What do you think about this idea in general? "

490,What psychological disorders have frequent and rapid anger outbursts?,"I'm interested in the mechanism behind a personality that can outburst anger rapidly and consistently for a long period. I've done some research and stumbled upon this issue described by multiple different people, typically about a female rejecting her partner, which makes me think it has some biological basis.  Within a certain time after a relationship starts, 6 months to 4 years an otherwise very desirable woman starts to have explosive anger outbursts over trivial issues and big issues alike. The words spoken and faults given during these temper outbursts does not matter, yet they follow a remarkably similar pattern:   very rapid onset (15 seconds or less from baseline to angry) and long duration (up to 3 hours to flare up again) near total suppression of logical ability (will not see logic or reason) total shut down of empathy (makes very hurtful comments, emotionally abusive) significant drop in self awareness (can't see that acting like this is not appropriate and feels self justified) perception changes (you ALWAYS do that, you NEVER do this) does not want to be touched and actively rejects attempts at physical comforting pushes the man out or continues the episode till the man can't take it any more and leaves poor recollection of what happened during the episode later likely to occur after 1 month of cohabitation, and can occur within days of having sex   I've additionally gathered that men in these relationship assume more ""feminine"" role, while women are more ""masculine"". I've seen reports of a man bending over backwards to please such woman for years, yet this does not help.  Otherwise the couple say they still love each other and can function normally.  The almost universally given advice is: run, flee, end it. So it appears that behavior is aimed at and quite successful at forcing separation.  Question: Is this some kind of personality disorder? Is there a more scientific term I can use to look up this behavior?   UPDATE: since the question is closed, I will add answer here, as it took me a long time to find relevant info.   The mechanism described here is a clearly observable, biological, cyclical in nature, but it is only a tip of the iceberg of a cluster B personality disordered woman.  This pattern of violent outbursts and push/pull dynamics is consistent with borderline personality disorder About 75% cases of BPD are female. I'm amazed at how many books are written on the subject by people who survived relationships with these women. (the male opposite is narcissistic personality disordered men, who deal just as much damage to women)  BPD/NPD has also been described as extremely low agreeableness and emotional stability on big 5 personality traits. During the courtship period, the undesirable traits are obfuscated from the potential partner (so woman who's more disagreeable than 95% of people may look like only 75% disagreeable). That's a major difference which is the cause of much unhappiness in such relationships.   BPD women are quite numerous are prone to emotionally violent anger outbursts, ""Projecting"" undesirable qualities onto the partner as a mechanism of self defense and avoiding any attempts to point out the pattern. Anecdotal evidence from countless sources suggests it is impossible to argue with a borderline disordered woman, or convince her to get help, as it results in the following:   Projection or blame shifting onto the partner Threats of separation Emotional abuse ""Circular arguments"" that solve nothing   Sometimes these women experience moments of clarity, which only confuse the partner. These moments do not last long. Anecdotal evidence suggests BPD women are very resistant to therapy, and I've read accounts of up to 15 years of seeing psychiatrists/psychologists pass without any change.  It is common for the partner to somehow start accepting blame/fault for these violent outbursts, resulting in a lot of frustrated, depressed and beat up partners and husbands. "
491,Where are intrinsically bursting neurons found in the mammalian brain?,"There are neurons in the brain that exhibit bursting behaviour. In some cases, this is due to interactions with the surrounding neural network. In other cases, it is due to intrinsic biological properties of the neurons.  In the case where it is intrinsic, where are these neurons found in the brain and what function to do they serve? How is their intrinsic bursting behaviour identified? "
492,What tradeoffs are there between internal and external validity?,"I was reading through an article about research design. The authors gave an example on the relation between internal and external validity which I thought might be an important area of consideration when designing research proposals.      ""A restricted study population (and exclusion criteria) may limit bias   and increase the internal validity of the study; however, this   approach will limit external validity of the study and, thus, the   generalizability of the findings to the practical clinical setting.   Conversely, a broadly defined study population and inclusion criteria   may be representative of practical clinical practice but may increase   bias and reduce the internal validity of the study.""   Broadly speaking, what questions can be asked to help decide one should strike a balance between the internal and external validity in our research proposal designs? Is it necessary then to carry out a pilot study first to establish some level of internal validity before moving on to establish external validity in a much bigger and formal follow-up study?

493,Can I use Mechanical Turk for a longitudinal study?,"My thesis looks at depression and social support. My design involves participants answering taking a survey every other day for a total of 10 times. Is is the same set of questions that they will answer each time, but I need to see how the responses change over time.  1) Is it possible to set up such a 10 part study on Mechanical Turk, where they will have to return every other day to take the next part?  2) If yes, will have to pay them as they finish each part, or can I pay them when they finish the whole study? I was also wondering if it might be possible to pay a bonus amount to those who finish the whole study - as an incentive to keep coming back each day.   2a) How much should I pay them each time? The survey consists of 23 rating questions on a 5 point Likert scale. I tried it and it took me a little less than 4 minutes.  3) Also, is it possible to accept their answers but only pay the ones who finish the whole study? Because I will be discarding the participants with missing data from my study anyway.  4) The survey results will be anonymous but it is a diary study of sorts. So, I need to be able to connect participants' responses from one day to the next. Will Mechanical Turk allow me to generate a specific code for each participant? Or does each worker already have a code?  5) What survey platform do you suggest I use for setting up my study? Will google docs work?  6) I read somewhere that Mturk workers don't like giving out their emails. But I need to be able to send them emails everytime the responses are due. Will Mechanical Turk allow for this? "
494,Epigenetics and serotonin (amygdala threat response)?,"In this article it states that:     Increased promoter methylation of the serotonin transporter gene   predicted increased threat related amygdala activity.   I'm finding this somewhat difficult to understand. Increased promoter methylation would imply that the serotonin transporter gene is less expressed, so less serotonin is taken up by the presynaptic neuron, leading to increased serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. Surely the increased serotonin levels would lead to decreased amygdala response to threat? After all, selective serotonin reputable inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat anxiety disorders and depression by reducing uptake of serotonin and increasing serotonin levels as well.  It seems like these two are suggesting two contrasting effects for the same cause? Have I misunderstood something? "
495,What is forward masking,"I am trying to understand what is visual masking (or more specificaly forward masking). I have read the explanation here, but still..  I understand that a background can interfere with a frontal visual stimulus. Anyone knows that. If I use whithe letters on white page I will see nothing. But, I assume the definition has more then that.. for example, in here, in figure 1b, are they describing an experiment? If yes' then what is the experiment? I mean, what is the stimulus, what is the masking, what is the experiment question, and what is the result (I assume that there are known results to what the figure is describing...)  Thank you!! "
496,Is it possible for any arbitrary able bodied human to develop exceptional cognitive talent & genius across multiple disciplines?,"Can any arbitrary [able bodied] human become a genius across multiple disciplines or at least one discipline assuming that they have some Secondary Eduction in  these disciplines?    For example, the Graduate Management Admission Test assess (1)analytical, (2)writing, (3) quantitative(maths), (4) verbal, and reading skills of candidates. In order to get admission to Major B-Schools around the world, candidates have to excel in all the above mentioned 4 sections. The average GMAT scores of Harvard, Yale, Chicago and NYU’s is very high at 720 or more.  Similarly for admission to engineering colleges like MIT or Caltech a candidate has to secure a minimum of A grade in Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry at the undergrad level so that the average GPA is at least 4.13  Therefore,is it possible for any individual to develop exceptional cognitive talent and genius across all these subjects/topics (like Maths, Physics, Analytical etc) or at least one of these subjects/topics? "
497,Biofeedback and Neurofeedback: Scams or Real?,I'm currently taking an AP Psychology course which just discussed biofeedback and neurofeedback very briefly. All I can say is that I'm entirely skeptical that either one works by any mechanism other than the Placebo Effect.   How is it possible for someone to consciously control one's own physiological processes just by being aware of the processes? Isn't this highly subjective and prone to the Placebo Effect? 
498,Possibility of increasing brain speed,"In science fiction stories, we often see the use of virtual reality, a 3d world that allows you to actually 'be' there. The writers often use a pod or helmet to signify the use of some sort of computer that reads and sends information to the brain. What many, if not all, of them have in common is that time is sped up. If it isn't double then it's triple or much more. Now, while this is science fiction and far removed from any real basis, I'm curious. Is it possible to speed up brain in such cases? I.e. Would we be able to make time move faster in a virtual space?  My gut, deduction, and the meagre amount of information I found online, says it's impossible. I know very little about the brain, but processing information at a much faster speed would force a much bigger strain on the organ, thus overtaxing it. Not to mention, if the brain could actually run faster, wouldn't it have it's own mechanisms for running faster, considering it would be quite the advantage when you want to survive as a cavemen against a lion that's in need of some breakfast. "
499,Math understanding: intuitions and proofs,"I think that cogsci can help me to study a problem in philosophy of math. Consider this case (adapted from M. Detlefsen, Brouwerian intuitionism):  Lucy has the kind of understanding of a given math subject S that we typically associate with the master mathematician. John has a superb ability to manipulate the axioms for S according to logical means.   Problem: is there a significant difference between Lucy's  knowledge of S and John's knowledge of S? Is it true that the second kind of knowledge does not imply the first? Is it true that Lucy understands S to a certain significant degree), John does not understand S to a certain significant degree.  Are there works in cogsci that can help me to study this problem?  I have found a relatively old article (Arbib, A piagetian perspective on mathematical constructions), but nothing else.   Thanks very much.  "
500,Are there any precise design principles for artificial connectomes or neural networks?,"I've been reading about the openworm.org project. I've downloaded the code and run some simulations.  The people at OpenWorm have made an experiment where they setup a robot with the neural network of the worm, obtaining very interesting results: [website]It appears this could prove intelligent behavior, at least for rather simple organisms, is ""coded"" withing the structure of the neurons and the connections between them, ie. the connectome.  The first part of my question is: do we know why this particular connectomes work like they do, meaning we know how to design a connectome from scratch for a particular purpose? Or are we still in the phase of cloning/copying existing connectomes and study their emergent properties?  Depending on the first part, the second would be: are there any connectomes design principles regarding the construction of an artificial connectome/neural network for a given purpose?  Thanks! "
501,EEG correlates of handedness,"Can any one suggest a good article about features of EEG of left-handed people?    I was surprised when find that there are only few old articles about it.

502,Why do humans like being touched?,"Why do people like to be touched so much, why would it make sense from a evolutionary perspective.  I know people enjoy hugs and company of opposite sex, but even people from the same sex hug and touch each other.  I wonder how this behavior could have evolved. Was it the struggle to keep warm that drawn people physically together? Does it all have to do with mating?  Maybe there just isn't enough data to specify how this behavior started out? "
503,Can we draw conclusions about content of thoughts from neural firing patterns?,"Can the neural firing patterns of animals be associated with specific kinds of thoughts? (ie Thoughts related to food, mating, or neighborly aggression?)  I am curious about the speculations in yesterday's Neuroskpetic blog post, ""What is My Cat Thinking"" on Discover Magazine's site. The author ponders if measuring his cat's neural firing patterns upon confronting a neighbor's cat, and then observing if similar patterns appear at other times when the neighbor's cat is not present, can be used as evidence for his cat's ""thinking"" or memory of the other cat.   The author concludes, preemptively, that such an experiment would not demonstrate anything about the content of thought: ""We have no idea how neural firing relates to consciousness in humans, let alone animals.""  However, I am quite sure I have seen various papers published that use fMRI and neural patterns as evidence of particular states of mind. There are also social science experiments in which participants' brains are electrically stimulated, resulting in particular actions (grabbing of a pencil, for example), and then asked to explain the motivations for this action. These experiments would suggest that it is already assumed that specific brain patterns correlate to specific thoughts and actions.  I am wondering to what extent biologists have already studied neural firing in relation to consciousness and the content of thoughts. More specifically, can we infer the recall of specific memories from a neural firing pattern? "
504,How to tell a diagnosis from an actual state?,"Since diagnoses merely represent what a doctor is thinking, how can a mental patient know the difference between de facto ""reality"" and what decisions a doctor is planning?  We know planning is not real but a mental patient can't say that a decision from a doctor is not reality, even though a decision from a doctor is not anything that has a physical existence.  So if the doctor decides a 5150 or likewise, I'm not asking about the legal processes but how you could convince that a diagnosis is not just a model.   What is a mutual indicator for every sz or psychosis? IF there is no common indicator, how can it be a diagnosis or a condition? What is absolutely impossible with e.g. schizophrenia that is possible with no schizophrenia?  Since paranoid schizophrenia could be just a person who is worried, which doesn't exclude anything does it.  "
505,Are cortisol measures more reliable than self-reported fear measures for looking at difference scores?,"I was sent an email by a researcher with the following question:     You wrote that difference scores are okay to use if measurement error   is   minimised.         Does that imply that biological data are more reliable for statistically analysing change than say a self-report personality   scale?     For example, I've measured fear via cortisol and also self-report scale, does this mean that I can look at hormone measurements in a   difference score but not on the self-report scales?     "
506,Why does speaking with rhythm help a subject get into a trance?,"Various hypnotism teachers tell you to speak with a relaxed voice with rhythm. You can see Derren Brown on this in The Experiment - The Assassin (from 4:48 to 5:40):     Soft, rhythmical language, repeated phrases ...   Also here, in a paper from Robin Allott:     A number of elements in successful oratory can be identified. Oratory uses some of the techniques also found in poetry: sound patterns (assonance, alliteration, repetition); strongly marked rhythmic patterns.   Why does rhythm help getting the subject in a trance? "
507,Is there a learning style that involves learning best by teaching others?,"Background: I'm familiar with the more common learning styles of hearing, seeing and doing. For lack of a better word I consider myself a 'vicarious' learner which is something similar to a Bodhisattva from Buddhism only without the enlightenment part. I learn best by helping other people learn it, or through explaining it successfully to someone else. Case in point algebra never made a lick of sense to me as a kid until I was able to get my mom to understand it (she's not math minded in the least).  Questions:   Is there a term for someone who learns best by helping others learn? Are there only the three theoretical learning styles at present?  "
508,"How do the correlations between Big 5 personality change in studies examining ""faking bad""?","I have conducted several studies that get participants to complete the IPIP personality test while role play going for a job. A common finding is that the average correlation (i.e., [tex] between big 5 personality scales increases the more you ask people to fake.  For example, the rough pattern in the data is:   Get participants to complete a personality test honesty ([tex]) Get participants to complete do a job applicant role-play ([tex]) Get participants to complete a job applicant role-play and explicitly tell then to fake it ([tex])   Thus, increasing the amount of faking, increases the average intercorrelation. I'm interested in what happens when participants ""fake bad"" (e.g., specifically try to present a negative impression such as depressed, disturbed, or socially undesirable).   What have previous studies found to be the effect of ""faking bad"" on the average scale intercorrelations of Big 5 personality? Have any researchers offered theoretical explanations for any observed effect of faking bad on such changes average scale intercorrelations?  "
509,How do ligands bind to and release from receptors?,"I'm wondering exactly how ligands bind to and release from receptors. Until recently I presumed ligands were attracted to receptors through electrostatic forces with no chemical interaction involved, and that catabolic enzymes (MAO, AChE) were simply present in the extracellular fluid. I hadn't given much thought as to how they disengage, but assumed ligands were brushed off by the extracellular fluid.   However, recently, I was reading about acetylcholinergic signaling and how it can be disrupted by, and I've come to realize is that everything I thought I knew about neurotransmission may be wrong. What I've read suggests this (article linked below):   AChE is membrane-bound AChE is part of the AChR, or just happens to be is close enough proximity that the AChE can catabolize the ligand while bound to the receptor The AChR attracts ACh's positively-charged amine, which brings the acetyl group within range of AChE's reactive alcohol group. This alcohol group cleaves the acetyl group from ACh It is not until the acetyl group is cleaved that the ligand disengages from the receptor   My questions:   Is all of this correct? Are the AChR and AChE distinct? If so, how can both simultaneously interact with a single molecule given their much larger size? If not, why are they ever spoken of as different? Is this sort of catabolism-mediated disengagement the case with other neurotransmitters?  Where can I read more about this, and what is this sort of interaction called? It's been difficult finding information on this.   Here's the source I was reading on ACh transmission: [website]"

511,"Is ""Schizophrenic"" considered to be a derogatory or offensive term?","In US English, ""Schizoid"" is considered a derogatory term, while ""patient/person with Schizoid Personality Disorder"" is the ""politically correct"" term (and more accurate).

513,Why do dreams lose clarity quickly over time after we awaken?,"Right after you wake up from a dream, you seem to be able to remember most if not all of the details.

514,"What's the neurological basis for ""practice makes perfect""?","I was reading Marvin Minsky's The Society of Mind:     This (practice makes perfect) is really is quite curious. You might expect, instead, that the more you learned, the slower you would get-from having more knowledge from which to choose! How does practice speed things up?   Another related observation is that more practice also make things less effortful, to the extent that people can ""autopilot"" after practicing for long enough, like driving. But what makes this shift from consciousness to unconsciousness possible? What happens in the process?  "
515,Are desires influenced by beliefs?,"I refer it especially to what men and women look for in the partner. Of course, this is a generalized speech.   There is a correlation between the model of beauty proposed to men and what men sees as beauty. And, as well, there seems to be a strong correlation between what women search and what soap opera propose as the winning model.  Which is the cause and which is the consequence? Mass media propose what people already desire? Does this affect people desire? Can it be considered a loop?  I think the question can be answered by comparing different stile of life across countries and centuries. For example the desire of being slim (see the growth of speaking about liposuction) has increased when the idea of beauty has become a synonim of being very slim.  Link Ngram  Is there any element to hypothesize that a person's desire is bound to his internal dialogue? To his fears? To his beliefs? To what he perceive as needs? "

My experience was that my parents did the same.   I have found over the course of my higher-education studies, that my ability to delay gratification was a big factor in my ability to complete degrees in Law and Computer Science.   My question is: What evidence is there to suggest that delayed gratification is taught and learned and not genetic?  ie Did I learn delayed gratification or did I just have it? (I didn't seem to have it as a child at the dinner table). Now as a parent with my children at the dinner table, do I have a hope of teaching them delayed gratification? "

At first, I thought it's a GIF animation since it doesn't appear static but it turned out to be a static JPEG image and the apparent motion is caused by the brain. So why does my brain trick me into believing that there's something moving? Does the brain have a purpose to do this optical illusion?    "
519,What is the most common form of delusional misidentification?,"The delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS) is a condition in which a patient consistently misidentifies persons, places, objects, or events. Broome (2004) affirms that:     The most common form of delusional misidentification is not that of either the exotic Capgras or Fregoli syndromes but delusional misidentification for place... delusional misidentification tends to occur in the context of a patient believing that they are at home or on holiday rather than in hospital and may not necessarily involve close family members or other intimate relationships.   While Feinberg and Roane (2005) claim that:     The most common form of misidentification is the Capgras syndrome... this disorder consists of the delusional belief that a person or persons have been replaced by ‘‘doubles’’ or imposters.   This seems to be the most widely held opinion. Cf. David (1997).  None of these authors provide a reference (they may be referring to their private clinical experience). Can anyone provide a reference that substantiates or contradicts this claim? "

523,Could markers on cars indicating a common destination improve highway driving efficiency?,"This question is a bit of a long shot for this site but it is psychology-related so I thought I'd give it a try. This is a little thought exercise.  I was driving down the expressway toward downtown Chicago this afternoon, frustrated at the gridlocked traffic. I thought to myself ""wouldn't it be great if the people that were going to get off on an exit soon drove in the far right lane while those that would be driving a long distance drove in the far left lane."" This way we'd be able to maximize speed for those that are passing through and avoid the delays of weaving in and out of traffic for the short distance drivers. Unfortunately people don't do this, we look at the lanes as fast or slow.   In order to help ""stratify"" the drivers instead of a big weaving blob, I wondered whether or not something like a sticker on the back of the car where the color of the sticker was associated w/ how far you had to drive from the city center would work. When people act as a herd, would something like function as a little trigger? If a person was a ""red"" and saw other red drivers, would that kind of mark push the driver to say, ""those people are going where I am going. I will model my driving speed/lane selection after theirs."" I know that this depends on the individual. Could we use herd behavior to an advantage? "
524,Does a loser prefer the winner to subsequently lose or win?,"Most major league sports have some form of tournament bracket where there are several rounds of elimination before a winner is determined.  In most of them, the winning team is undefeated over the course of the whole tournament.  This question considers the losers and their fans.  Specifically, do fans of a losing team prefer that the team which beat them go on to be the overall winners (the ""We lost to the best"" scenario) or that the winning team lose in the next round (the ""Revenge"" scenario)?  Have there been any studies of this?  Is there a difference between the attitude of the losing team's players and the losing team's fans? "

529,Spiking Neural Network Simulation: Measuring and Classifying Bump Attractor States,"I am currently working with Spiking Neural Networks and multi-(meta)-stable attractor states.  What I observe in my simulations are 'bump' attractors that appear, disappear, and may wander around. Here is a screen shot from a simulation:     Dark blue dots represent excitatory neurons' spikes (fading into white to leave a trace), and dark red triangles representing inhibitory neurons' spikes.  If neurons are currently part of a 'bump' cluster, they exhibit a high firing rate, otherwise the rate is much lower.  The neurons are arranged on a 2D torus map (periodic boundary conditions). Thus, for every neuron I have its respective x and y coordinate plus the timing of the spikes.  What I want and need is a algorithm that   can detect and distinguish neurons within the bump state from non-bump states measure the average size of a bump the average number of bumps per unit time and unit map size the average lifetime of bump (as I said they are meta-stable) In case the bumps are ""wandering"" the average speed or drift of a bump   What might be a suitable clustering algorithm in order to perform these steps? Would it be more useful to convolve the spike times with a filter in order to get some rate representation? "
530,What is the neurophysiology of a thought?,"PURPOSE  1) To find out if there is evidence in favor of one of Hebb's claim. In is book ""The Organization of Behavior"" he claimed that cell assemblies are the physiological foundation of thought. According to Sebastian Seung, in his book ""Connectome: How The Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are"", a  thought is an association of ideas.      Is there evidence that support Hebb's claim?   2) In addition to (1) I want to know in which other ways Hebb has contributed to neuroscience. I have provided some examples below.      So, please leave links to research papers that support any other claim he has made.   BACKGROUND  The Organization of Behavior  ""The Organization of Behavior - A Neuropsychological Theory"", by D.O. Hebb, is one of the classics in the field of neuroscience, as you may know.  Hebb wondered about the nature of thought, and how ideas might be represented in the brain.  He was puzzled as to why the intelligence of some individuals remained intact after brain surgeries, where  a large part of their brain was destroyed.   In his book, it is suggested, that these high IQ scores were      ""due to a conceptual development which brain damage does not easily reverse.""   Given these observations, Hebb asked:     ""... what is a concept physiologically ...?""   Which then prompt Hebb to claim that cell assemblies were the physiological basis of a concept/thought.  Hence, my question:     Is there any scientific evidence that support that the cell assembly is the basis of thought/a concept?   HEBB'S CONTRIBUTION TO NEUROSCIENCE  Some of his ideas have been confirmed; for example, in ""Biological Psychology"",Breedlove, Watson, Rosenzweig, teach that memory storage requires neuronal remodeling. This finding is grounded on Hebb's observation, which was confirmed by Kelso and Brown, 1986, that      ""Ensembles of neurons, or cell assemblies, linked via synchronized activity of these Hebbian synapses, could then act together to store memory traces.""   The above observation is related to the maxim:     ""cells that fire together wire together.""   Hebb's hypothesis about how synaptic connections grow stronger or weaker in response to experience gave rise to the idea of Hebbian synapses.   A Hebbian synapse is a synapse whose strength depends on its effectiveness in driving the postsynaptic cell; for example, cells during visual deprivation do not fire together; consequently, they do not drive the postsynaptic cells. In turn, the synapses get weaker, i.e., less sensitive. In contrast, if cells are stimulated by the visual field, cells fire together, driving postsynaptic cells. This in turn strengths synapses.

532,Other studies of animals with sign language,"Dr. Francine Patterson taught a modified form of sign language to Koko, a western lowland gorilla. Much media attention has been focused on Koko, especially after her death, and Patterson herself published several papers on Koko's use of language and cognition. I'm wondering if similar research has been performed with independent researchers and subjects. I am aware that Koko taught another gorilla Michael language, but he died in 2001.    Have there been any experiments to replicate or test Patterson's publications, claims, and/or discoveries related to Koko's use of language and cognition? Has anyone compiled a study of these experiments' as a group?  "
533,Are millenials more risk-averse than prior generations were (at the same age)?,"The Congressional Institute (a US Republican think tank) has a 2015 report stating that:     Millennials were highly protected in childhood by a fortress of youth safety initiatives, which they took as evidence that they were truly valuable. This protection has translated into risk aversion in their young-adult lives: Millennials are avoiding the stock market and real estate, turning away from entrepreneurship, and are trying to plan for the long term.   The above is mostly an indirect inference, which may well confuse cause and effect. The recession may have caused some of the observed effect via lack of money. But it's also possible that a combination of developmental and later environmental condition have truly affected the psychological inclination toward risk taking of the generation graduating in the midst of the recession. After all, people do suffer negativity bias.  I did find something else (and from a less political source) that might support the inference as well, namely two surveys found that millennials are apparently less likely to switch jobs than Gen-Xers. (Generally, more risk-averse persons switch jobs less often.)     British think tank the Resolution Foundation reported in February that only one in 25 UK millennials was switching jobs each year during their mid-twenties. Members of the preceding generation, known as Generation X, were found to be twice as likely to keep switching employers at the same age – a good thing for them, financially speaking. Job-hopping tends to come with a pay rise of about 15% with each move, as well as the opportunity for workers to learn new skills and determine which kind employers are a good fit for them. Meanwhile, pay rises for those who stay with one company for the long term have dwindled to almost nothing, according to the Resolution Foundation report.      In April, the Pew Research Center, a non-partisan “fact tank” based in Washington, DC, published similar findings, drawn from US Department of Labor data. The report found that American workers aged 18 to 35 were just as likely to stick with their employers as their older counterparts in Generation X were when they were young adults. And among those with college degrees, millennials were found to have longer track records with their employers than Generation X workers did when they were the same age.   But millennials may have done that because fewer jobs were available.     “The economic evidence is pretty clear,” says Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation and one of the authors of the report on UK millennials’ decreasing job mobility. “Young people have always changed jobs more than older people, but it’s definitely the case that the rate of mobility has fallen – for young people particularly quickly, although it’s fallen for everyone.” [...]      Neither report gives concrete answers about why job mobility has decreased among young people. Richard Fry, a senior researcher at Pew, wrote in his summary of the data on Pew’s Fact Tank blog, that it may be “due to a dearth of opportunities to get a better job with a different employer.” Gardiner, meanwhile, points out that young people may be less willing to take risks having come of age during the financial crisis.    So, my question is whether are any systematic studies that more directly (e.g. via questionnaires or lab-based experiments) try to assess whether millenials have higher risk aversion than previous generations had at a corresponding age.    There's also an interesting side question here, which does however have an answer. Namely whether (self-reported) risk-aversion is time-varying (and how much). One study says     the question could be asked as to whether the financial   and macro shocks a person faces over his lifetime modify his risk aversion. Our empirical   analysis provides evidence that risk aversion is composed of a time-variant   part and shows that the variation cannot be ascribed to measurement error or noise   given that it is related to income shocks. Taking into account the fact that there   are time-variant factors in risk aversion, we investigate how often it is preferable to   collect the risk aversion measure in long panel surveys. Our result suggests that the   best predictor of current behavior is the average of risk aversion, where risk aversion   is collected every two years.   Given that it has been more than that since the start of the last recession, I guess the average risk aversion of millennials could be well estimated. "
534,How do children learn the grammatical rules of counting?,"Up to the number twelve it is simply a case of learning a sequence.  ""one, two, three, ...,twelve""  From 13..19, it's adding the word ""teen"" after a number but sometimes with certain changes e.g. ""thirteen"" instead of ""threeteen"" and ""fifteen"" instead of ""fiveteen"". (He even may make this mistake of ""nineteen, tenteen, eleventeen..."" at first).  Then we must learn that ""after nineteen comes twenty"". Next 21-29 is just the word ""twenty"" followed by a single digit.  Then we must learn ""after twenty-nine comes thirty"".  Next(?) we are taught to count in tens ""ten, twenty,..."" (the next being like the teens by with ""-ty"" instead of ""-teen"".) And we learn that ""after ninety comes a hundred.""  Now this tricky part (in my opinion) the child learns (or is told?) that ""after twenty-nine comes thirty"", ""after thirty-nine comes forty"". From this clever child deduces that ""after forty-nine comes fifty"". Maybe the child gets stuck on ""ninety-nine"".  But then the child is able (in principle) to count to a hundred and perhaps even further once it realises that the next numbers you just say ""a hundred and"" and start from the beginning until you get to 199.  Is there much research done into this? What I'm particularly interested in is which bits are taught, which bits are learned through imitation and which bits are deduced. I am trying to write a program that can imitate this learning.  "
535,Is there any evidence for the cell assembly?,"What is a cell assembly?  In Principles of Neural Science Eric Kandel, and colleagues wrote:     After this strengthening has occurred, a group of three neurons that are strongly coupled by excitatory synapses form a cell assembly (Figure E–5C). Neuroscientists generally use this term rather imprecisely. One must look to mathematical models of networks for more precise definitions, which generally have some- thing to do with the presence of strong mutual excita- tory interactions within a group of neurons. The word “assembly” emphasizes that the group did not initially exist but was constructed through the strengthening of the synapses of the neurons in the group, which in turn was caused by the simultaneous activation of the neurons.   In [1] the cell assembly is defined as:     A large group of cells that tend to be active at the same time because they have been activated simultaneously or in close succession in the past.   Sebastian Seung in [2] defines the cell assembly like this:     ... the neurons are excitatory and are mutually connected by synapses into a structure known as a cell assembly.   Hence, my question;  What is the best evidence, if any, for the cell assembly?  Thanks!

536,Does practicing Ravens Progressive Matrices tests inflate your IQ score?,I'm 16 years old and a year ago I got obsessed about IQ. I took a Raven IQ test and scored 115. Then during the autumn and winter of last year I took some more IQ tests using RPM and scored 126 on almost all of them. I took the Raven IQ test again in January of this year. I scored 126 on it. I wasn't convinced. So I researched the most accurate online IQ test and found the Norwegian Mensa Practice test took it and scored 128. A couple months after that I took the Mensa Denmark practice test formerly known as iqtest.dk. I scored IQ 121 on it.  Is it because I took so many Raven IQ tests my score is so high? Does that mean that my IQ isn't in the 120's? Where would you put my Non-Verbal/Spatial IQ? Also I'm planning to take the WAIS next year and don't know what to do. I want my scores to be 100% true and not at all inflated. Would this affect it? And if so how can I change that?   Edit: Just wanted to add that I didn't get feedback on the correct answers. 
537,Connection between sociosexual orientation and parental instincts?,"According to wikipedia:     Sociosexual orientation, or sociosexuality, is the individual difference in the willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of a committed relationship. Individuals with a more restricted sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who have a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness.   The same page suggests there are many connections with others traits. But there is no info on parenting traits.  Do individuals with less restricted sociosexual orientation on average have weaker parental instincts?  By parental instincts I mean the desire to have and grow children, the ability of being better parents, etc. This may mean that individuals who want to have more sexual partners are also more inclined to have children and are worse in doing it.  Is there any study confirming or rejecting it? "

Thus, what do empirical studies have to say about the following:   What is the relationship between practice and call centre performance? To what extent have studies been effective in controlling for task factors (e.g., whether it is a quiet or a busy shift; variation in task difficulty assigned to particular workers, etc) when modelling individual employee performance?

549,Intelligence and marriage satisfaction,"A recent letter by a Princeton alumni stated:     Men regularly marry women who are younger, less intelligent, less   educated. It’s amazing how forgiving men can be about a woman’s lack   of erudition, if she is exceptionally pretty. Smart women can’t   (shouldn’t) marry men who aren’t at least their intellectual equal.   This letter has generated a lot of controversy. But I thought it would be interesting to clarify what the scientific literature says about a few of the implicit empirical claims made in the letter.  My broad questions is: What is the relationship between intelligence of marriage partners and marriage satisfaction?  However, given the dyadic nature of the phenomena, this question can be broken down in various ways:   Is the degree to which a husband is more intelligent than a wife correlated with marital satisfaction of the wife? Is the effect of partner intelligence on  marriage satisfaction more about similarity to one's own intelligence or is it the case that the relationship between partner intelligence and marriage satisfaction is linear and positive regardless of one's own intelligence? Does any observed effect of partner intelligence on marriage satisfaction vary based on whether you are comparing husbands to wives or wives to husbands? To what extent are any effects of intelligence explained in terms of other correlated outcomes (e.g., income, socio-economic status, shared values, similar educational experience, etc.)? What are the theorised mechanisms behind any observed effects?   I'd be particularly interested in any review articles or large sample studies that have measured intelligence and marital satisfaction on both husbands and wives. "
550,How to estimate an expected effect size for a planned psychology study?,"When planning a psychological study, researchers are often asked to formulate an estimate of  expected effect sizes for important hypotheses in the study. This might be the expected group mean difference (e.g., Cohen's d), the correlation between two variables, the odds ratio, or any number of other effects of interest. Such estimates can then link into power analysis and sample size calculations.  However, often formulating such an estimate is a difficult task. The exact study has not been performed before. Meta-analyses may only be partially related to the hypothesis of interest. Various modifications to the design might be theorised to change the effect size from previous studies. This leads to the question of how to systematically integrate such information to formulate an expected effect.   What is a good strategy for formulating an expected effect size in a psychological study, particularly where the study has not been performed before? Are there any scientific articles that attempt to elucidate best practice in effect size estimation in a psychological research context?   Note: A student recently asked me this question, thus I thought I'd post it here to draw on the expertise of others. I will post my answer below as well, but hopefully other people add answers also.

551,Psychometric information on IPIP representation of NEO facets,"The IPIP (International Personality Item Pool) website provides a copy of the IPIP representation of the NEO 30 facet form.  It also provides some information comparing IPIP NEO with official NEO. However, the information provided is incomplete for making an assessment of the psychometric properties of the test. For example, I'd like to know about: (a) how items were chosen; (b) what was the sample size and characteristics used to generate the comparative correlation information provided; and (c) what is the factor structure of the IPIP NEO.  Thus, my questions:   Where can I find information on how the IPIP NEO (30 facet version) was developed? What studies have examined the psychometric properties of the IPIP NEO (30 facet version) both in absolute terms and relative to the official NEO?  "
552,Facet versus scale prediction of Big 5 personality,"NEO facets and scales: The NEO model of personality has 5 scales (i.e., extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, openness, and conscientiousness). For each scale there are 6 facets (e.g., neuroticism has anxiety, hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, and vulnerability to stress). See here for a list of the 30 facets and how they relate to the 5 scales.  Incremental prediction: I am interested in the degree to which the 30 facets predict important real-world outcomes over and above the big 5 scales. Examples of important outcomes might include financial success, life satisfaction, health outcomes, longevity, job performance, career success, marital satisfaction, criminality, and so on. While each of these outcomes would be interesting in itself, I'm particularly interested in any general claims that can be put forward regarding the incremental predictive validity that is obtained from using facets rather than scales.  Statistical baseline: I take a few points as self-evident. There is a difference between in sample prediction and true population prediction. The true population regression equation can not be worse for the facets than the scales. The facet level prediction could mirror the scale prediction merely through an appropriate set of regression coefficients (i.e., some form where facets are in some sense equal within a scale, adding up to the scale effect).  I also take it as self-evident that the population prediction would be at least a little bit better with facets. It seems implausible that the pattern of regression coefficients required to replicate the scale prediction would necessarily be exactly match the best population prediction model. However, there is still the question of what the size of the increase is, and how big the increase in prediction is relative to the prediction achieved by the scales.  Methodological challenges: There are also several issues around estimating the size of the incremental prediction of facets relative to scales. Adding an additional predictor increases sample variance explained even when the predictor has know incremental prediction in the population. Thus, procedures that compare sample r-squared of scales versus facets prediction models would be biased. Models that use a data driven variable selection procedure like step-wise regression to select an optimal subset of predictors would also be biased. The size of this bias would be greatest in smaller samples.   Thus, I'm particularly interested in studies that have accounted for these methodological challenges. For example, a good study might have (a) a large sample of 1000+ participants in order to generate robust results, and (b) a statistically valid procedure for estimating population r-squared for facet and scale predictor models (one possibility would be to estimate the model in half the sample and evaluate in the other half, although many other cross-validation procedures are possible).  Thus, my questions:   What is the incremental prediction of the 30 facets over and above the big 5 scales on important psychological outcomes? In particular, how and to what extent have studies dealt with the methodological issues related to performing this comparison? In totality, is the incremental prediction at the facet level sufficient to justify the added complexity to thinking and theorising?  "
553,Predicting the Duration of Future Events,"I am interested in the question of how people use/integrate previous experiences with instances of tasks or events to make predictions about the duration of future instances of tasks/events.  To illustrate: I am a regular user of Google Calendar, and I use its drag-and-stretch time-interval interface. In doing so, I constantly seem to be making judgments such as ""Event A has properties [a1,...,aN], ####.... it will probably last about two hours"". My question, then, is: what is happening during the ""####"" stage of this process?  **EDIT: To avoid confusion, I would like to make clear that I am interested in cases where an agent is facing an ""instance"" of a ""type"" of event (if you imagine that the agent has a set of ""memory traces"" related to instances of the event, then I am referring to a case in which there is a reasonably high amount of variance/uncertainty in duration across previous instances), that agent has certain knowledge/evidence, and the agent must make a guess and/or a decision based upon a guess. I've used the calendar planning example as an illustration. However, I am asking this question more broadly, as it relates to time scales ranging from very small to very large.    This question can be addressed at many levels of analysis (in Marr's sense). I am familiar with research related to this question, such as Griffiths and Tenenbaum's ""Optimal Predictions in Everyday Cognition"", Warren Meck's ""Neuropharmacology of Timing and Time Perception"", and empirical work on human planning behaviors/suboptimalities.  Can you recommend any further readings on this topic? I am particularly interested in research that treats this problem as an inductive reasoning task and investigates the question through the use of computational models.

555,How can psychometry measure the very high IQ's in adults?,"From Wikipedia's page on Mental age, we learn that:     Originally, the differences between mental age and chronological age were used to compute the intelligence quotient, or IQ. This was computed using the ratio method, with the following formula: mental age/chronological age * 100 = IQ. No matter what the child's chronological age, if the mental age is the same as the chronological age, then the IQ will equal 100.[4]   An IQ of 100 thus indicates a child of average intellectual development. For a gifted child, the mental age is above the chronological age, and the IQ is higher than 140; for a mentally retarded child, the mental age is below the chronological age, and the IQ is below 70.   In this way, precocious children can get exceptionally high scores (e.g. scores above 160, s.d. 15), even if they answer correctly only a fraction of the total number of questions, provided the test is sufficiently hard in comparison with their actual chronological age. However, I am not aware of any tests for adults that discriminate accurately above the threshold of IQ [tex] 160 - their accuracy is even less than 4 s.d., taking into account a ceiling effect.    How can psychometry assess an IQ of 170 or 180 in adults when the rarity of such scores is 1 in several millions? Can the IQ scores of exceptionally and profoundly gifted children be extrapolated into adulthood? Is it true that that a profoundly gifted child with an IQ of 170 would score better than 99.9998% of the general population? It seems that two different definitions of IQs are used here: is there a correlation between them?  "
556,What psychological factors account for code readability?,"Readability is often intuitively synthesized. If you see some piece of code, you just know whether it is readable or not. But what are actual psychological, scientific explanations for this?   There are readability metrics for written text, but do they apply to source code as well? For example: I believe the word superiority effect to be applicable to source code. What other effects can be found while programming, that make code readable?  I am not looking for educated opinions or examples as in here or here, but for neural correlates or a perspective from cognitive sciences. "
557,Deception and nose touching - does it work for things that are about to be said in prepared speeches?,"I'm not sure if nose touching is a scientifically-validated signature of deception or internal conflict. For the purposes of this question I would assume that it's fairly common knowledge in psychology that people touch nose or cover the mouth when saying something part of them does not believe to be true.  If nose touching is encountered in a regular,spontaneous conversation, then it may be deduced that the statement that the person just made is untrue (or the person does not really believe it). For example: ""I can easily make money on the stock market"". If such statement is followed by a nose touch, I can assume that the person is at least partially unsure about the content of the statement.   Now, when I'm watching prepared talks, like on Ted.com, the following question arises: If a person has prepared a speech in advance,rehearsed it and is now delivering a prepared speech, does nose touching have any ""predictive component"" for deception? In other words, if a person touches a nose during a prepared speech, is it a sign of deception/internal uncertainty that just happened or one that is about to happen?  I know that there are fMRI studies that found some actions can be predicted x milliseconds in advance, and I'm interested if nose touching is one of things that can predict something that is about to happen, not indicate something that just happened.    "
558,What is the effect of income on an adolescent's reward response to monetary vs. social reward?,"I am asking a question related to adolescents and their response to either monetary or social reward.  What is the effect of income levels on monetary vs. social reward? Do higher income children respond better to one over the other, or vice versa? Does preference for one or the other have any indications for overall self-perceived life satisfaction?  Any links to papers dealing with the issue or even similar issues will be much appreciated!  Also, it would be nice to understand the underlying neuroscience behind your answers. What is happening in the brain? This is a very internist question! "
559,What is it called to think without language? Are there studies around it?,"I think there are two types of thinking: with and without language.  For my entire life, in my opinion, I have always thought without language. Some people say it's impossible and that we think with language without knowing it. But the fact is that I can distinguish them pretty well.  Reading the answers on [website]So here I am, stuck on ""What is this thinking process? How does it happen? It just looks like magic.""  If you ask me to describe it, I would say it is a weird mix of--well, I can't even explain it. I just have some perception of the mix of things received from memory like something operating on memory really, really fast.  I am very slow and bad at thinking with language which results in big difficulties in explaining anything.  I feel language is like putting what we have in so many dimensions into a single one like taking a colorful picture with a sense of depth and turning it into a flat black and white image.  Does anyone know any studies done on this? What is this weird form of thinking? It's hard in terms of communications, but it's awesome to feel things intensely.  Please remember I am really talking about this ""weird thinking"" and not confusing it with feelings. "
560,What functions does the brain perform to recognize a familiar object unconsciously?,"Let's say a person's brain experiences how a vehicle/object looks for the very 1st time. It would require lot of attention/focus/processing to analyse the object, extract features and train its neural networks. After many such experiences (don't know the statistics, does anyone have any clue?), when it sees/experiences the same vehicle/object, it won't need much self/conscious intervention to be able to understand the presence of it. Remember, when driving a car, how many times do we need to actually focus on vehicles/objects? Presumably 0 except for some personal interests (reading number plates, unusual activities) or trigger events that might excite us to do so (turn indicators, possible threats, unusual activities, etc.).   There's also a caveat associated with this behaviour: the brain just knows/believes the vehicle/object exists there with some minimal set of attributes, but it can't read/interpret minute details (like texts/numbers, precise boundaries etc). To do this it requires visual focus as well as the brain's attention, I think.      What brain functions are involved in this activity? What are those features that help the brain perform such tasks without requiring much intervention/processing? Is there any technical term for this behaviour?  "
561,Are there first person accounts of monothematic delusions?,"Monothematic delusions are delusions that concern a single topic (Davies et al. 2001). They are often the result of acquired brain damage and include the Delusional Misidentification Syndromes, such as Capgras delusion (which involves the conviction that a close relative or spouse has been replaced by an impostor), as well as Cotard delusion (which may involve the conviction that one is dead) and somatoparaphrenia (which involves the conviction that a limb or an entire side of one's body is not one's own).  While there are untold numbers of first person (experiential) accounts of schizophrenia and, therefore, schizophrenic delusions (which usually present as polythematic), from Daniel Paul Schreber's Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (1903) to Elyn Saks's The Center Cannot Hold (2007) and various accounts published in Schizophrenia Bulletin, I have not come across first person accounts of any monothematic delusions so far. "
562,Why dreams can be surprising?,"If we all agree that dreams are created by our own minds, then how could some dreams surprise us, since, after all, all the things that could happen in a dream are made up by us, and should be utterly predictable and be of no surprise at all?  For example, if you are awake and doing some day dreaming, you would never be surprised by what you are imagining, right?  Then why some dreams are surprising, and kind of unpredictable? "
563,What books should I study to have a decent understanding of psychology?,"Background: I am a student currently doing my undergraduate degree (Electrical and Electronics, if it interests anyone). I am very much interested in studying psychology. I have read quite a bit on psychology, mostly on PsychCentral and PsychologyToday, but the knowledge I have is in bits and pieces. I want to have a well-organised knowledge of psychology like a student who is pursuing a career in psychology. The knowledge that I have right now feels like 'Googled knowledge' to me. I am of the belief that anyone should be able to learn anything he wants to, irrespective of whether he goes to college for it or not.    Question: What subjects does a good university course on psychology have? (Yes! List all of them. Along with the years in which you studied them, starting from the freshman year!) What are good textbooks for these subjects?    [It is not possible for me to get formal education in psychology. I would really appreciate it if you just accept this fact and not challenge it. :-)  The resources that I really have to study are the internet and books. (Yes, I'll buy them.) I want to make the best I can with what I've got.]   "
564,How does subjective experience arise from matter?,"Forgive me for lacking rigor, but if what I know is correct, it is established that consciousness and other higher functions characteristic of humans are a consequence of our cortex, specifically neocortex. However, what has always puzzled me is the neurobiological basis that gives rise to the phenomenon that we associate our bodies with ourselves – i.e., why does my brain think of my physical body as ""me"" and make me care for it? In other words, why is me me at this particular point in time and not some other body living e.g. centuries ago? Why do I not associate ""me"" with multiple bodies living at the same time, or have identity at all?   A naive, materialist answer would perhaps be that given our nervous system etc., ""me"" is only a sort of an illusion created by the brain which acts as a kind of ""least thinkable unit"" that has no neural connections to other physical bodies. Still, what is the process that ""picks"" precisely my brain and my body to become ""me"" – why have I not sensed reality from the viewpoint of e.g. Albert Einstein or Brad Pitt?  I wonder if any empirical answers to such questions can be given, or at least if these questions have been reformulated to a set of more well-defined questions in the light of modern neuroscience.    UPDATE: A better way to form this question would be: if two bodies come to exist at the same time, and consciousness is an emergent, materialistic phenomenon of the body, why do I experience the emergence of consciousness in one specific body (i.e. the one I call my own) and not in another? "
565,How do humans learn to combine tasks?,"I've been reading about hierarchical learning (a variant of reinforcement learning from what I understand) and how it is shown to allow learning of a higher-level task (the main example is assembly). I made the mistake of assuming that since the paper shows how a set of sequential actions are learned more quickly when the individual tasks are learned beforehand, that the same could be accomplished with a set of tasks to be combined.  For example, imagine learning to play hockey. First, you have to learn how to skate effectively. Secondly, you learn how to handle the puck with a stick. Thirdly, you have to learn to be aware of the other players and their movement. Finally, you combine all of these and sometimes have to spend time refining the lower end skills to become an effective hockey player.  Is there a name for this type of learning and a model associated to it? Is this type of learning encompassed in hierarchical learning? "
566,Origin of group-level statistics in psychology and cognitive neuroscience,"In experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience today, with the exception of a few specific subdisciplines, the consensus seems to be that an experimental study has to be performed on a group of subjects which are considered as a sample from an underlying population. Statistics is then applied in such a way as to allow an inference on properties of the distribution in that population of a certain psychological function or feature, most often the population mean.  My question is: When was this consensus established, with which reasoning, and on whose initiative?  In my experience, current textbooks on statistics in psychology discuss the statistical procedures in great detail, but contain only a few cursory remarks on the psychological (not statistical) motivation of these procedures. They do not discuss why a cognitive scientist should be interested in a population-average reaction time, a population-average event-related potential etc. – instead of e.g. effects that are present in every single individual in the population, or a specific sub-population. Or maybe I'm just looking at the wrong books? "
567,Are sensations of turbulence after flights proprioceptive hallucinations?,"I noticed on several occasions after long-haul flights (greater than eight hours) that I would still feel a sensation of turbulence or movement as if I were still in the aircraft. These would be persistent for approximately a day and occur periodically every minute or so.  As there is no sensory input from reality which could cause these sensations, are they technically proprioceptive hallucinations? If so, why do they occur? (I am assuming the abnormality or cause lies in the brain and central nervous system as my inner ear is not infected or altered.) "
568,Can microdialysis be made in Drosophila melanogaster?,"Microdialysis is a common method to study the effects of drugs on specific mamal brains zones (mostly in rats), in order to study the it's interaction with the function of those specific areas that controls or mediates in complex behavior.  There are invertebrates who are well known for providing genetic tools to study both behaviour and pharmacology of drugs, like c. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The last one has been also used for attention, learning and hyperactivity study, as a model for ADHD.  While I found a couple of studies which uses microdialysis on insect brains, I couldn't reach anyone for microdialysis in Drosophila. Is it possible to do microdialysis in Drosophila? Otherwise, there are alternatives to oral administration of drugs in insects like Drosophila?  -- Edit: Thanks for your insights, I have a computer science background and its hard to me to try to talk with property about these things completely out of my comfort zone.  Also, I specified the original target, Drosophila Melanogaster, since there are bigger parients like Hawaian D. heteroneura and D. cyrtoloma. where current probes could be used """"""without too much trouble"""""" "
569,Neurological basis of selfishness?,"Is there a neurological component to selfishness?   Awhile back, I witnessed a mentally retarded person who was severely possessive of a water fountain, claiming it was ""his"".   I've also seen toddlers exhibit this same behavior.  Is this a form of arrested development? "
570,"Why do children sometimes not do what they are told, even though their environment supports them fully to do so?","I see many children that do (at times) not listen to their parents, or even do the complete opposite of what other people want them to do. That while the social environment supports them (with positive feedback on positive behaviour and possibly negative feedback on negative behaviour) to do what they are told.  Do we know the main drivers for why kids (at times) do not do what they are told to?  Is it their drive for freedom and autonomy? Attention? Something else? "
571,"Is it okay to use ""fixed number of factors"" in EFA after contradicting results from MAP test and eigenvalues?","I need help with my data analysis. I am using a non-validated translated questionnaire in my survey. The purpose of it is not to validate the measure in a different language and its construct validity, I only translated it for the purpose of my study. Still, I am obligated to test the construct validity of the questionnaire and the problem is the following:  When I run the principle axis extraction with oblique rotation, I initially get 2 factors-two of the items load very poorly on the 1st factor (zero corrleations), and some have small values of 0.3, but also correlate with the second one. Majority loads on the first factor and the MAP test also gives me a reason to extract only one factor. If I run the principle axis extraction without any rotation-it only suggests me to remove one item, based on the correlations with the factor, not two.  My question is-can I decide to extract a ""fixed number of factors"" and extract only one after concluding that MAP test gives me a better solution? The second question is-if I do so, am I allowed to only remove that 1 item that it offers me to remove after extracting 1 factors and ignore the almost zero loadings in the initial EFA with oblique rotation of the second item? The other problem with removing too many items is that it messes my variance too much. It is in my interest to keep as many items as possible, but only the mentioned one I think I must remove (the second one I am not sure whether I must).  Thank you so much for your response, I am really stuck because of this problem. "
572,Chess performance and IQ,"Are there formal studies relating chess performance (e.g. ELO) and IQ? I found a proposed Levitt equation (also mentioned in thechessworld):  Elo ~ (10 x IQ) + 1000  Is there some systematic evidence to back this formula, and/or propose a better one, and how well do such regressions fit, i.e. what's their goodness of fit (R), or alternatively stating this last part: how well does ELO (or some equivalent measure) correlate with IQ?  Regarding the question linked: this one is not even remotely a duplicate. The other question asks if playing chess can improve IQ. (and the answer seems to be no.) None of the answers there even talk how much IQ affect chess performance. The answer to my question is a qualified yes, by the way. Just think of the limit case where IQ were ""set at birth"", and your chess performance depended 100% just on IQ. You could still play chess all day and your IQ wouldn't change. "
573,What are a digital dementia and a pseudo debility?,"I'm a fan of Psychology.  I'd like to know what ""pseudo debility"" is. Unfortunately, I don't know what it means in English. This is my free translation from Russian.  I've encountered the terms ""pseudo debility"" and ""digital dementia"" on resources that popularize science. But I still haven't found a generally accepted definition.  This ""pseudo debility"" is the simplification and flattening of delirium in the modern world. In the past, delirium was more saturated, unique and striking imagination.  I'd like to know:   What is it? Who invented and studied it?   Links   Цифровое слабоумие: кто на самом деле глупеет от гаджетов? Псевдодебильность и слабоумие общества.

574,What is the bias that arises because a thing is way more common than the rest?,"So I have a sentence: Hence this option is free of abundance bias  I've made up the phrase ""abundance bias"" and I want to replace it with the proper scientific term. What is the exact term that would denote that the option will account for all subtleties and won't be biased towards stuff that happens to be more common?   Like for example, if a doctor sees 100 patients with X and someone who has Y (which has symptoms similar to X) comes in. The doctor fails to consider any subtleties that might make it different from X and just diagnoses X. This doctor has the ""abundance bias"" because the X was more common. You could say it's actually confirmation bias but that'll be when the doctor diagnoses based on his subjective experience and personal judgement rather than X being more widespread.  So, what is the right scientific term that would mean the same thing as ""abundance bias""? Basically, the cognitive bias that arises when a particular thing is perceived to be much more common than the rest and hence it is considered to be the only case and the rest is disregarded/not considered "
575,Is there a model for designing a tracklist to get the most engaged reaction from a crowd at a rock concert?,"At a recent rock concert, I noticed that the ""headliner"" is almost always preceded by several bands whose job it is to ""warm up the crowd,"" and that during those ""opener acts,"" the crowd does indeed transition from a sort of ""cold"" to ""warm"" state, i.e. will dance more, jump around more, etc.   During an act, the band seems to (in my experience) open with one or two energetic songs, follow up with a slower song, then play more energetic songs, in a series. This doesn't exactly follow the model of act to act transitions - wherein the ""hottest act"" is saved for last. Instead, it's more of a ""wave."" In short, there seems to be a contradiction in the planning of a concert between how the whole concert is planned, and how a single band's tracklist is planned.   This made me wonder: Does anybody have any evidence or analysis for the best way to set up a tracklist for a live performance? ""Best"" being ""getting the most positive reaction from the crowd,"" or ""getting the most energetic reaction for the greatest period of time"" from the crowd, ""live performance"" being an event where presumably the goal of the performer would be an energetic reaction from the crowd, such as a rock, metal, EDM concert etc. Asking around people that play shows, the answers seem to be mostly ""common sense"" or intuitive - ""let people rest, then give them anxiety with a quick beat, then drop the bass,"" that sort of thing.   I have found a pre-phd thesis on emotional responses to bass drops in EDM, which analysis the in-song emotional responses people feel. (pdf) This led me to a great deal of papers and articles arguing that yes indeed humans have an emotional reaction to music, which is not quite what I'm looking for.  Further searches around terms like ""concert, planning, setlist"" mostly yield results about concert safety or music education. One article looked into the different types of crowds, which might be helpful, but it seems to mostly focus on managing those crowds safely, rather than managing their enjoyment of a show.    This paper does analyse Grateful Dead setlists, but mostly to compare listening styles at concerts vs listening events, so still isn't quite a ""model"" or hypothesis on a good way to establish a setlist.  "
576,Depression Causing Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD),"Whilst trying to think of non-chemical/hormonal causes of low self-esteem when reading Is low self-esteem, a brain chemical imbalance problem, rather than a personality defect, and can&#39;t be fixed by any amount of counselling/self-help?, I have been considering Body Dysmorphia Disorder (BDD).  Whilst it is a mental disorder in its own right, I have been thinking that BDD can cause depression due to the constant upset caused by the feelings concerning the body, but not the other way round; yet the UK mental health charity, Mind, states.     No one knows exactly what causes BDD. However, recent research suggests that there are a number of different risk factors that could mean you are more likely to experience BDD, such as:         abuse or bullying   low self-esteem   fear of being alone or isolated   perfectionism or competing with others   genetics   depression or anxiety      I am asking here specifically about depression because for the other reasons in MINDs list such as perfectionism or bullying, anxiety could cause BDD in my thinking.  With risk not necessarily meaning cause, in order for the risk to be quantified, there needs to be indication from studies and past clients that depression led to BDD rather than the other way round, and yet I am not convinced of this.  What studies are available which indicate that depression can cause BDD rather than the other way round? "
577,Questions on Interpreting Factor Analysis Results and Scores,"I am trying to learn factor analysis and I thought it would be a good idea to try and very poorly ""mimic"" the computation for IQ scores with a dataset of dummy values as a way to ""learn by example"".   To start off, this is what I intend to do, and I don't know if this methodology is correct or not: I have the loadings for that factor determined. Now that I have the loadings, I want to generate a score for each of the samples. That will leave me with a population of scores that I can then standardize around a mean of 100. From there I would plot a normal distribution. Whenever I get a new sample, I can then generate a score for it and see where it falls on the distribution.  To get my results, I am using Python's Sklearn library, specifically the FactorAnalysis class. I noticed that the FactorAnalysis class has a score_samples() method. The output score for each sample is the log-likelihood of the sample.  Here are some of the questions I have:   Is my approach in generating a distribution based on the samples' factor scores flawed? How do they do it in practice? Is the log-likelihood of a sample even an appropriate score to use? (If not, what alternative ways are there to score a sample?) I have gone ahead and generated the scores using the score_samples() method for all the samples, but they range between -4 and -49. Is there a reason they would be negative? If you are only looking for 1 latent factor, is it good practice to set the number of factors to 1 or should you leave it unspecified anyways?    Here are the loadings if I leave set the number of factors to 1:              Factor 1 variable 1  0.082558 variable 2  0.107940 variable 3  0.199645 variable 4  0.612495 variable 5  0.623707   Here are the loadings if I do not specify the number of factors:               Factor 1   Factor 2   Factor 3  Factor 4  Factor 5        variable 1   0.263914   0.426346  -0.012893   -0.0       0.0 variable 2   0.297078   0.415269  -0.002193    0.0      -0.0 variable 3   0.243590  -0.005131   0.085178   -0.0      -0.0 variable 4   0.487537  -0.224135  -0.019501   -0.0      -0.0 variable 5   0.484462  -0.248173  -0.008902    0.0       0.0  "
578,Which mental illnesses are probably natural?,"Which states of mind that are classified as mental illnesses might be a natural and useful part of our brains?  For example, some evolutionary biologists have suggested that some types of depression are a natural consequence of losing a fight for dominance. i.e. In order for the loser to fit into the social pecking order he must have feelings of low self worth.   Are there other types of ""mental illnesses"" that might be natural and useful? (By ""natural"" I simply mean evolutionary selected for.) And that if this illness was cured for all human beings it would in fact damage the social fabric of society?  Another example. A phobia of spiders. Most people would agree that this is not a mental illness but a common trait of most humans. A phobia of trees is probably not. "
579,How does a female measure her own attractiveness?,"In theory, a female who is above average should reject most advances because they can afford to wait until they are approached by a male of high value. Whereas a female of low attractiveness can not afford to reject most advances.  But how does a female gauge here own attractiveness in the first place?  What would make sense is that in the fist few years of adult life a female should simply reject all advances. A process of simply collecting statistical data on her own attractiveness.   Then females who are approached at a low level during this period would become more easily approachable whereas females who are approached at a high level would become more stand-offish.   Does any of this correspond to reality? "
580,Venus effect explained in greater detail?,"I stumbled upon this fact but I can't seem to understand the websites that are trying to explain it. I could only understand wikipedia's explanation     This psychological effect is often used in the cinema, where an actor will be shown apparently looking at himself or herself in the mirror. What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but the position of the actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed in the mirror for the camera.   but I don't think my understanding is sufficient.  So correct me if I'm wrong but, the idea is that, contrary to our quick assumptions, Venus isn't actually admiring herself in the mirror but she's actually looking at the viewer (me)? Am I right?  I'm just wondering why all the other websites are talking about mirror angles, like how she actually would not be able to see her face (really?) and there's one saying that Venus' face is actually between me (the viewer) and the mirror, uhhh what? So does that mean she's actually painting herself?   I'm so confused. "
581,At what age is a human child able to learn through the spoken word alone?,"Up until a certain age a child learns through observation.  But there comes a point when a child can learn new concepts by simply having them explained by an adult.  This age is kind of like when the child becomes ""programmable"".  What age is this? And how many words does a child know at this stage?  And what age can a child be taught algorithms? Like ""To do this, you first do this. Then if this happens, do this.""  And what age can a child teach other people algorithms? "
582,Can tapering reduce the risk of sedative kindling and brain damage?,"So we know that repeated withdrawal from GABAeric substances like alcohol and benzodiazepines will cause kindling and worsen future withdrawal symptoms. Also, it appears that withdrawal from alcohol is responsible for most of the brain damage, since binge drinkers have more brain damage than alcoholics.   Wouldn't it be possible then, to take a long acting benzodiazepine or slowly sip alcohol throughout the next day to taper off and therefore mitigate the risk from this? The benzo route seems more effective because the half life of alcohol is fairly low and withdrawal will most likely occur when sleeping.   I could not find any studies about this. Is there any evidence to support this?   Source: [website]"
583,Is it just a cultural norm that men approach women for dates rather than the other way round?,"In many countries it is expected that a man should ask a woman on a date. But in some other countries (Scandinavia, or the Wodaabe tribe in Africa) it seems to be the other way round (or at least the other way round is acceptable.)   I have noticed that when alcohol is involved women are more likely to approach men (apparently alcohol increases the level of testosterone in women).  Thus psychologically speaking, is this a cultural norm or something innate.  Also, mathematically speaking, it seems that it is better that only one gender does the asking. At least most mathematical models assume this. But is this decided biologically or culturally?  (And are there animals that differ in this regard?) "
584,How to interpret HLM analyses looking at work group and individual worker effects?,"Liden et al (2004, PDF) is an example of a study examining employees in work groups in an organisation. Thus, measures are obtained of both individual workers and of the work groups that they belong too. The data is analysed using multilevel modelling (or what the paper calls HLM).   How can the HLM results in the paper be explained in a way that is meaningful for someone with only a basic level of statistical knowledge? What resources could help someone with only a basic level of statistical knowledge understand the paper?     Note: The above questions are based on an email I received asking about how to interpret the results of Liden et al (2004). I'll probably add an answer. But I thought others might also have answers, and that the answer might be relevant to others.  The abstract:     Social loaﬁng was investigated by testing a multilevel model among 23   intact work groups comprised of 168 employees representing two   organizations. Results demonstrated that as hypothesized at the   individual level, increases in task interdependence and decreases in   task visibility and distributive justice were associated with greater   occurrence of social loaﬁng. At the group level, increased group size   and decreased cohesiveness were related to increased levels of social   loaﬁng. Of particular interest was the ﬁnding that group member   perceptions of perceived coworker loaﬁng was associated with reduced   social loaﬁng, opposite of our predictions. We suggested that this   unexpected ﬁnding may provide evidence of a social compensation   effect.   References   Liden, R. C., Wayne, S. J., Jaworski, R. A., &amp; Bennett, N. (2004).

585,How to design research participant recruitment flyer to maximise participant response?,"I often supervise student research projects. Often these projects involve recruiting participants by placing one page flyers in strategic locations. The most common scenario is that the flyer is targeted at university students, there may be some small financial reimbursement for their time, and the study might involve spending an hour or so in lab.  When writing such a flyer, there is a balance between making participation sound like a worth while thing to do, but at the same time being ethical and accurate in describing what the study involves.  Thus, while I have a bunch of tips and tricks for writing such materials, I wasn't aware of any particular material that I could provide to research students to get started.   What is best practice in participant recruitment flyer design? What is a good repository of examples of good participant recruitment flyers? What are some good online resources outlining tips for creating a participant recruitment flyer?   I'd also be interested in materials about the surrounding context (e.g., flyer placement; streamlining the process between reading a flyer and participation). "
586,What causes an individual to not be able to hold all the details of a large project in memory?,"Background: First of all, I'm not in any kind related to cognitive science, I'm a programmer. I'm not even sure that it's the right place for asking my question, but I'll try anyway. So, first of all, I'll describe the initial problem that motivated me to ask this question. There are some concrete examples.   I join the programmers team that have rather big (but not huge) project. I'm trying to figure out how it works, how each part of the system cooperates with each other. I want to see how it works as a whole, so that I could say that I understand what's going on: what goes first, what goes next, without going into pretty much detail. I want to have this image in mind and to discuss the project with no need to diving into code, or to schemes describing the project, or any additional info. The thing that does not let me do this -- I fail to remember the system components, their execution precedence that may vary, and their interactions between each other. I got explanations of some project use case. Everything seems to be clear, but there comes a time when I realize that I can not hold all this in my head, can not keep all precedence of actions, the interactions between them. The whole thing becomes blurry.   I tend to see these cases having the same reason. As this reason results in my wish for better results achievement, I call it a problem. It may or may not be a ""problem"" from medical or any other point of view, but this is a problem for me anyway. So, when I talk about solving this problem, I talk about improving my results in area described above.  Questions   What is this problem called where a person can not hold all the details of a large project in memory? Is this a failure of memory? Is the problem due to lack of intelligence?  Would any of the following reduce the problem: chess, poker, solving math problems, nootropics?  "
587,Are there any rules about masking?,"I am currently programming an experiment where participants have to do a divided visual field task. In a paper about the correct methodology about these tasks, it is said that you should use a backward mask (a mask after the target) in order to avoid after-images.  I have no objection of inserting backward masks in my experiment, but I just can't find any rules about how to implement these correctly.  Does it matter if I use a random black/white pixel rectangle where the target was or some symbols (e.g., ### is often used in psycholinguistic experiments) on that location? Or should I put random black/white pixels over the whole screen?  (Location of the target/mask is not important for the participants, so a target-located or a full-screen mask does not change to the goal of my research.) "
588,Is there a variance in acceptance of conspiracy theories by occupation?,"For some time I have been very interested in the intelligent design (ID)/creationism vs. evolution debate.  My parents are both medical professionals and consider themselves creationists.  I have many other family members who are also medical professionals and believe in creationism.  While reading webpages on the subject and other widely rejected ideas, my experience suggested that medical professionals were more likely to accept such ideas than people from other technical professions.  Is there any evidence to support this?  Are people from medical professions more likely than average to accept conspiracy theories?  I did find one article that appeared to address the issue, but I could not find a free copy of it anywhere. "
589,When did neurotransmitters derived from monoamines first appear in evolutionary history?," When did neurotransmitters derived from monoamines first appear in evolutionary history? What are main the points in evolution for monoamines based on the neurotransmitter system ?   Edition  I'm interested in this area because, there is far less monoamines neurotransmitters  based neurones than based on amino acid neurotransmitters. So it seems that monoamines based system is fine tuning work of the whole system while, amino acid neurotransmitters based neurons are the work hourse. "
590,Does masturbation in men negatively affect cognitive processes?,"Gary Wilson has mentioned that porn and masturbation is an addiction that negatively affect mental performance. Moreover, there is some ""pseudo-science"" claiming that abstaining from masturbation increases testosterone. I believe it increases serum testosterone levels after 7 day. I think that pornography negatively  affects working memory.  Does abstaining from masturbation in men significantly change cognitive processes? "
591,What is the effect of Social Media consumption on self-esteem?,"I have been seeing many conflicting studies saying that facebook usage increases or decreases self-esteem.    What is the current consensus regarding the effect of facebook usage on self-esteem?  Has there been a meta-analysis?   I can see that looking at facebook would make one compare himself to another (upward comparison). This could induce jealousy. Likewise, seeing your own facebook profile reaffirms who you are. This would increase self esteem. "
592,Is actively trying to create insight inducing conditions effective in generating insights?,"Kounios and Beeman (2009) show that many insight solutions come when one is in a relaxed state. Furthermore, positive mood helps with insight solutions.    But practically speaking, is it wise to try and induce conditions that support insight solutions?  Would trying to induce conditions that support insight solutions be counterproductive because of some type of meta-cognitive process in the background?    I assume that most people who have eureka moments do not explicitly seek out to have them.  References   Kounios, J., &amp; Beeman, M. (2009). The Aha! Moment The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 18(4), 210-216.  "
593,Short term time perception affect long term time perception?,"It is known that attending to time (i.e. looking at duration) expands subjective time. So if I want to do something for 20 minutes and look at my watch, this would increase my subjective time perception. Let's say that I have a timer that goes off every 10 minutes. I predict that a day would seem much longer.    Would doing this for 1 week make the week seem longer? More generally, is it possible for short term time perception to affect long term time perception?    I know that time perception really is both a prospective and retrospective judgement. Time may feel like its passing slowly. But looking back on it, it may seem to have passed quickly. It seems that many mental disorders are fundamentally disorders in time perception. "
594,"Does the subjective experience of artificial light brightness vary for people, if so, by how much?","I'm thinking about human perception and particularly the experience of how bright artificial light is. I'm talking about dusk, when the sun has set and only street lamps and light reflecting off clouds provides light. What affects the perception of brightness of ambient artificial light at night?   Let's provide a concrete example: same appartment, same lights outside, but looking outside on one day it looks dark, while on the other day it is much clearer and brighter. What can account for such a difference?  Is there some part of the brain or some mechanism that is responsible for perceiving how ""bright"" such light is? I know of visual purple that gets produced after prolonged exposure to darkness, and is effective for seeing in the starlight/moonlight.  But it appears to me that visual purple is too easily destroyed and may not get produced under streetlight conditions.  "
595,What is the difference between psychophysics and neurophysiology?,"I'm an engineering student who is doing some subjective tests.    What are the difference between psychophysics and neurophysiology?  Is it correct that in the latter case, we have to implant to read the brain signals?  "
596,Time pressure and learning,"What are the effects of time pressure (salient vs. non-salient) and learning? Salient time pressure is basically when you have a countdown timer in front of you. Non salient time pressure would be when you have a timer going off after some preordained times (making a beep). Would the salient time pressure induce a person to do something more efficiently? Or would it be a distraction?   Sophie Leroy has shown that switching tasks incurs a cost. In particular, there is attentional residue from the previous task. Time pressure, she shows, may help with this. It provides closure to a task. But what are the effects of time pressure on learning? I guess testing is a type of time pressure activity that is one of the best ways to learn.  References  W Leroy, S. (2009). Why is it so hard to do my work?

599,Which model of Consumer Behavior has proven to have better predictive ability for complex products?,"I read about several models in Dr. Jeff Bray’s unpublished article (Bray, 2008).  Does anyone know which of them has proven to have the better predicting ability? I mean, which of them holds more evidence of predictability so far?   I do not want to  be reading wild theories with little scientific grounding and it would be helpful is someone with the expertise on the subject could tell me which has more evidence grounding it.   The models of which the paper speaks are:    Consumer decision model.  Theory of buyer behavior.  Theory of reasoned action.  Theory of planned behavior.    Again, I'm not asking for explanation. I am asking which holds better evidence.   Reference  Bray, J. P. (2008). Consumer behaviour theory: approaches and models. UnpublishedRetrieved from: [website]"
600,Is there a term for the desire to maintain a level of anxiety?,"As a war veteran who has/had PTSD, I've noticed in myself a desire to maintain a level of anxiety and stress closer to what I was used to.

I've also known former incarcerated individuals and PhD graduates who do the same.  Is there an official term for this behavior? Further reading on the topic? "
601,Why might sleeping on the floor alleviate PTSD symptoms?,"Question:  Does sleeping on the floor have similar neurotransmitter effects, as sleeping under a weighted blanket might? Psychiatrically, would it be expected that a person having PTSD would find similar results sleeping under a weighted blanket as they do when they sleep on the floor?  Could sleeping on the floor actually be a subconscious attempt at regulating neurotransmitters or possibly even to promote better REM sleep?  Background:  There are many views on the interplay of different neurotransmitters and hormones, (dopamine, serotonin, etc.), and PTSD, anxiety, depression, etc.  There is also a lot of consensus on how weighted blankets seem to help alleviate these symptoms, providing that sense of security. They also seem to be used a lot by parents of children with Autism, Aspergers, and ADHD.  There are a variety of theories why people with PTSD sleep on the floor, could a valid rival hypothesis be a neurotransmitter affect?   To be in a position to respond to threats more effectively. To askew comforts, and lavishness, in view of self-worth. The sense of security and being ""grounded"".   Article linking sleeping on the floor with hypervigilance: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Reactions.  I feel that this traditional connection to hypervigilance is not a good enough explanation because I have been observing that the quality of sleep is the same, if not better, in terms of durations of Light, Deep, and especially REM sleep.

602,"Human vision detection of faint blinking or moving point of light, guidelines for sensitivity versus frequency","This question is in the neurology/neuroscience rather than the psychology aspect of this site.  I'd like to check the limits of visibility of a (presumably green) LED at large (kilometer) distance, and I'm assuming that modulation of intensity (blinking) or position (""wiggling"") would make the same brightness noticeable at larger distances than a steady, stationary point of light.  My options are to vary the frequency and duty cycle of the pulses, and to alternately flash two different LEDs separated by a large enough distance that the point would appear to ""wiggle"" or move slightly either left/right, or up/down.  Neurologists and human visual processing researchers have studied the limits of visual detection of stimuli for quite a long time, and so the body of work is quite large and therefore beyond my scope of understanding.  Might there be a best frequency or range of frequencies for blinking or ""wiggling"" that the human vision system might be most sensitive to? I'm just guessing that it might be somewhere near the range of 1 Hz to 10 Hz, but I'm just guessing without any scientific basis.  As far as separation for the ""wiggle"" what might a best separation or range of separations that might be most noticeable?   An answer that points me to the underlying physiological phenomenon that I should read further about would be just as acceptable as numbers with supporting links. Because I'm not so familliar with the neurology of vision, I can't judge beforehand which way to cast the question.    Possibly helpful for context or background are my previous questions:   How to make a green LED as visually bright as a 0 magnitude star? How can I estimate the optical power that a single-color LED generates?  "
603,"The brain physically changes with regular coffee consumption, but at what rate does it return to normal?","Question  We know adenosine receptors A1 &amp; A2 subtypes physically increase in the basal ganglia with prolonged caffeine exposure over the period of about 1-2 weeks, but at what rate do they return to normal (downregulate)? Id est, what is the extinction rate of upregulated adenosine receptors?  .  .  .  .  Background  If you take coffee daily, you no longer get a boost from it after about a week, but rather, you're just staving off the harsh withdrawal symptoms, not to mention over time it will physically change your brain to have more adenosine receptors i.e., ""sleepiness receptors"". (Ramkumar V et al, J Clin Invest 82:242-247)  ""A 1995 study suggests that humans become tolerant to their daily dose of caffeine—whether a single soda or a serious espresso habit—somewhere between a week and 12 days. And that tolerance is pretty strong. One test of regular caffeine pill use had some participants getting an astronomical 900 milligrams  (9 cups of coffee) per day, others placebos—found that the two groups were nearly identical in mood, energy, and alertness after 18 days. The folks taking the equivalent of nine stiff coffee pours every day weren't really feeling it anymore. They would feel it, though, when they stopped.  ""You start to feel caffeine withdrawal anywhere from 12 to 24 hours after your last use. That's a big part of why that first cup or can in the morning is so important—it's staving off the early effects of withdrawal.""  Caffeine, the natural pesticide of bright red coffee berries, creates an emergency response in your body to fight it off (pooping, peeing, and adrenaline). It inherently doesn't give you energy or focus, but the adrenal side effect does. Studies show that people who have coffee 7 days in a row no longer receive any energy or focus benefits. At that point their brain has been sufficiently altered with new adenosine receptors that they are just at their baseline behavior. They found this was true with any caffeine amount, from 1 to 10 cups of coffee. The exception is after 10 cups is it just starts frying your brain.   ""You might think all of this probably takes a while, but it takes about seven days to become addicted to caffeine. Once addicted, you need more and more coffee to get buzzed as your brain gets covered in receptor sites.

604,What's the term for people who deny others' achievements?,"I know a bunch of people that are always in deep denial (at least trying to appear so) of other people achievements. It can be another country or another group or another religion.  For example, when you tell them, ""Did you hear about Mike? He just bought a Lamborghini,"" they have several type of answers ready for this situation, like: ""Who cares? Lamborghini was never good, you need to go to gas station every 15 minutes,"" or like, ""But don't you know how terrible his wife is?"" or, ""He might have stolen someone's money,"" etc.  They know they are wrong, but they say these types of things to ease their deep internal pain. You would call them some sort of jealous people, but it's not only jealousy. Sometimes when you tell them things like, ""Did you see the recent car Germany just built? It just runs on salt water!"" They come back with sentences like, ""Whatever, I would die rather than living for a second in Germany."" Everyone would be like, ""WHAT?"" But yes, they say these sort of things.  So what do you call these people? What's their problem? Do you have any advice to offer these people? "
605,Are there any models of human cognition that do not depend on physicalism or materialism?,Are there any models of Human Cognition that do not depend on Physicalism or materialism? Could Cognition models that say 'mind' states are actually 'brain states' and that we are therefore neuro-chemical mechanisms ; could these models miss important factors like how 'behavioral algorithms' of the 'mind-brain' are organised and how they interact and how the mind-brain 'makes new 'behavioral algorithms'. What I call Behavioral Algorithms could be called 'mental programs' or 'mental software'. So are there models of Cognition that do not focus on Physicalism ( the philosophy that everything that exist has a physical basis and nothing else like  emergent qualities or something 'intangible')? 
606,What's the functional difference between the NEF and normal ANNs?,"Aside from obvious biological plausibility, from a computational standpoint, what's the motivation of using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) instead of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for computing functions? From what I can tell, they both approximate functions, have the ability to learn new functions and the ability to create self-organizing networks. What makes the NEF different? "
607,Is the SPAD-T textual analysis software still available?,"I am looking for an old program called SPAD-T that is still used for textual analysis (especially in psychology).

Note that I have cross-posted the question here. "
608,Where in the brain is meaning extracted from visual information?,"I am looking into several systems for improving learning speeds and ran into a question I seem unable to answer on my own:  When we read a word, it somehow gets converted into it's abstract meaning. To be clear in my further descriptions, I will encapsulate written information into "" and abstract information into +   For example, a person fluent in English and Japanese (or Chinese for this particular example) could look at the letters  ""Tree""   and   ""木""   and in both cases convert this information into the internal representation of +tree+.  My questions are   Is my understanding of the reading process accurate? If yes, what zone(s) of the brain would handle this conversion? Where in the brain on the 10-20 System would these zones be located?  "
609,Analysis according to Jung's Psychological Types,"Recently I read Jung's Psychological Types out of self-questioning. I would like to analyze myself in such a fashion more ""professionally"", however I do not profess to be able to do that myself, having no prior education and training in psychology. I have already done the MBTI test, but after reading Jung's book, I realize that the test is not exhaustive.  My question is - which types of therapists or specialists normally perform these analyses? Do some psychologists base their analysis on Jung's theory? Is it possible to ask ""just"" for a personality analysis based on Jung's Psychological Types? Or is this theory just an auxiliary method, and does not play as an approach per se? "
610,Which statistical tests to use when analyzing NASA TLX?,"The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) is a subjective, multidimensional assessment tool that rates perceived workload. A set of different scales (Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, Frustration) are combined into one measure ranging from 0 to 100, the task load index.   Which statistical tests can be used to compare these test results? I am particularly concerned with whether or not the task load index could be considered an interval variable, and thus whether, for example, a simple student t-test could be used. In particular, is the NASA-TLX scalar invariant? Can a difference between two means (e.g., 50 and 60) be interpreted as equal to a difference between two other means (e.g., 10 and 20)?  If not, what are the consequences of using a wrong test? What is a suitable test? "
611,What is the conceptual relationship between higher order thinking and inductive reasoning?,Higher order thinking seems like a larger construct than inductive reasoning but the constructs also seem related.   What is the connection between inductive reasoning and higher order thinking?

612,Math or Physics: Which is the more relevant background to enter Cognitive Sciences and Psychology?,"What would be a more suitable background to enter cognitive sciences, mathematical psychology, and study of emotions? I have the option of taking a Integrated Masters Degree in Mathematical Sciences, or Physical Sciences. Going into which field will allow me to contribute greater to the study of the mind? Also, which field gives me more research options for the same?  "
613,What defines the easiest time to get out of bed in the morning for humans?,"I'm interested in sleep research, and sometimes in conversations with people the following idea gets discussed: ""A person becomes aware at a certain time in the morning and feel great(while still in bed). But the wake up time is later, so that person keeps sleeping and the feeling is gone. It's much harder to get out of bed"". The general pattern is that there's a perceived good time to get out of bed, but people oversleep it.  From my understanding, the second part of this statement is caused by sleep inertia, where a person slips into deeper sleep(slow wave sleep SWS) stages. But what about the perceived ""perfect wake up time""?   What sleep stage or sequence of sleep stages, if any is associated with this feeling of energy in the morning(NREM1,2?)? is this feeling associated with light exposure (ex: 20 minutes after light exposure) does it happen every day, for all people? Is there some "" deep sleep hormone"" (probably not melatonin) that gets released in deeper sleep stages and produces sleep inertia?   There are a couple very successful sleep apps for smartphones that are marketed for this principle (they advertise the ability to find this ""best wake up time"" for you) and hundreds of imitations (""smart alarm clocks""). But is there really a phenomenon like I'm describing above, or is it a rare glitch of the endocrine system or something? "
614,Can we increase our higher order thinking (HOT) skills by practicing inductive reasoning?,"I previously asked about the conceptual links between higher order thinking and inductive reasoning. This question focuses on the potential for improving higher order thinking through practicing inductive reasoning tasks.  For instances, in order to become a good dancer, one must exercise leg muscles, improve coordination, learn how to breathe and so on. Is their an analogy with acquiring higher order thinking skills?  If so, where can one find the main literature on how this process works?  "
615,"In a central pattern generator based on reciprocal inhibition, how does one ""side"" get picked over the other to start out?","Consider two neurons, A and B, which reciprocally inhibit each other. If both of the neurons receive input at the same time, it seems to me that no oscillation will occur between the two. Such would occur only if one of the two is initially ""favored"" over the other. So what I'm wondering is, how does that happen? Is it essentially random? "
616,What is the maximum number of objects an average human being can recognize at once?,"I'm wondering, how many objects can the average human being can recognize?  For example, most of us can't look at this and say how many boxes there are  without counting them:    But I think we can all recognize that there are only 3 boxes here (without  manually counting):    So how many objects can an average human being recognize at once? "
617,Neurotransmitters appearance in the evolutionary process,"Recently I disagreed with the assumption, that lots of neurotransmitters came within recent 10,000 years of Homo Sapiens evolution. Judging from the available information sources, there is possibility of minor changes of brain reaction on neurotransmitters, but first assumption seems like nonsense for me.  So, are there any neurotransmitters, appeared only in human evolution history?  Then, are there reliable sources which will connect the appearance and development of biological species with appearance of neurotransmitters?  At last, are there significant acceleration of human brain evolution within last 10,000 years, connected with social processes or brain evolution for Humans occurring more gradually? "
618,How to identify participants answering online questionnaires who have not paid attention?,"I often analyse data that involves participants completing a selection of psychological tests online. A concern with online testing is that some participants may not complete the task conscientiously. For example, they may response options at random or just click the same response option repeatedly.  In general, I like to get response times per item, as I find that they are useful in diagnosing people who are deliberately skipping through the test. However, there are cases where that is not possible.  To make discussion concrete, think about where you have responses to 10 psychological scales. Each scale has 20 items. Some items may be reverse coded.   What is a good way to identify participants who were not concentrating or not completing the items conscientiously? How do you ensure that you don't filter out participants with unusual patterns of responses?  "
619,"How to use Mechanical Turk for longer studies (i.e., 30 minutes+)?","I'm interested in using Mechanical Turk as a means of recruiting participants for online psychology studies. I have never used it for any research. However, many of my studies take around 30 minutes to an hour to complete. A typical study might involving answering a set of questionnaires using Inquisit. My impression is that Mechanical Turk works best with short studies (i.e., one to five minutes).    Is it possible to use Mechanical Turk for longer studies? Are there any important tips for effectively using Mechanical Turk for longer studies? Are there any tutorials or case studies which document successful methods for using Mechanical Turk for longer studies? Or alternatively are there better systems for recruiting paid participants for longer online studies?   In general I appreciate that longer studies would require much more remuneration probably more than just a multiple of the amount of time. I also imagine that there would be additional issues of quality control. "
620,"Are there ""6 degrees of separation"" for ideas?","Sites like linkedin.com are built on the idea that you can be related to any person in the world though around 6 people. One person knows another one, that one another one, and in the end you are connected through intermediate connections.  I'm interested if something similar exists for ideas - does human mind naturally connect and infer from different ideas to find a relationship between ideas? I'm thinking about this in the context of Freudian dream interpretation. In his book on the analysis of dreams, Freud repeatedly lists examples where he uses analysis and logic to find meaning in dream imagery and experiences.  This makes me curious if what Freud has discovered is some function of memory or thinking that establishes connections between unrelated ideas through intermediate ones.  For example, there is no connection between cats and space flight. But ones mind may try to connect them through a cartoon episode which involved super intelligent cats from the outer space invading earth in spaceships. Now there is a connection between cats and space flight.  What I'm trying to ask is if it is natural for the mind to bridge gaps between unrelated ideas through intermediate ones, especially if/when a person is actively looking for a connection? if there are 6 jumps between two unrelated ideas/concepts, then there are 6 degrees of separation. "
621,Picture of eye promotes good behaviour,"I remember a study about how a picture of an eye made people more well behaved. The experiment was in an unsupervised coffee room where there was a box where participants were expected to deposit money after getting their coffee. However, due to lack of supervision, the participants had the option of leaving no money in the box and getting a free coffee. The study had two conditions, when a picture of a plant hung over the coffee maker and a picture of an eye. They found that participants contributed more money in the eye condition.  What is the original reference and name of this study? What mechanisms did the authors propose to explain this effect? Have the results been replicated in similar studies? How does the increase in contribution compare to cases with passive surveillance like an easily visible camera in the room (but not eye shaped)? "
622,Do living beings of different sizes perceive time differently?,"Do living beings having different sizes e.g. an ant and an elephant perceive time at different rates? Is the physical time same for all sizes or different for different sizes?  Suppose There is a being existing in the intergalactic space and I am able to observe the movement of the galaxies. Relative to me 1 sec of time is the time in which I may observe the galaxies to travel with a noticeable speed,but relative to a human on Earth 1 sec is infinitesimally small time for the galaxies to travel at the same speed as observed by the giant being. "
623,"Recent psychophysical studies using the ""Method of Adjustment""?","The Method of Adjustment, devised by G.T. Fechner, is one of the three classical psychophysical procedures used to examine perceptual performance.  It came to fame through early studies of visual illusions. But, unfortunately, it is rather difficult to find recent publications in which it was used. Other methods, such as forced-choice procedures, are much more popular nowadays.  Questions        Is there a research field in which the Method of Adjustment is still frequently used, or is even the prevalent psychophysical procedure?   Where can I find recent publications about this method?      I know that ""recent"" is imprecise, but I would say that fifty-year old publications do not count as recent, anymore.    Update (Description of the Method of Adjustment)  The Method of Adjustment, also called Method of Average Error (Guilford, 1954), is used to psychophysically measure a subject's accuracy and precision in matching (subjectively equalizing) stimulus magnitudes.  Typically, subjects are asked to adjust the magnitude of a variable comparison stimulus (Co) until it subjectively equals the magnitude of a fixed standard stimulus (St). This is repeated several times[tex]per St as well as for different St's. As a result, one obtains for each St a distribution of Co's. Descriptive statistics of these distributions, such as the mean and the standard deviation, are used to compute the point of subjective equality (PSE) and the difference limen (DL).  A measure of accuracy is the constant error (CE), i.e. the difference between the PSE and the St. A meaure of (relative) precision is the Weber fraction (W), i.e. the ratio of the DL and the St. "
624,Does neuroticism go hand in hand with introversion?,I'm reading this paper on relations between affect and personality.  It seems the personality domain has been characterized in terms of two dimensions: neuroticism and extraversion.  How does introversion fit into this? There is a clear association between extraversion and measures of positive affect; there is a clear association between neuroticism and measures of negative affect.  Does neuroticism therefore go hand in hand with introversion?  
625,Islam and participation in acts of political violence,"This is currently a hot political topic, but what does the science say?  I was thinking that a good experiment would take groups of people, and match them for alternate explanations: Age, gender, socio-economic status, level of education, nationality, occupation, cultural factors, political affiliation, immigration status, etc.  (These are factors that many experiments control for when dividing subjects into groups, so is not unusual to do.)  Then look for correlations, and see if particular religious affiliations (or non-believers), are more strongly correlated with participation in acts of political violence than are other factors.  I have not found such a study yet.  There is a fair amount of research regarding attitudes towards violence, with mixed results (example, example, example, example), but these are generally not controlled for very many factors, and do not address any actual violence rates.  There is also some research on actual violence rates (example, example), but again, few variables are controlled for, and the focus is on countries rather than people.  Is religious affiliation really a predisposing factor for people to actually commit acts of terrorism and politically-motivated violence? "
626,How does the order of words influence our ability to remember a question once it's asked again?,"I'm about to send out surveys that I need for a project and these will be sent out every season - winter, spring, summer, fall - each supposedly having the same questions. It's quite likely some people partaking in these surveys will be those same people who partook in them before( previous seasons)  So I'm wondering whether a changed order of words, though not the meaning - in the questions, would result in it being harder( or not?) to remember having been asked this question before.  To put it in another way - how does word order in a question influence the ability of the person( who is being asked) to remember the question, provided it has been asked before?  I wasn't able to find StackExchange for Neuroscience, so I thought I'd ask here. Thanks in advance! "
627,"Improving observation, attention to detail in mental imagery","Once in a while I remember the whole ""use mental imagery to remember things"" thing and start looking for information about it (never actually tried to turn it into a habit...).  It doesn't take long for me to find some ""article"" or another stating that improving our attention to detail, the vividness of our mental imagery and our observation skills will make these techniques working even better (makes sense, I guess).  ... And then comes the training. Games such as Kim's game are offered, but I can't find a shred of evidence that any of these things (skills?) can improve (nothing that shows evidence that they can't be improved either).  Kim's game, for example, is used in the U.S. army  training (at least according to Wikipedia), but  I can't find any research done into that...  So, is there any basis to Kim's game, or any other game claiming to improve observation skills, attention to detail and the vividness of our imagination?  Putting meditation (which is well known for being very good for many things) aside, I can't find anything (maybe I'm not even looking for the right things. I wouldn't know much in the way of scientific in this field) "
628,Does spanking a child teach them that it's ok for another person to touch them against their will?,"The debate over whether spanking is an appropriate punishment largely revolves around proponents saying that it creates a more ""disciplined"" person and opponents saying that it traumatizes the child or makes them grow up violent.  One thing that, as far as I know, has been overlooked is the issue of how it affects a person's sense of personal physical sovereignty. Can a child really compartmentalize spanking such that they can believe ""It is acceptable for my parent to spank me as long as a child, but nobody else, and not when I am an adult.""? It doesn't seem likely to me. It seems that, if a child is conditioned to believe that spanking is a normal and acceptable thing, it isn't a stretch to believe that other entities, such as the government, have potential suzerainty over the individual.  Given that any rational person should want their children to believe that nobody but nobody has the right to touch them against their will, for any reason, would it not make sense that spanking is detrimental to an individual's psyche? "
629,Are there mental states that make the mind more susceptible to other negative mental states?,"I've recently read the following folk parable and am interested if there is any truth to it.  It is originally in russian(full version here), so I will translate the gist of it:     The devil displays his Arsenal of tools used to corrupt mortals - anger,   jealousy, greed, etc. Then he shows the ""special"" tool which can work   when all else fails- depression (dismay or broken spirit). He suggests that once depression takes hold, the mind is open to all other tools (jealousy, greed, etc)   This got me thinking - is there some equivalent of a mental ""immune system"" which keeps the mind healthy and keeps negative, unwanted, maladaptive emotions at bay?  Are there conditions that make the mind more open to other disorders? "
630,Why is it that some (yet not all) people may struggle to retain information unrelated to what they are interested in?,"It seems to me that some people find it difficult to retain information that is not naturally salient to them. This isn't the case for all people, however. There exist people that will put in the effort to retain and use information related to material that is inherently uninteresting to them, particularly in a school setting. Is it the case that the latter group has more of a conscious control over what is salient to them at the time? Is this phenomena 'traceable' in the brain? "
631,Do some people possess more or more active mirror neurons than others?,"Some people love watching people get hurt, they may find it humorous. Some people don't really like it but can watch it. Some, however, find it unbearable to watch. Why is this? Are the latter of the three categories of people listed have more mirror neurons than the average, or are they more dynamic, perhaps? Do the first type of people listed have less mirror neurons than most, similar to those with SM, who don't perceive fear, or are their mirror neurons less active? If we all have these mirror neurons hard-wired into us, as humans, why are the impacts of our mirror neurons so variant among differing individuals of the human race? "
632,Structural neuroimaging processing with FreeSurfer or SPM?,"I have a limited amount of time to analyse strucutural neuroimaging from a sample of patients. My objective is to simply extract volumes from selected fronto-parietal areas.  I have no previous knowledge on using SPM nor FreeSurfer. Which should I learn? Which has the fastest learning curve?  I usually prefer working with free and open source software in research, so if any of these two is able to plug into R, for example, it would be a plus. "
633,Do people (under)value free stuff?,"I recently saw this Ted talk by Esther Duflo, and in it Duflo tells of how she tackled the question in the title head on, in the context of health and disease prevention.  I would like to know what other research has been done to answer the question: how do people value commodities, if given for free?  The question might have different answers to different kinds of commodities, which makes it all the more interesting, but not more ambiguous.  Note that in Duflo's research, for example, the question of how to define value is clear and totally unambiguous: did people use the bed nets that they got for free, a year after getting them. "
634,Is it possible to present/perceive information objectively?,"A recent project has brought an interesting thought to mind. Hopefully this is the correct format to ask this question, as I'm unsure where else I'd receive an educated response. (possibly philosopy? Thanks Steven)  People are passionately opinionated, the subject matter carries little importance in what opinions those are. We perceive information on a cognitive bias based on more factors then I can comprehend. Information can be used to persuade, divert, reverse, or bolster the stance behind said opinions; great lengths are gone to achieve this. But, is there an example or method of presenting information that will be perceived as completely unbiased, objective, and exclusively informative in nature?   For example, if I were to erect a website that displays presidential candidate information (seems to be a hot topic right now), in a purely statistical nature (although, this would bore most), one may find some form of bias in what stats were being presented or which data group was given higher emphasis, etc.   Which leads me to my question: Is it realistically possible to display information in a completely objective manner? Even still, if displayed in this fashion, are we capable of seeing it as such? "
635,Can depression be faked?,"Can depression be faked, and for what reason would someone do this? Is there a more accurate way of diagnosing it to tell when someone is just putting it on? "
636,Can dendrite spines fire action potential toward the soma?,"I am confused about how the signal propagates from the dendrite spines toward the soma. I believe it is commonly taught that the signal diffuses ""passively"", i.e. electrostatically with no amplification during its path towards the soma.  But can an action potential be generated sometimes with opening of voltage-gated channels to help it propagate if the dendrite is very long for example?  Can we have zones along the dendrite with more or less voltage-gated channels so the signal would be a combination of both passive and active propagation?  "
637,During synchronized waves oscillation (alpha beta etc...) do neurons fire only once for each wave cycle?,"Or can they fire few times then pause and again, firefew times and pause periodically?  If  the second case happens then do we know if the neurons that fire in synchronity fire the same number of times at each wave cycle?  "
638,how to see prefrontal cortex is functioning well by a test?,"Is there a test to see if the Prefrontal cortex of someone works normally? especially a simple test like a questionnaire that you give the individuals to fill out and based on their answer you obtain results.  My next question, if someone's prefrontal cortex does not work normally, how that can be cured? I am looking for natural ways, natural medicines, or methods. "
639,Can a positive change result in positive stress?,"I have been researching the differences between stress and anxiety to understand them for my own curiosity. My basic understanding is that stress is a variation from routine or something that upsets your normal balance while anxiety is worry about something when there is no stressor.  My question, then, is this: if stress is caused by change to normal routine, would a good change with only positive effects still be considered stress? For example, going on vacation. The travel could certainly be stressful (or perhaps just anxious), but once a person arrives, lets assume they have a very good, relaxing stay. Could this be considered a stress since it is a change from the normal routine, despite having no negative effects?  I admit that most likely the answer lies in a misunderstanding I have about the definition of stress, but I am curious... "
640,How far can a signal travel in the neocortex without passing through the white matter?,"Correct me if I am wrong please, from what I understand horizontal communication spans very short distance in all layers of the neocortex but layers I and II. In these two layers dendrites and axons can travel horizontally a little farther, but how far? Also the question can have different subcases. First one, how far can one single dendrite or axon travel horizontally in the neocortex ? Second one, how far can a signal travel (possibly going through several synapses) horizontally in the neocortex? "
641,Thinking about something vs. doing something,"In computer programming, when a program analyzes itself, we call it ""reflection"" or ""introspection"". Example: A program has several features. When the program runs, it can analyze itself to determine what features it supports and present it in the user interface. The user could choose one of the features and instruct the program to run it.  Now, the question: Is there an equivalent mechanism in the brain? I.e. how can the brain think/reflect about a behavior/capability without executing the behavior/capability? Is there a special ""module"" in the brain that is responsible for reflection and one responsible for execution? If yes, how does the brain decide which module to use in the specific context (thinking vs. acting)? "
642,What is input resistance and how to interpret its values?,"For example, this site gives a distribution of values of the input resistance of various cells. The values are in MOhms. The definition says that ""input resistance measured at steady-state voltage response to current injection"".  How can its value be interpreted? What do high or low values indicate? Does it relate to other cell properties? "
643,Is low self esteem pushing person toward maximizing (instead of being easily satisfied),"See the answer to this question: Is there a term that describes the personality trait of always desiring more?     Schwartz and colleagues (2002) have proposed that people fall into two   groups: those who seek to maximize their decision by finding the very   best option out of choices presented (maximizers), and those who have   an idea in mind of what would be an ""acceptable"" option and settle for   the first choice that surpasses their expectations (satisficers).   Maximizers are always on the look out for ""the best,"" are less   satisfied with their choices, more likely to ""socially compare"" their   options to others, and more likely to experience regret (Ma &amp; Roese,   2014). Another recent publication proposed that when individuals   experience ""choice closure,"" and stop re-evaluating the non-selected   alternative options, satisfaction with choice can increase (Gu, Botti,   &amp; Farro, 2013).   Is it possible to state that looking for challenges and being a maximizer can be correlated to a low selfesteem? "
644,Relation between Sleeping pattern and attention for ADHD people,"Question 1: Does sleeping at different times daily affect the attention for ADHD and Non ADHD ?  For example let us consider the below scenario,  Day 1 : Sleep time is 1:00 AM  Day 2 : Sleep time is 2:00 AM  Day 3 : Sleep time is 4:00 AM  Day 4 : Sleep time is 12:30 AM  Day 4:  Sleep time is 2:00 AM  Do such patterns affect the attention for ADHD people ?  *Note: Provided that the sleep time is 6- 7 hours per day *  Question 2  Can we compromise the lost sleep ? "
645,Why are disorders discrete?,"Disorders are usually discrete. For example, if you are given a test for, say, ADHD, they are usually only two results ""you have ADHD"" or ""you don't have ADHD"". Autism is treated as a spectrum, but this spectrum is by no means continuous, also being in discrete parts.  Why is this? Why can't you get a result of ""76% ADHD""? Intelligence, for example, is measured continuously, as is personality (psychometrics). Of course, tests can't be continuous, having a finite number of questions, but neither are rulers, which measure the continuous quantity of length, or IQ tests, which measure the continuous quantity of IQ.  So, why are disorders measured discretely? For example, if one person has 38% of a disorder, they may benefit from different treatment than someone with 87% of a disorder in a predictable way.  Why are disorders discrete? "
646,give me concrete example of mindless and mindful activity,"Can you give me concrete example of mindless activity and mindful activity?  which category ""watching movie"" or ""reading novel"" belongs to?  my definition of mindful and mindless? mindful to me is being aware of things I am doing. mindless is doing it without being aware of that activity (like auto pilot)   how to measure mindful and mindless objectively? I honestly don't know the answer to that. but if i may try, maybe from the way I can retrace it back in my memory to the detail information.  I have been doing a lot of activity throughout my daily routine. a lot of those activities has been done mindlessly out of habit. how can I do it mindfully?  "
647,Evidence for gender-based math ability differences?,"What evidence and counter-evidence is there for mathematical ability for being correlated with gender? If there is a difference, how significant is it (mean vs. variance) and when does it start to become visible? Actual causes for this difference are secondary and outside the scope of this question (although still very valid paths of research and investigation). Also, to further narrow the scope of the question, let's focus on evidence based on Western cultures (Europe, USA, Canada).  The evidence I have so far is this blog post, which finds a correlation between gender and math scores on the GRE and SATs. I also seem to recall finding somewhere evidence that gender-based math differences start as early as first grade, but I can't find the link at this point.  I'm not expecting a conclusive answer, more of a quick summary of the state of the field. "
648,What does it even mean to have a male/female brain?,"I have began taking a class on the sociology of gender and how gender is more malleable than previously thought and that femininity and masculinity exists in a continuum. What does this actually imply for the observable activity of people? For example, are women born with more male brains more likely to be lesbian? or prefer male friends? or prefer a more feminine sexual partner? And Can you tell from physical appearances that an individual has a more masculine or feminine brain? (ex: a man with a more feminine voice or a woman with more masculine features) "
649,Are superhero masks effective at concealing your identity?,"In modern comic book fiction, a superhero wears a partial mask to obscure their identity.  This mask is properly known as a ""Domino Mask""   Now obviously these masks are not the most effective masks in the world.  However, is there any cog sci evidence that they provide any protection at all?  I highly doubt there's any evidence to show they prevent someone from identifying you, but is there any evidence to suggest they even slow identification down or increase errors? "
650,Is it established that personal success or happiness is primarily determined by personality and is largely independent of social identities?,"In a discussion about choices about occupation, I shared the image of this tweet. The following was one of the replies:     Of course you can sit and complain about it, but it tells you about your own shortcomings be it laziness, cowardice, fears of all kinds lack of initiative etc.   Further the commenter pointed out that      Personal success or happiness after (everything else being equal) is determined by your personality.   He claims this using the theory of delayed gratification. His point being [from the wiki link]:     In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were   able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better   life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational   attainment, body mass index (BMI), and other life measures.   Actually he might be right. I have no idea of modern cognitive science results. So I want to know the following:  Are there results in cognitive sciences that show personal success or happiness is determined by one's personality? And that any occupation failure is determined mostly by personal shortcomings and is largely independent of social identities? "
651,"Do ""overview"" sections increase learning outcome?","Suppose a math textbook contains an overview chapter for each part of the textbook. The intent of those overview chapters is to motivate and introduce the new mathematical concepts which will be discussed in the respective part of the textbook. For example, why do we need the mathematical concept? How did the concept evolve in history? What will be the content of the next chapters?  In this context, will the overview sections facilitate learning? How important are overview chapters in textbooks for the success of learning?  Note: I reasked this question on matheducators.stackexchange.com. "
652,Why do people love nature?,"I wonder why we feel happy and comfortable when seeing the view of trees, green plants and flowers. Why do we admire sea, waves, fishes inside pure water and sun set? why do we love seeing the view of sky, moon and stars? Why people love nature even it is not real like a Picture on a computer?  To be more clear, People love seeing sea but the don't feel the same when they see a cup of water although they both are water.  Is it pure psychological reason? or There are some other biological reasons or chemistry of the brain?  Thank you very much, "
653,Can music be addictive?,"As playing games for a prolonged period, tend to develop a addictive behavior in humans, Is there any possibility for addiction to music?  i.e. When a person listens to certain list of songs and gets addicted to it, without which the person finds the day boring(or emotionally disturbed)? "
654,What is the effect of Binaural Beats on an Autistic brain?,"I understand a fare bit about autism, and Binaural Beats.  Autism is the result of synaptic pathways becoming malformed during the fetal stage of pregnancy.  A Binaural Beat is a collection of two frequencies layered on top of each other to produce a third frequency which mimics a brain wave frequency.  I know they have done experiments on people to find the effectiveness of a Binaural Beat, under controlled conditions, to perform a triple blind study.  However as an Autistic person I find myself wondering if any of the participants in that study had any form of Autism.  It seems to me that if the synaptic pathways in the brain of a fetus can become so malformed that they result in things like, Learning Difficulties and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified with traits of Aspergers Syndrome, then how would the brain of an autistic person interpret a Binaural Beat in comparison to a Neurotypical person ?  Binaural Beats are essentially two similar frequencies, you play a Binaural Beat through headphones and the brain of a Neuro-Typical person interprets the two frequencies from both ears to create the actual Binaural Beat which only the brain can here.  Is this so for people with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder ? "
655,How to create a non cogntive index,"I am currently trying to make a non-cognitive index using questions/variables. However there are following problems;  (a) The scales of the questions/variables vary, so I have a scale from 1 to 4 and some with 1 to 5  (b) I also have dummy variables that have been coded as 0 and 1 (yes/no)  The strategy I have in mind is to find the athematic mean of the scales that are similar and then calculate a weighted geometric mean. Do you think this is correct? Plus because of the dummy variable would it be correct to recode it as 1 and 2 so as to prevent my weighted geometric mean from going to zero? "
656,What are the rules that govern neuron behavior?,"This is what I know so far:  Neurons are nodes with a number called the threshold.  Neurons are connected to other neurons through directed axons.  Axons take the signals produced by neurons and deposit them on other neurons, these signals can be ""negative"" or ""positive"".  Once all the signals coming into a particular neuron are added up, if the sum is greater than the threshold, that neuron fires.  My question is: are these all the rules? And do all neurons have the same rules? "
657,Publicly Available NEURON models,"NEURON is a software package for simulating neurons and networks in great detail. Although it's quite easy to find papers that use NEURON with a simple Google Scholar search, is there some way to find which models are publicly available? For example, some repository of NEURON models and their associated publications?  If there is no standard, an answer with a few examples of recent (last 10 years) publications with a freely available NEURON model would be appreciated. "
658,Low agreeableness on argumentations with people confident in rethoric,"In many discussions people show confirmation bias, self serving bias and mental rigidity.   Assume one of the actor is very confident with rhetoric and shows really low agreeableness and a passive hostility (the definition given by wikipedia fits very well) toward the other one. He can be frustrated or Narcissistic.    The other tries to express his perceptions of some reality but his argumentations are not perfect in the form in which they are formulated, so he is accused of the typical formal errors (i.e. ""generalization"", ""you cannot be sure""). It's extremely easy to create a wall in this way (only philosophers or scientific papers are formally correct).   And the formal errors in an argumentation don't prove the speaker is wrong. But many people can think that winning an argumentation means being right.  This second guy (like the victim of many narcissists) could feel impotent, overwhelmed, or experience a kind of Gaslighting)  Is there a specific name for expressing this kind of argumentative hostility? Something like 'rubber wall'?  "
659,"In a forced-choice task, what proportion of responses is above chance level?","If I give a task in which there are only two response-options, and I want to categorise the participant according to their responses, what is the 'cutoff' or required proportion of one type of response?  E.g.  50-50 would be chance level performance: 50% Type A responses; 50% Type B responses.  100-0 would be a perfect Type A performance: 100% Type A responses.  Presumably a significant number of Type A responses (say, probably around 65%) would qualify as 'Type A' as opposed to 'chance performance'. But how should I decide on what that number is - what is a justifiable criterion and how do I justify using it? "
660,Influence of LIP on visual cortex,"I understand that the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) maps various features of targets onto an eye-centric reference frame. I also know that this mapping predicts where visual attention (in the form of saccades) will be directed and helps maintain the integrity of the mapping. Finally, I've also noted that the LIP has various projections to the visual cortex ventral and dorsal stream.  What is the function of these projections to the visual cortex? How is the visual cortex influenced by the aforementioned functions of the LIP? "
661,Are facial muscles activated in verbal thought?,"In this video, Dr Russel Barkley states the following:     I can put electrodes all over your face and I can ask you to cite your   Canadian pledge of allegiance in your mind. You still move your face.   The muscle movements are so small that they're inperciptible to you   and to others. But they're measurable. The human face is moving any   time you engage in verbal thought. So is your larynx, by the way.   I am having a hard time locating a source for this though, and have never heard of it. Does anyone know if this is true? "
662,Is CBT-based anger management effective?,"I have no doubt that some (aggressive) medication will definitely work in cutting people's anger-outburst potential. But is the usual CBT-based anger management class effective? There's a 2013 BBC article which says the systematic evidence isn't too convincing, although (of course) practitioners say it works if the patient has enough commitment.  In particular, most doubt seem to be whether such class-based approach can affect real-life ""heat of the moment"" events/outburst. So what does the scientific evidence on this look like? Are there substantial well-designed studies on this, are there enough studies for meta-analyses etc.? "
663,Does James Holmes diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder indicate a predisposition for mass murder?,"   On May 27, Dr. William Reid, a court-appointed psychiatrist who   interviewed Holmes for a total of about 22 hours, testified that   Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane, diagnosing him as having   schizotypal personality disorder, which is characterized by   constricted behavior and difficulties relating to others.   From Wikipedia  In other interviews and articles I have read, Holmes told psychiatrists that he had always had homicidal thoughts, in childhood they were to do with killing everyone via nuclear weapons, but progressed to more realistic scenarios (serial killing or gun rampage) as he got older. (This was contained in the recently unsealed psychiatric evaluation released by the court).   My question: does schizotypal personality disorder explain lifelong homicidal ideation / obsession, or predisposition to same? If not, why does James Holmes' psychiatric evaluation (both court-appointed and otherwise) fail to address the source or origin of his self-confessed homicidal tendencies (even speculatively)?  Such attempted explanation would seem to have had high intrinsic value. "
664,What might be the daily experience of someone who does not have an orientation association area?,"The orientation association area gives us a sense of our body in time and space.  What would it be like without this part of the brain assuming everything else works normally?  Can the brain separate itself from the totality of everything? Can the person maneuver in the environment? Can the person know ""he/she"" exists without this tactile sense of separation and ability to identify? Can the person understand ""life/death"" without this separation? "
665,What is the difference between the structure and the conception of an empirical study in psychology?,Can someone explain to me the difference between the structure of an empirical study in psychology and its conception?   My interpretation is so far that structure means the test arrangement and conception the basic concept of how the study is designed. Would you agree? 
666,Saying things to shock others,"Is it strange or categorically bad to say things that shock others knowingly, and enjoy their reaction?   I have a close friend who partakes in such behavior, and I want to understand his motivation a bit better.  Some context     I am not speaking about an attention aspect, per se, since this satisfaction from saying ""shocking things"" would be usually in a personal relationship context, whether that be friendship, intimate, or familial.    Perhaps the idea stems from hurting others as a coping mechanism?     Further, the satisfaction is not sexual at all, but merely a satisfaction from the reaction to whatever was said.     I am currently investigating this idea, as I have seen my friend partake in such behavior, and often at that. This behavior is private, so I am doubtful that it is for attention.  "
667,Is there any neuroscience research on the emotion of feeling nothing?,"When people entering anechoic chambers, logically there is a sensation of silence because relatively speaking, the sound levels are much lower compared to some normal baseline  Likewise, when there is emotional numbness there isn't a feeling of emotions nor there is an awareness that there isn't a feeling of emotion and the person will struggle to describe or comprehend emotion adjectives  Also for some people in anesthetics, they shared about what it is like to feel the consciousness is fading  All of these caused me to become curious on what the literature know about the neuroscience such as brain activity when subjects experience these feelings like feeling numb, feeling empty, feeling consciousness is fading, or all at the same time. Unfortunately neither my neuroscience professors are aware of something similar in the literature, nor intense googling on google scholar found any brain activity studies when people felt numb or something stronger     What is the technical name for all these seemly neutral emotions and (lack of) sensations?      Any known famous papers or literature that study the neuroactivity when subjects are experiencing these emotions?  "
668,What tasks is Spaun 2.0 able to perform?,"According to ""A Large-Scale Model of the Functioning Brain"" by Eliasmith et al., Spaun 1.0 was able to perform 8 distinct cognitive tasks:   Copy Drawing: Given a randomly chosen handwritten digit, Spaun should produce the same digit written in the same style as the handwriting. Digit recognition: Given a randomly chosen handwritten digit, Spaun should produce the same digit written in its default writing. N-arm bandit task: Spaun should perform a three-armed bandit task, in which it must determine which of three possible choices generates the greatest stochastically generated reward. Reward contingencies can change from trial to trial. List memory: Given a list of any length, Spaun should reproduce it. Counting: Counting. Given a starting value and a count value, Spaun should write the final value (that is, the sum of the two values) Question answering:  Given a list of numbers, Spaun should answer either one of two possible questions:  i. What is in a given position in the list?  ii. Given a kind of number, at what position is this number in the list? Rapid variable creation Given example syntactic input/output patterns (e.g., 0 0 7 4 → 7 4; 0 0 2 4 → 2 4; etc.), Spaun should complete a novel pattern given only the input (e.g., 0 0 1 4 → ?) Fluid Induction Spaun should perform a syntactic or semantic reasoning task that is isomorphic to the induction problems from the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) test for fluid intelligence   In ""Spaun 2.0: Extending the World’s Largest Functional Brain Model"" by Xuan Choo, it is written:     The final Spaun 2.0 model consists of approximately 6.6 million   neurons, can perform 12 cognitive tasks, and has been demonstrated to   reproduce behavioural and neurological data observed in natural   cognitive agents.   What novel cognitive tasks does Spaun 2.0 add? Reading the thesis, I've only been able to identify:   Adaptive arm control: Given a force field applied to Spaun's arm, Spaun should adapt to the force and continue to be able to draw in spite of the changing environment dynamics. Stimulus matching task: Given an example image from ImageNet, match other images of the same categories.   Hypothetically, instruction following could be considered as a task, but it seems like more of a meta-task, since it defines how Spaun can combine tasks to create new tasks without any architecture changes.

669,"""Give me a child..."" Quote from Skinner?","B.F. Skinner has been quoted all over the place on the internet (e.g. PsychologyDegreeGuide) to say     Give me a child and I'll shape him into anything   I am starting to think he didn't as I am yet to find a reference to where he said it.  The nearest I have found is     Give me a dozen healthy infants, well formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in, and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select — doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant, chief, and yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. (Watson, 1925, p. 82)   Robert Charles Lee, BSc (Hons) Psych &amp; Stats, 1981, Univ. of London states that it     seems to have come from a TV interview in the 1960s and reused in an Open University (UK) programme in the 1970s and '80s.   I have yet to find this.  Did Skinner really say this?  If so, where?  References  Watson, J. B. (1925). Behaviorism. New York: Norton. "
670,"What does ""dimensionality of power distance"" mean?","The BBC's article Cracking India's mystifying nod code is an interesting read and contains the paragraph:     However, there is more to the Indian head wobble than just a cultural quirk passed through the generations. In renowned cultural scientist Geert Hofstede’s exhaustive research on cultural norms across different countries, India scored 77 on the dimension of Power Distance – the extent to which people expect and accept power inequalities within their own society – compared to a world average of 56.5. This high score indicates a deep respect for hierarchy and limited scope for disagreement with those considered superior in any way.    and links to the website hofstede-insights.com where one can compare countries (cultures?) I've spent over a decade in the US and Taiwan each for example, and certainly the following comparison using the tool on that website rings true per my personal experience:    The terms ""dimensionality"" and ""distance"" have meanings to me in mathematics and physics, but I'm not familliar how they might be used in Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory.  Could someone help me understand the terms ""dimensionality"" and ""distance"" in the current context, using language accessible to one not familliar with the field, Hofstede's work, or formal psychology in general?  Does ""the extent to which people expect and accept power inequalities within their own society"" sum it up completely, or do ""dimensionality"" and ""distance"" carry more meaning than just ""extent of expectation and acceptance""?

671,"Why does SCID call itself ""Structured"" when by many accounts it's semi-structured?","The ""S"" in SCID officially stands for ""Structured"" as in Structured Clinical Interview for DSM. But as far as I can tell for the last three editions (5, IV and III), non-official sources (research papers etc.) often refer to it as a  semi-structured interview. e.g. [0], [1], [2] / [3], or [4] etc. The first link [0] is actually APA's own publishing blurb for SCID-5. The last one [4] is Spitzer et al. (1992) paper on SCID for DSM-III... which has over 4,000 citations in Google Scholar.  So why is there this discrepancy between the name (as fully spelled out) and content of the SCID?    I find it even more baffling after reading the introductory section of Spitzer et al., which emphasizes that SCID was designed from the get-go as semi-structured in opposition to previous [completely] structured interviews that were being advanced by others.     The major contribution of DSM-III was its inclusion of   specified diagnostic criteria for virtually all of the mental   disorders. This made possible, at about the same time as   the publication of DSM-III, the development of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). The DIS was designed for use by lay   interviewers with 1 week of intensive training. Although   originally developed for use in the Epidemiologie Catchment Area Study in which the cost of employing clinically   trained interviewers would have been prohibitive, it has   been used by investigators in a large number of nonepidemiologic   studies.   In the presidential address at the 1983 annual meeting of   the American Psychopathological Association, titled ""Are   Clinicians Still Necessary?"" one of us (R.L.S.) discussed the   potential limitations of the DIS in clinical research. Without questioning the advances embodied in the DIS, it was   argued that the most valid diagnostic assessment still required the skills of a clinician with experience in evaluating a range of psychopathology.      Unlike a lay interviewer   administering a completely structured interview, such as   the DIS, an experienced clinician can tailor an interview by   phrasing questions to fit the subject's understanding, asking additional questions that clarify differential diagnosis,   challenging inconsistencies in the subject's account, and   judging whether the subject's description of an experience   conforms to the intent of a diagnostic criterion. This is   particularly true in the diagnostic evaluation of subjects   with psychotic symptoms who have little insight and   present with a complicated story from which the interviewer must discern the symptom profile. For these   reasons, two of us (R.L.S. and J.B.W.W.) started work on a   clinical assessment procedure that would not only be   linked to DSM-III but would incorporate several features   not present in previous clinical diagnostic instruments.   So was the naming of the SCID a case of ""embrace and extend"" the concept of ""structured"" interview? I couldn't find the answer in Spitzer et al... "
672,Survey questions to test competitiveness,"I'm running an experiment and am suspecting that competitive people may respond differently to experimental treatments compared to non-competitive people.  To determine whether a person has a competitive personality, I'm thinking of surveying and asking questions such as   ""My friends would describe me as a competitive person.""  ""I would describe myself as a competitive person.""  ""Even when there is no monetary reward, I will seek to surpass others when doing a task.""  Would these be good measures of competitiveness? What other questions could I use? "
673,Does male preference for feminine women faces vary with bisexual orientantion and/or (BDSM) submisiveness?,"I found some papers on the variance of male preference for ""feminine"" women faces:   ""Men report stronger attraction to femininity in women's faces when their testosterone levels are high"" ""Men’s Preferences for Female Facial Femininity Decline With Age""   The latter is not terribly surprising given that testosterone level declines with age.  In case one wonders, the latter paper also gives a brief description how the facial ""femininity"" is operationalized in terms of     facial features such as higher cheekbones, a rounder forehead, smaller chin and nose, and rounder eyes (Farkas, 1987). The aggregate differences between women and men in this combination of facial features are often referred to as “facial femininity” (Little et al., 2011)   Probably the most interesting paper (that I found) in this line of research has these elaborate findings:     preference for feminine faces was not only influenced by sibling age and sex, but also [...] fatherhood modulated this preference. Men with sisters had a weaker preference for femininity than men with brothers, highlighting a possible effect of a negative imprinting-like mechanism. What is more, fatherhood increased strongly the preference for facial femininity. Finally, for fathers with younger sisters only, the more the age difference increased between them, the more femininity preference increased.    Also there's a Western-culture association with the preference.  After glancing at those papers, I have some ""obvious"" questions:   is this preference also affected by bisexual orientation, i.e. do bisexual men report a less strong preference for ""feminine"" women faces? is this preference also affected by dominance/submission-preference in a BDSM-type relationship?   (Yeah, asking two questions in one is somewhat frowned upon, but these seem related enough and a review paper might answer them both.) "
674,Any academic research/term for (some) men's preference for muscular female bodies?,"While I was searching for articles on the correlates of attraction to female ""feminine"" faces I ran into some non-academic discussions on the attraction that some men apparently have for muscular women, e.g. on quora or on bodybuilding.com forms, where some of the folk opinion (fairly predictably) was that such men are ""closet homo"" etc.   I'm at a loss how to search for any academic works on this topic, i.e. what's some terminology used; is there any academic research on this phenomenon at all?  As a related matter, there is some academic research on the nature of visual preferences of bisexual males, e.g. using swimsuit images, but only typical male/female images were used in that paper, not anything more ""in-between"", e.g. in terms of muscularity (or facial features). It's also quite easy to find reseach on the culturally-expected phenomenon ""women drawn to men with muscles"" or articles trying to limit/disprove that. There's an article in theconversation.com ""Why do we find muscular women wildly perplexing?"" but it doesn't even acknowledge the phenomenon that some men apparently are attracted to muscular women; it just rails against cultural standards etc.  In a case Wikipedia having surprisingly little google juice, on the 5th page of google results; I discovered its article on ""muscle worship"", which does contain some Latin-ish (how else) academic terms: sthenolagnia (=""sexual arousal from displaying strength or muscles"") and cratolagnia (""arousal from strength""). But these terms can simply refer to the ""worship"" participants fitting culturally-expected roles; I did find there that it's supposedly very prevalent among gay men, but there's no citation to back that up, and in any case it isn't what I was looking for. A similarly uncited statement is that      Many other sites are oriented towards straight men who enjoy worshipping female bodybuilders and other fit, muscular women, either virtually or by arranging for in-person sessions.   Ok, no academic took interest in this phenomenon, ever? "
675,My Mind Shows Me My Future,"When I sleep, I can see some phenomenon as a dream. After some days or months or years that phenomenon happens in my life and forthwith my mind reminds me of that earlier dream that I saw.

What kind of situation is this in the mind? Is it normal or abnormal? "
676,How is the brain cooled?,"I remember[ed] reading a story on a brain-inspired integrated mechanism for energy-delivery and cooling in (experimental) new computer chips:     The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match.      Its new ""redox flow"" system pumps an electrolyte ""blood"" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. [...]      ""The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today.      ""That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time.""   But as with other biology-inspired stuff, neural networks in particular, what ultimately becomes useful in computer science/engineering may not be that closely related to the way biology actually works.  So what I want to ask here is: are there some detailed mass-and-heat flow analyses for how the brain (of humans or even of other mammals) is actually cooled? How is most of the heat exhausted from the brain? Is it really thorough blood, and then globally through the whole body? Or is mostly a more local process at head level?    I managed to find something about the importance of blood for cooling, but only at whole-body level:     The second influence of the blood flow is that it can enhance heat   dissipation from the inside of the body to the environment to maintain a normal body temperature.   Theoretical study has shown that if the heat produced in the central areas of the body at rest   condition could escape only by tissue conduction, the body temperature would not reach a steady   state until it was about 80°C. A lethal temperature would be reached in only 3 hours. During exercise,   our body temperature would have typically risen 12°C in 1 hour if no heat were lost by   blood flow. Maintaining a core temperature of 37°C during thermal stress or exercise in the body   is achieved by increasing the cardiac output by central and local thermoregulation, redistributing   heat via the blood flow from the muscle tissue to the skin, and speeding the heat loss to the environment   by evaporation of sweat.   So from that I suspect blood is surely important for cooling the brain as well, but still some questions remain, e.g. where does most of the heat from the brain get dumped by the blood? In more layman's terms: is the rest of the body necessary as a radiator for the brain, or is the skull enough for that purpose?    Thanks to a paper cited by AliceD on biology.SE, I also found some anatomical considerations from about two decades ago... which seem to not be very conclusive:     Selective brain cooling (SBC) is understood as a natural   mechanism that enables mammals to maintain their brain   temperature below the temperature of the rest of the   body during states of hyperthermia (Baker 1979). [...]      The question whether SBC also operates in humans, who   lack cranial retia mirabilia, has led to an interesting controversy.   For some authors (Brengelmann 1987) the copious   and constant arterial blood flow to the brain appears   sufficient to cool the brain under all conditions. Others   (Cabanac 1993) concede that this concept may be correct   for the conditions at normothermia, but they propose that   an additional brain-directed cooling mechanism becomes   effective during hyperthermia. These authors draw attention   to vascular arrangements in humans, which permit   effects comparable to SBC in ""rete species"". Cabanac   (1993) points to several sites of intimate thermal contact   between the arterial and the cooler venous blood, e.g.,   the internal carotid in the carotid canal, where the artery   is tightly surrounded by the venous plexus caroticus and   thereafter immersed in the cavernous sinus, and the vertebral   arteries surrounded by a plexus of veins where   they course through the transverse foramina (see our Fig.   14). Furthermore, Cabanac refers to the high cooling capacity   of the skin of the head (particularly rich in sweat   glands), whence venous blood, cooled by sweat evaporation,   flows via emissary veins towards the brain in hyperthermic   situations (Caputa et al. 1978; Cabanac and   Brinnel 1985; Deklunder et al. 1991; Hiroshita et al.   1991). An additional loss of heat occurs in the upper airways   (Cabanac 1993), including the paranasal sinuses. A   direct conductive skin-brain heat exchange has also been   considered.   A decade-later paper by Caputa still noted that     The existence of effective SBC in humans has not been   proven directly because brain temperature has never   been recorded in healthy subjects exposed to hyperthermic   conditions.

677,Could we develop a notion of conceivability that would allow us to imagine impossible/inconsistent/illogical things?,"There are things that we cannot imagine because they are impossible (like a solution to Russell's set theory, since it is impossible to reach that solution because it is illogical.)  Some months ago, discussing with a user in this site, he said that although no one has reached that notion, it could be the case that someone in the future could achieve it, but he did not know the topic well enough to make any meaningful conclusion. ([website]Maybe someone here could help me  So could we develop a notion of conceivability that would allow us to imagine all of these things? Even all things that do not exist or cannot exist or are impossible like a solution to Russell's set problem or a thing that is illogical but at the same time is logical or inventing a new logic (or illogic) system...etc? What would be needed to reach such notion of conceivability? A change in the laws of physics? Or just biological evolution in our brains?? "
678,"Study purportedly proving psychedelics induce a ""heightened state of consciousness""","The Guardian headlines  on 28 Nov 2017: ""Psychedelic drugs induce 'heightened state of consciousness', brain scans show"".      Healthy volunteers who received LSD, ketamine or psilocybin, a compound found in magic mushrooms, were found to have more random brain activity than normal while under the influence, according to a study into the effects of the drugs.      Researchers at the University of Sussex and Imperial College, London, measured the activity of neurons in people’s brains as the drugs took hold. Similar measurements have shown that when people are asleep or under anaesthetic, their neurons tend to fire in a more predictable way than when they are awake.      “What we find is that under each of these psychedelic compounds, this specific measure of global conscious level goes up, so it moves in the other direction. The neural activity becomes more unpredictable,” said Anil Seth, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex. “Until now, we’ve only ever seen decreases compared to the baseline of the normal waking state.”      The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, appears 74 years to the day after the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman went on the world’s first LSD trip.    After the Guardian article just gets into a long expose of Hoffman's experience. But it does seem to identify one of the authors a bit later on:     Robin Carhart-Harris, a researcher at Imperial College who took part in the study, said the sudden increase in randomness in brain activity appeared to reflect a deeper and richer conscious state.      “People tend to associate phrases like ‘a higher state of consciousness’ with hippy speak and mystical nonsense. This is potentially the beginning of the demystification, showing its physiological and biological underpinnings,” he said. “Maybe this is a neural signature of the mind opening.”   N.B. a quick search found a TEDx talk by Carhart-Harris on the topic, but it seems older than this study. Also an older (2014) headline: ""Dr Robin Carhart-Harris is the first scientist in over 40 years to test LSD on humans - and you're next"".  So I have some questions:   Can anyone locate this Scientific Reports study? Has there been any more skeptical commentary on it? Or is there (silent) agreement that it really proves psychedelics induce a heightened state of consciousness?     Based on a photo credit to Muthukumaraswamy in that Guardian article, I found a 2016 paper ""Increased Global Functional Connectivity Correlates with LSD-Induced Ego Dissolution"" co-authored by many, including Muthukumaraswamy and Carhart-Harris, but it was in Current Biology, and the finding don't quite match, although they are somewhat related;  the focus of this paper is a bit different ""ego dissolution"" etc.  There's also a paper in Scientific Reports published around a month before the Guardian article ""Psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression: fMRI-measured brain mechanisms"", on which Carhart-Harris is lead author, but it doesn't ever mention consciousness--except in the title of a [self-]citation (from 2014)... ""The entropic brain: a theory of conscious states informed by neuroimaging research with psychedelic drugs"", which was later (2016) commented upon by David Papo. But I don't see the ""heightened"" claims in either of these... however they do debate the      “entropic brain hypothesis” [which] holds that the quality of conscious states depends on the system's entropy   which might be the same thing; I'll have to read these in detail to figure that out. Still, is there a Sci. Rep. paper with additional evidence as the Guardian article seems to suggest? "

684,What are the personality correlates of moral outrage?,"It seems surprisingly hard to pin down what moral outrage actually involves. It's easier to say what it isn't:     However, moral outrage—anger at the   violation of a moral standard—should be distinguished from personal anger at being harmed and   empathic anger at seeing another for whom one cares harmed. Across a preliminary experiment and a   main experiment, both designed to manipulate the appraisal conditions for these three forms of anger,   we found evidence of personal anger and empathic anger, but little evidence of moral outrage.   My question is basically: what is known about personality correlates of moral outrage? Below are some musings of my own:  I'm guessing some level of extroversion might be needed to express it, but it might even depend on how that outrage is expressed, e.g. online or in a rally or face-to-face etc.  It's even less clear to me what would correlate (personality wise) with just feeling such an outrage (keeping in mind the non-trivial distinctions from the quote). Possibly the close-mindedness from Big Five (opposite of openness) plays a role, but it's unclear to me if it's universally relevant. E.g. outrage at bigotry could have the exact opposite personality correlates to outrage at unconventional behavior. Maybe the humility/honesty in the HEXACO model has some correlation as well, e.g. with outrage at theft of aggrandisement.  And apparently I'm not the only one to think something like that:     outrage is driven by differing conceptions of what is just. For example, a recent Super Bowl ad featuring a Latino mother and young daughter making the long journey from Mexico to the United States – only to be confronted by a border wall – elicited very different responses of outrage. That’s because those who see the exclusion of immigrants as unjust and those who see maintaining a strict border as justified share a common desire to promote what they see as moral.   So, maybe I'm wrong to assume there are any universal correlates in the current personality models. If that's the case, are there more specific personality facets proposed for correlating with ""moral outrage""? Something like a strong sense of having a ""moral compass""?  From the previous link:     Our work highlights a third motive that is based on people’s desire to view themselves as morally upright people. Threats to one’s moral self-image have been shown to elicit unpleasant feelings of guilt that can motivate efforts to restore a positive view of oneself. This is commonly expressed by issuing an apology or making amends.   So maybe feeling moral outrage is actually related to Neuroticism? That seems a bit simplistic to me. "
685,Is there a formal name for the compulsive and recurrent urges to pick one's nose in order to remove perceived imperfections?,"Under which formal category does the following condition fall?: the condition of experiencing frequent and compulsive urges to pick one's nose searching for any possible perceived imperfections (be they wet snot, dry snot and even scabs) in order to remove them or ""smooth them out"" by means of scratching, in a sort of endless pursuit for a sensation of perfect smoothness within one's nose (endless because the sensation of perfect smoothness is never quite achieved and usually the scratching itself leads to bleeding and scabs which paradoxically become the fuel for future nose picking sessions, in an endless cycle). Likewise, are there any formal treatments to cure this particular condition? How effective are these treatments? Are there any studies on this? References are very welcomed. "

689,Psychology of disrespect and being proud of law breaking. How does it work and how to combat it?,"I'm gonna talk about Russia. :) I'm not interested in foreign policy, relations, for this question... maybe just a tiny bit.   A little preamble.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union (hereinafter S.U.), the people got lost, they didn't know who they were, what they wanted to do and who was going to tell them what to do. S.U. did a really good cleansing (of people's minds)... they were destroying all the traditions and knowledge that people lived by before S.U.: how to organize themselves, how to protect your property and even how to manage your household (if you're living in your own house). Private property, businesses, gold and anything valuable were seized. From the Party's point of view it was better if you live in an apartment rather than your own house. So, after the collapse, it was, loosely translated in English, the wild and evil ’90s. Basically the time of socio-political chaos. All the bad in people surfaced and no one to stop them because bribery was a second nature and it got instilled in the culture and the government.  Now to the point of the question.  Nowadays, when people break laws, even those that just a manifestations of common sense and you point that out, they tend to just show ""muscles"" and try to scare you away. Examples: driving in places when it's prohibited, littering, bribing the law enforcement, causing disturbances (e.g. playing loud music). Driving dangerously is a particularly big problem.   The reasoning often goes something like this: that's ok, no one's there, and it's really stupid not to take the ""opportunity"" (for saving little time, money, effort), I will do no harm... And even if you don't take this ""opportunity"", in some circles there can be social pressure to act like this. Romanticizing and glorifying a criminal life-style is somewhat prevalent... unfortunately teens often don't grow out of it. The civil court is a huge hassle (unless you're some sort of a government worker), police officers often ignore ""small"" violations and you left with the aggressor alone, imagine a big guy with no morals or a sociopath.   Why people don't see that they live such an a-typical, perhaps anti-social or criminal, life? And is there a way to go about to make those people aware of how they behave?  Any terms in psychology that describe this, any books to read or forums to visit... I'll appreciate any advice.  "
690,How does neuron stimulation work?,"Neurons are excited via an external electrode by passing current through it. A neuron at rest is at -70 mV, it needs additional charge amounting to around 15 mV to initiate an action potential.

Does the electrode provide charge to the outside of the membrane of the neuron? "
691,Is there a psychological term for enduring hardship to achieve a promised state?,"I'm new to CogSci and to Psychology in general, so forgive me if this question has been answered before...  I see a pattern in many sociological environments that goes like this:   Someone promises a better (possibly imaginary) state of living to someone else But this better state will only be achieved if the someone else endures a hardship period or similar A lot of ""Someone elses"" go through the hardship, and many of them endure a lot of time and justify what they are doing, even though nothing has really changed.   What I am most interested in is this aspect of point 3: that, even if there isn't a real difference, people will think there is, just because they endured the hardship.  Some examples:  a) A promise that some phone/shoe/whatever is much better than the alternative, but it is overpriced. People who bought it (endured the hardship) will find a justification for it at any cost (even if there isn't one).  b) A promise to achieve a peaceful state of mind through daily meditation for a long period of time. People who are committed to meditating will find any small improvement in life as if it was related to that.  Is there a psychological term for this ""phenomenon""/behavior? Has it been studied (I'm sure it might have been)?  This may be related to consistency theory, but I'm not sure about that. Any indications of articles about it would be welcome. "
692,Can the V * I * E theory of motivation explain the motivation of Nelson Mandela?,"Background  The V * I * E theory of motivation (Galbraith &amp; Cummings, 1967; Vroom, 1964) posits that if either the value of a goal, its instrumentality or the expectancy to reach it is zero, then an individual will not be motivated to reach that goal (please correct me if I'm wrong).   Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in jail because he was an anti-apartheid revolutionary. Apparently, he never gave up his mission.   Question  Can the VIE theory of motivation, or newer developments of it, explain thoroughly why some people don't give up their goals even if they to live under adverse conditions for a very long period of time?  More details: One might argue that such a person didn't lose the goal but just didn't try to realize it as long as it wasn't possible. In other words: the value was kept upright but the expectancy was zero. On the other hand, if V, I or E is zero, then the motivation - the drive - is zero as well. It is unclear what kept upright the value in this case. What drives a person in such a situation to keep fighting and can that be explained by the VIE theory of motivation?

Having reviewed the literature, I'm under the impression that they often occur in stress related situations or serotonin dysregulation (MDMA seems to trigger brain zaps), but I also read isolated people claiming they could voluntarily trigger brain zaps by ""tensing up"" and voluntary eye movements. These people said they could do that in a context devoid of any anxiety issues. Also a few marginal reports of brain zaps by heavy opiate, LSD, DXM and ketamin users, but who do not seem specific about details.  I'm under the impression that brain zaps can be caused by anxiety, but also that they can trigger violent panic attacks (fight-or-flight response from the brain zaps), but again also that they reportedly occur in the absence of stress.  What is known of what really happens at a cognitive, neural, or psychochemical level during brain zaps? What's the mechanisms? In the absence of hard science about it, what are the most plausible speculations? "
695,How accurate is a person's estimate of their social networks knowledge?,"A lot of studies have been performed on the nature of fake news and it's spread on social media sites:   ""Perceived social presence reduces fact-checking"" ""Echo chamber and trench warfare dynamics in online debates"" ""Epistemic Factors in Selective Exposure and Political Misperceptions on the Right and Left"" ""Politically Motivated Reinforcement Seeking: Reframing the Selective Exposure Debate"" ""Helping populism win? Social media use, filter bubbles, and support for populist presidential candidates in the 2016 US election campaign""   A problem I have with a lot of these studies is how they seem to ignore the structure of a person's personal network. For example, I'm going to trust a post on psychology from someone who frequently makes accurate posts on the topic more than I'm going to trust one from my crazy meme-posting uncle.  I would trust ignoring this factor if most people didn't have accurate estimations of the knowledge level of the people in their social networks? Has there been any studies examining how accurately people keep track of who they trust on what topics? Does this accuracy affect how accurately they detect false information spread in their social network? "
696,What is the correlation between self-rated and objective measures of intelligence?,"In the context of a broader question, someone asked:     Can the detailed analyses from, say, the Wechsler test, be used to inform decisions significantly better that gut feelings can?   While this question might be closed, I thought a more defined question regarding the correlation between self-rated and objective measures of intelligence would be good to have. I feel as if I've read papers that suggest the correlation is modest (e.g., r = .2 or .3). Presumably, Dunning-Kruger and a bunch of self-serving biases operate. But I could not find any authoritative reference off hand. So my questions:   What is the correlation between self-rated intelligence and objective measures of intelligence (i.e., full scale IQ scores from well-validated measures)? To what extent does the correlation depend on how the self-ratings are obtained?  "
697,What stops this (one weird) hypnotic trick having the reverse effect to intended?,"In one of his endless Blogs about Trump and hypnotism, Scott Adams, creator of the comic Dilbert, claims that by showing an image of Trump's book and his own book side-by-side he can hypnotise you into thinking his book is important.    Trump is a business tycoon/president/mysogynistic-dinosaur/fork-and-spoon-operator. Whether you love him or hate him the view is widespread that Trump is an important guy. When I see Adam's book next to Trump's my hindbrain says, 'Oh, this Scott Adams guy must be as important as Trump to have their books side-by-side'  I believe that is true to some nonzero extent. It might be huge; it might be tiny. I am not interested in debating the exact size. My question is why does this trick not have the opposite effect?   Scott Adams is best known for drawing cartoons for cripe's sake? Unlike Trump, Scott Adams is not a household name. Why doesn't the hindbrain see both books and say, 'Trump's book next to Adam's? That nobody!? Gosh I guess Trump was not as important s I thought.'  If the association goes one way, what's to stop it going the other? "
698,Why do colors affect emotion?,"The paper ""Color Psychology: Effects of Perceiving Color on Psychological Functioning in Humans"" by Andrew J. Elliot and Markus A.

Basically, are the color emotions controlled by association or something else? "
699,What's the relation between PES and LSA?,"In ""Learning by stimulation avoidance: A principle to control spiking neural networks dynamics"" by Sinpayen et al. a learning rule called Learning by Stimulation Avoidance (LSA) is presented.

700,Biological Plausibility of FORCE training,"In ""Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with FORCE Training"" by Wilten Nicola and Claudia Clopath. The authors create a learning rule for learning non-linear dynamics from populations of spiking neurons. The learning rule only seems to depend on:   an error signal the firing rates of each neurons an approximate inverse correlation matrix calculated from the firing rates of each neuron   Is it possible to calculate the inverse correlation matrix of using another population of neurons or is there some biological mechanism that could be used to explain this? Additionally, is this calculation sensitive to delay? Often, forgetting to take delay into account is the undoing of many learning rules and cognitive architectures. "
701,What is the psychology behind male pornographic actors having larger than average penises?,"There is a question What does scientific research say about the relationship between penis size and attractiveness?  This  answer and this link give the statistics of penis size. Given these statistics, the average man performing in porn, would likely be in the top 2.5% of the population of penis size.     Porn stars are statistical outliers, not the norm; men are more likely to be over 6’3” than to have a penis longer than 7.5 inches.     It also ""appears"" that men may be inclined to having poor self-perception, regarding their penis size.     Males self-perception   Males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis relative to that of others, because of the foreshortening obtained from looking down, due to repeated observation of atypical penises in pornography, or because of the accumulation of fat at the base of the penis.[34] A survey by sexologists showed that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises.[35]    Given that men are the main consumers of pornography, why does pornography feature so many men, out of the norm for penis size? Would it be more appealing to men, if the men starring in porn, had average sized penis?    what is the psychology behind using men with such, abnormally, large penis? "
702,Why do people say they hate drama?,"On social sites sometimes people will state, ""I hate drama!"", as if to say ""if you cause drama, please go away.""  My theory is the people who say this, in fact, actually like drama... as evidenced by the apparent hatred for it.  Has there been any research into this?  People could also say, ""I hate being kicked in the rear!"", which I'm sure most people would hate, and if it happened commonly enough, people may start posting such on their profiles.  This line of thinking leads me to believe that the statement of hatred for drama is the admission that drama is a commonly occurring problem.  Also, it seems to be as reasonable to state this on a profile as it is to hang a sign on a door reading, ""I hate thieves!"" or a sign on a backside saying, ""I hate muggers!""  Since people don't commonly hang these types of signs, why do they hang the drama sign on their profiles? "
703,Current theories of the psychology of ambivalence,"This question querying the authenticity of people's words and actions and the resulting commentary after this answer, has led me to ask this question.  Ambivalence is a state of having simultaneous, conflicting feelings toward a person or thing.1 Stated another way, ambivalence is the experience of having thoughts and/or emotions of both positive and negative valence toward someone or something. The term also refers to situations where ""mixed feelings"" of a more general sort are experienced, or where a person experiences uncertainty or indecisiveness concerning something. The expressions ""cold feet"" and ""sitting on the fence"" are often used to describe the feeling of ambivalence.     Ambivalence is experienced as psychologically unpleasant when the positive and negative aspects of a subject are both present in a person's mind at the same time. This state can lead to avoidance or procrastination, or to deliberate attempts to resolve the ambivalence. When the situation does not require a decision to be made, people experience less discomfort even when feeling ambivalent.      It is normal to have ambivalence from time to time about how we feel about another individual, whether we can trust the authenticity of a person. As human beings are multidimensional creatures. Trials and triumphs both bring out different aspects that are part of the one person. A person's mood, can change the way that person relates to others. Combined with the modulation of the observer's own internal processes, there can be a varying perception between two people.    If my ideas are correct, and a degree of ambivalence can be quite normal, almost expected within human interactions (or relationships); How can  reasonable ambivalence be differentiated from  pathological ambivalence? What are the current theories regarding the psychology of  ambivalence? "
704,Derived knowledge from periodicity of harmonic motion?,"This question is the third in a series, after:    1. Improved Typing as a result of slight movement    2. Neural Processes of Inducing Flow  Background: Pseudo-random, 'swaying', motion appears to help induce a flow state, in that it 'captures' the movements of an activity and entrains them to an underlying rhythm of activity.  Time between activity-related movements is reduced, and error-recovery time is also reduced.  (again, this is from first-hand observation, not published results).  The following is the relevant explanatory section of the 2nd question's answer:     Seen from this perspective, cyclical movements are the norm for almost any animal,    whereas short-duration, ""single-use"" movements like typing or playing the piano are rather unusual. It could be the case that if the motor cortex (or even the basic movements encoded in the spinal cord) is inherently tuned to modeling cyclic movements, then adding some continuous motion could help the motor cortex capture the intended typing or playing movements as part of the larger, continuous movement.   The last question I have is if the frequency of the periodic movements, which in general follow a 'figure-8' track, could be related to the frequency of other cycles in the body?  For example, could the frequency of motion reflect the active frequency of the brain, e.g. EEG waves?  Or could it reflect a different neural/physiological cycle or state?  Naturally this is a tricky question: on one hand, the activity itself serves to entrain the neural system to a certain periodicity.  On the other hand, if the rhythmic movement activity is allowed to 'float' in frequency organically, does its characteristics reflect anything about the initial state of the neural system?  Final question(s): Does the frequency of movement give clues to other periodic cycles, such as EEG waves? Does said movement give any other insight into the brain/body state?   "
705,What causes fear of failure to lead to lack of effort and actual failure?,"Background: I'm having hard time motivating myself to study. In my first year I was a very good student, I had the motivation to study because I wanted to compete, it was first and maybe hardest year. I wanted to show that I am good and better. I passed my exams in time with good grades. Then, I started studying less and less, finding it hard to motivate and focus on learning.  I don't study and don't have motivation to study because I am afraid of failing an exam. I am afraid that if I study hard for an exam and then fail I will feel that I am stupid.   Questions   Is there a name for the phenomena of not putting effort into study because of fear of failure which in turn results in actual failure? What causes this? Are there any strategies for overcoming this cycle?  "
706,What is the relationship between sociology and cognitive sciences?,"I want to know what is the relationship between sociology and cognitive sciences.  Let me start by short consideration of both:   Sociology - well established discipline or a field of research Sociology is a part of social sciences. Cognitive sciences - a bit more recent field of research. Cognitive science cannot be considered a discipline, it lacks core basics, there is bigger and less connected variety of research methods and objects. Cognitive sciences is also part of social sciences, but has stronger ties with biomedicine (neurology, pharmacology).   Sociology considers that main causes of our behavior lie outside, in the social environment. At the same time cognitive sciences look for causation within psyche/brain.  I believe that there are three ways of looking into relations:   Connections between sociological and cognitive-science journals? Semantic relations like use of similar concepts and definitions? Interdisciplinary projects that include both sociology and cognitive sciences?  "

710,"What is the primary mechanism behind nationalism, sports-team-ism, product-ism etc.?","I'm interested in doing research on the subject of nationalism, but I believe that what I'm looking for is more generic than that. I observe that nationalism looks similar to the way that people feel about their sports team or their favorite product or their religion or their race. People proselytize for these things, and people sometimes kill over them (e.g. -- soccer riots). I note also that this kind of devotion can also produce strong negative feelings towards the other teams, countries, etc.  In each case, a person exhibiting this behavior with respect to a country, sports team, or product has at least one of the following characteristics (maybe others?).   Person identifies personally with X. Person feels a sense of belonging with others who also identify with X. Person is inclined to convince others that they should also follow/admire/believe X.   Is there an underlying mechanism behind these symptoms or term that describes this behavior? What is the body of study that examines these types of behaviors (causes, definitions, and effects)? If there isn't a particular term for this as a generic subject of study, are there at least some studies that examine the common features of these behaviors?  What I have researched so far: This question helped a little bit in thinking about this issue, but I'm not sure it answers my question. Also, Maslow's hierarchy of needs points to ""respect by others"" and ""belonging"" as posibilities, but I don't know much beyond that or where to look.    Update  I'm stuck. I'm just not sure that ingroups and outgroups really characterize the fundamental mechanism behind why people hold some beliefs with evangelistic or violent fervor. That feature of human nature is not dependent on the existence of a group. If I try to convert someone to my way of thinking, I am not doing so because of a group to which I belong. Certainly group behaviors that @PEEJWEEJ mentioned can feed such sentiments, but like I mentioned to @Ana, I'm not convinced that the group itself is the cause. Perhaps I could be persuaded otherwise, but I think there's something else going on here. "
711,Why are websites constantly updated even when the change seemingly reduces functionality?,"Examples:   Imagine coming to SE tomorrow and instead of seeing ""1 2 3 4 5 ... 77 next"" at the bottom of the ""questions"" page, you see a giant circle with a triangle inside pointing to the right and you no longer have the option of going from page 1 to page 5 in one click, but you must now click the big circle incrementally instead. Or imagine your favorite weather website having a 10-day forecast horizontally across the screen like a calendar would have, then one day it changes to a vertical alignment because someone decided it was time for a change.   Questions:  Why do people do this?  And is it normal to feel extremely frustrated by this?  I mean, when something works well and makes sense, leave it alone?.  Why change stuff just to change stuff?  And especially when the change is less functional or intuitive. "

713,Can asking a leading question in a poll change the opinion of the respondent?,"Poll* questions if phrased in a way to suggest a fact to the reader, may force the person to think of explanations to support the view expressed in the question. This belief may then last on its own because of belief perseverance.  For example, if a poll ask questions of the form :     How do you think 90% of people behave in {situation}?   or, political questions     Which party do you believe is trusted by over 70% of the voters? Options:{Plausible Party A} {Small unknown party B}   Or from the opposition party,     Which party do people relate to when thinking of corruption? Options: {Ruling Party} {Small unknown party}   Or, another of the commercial flavour,     Which company comes to the mind of 70% of the people when they think of clean water? Options : {Big company A} {Small unknown company B}   By choosing options wisely, the poll creator can force certain ideas into the minds of individuals under the banner of ""popular opinion"" without them even realising it. By trying to rationalise why or how the most likely option is correct, individuals giving the poll will essentially think up of or create evidence. This will then further reinforce and plant the suggested idea with varying degrees of permanence.  So, does the concept of belief permanence thus imply (as explained above) that polls can be used to plant incorrect ideas/information in people?   Also, can polls thereby be an effective marketing technique for companies and/or political parties when trying to shape public opinion?   By poll, I mean any form of interaction which involves Q&amp;A with or without the provision of correct feedback at the end. I do not mean only elections or opinion polls.  "

717,"Does hypnotherapy/hypnosis, in any form, for any type of disorder, work?","Does Hypnosis Work for Treating, or Curing, any Form of any Mental Disorder?  Let's say my definition of hypnosis is related mostly to the classical way people think about it.  This is subjective of course, but I've purposefully made it that way. I do realize at times it may overlap into other types of therapy as well.  If there are other forms of hypnosis I'd like to hear about those too though!  Citation/Research Wise:   I'd like to know if its backed by literature.  I want the specific citation's abstract   quoted. I'd like to know their findings, conclusions, and methodologies and your analysis of that. I'd like to know how long the treatments lasted after they stopped being hypnotized. I'd like to know how effective it was for whatever specific goals that it was used to treat.  How long did the affects last if there were any? I'd like to know if you found any potential errors or flaws in the study - and you're overall analysis of that.     Citing Wikipedia is not an acceptable answer or comment as it is not a reputable source, it's citations are.  If you are going to do that, pick the most compelling and valid studies (no matter the disorder), or something like a meta analysis that Wikipedia cites and then post that along with the answer to the above questions.  Thanks.    Anecdotally:   I'd like to know what it feels like to be hypnotized if you've had the experience of it. I'd like to know why if it worked really well for you then why did you stop doing it or have you actually continued?   It can be any disorder of any kind, just as long as someone could classify it as a psychological ""problem"" in some context.  The more angles you come at it with the better though. "

719,How to calculate IQ score based on raw score and adjust for age?,I am having a hard time grasping how IQ scores are calculated. I think it has something to do with their age score ratio multiplied by 100.  Say I have a test that holds 30 questions. How would I generate from that test an IQ score? Would each question be worth 1 point? Then I would divide by age and multiply by 100?  So if someone got 26 questions correct and they were 18 it would be  26 / 18 = 1.44 1.44 * 100 = 144   Is this the general way of doing things?  I have researched the internet with no definitive answer to this even on wikipedia. 
720,How is it that taking a break from a problem sometimes allows you to figure out the answer?,"As a computer programmer, I have noticed an interesting phenomenon: If I am stuck on a particular problem in my work, often if I stop thinking about the problem and do something else, the answer will suddenly come to me.  Is there a name for this phenomenon? How does this work? Has any research been done on this? How is it that taking a break from a problem sometimes allows you to figure out the answer?  Edit: I remember now where I heard about this phenomenon: on the Charlie Rose Brain Series, Eric Kandel of Colombia University says (at 43:20 in)     [The unconscious] can do many processes at the same time. You can either focus on one   thing  or another, you can't focus on two or three things at the same time. Because   consciousness is very limited in what it can do; unconsciousness is much broader. And   although we know very little about the true nature of creativity, one emerging theme that   comes out of this is that, if you're trying to solve a mathematical problem... if   you're trying to solve any intellectual problem... you keep on focusing at it, you may   get stuck. Taking a break, taking a shower, going for a walk, playing golf, you come   back refreshed. And often doing the other activity, boom, the idea will come to you.   But then they change the subject! What is the concept he's talking about, and where can I read more about how it works? "

722,"Beyond a certain level, is reading comprehension affected more by psychological intuition than by verbal intelligence?","Certainly, you have reading comprehension passages on the SAT, GRE, and LSAT. But beyond that point, is it really possible to measure reading comprehension through multiple-choice tests? There are multiple motivations for why an author may make argument X, and multiple interpretations of his exact argument, which may be affected by the immediate circumstances that made him write that argument at that particular point in time (and while we may know a bit about the society that he lived in, chances are that we'll probably never know who he intended the book to be written for - hell - some people probably intended to write a book to impress some potential lover [and hell, maybe some passages in the book are motivated to attract the sympathy of that lover] even though they pretended to write it for the greater good of society).   I mean, all you have to do is to look at courtrooms. There, people pretty much argue about what people (in a case with precedent) actually meant, and there's usually no concrete (and correct) answer. And people who study the life of a particular philosopher may have multiple interpretations of why philosopher X wrote passage Y, and what X really meant in writing passage Y.   Plus, it's oftentimes very interesting to read the writing of someone you know REALLY well because you know their life so well that you can dream up hypotheses of what prompted them to write passage X at time Y (and you also know his social network so you could imagine what audience he had in mind, and what audience he might have secretly hoped to impress without mentioning it). And perhaps because of this, reading comprehension is not a skill with a single scale, since people are better at understanding some people than they are at understanding others.  I mean, I guess the ultimate test of reading comprehension would be to test someone on one of Immanuel Kant's books, or on some recent postmodernist book (made artificially difficult to read/parse), and then ask him ""well, what is Kant trying to get at""? But is that really a valid test? Or maybe one where you have to dissect the entire structure of a book where X is pretending to be Y pretending to be Y pretending to be X (of course, such books are rarely written, but theoretically possible).   Alternatively, wouldn't someone with exceptional reading comprehension be better at reading crappy writing? (because they're probably more able to process multiple thought-streams at once - which includes possible fragmentary/jumbled ideas?) A common assumption in reading comprehension tests is that the writing is ""perfect"", but this is frequently not the case, and people (especially older people) can get attention lapses when writing "

724,Are there any connectionist models that integrate reinforcement and  fully supervised learning?,"I've been working on modeling some phenomena involving real-time control in an environment with inherent rewards (specifically, playing a 'pong'-like game), and it's increasingly looking like reinforcement learning by itself won't cut it computationally (I'm currently using a temporal difference back propagation neural network).  One possible supplemental learning mechanism is to also have the model predict the environment's future state, from which it can learn from in a supervised manner using standard feed forward back propagation.  My current thinking on synthesizing these mechanisms is to have the input layer feed into a hidden layer, which in turn feeds into both a reward predicting layer and a separate state predicting layer. In training this net, I simply change the weights via reinforcement learning first and then change them again to account for the state prediction error via back prop.  So my question is this: Are there any problems you can foresee arising from this architecture? Additionally, has this combination of learning mechanisms been done before, and if so was it done in a similar way?        "
725,How is it possible for psychometricians to develop IQ tests for people smarter than them?,"After all, while psychometricians definitely have above-average IQs, they probably don't have IQs over, say, 160.  If psychometricians already know what the right answers are (and how to obtain the right answer), then wouldn't they score very high on the tests, even if they're not THAT smart? (making it possible for other people to score high on the tests if they studied psychometrics as well?) The format of the test isn't going to vary that much from administration to administration. Of course, the tests are timed, but it's entirely possible that the practice the psychometricians get from writing the tests could easily make them better at each of the subsets of an IQ test. "
726,"Are IQ tests ""biased"" against individuals with Asperger's Syndrome?","One person makes the claim over at his response to the Quora question Do people with Asperger's have above-average IQs simply because the ones with below-average IQs simply get diagnosed with autism instead?.     No.       Intelligence testing as most neurologically typical people understand   it, is heavily biased toward individuals with expressive and receptive   language ability which is often impaired in persons with autism to a   greater degree than in persons with Asperger's.       As an example: imagine an intelligence test that was written in   English being administered to a person who grew up speaking French.   That person might be quite bright but would likely score very low.   There have been numerous documented studies of the effect of language   bias in intelligence testing that makes the idea of standardized   intelligence testing a questionable endeavor.       From personal experience, my own son has rather severe language   impairments and, if tested with a written or verbal test, would almost   certainly have an MR diagnosis in addition to his autism. However,   when tested with strictly non-language based testing methods, has   proven himself to be quite bright (in the empirical sense, that is.   Watching him spend 30 seconds on a strange computer before finding his   favorite YouTube videos shows that he knows quite well what he's   doing).    Is he right when he says that ""Intelligence testing as most neurologically typical people understand it, is heavily biased toward individuals with expressive and receptive language ability which is often impaired in persons with autism to a greater degree than in persons with Asperger's.""?  And could IQ tests be biased against Aspies in other ways? Could they also be biased in favor of Aspies in certain ways as well? "

729,Are end-stage Alzheimer's patients still conscious?,"I asked the same question at Reddit here, but none of the responses were convincing.  So here's the thing: to the extent of what we know about consciousness, are end-stage Alzheimer's patients still conscious? I will use Christof Koch's attempt to define consciousness, as explained below.     What is the character of the NCC? Most popular has been the belief   that consciousness arises as an emergent property of a very large   collection of interacting neurons (for instance, Libet 1993). In this   view, it would be foolish to locate consciousness at the level of   individual neurons. An alternative hypothesis is that there are   special sets of ``consciousness"" neurons distributed throughout cortex   and associated systems. Such neurons represent the ultimate neuronal   correlate of consciousness, in the sense that the relevant activity of   an appropriate subset of them is both necessary and sufficient to give   rise to an appropriate conscious experience or percept (Crick and Koch   1998). Generating the appropriate activity in these neurons, for   instance by suitable electrical stimulation during open skull surgery,   would give rise to the specific percept.   So do end-stage Alzheimer's patients lose these types of ""neurons""? "
730,What do the super-large brains of whales and elephants map to?,"Elephants and whales have brains that are much larger than those of humans. It is presumed that much of their brain is used up for their larger bodies (after all, there is a allometric scaling between brain weight and body weight in mammals).    Do elephants and whales really need super-large somatosensory cortices to map to their larger bodies?  Have we mapped out the parts of the brains of a whale or elephant to see which parts of the brain are mapped to which parts of the body?   With whales in particular, they don't even have arms or legs, so I wouldn't expect them to have large regions of the brain devoted to, say, fine-motor skills.  Yet, it is apparent (to many people) that whales and elephants don't have drastically higher intelligence than humans. So their extra brain regions have to go somewhere. Where do they go to?  I asked the same question here, though I'm not convinced by any of the answers provided. "
731,What are the effects of implanting electrodes into the brains of monkeys?,"If one implants electrodes into a monkey's brain in order to allow the monkey to control a mechanical arm, then is the monkeys able to move both it's natural and it's mechanical arms at once?  What happens if, say, the same signal might tell the mechanical arm to move up, and the natural arm to move down? "
732,Can intense multitasking improve fluid intelligence/working memory?,"The Dual N-Back task is the only task I'm aware of that has empirical support showing that it improves working memory. It appears to improve working memory through multitasking, although this multitasking must fit certain criteria, namely that you can't learn the task so well that you can eventually ""automate"" it without going into working memory.  Thus, I'm wondering whether other forms of multi-tasking such as playing Starcraft II (see my earlier thoughts) and driving with a cellphone can also improve working memory?  A possible follow-up question: if not, what differentiates the type of multitasking found in the Dual N-Back task from other types of multi-tasking? "
733,Do expert computer gamers have unusual physiological or mental characteristics?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Any work being done on Perception, Action, and/or Cognition in Video games?       Are there any research studies that show this?  See a thread on Quora for some initial discussion, but few research articles so far.     For decades, a different game, chess, has held the exalted position of   “the drosophila of cognitive science”—the model organism that   scientists could poke and prod to learn what makes experts better than   the rest of us. StarCraft 2, however, might be emerging as the rhesus   macaque: its added complexity may confound researchers initially, but   the answers could ultimately be more telling.   “I can’t think of a   cognitive process that’s not involved in StarCraft,” says Mark Blair,   a cognitive scientist at Simon Fraser University. “It’s working   memory. It’s decision making. It involves very precise motor skills.   Everything is important and everything needs to work together.”      Blair, the Simon Fraser University scientist running the SkillCraft   project, asked gamers at all ability levels to submit their replay   files. He and his colleagues collected more than 4500 files, of which   at least 3500 turned out to usable. “What we’ve got is a satellite   view of expertise that no one was able to get before,” he says. “We   have hundreds of players at the basic levels, then hundreds more at   level slightly better, and so on, in 8 different categories of   players.” By comparing the techniques and attributes of low-level   players with other gamers up the chain of ability, they can start to   discern how skills develop—and perhaps, over the long run, identify   the most efficient training regimen.      Both Blair and Lewis see parallels between the game and emergency   management systems. In a high-stress crisis situation, the people in   charge of coordinating a response may find themselves facing competing   demands. Alarms might be alerting them to a fire burning in one part   of town, a riot breaking out a few streets over, and the contamination   of drinking water elsewhere. The mental task of keeping cool and   distributing attention among equally urgent activities might closely   resemble the core challenge of Starcraft 2. “For emergencies, you   don’t get to train eight hours a day. You get two emergencies in your   life but you better be good because lives are at stake,” Blair says.   “Training in something like Starcraft could be really useful.”  "
734,What is the relationship between self-perceptions and actual driving ability?,"I've often heard it said that almost everyone thinks that they are a better than average driver. If this is true, it could be explained by a number of theories. Some of these are outlined in this Wikipedia article on illusory superiorty.  I had a few questions:   Has anyone researched the actual correlation between self-perceived and other measures of driving ability? Has anyone developed a model of the degree to which any bias is due to different causes (e.g., different values of speed versus safety; perceptual differences of others versus self; etc.)?  "
735,What transient factors affect performance on IQ tests?,"While performance on intelligence tests aim to measure an underlying relatively stable trait, there are presumably a range of transient factors that could temporarily lower or possibly even raise scores on such tests.  Possible factors might be: alcohol, sleep deprivation, mood, test taking anxiety, etc.   Are there any studies so far that have assessed the degree to which such transient factors can influence performance on intelligence tests? Do such studies suggest such affects depend on other factors such as gender, personality, and presence/absence of ADD/Asperger's?  "
736,Is there a correlation between high IQ and creativity?,"Is there a correlation between high IQ for example over 125 and creativity?  Is creativity improved or does its importance simply diminish?  Maybe there could also be confounding variables as well? It can be easier to be creative if you're not the best in the world in something (surprisingly enough), since then it might motivate you to get off the beaten path. "
737,Does writing something down help memorize it?,"This is a question inspired by this recent question on the Chinese Language &amp; Usage website.  Someone asked why they needed to learn how to write Chinese characters, since today we mostly use computers or text messages to do so. Several users replied that writing Chinese characters help remembering them more easily, including for reading purposes.  However, another user argued that there was no reason to believe that it was true, and that writing characters doesn't necessarily help one remember them (compared for example to simply reading them and looking at them).   Is that the case? Does writing generally help remember glyphs (or more generally information) or not? Is there any conclusive research about this or about the relation between writing and memorizing in general? "
738,How is a young child able to learn language so easily?,"It's a well known fact that the earlier children are exposed to languages the better, as young children have a better ability to learn new languages than adults.    Why is this?  At what age does a human's mind start to lose this ability?  What causes the change?  Does this phenomenon have a name?          "
739,What structures in the brain are called upon to strengthen coupling between bilateral movements?,"It is very difficult for the normally-coordinated person to be able to pat his/her head and rub his/her stomach at the same time (or pick a similar activity).  It seems to be possible to maintain the separate hand motions over the short term, but keeping the movements separate is almost impossible to keep up.  One ends up either rubbing the head while rubbing the stomach or patting the head while patting the stomach before long.  Effectively, there seems to be a ""locking"" between the motor cortices across the hemispheres during bilateral movements of the arms.  Given all of this complex coordination that is possible between the two arms/hands, what are the structures within the brain that are called upon to strengthen the coupling between the two arms during bilateral movements?  Why do the hemispheres try to lock their activity rather than letting both arms act independently? "
740,What is the psychology behind trolling?,"For those new to the internet, trolling is an activity where one person intentionally tries to upset other members of the same community, presumably for entertainment.   This has been informally addressed in the media, normally positing that the anonymity of the internet gives rise to more extreme behaviors,    but is that the explanation research supports?  And if it is, how does the process of enabling occur? And more broadly, why do people derive pleasure from the anger of others within the same group? Lastly, is this behavioral phenomenon unique to the internet era, or are there historical predecessors involving similar causal mechanisms?  "
741,Does the concept of employee engagement add anything over and above traditional concepts?,"The concept of ""employee engagement"" is popular in organisational consulting settings. A quick Google for ""engagement survey"" will yield many results. However, in some respects the concept often seems defined in terms of some combination of satisfaction, commitment, and motivation.   Does the concept of employee engagement add anything new over and above satisfaction, commitment, and motivation? To the extent that it does overlap with previous constructs, does it still have value?  "
742,Is it possible to measure the working memory of a non-human animal?,"Is it possible to measure the working memory of a non-human animal? And if so, have there been any studies that have quantified the working memory of animals, and that have compared that to the working memory of humans? Or are the two not comparable? "
743,What is the term for a psychological effect which does not have a neurobiological/genetic basis?,"When a psychological condition is the result of irregular brain structures or neurotransmitter imbalances we say the condition has a neurobiological basis; this is analogous to the classic Nature in the Nature vs Nurture discussion.   What is the term for a condition which does not have this sort of (apparent) neurobiological basis? This would be a condition caused by Nurture effects such as psychologically traumatic events.   Is there a distinction? Technically both would induce physical changes in the brain, but I often see ""neurobiological basis"" used as if there were a different sort of basis for a condition. "
744,What was the experiment where you pour liquid from a tall container to a short one and ask a child which has more?,"From Developmental psychology 101 I remember an experiment where the person conducting the experiment would pour liquid from a tall, narrow container into a short, narrow container and ask a child if the volume of the liquid had changed... or something similar to that. I can't remember if it actually involved pouring the liquid or just showing two containers. I remember it was used to determine if the child had reached some critical threshold and learned a specific skill, but my memory is very hazy on the details.   Who invented this experiment? How did it work? is my description accurate? What is the name of the skill it's testing for?  "
745,Research suggesting conscious control over brain region activation?,"Has there been any research proving, disproving, or exploring the concept of conscious activation of specific brain regions?  To elaborate on this:  I've read that performing processing tasks causes the brain to reinforce that type/kind of processing or thinking.  For example, visualizing performing a task fires the same neurons as actually performing the task.  Thus, has there been research into the idea that mental models and biofeedback mechanisms can result in conscious control over the activation of particular brain regions?  For example, with biofeedback and practice, can I consciously, measurably, and significantly increase activity (blood flow, electrical activity, etc) in the frontal lobe? "
746,What is the relationship between psychological entitlement and locus of control or other personal characteristics?,I'm studying psychology and I have the assignment to write an experimental study I'm still collecting the scientific information on the topic so I would really appreciate some help.  I'm interested to know:   What is the relationship between psychological entitlement and locus of control? What scientific studies have been conducted on the relation between psychological entitlement and locus of control or some other personal characteristic?  
747,"Why is it so difficult to use a ""true mirror"" as a mirror","This Youtube video shows what a ""true mirror"" is: [website]In short, when you look into a true mirror you look at yourself (among other things) as you really are, instead of as a mirror image. That is what looking at real time video recording feels like.  But as anyone ever tried shaving or doing their makeup using a live video can tell, a true mirror makes you clumsy, to say the least. From my own experience, I find myself constantly confuse both left-right and front-back in such a case, which is interesting because a true image is just a mirror image that reverses left-right and front-back. So it seems to me some part of my brain in some sense recognizes my true image as a mirror image, and summons whatever pertinent mirror image circuits to automatically take on from there. Any other thoughts on how to explain this difficulty?  Think about this: suppose a person grows up never seeing a mirror reflection, will he be able to use a mirror for the first time? will he not be better off with a ""true mirror"" than with a mirror? If he grows up using true mirrors, will he be as clumsy with mirrors as we are with true mirrors? We feel natural and at ease dealing with mirror images. Is this just the result of practice and experience? I'm curious if a true mirror will become as natural as a mirror if one uses it for long enough.     "
748,Are good students truly good at all things?,"Source: 'Putting a Bolder Face on Google' By LAURA M. HOLSON     At a recent personnel meeting, she homes in on grade-point averages and SAT scores to narrow a list of candidates, many having graduated from Ivy League schools, whom she wanted to meet as part of a program to foster in-house talent. In essence, math is used to solve a human problem: How do you predict whether an employee has the potential for success?      A scrum of executives sit around a table, laptops in front of them, as   they sort through résumés, college transcripts and quarterly reviews.   The conversation is unemotional, at times a little brutal.      One candidate got a C in macroeconomics. “That’s troubling to me,” Ms.   [Marissa] Mayer says. “Good students are good at all things.”      Another candidate looked promising with a quarterly rating from a   supervisor of 3.5, out of 4, which meant she had exceeded her   manager’s expectations. Ms. Mayer is suspicious, however, because her   rating hasn’t changed in several quarters.   What does research indicate about this claim? For example, can a preeminent literature or law student truly struggle in math, and vice versa, or is this just a common excuse/pretext? What branch of psychology does my question here concern?  "
749,How to integrate word prediction keyboard into P300-based BCI (brain computer interface) system?,"See this question in User Experience. Farwell and Donchin (1988) described a P300 based BCI selecting letters by detecting P300 responding to the flashing letters. According to this system, only one target can be detected each time, thus only one flashing group. If we use word prediction keyboard in this system, once a letter is selected, the predicted words will appear on the screen. If next letter and the predicted words flash at the same time, the system is not able to tell which to select. What's the best way to integrate word prediction keyboard into this system? two ideas below:   to have the keyboard disappeared after a letter is selected, only leave predicted words appear on the screen. If nothing is selected in a limited time, remove the words and the keyboard comes back, subject continues to spell. same idea as above, instead of removing  the keyboard, just to stop the keyboard from flashing when the predicted words are flashing after a letter is selected.    However, both might slow down the spelling process if subjects only need words with 3 or fewer letters. Any other ideas?    Fig. 1. An example from the Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory at East Tennessee State University  [To spell the word ""DOG"", as rows and columns flash successively, the user has to count how many times the letter 'D' (the target) flashes. This results in a P300 response being generated each time the row or column containing the target flashes. The twelve-flash series is repeated a predetermined number of times. The responses for each row and column are averaged, and a classifier is applied to determine how closely each averaged response resembles the P300. The intersection of the row and column with the highest classification values is selected. In this case, the row and column containing the target letter 'D' would be selected, and a ""D"" would be presented as feedback to the user on the line below the presented word ""DOG"" at the top of the matrix.]  Farwell, L. A., &amp; Donchin, E. (1988). Talking off the top of your head: toward a mental prosthesis utilizing event-related brain potentials.

750,Evidence that positive rewards are learnt faster than negative rewards?,"Its folk psychology wisdom that its easier to reward positive behavior than punish negative behavior (e.g. any book on parenting or dog training), but is there any evidence in the cognitive science literature that this is indeed the case? And if so, then have possible mechanisms for this phenomena been proposed?  For some context, I'm asking this because coming from a computational perspective this doesn't really make sense. The typical reinforcement learning algorithm tries to maximize the expected discounted cumulative reward of behavior, and it makes no difference if that entails avoiding negative rewards or seeking out positive rewards.  "
751,"Confirmation vs peak-end bias - when does it make sense to ""save the best for last""?","This question is inspired by Should I give the interviewers surprise? on Academia.SE.  The strategy of ""save the best for last"" seems to be affected in conflicting ways by two cognitive biases:   Confirmation bias: ""the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses."" This suggests that one should try to optimize for a good first impression. Peak-end rule: ""a psychological heuristic in which people judge experiences largely based on how they were at their peak (i.e., their most intense point) and at their end."" This suggests optimizing for a good last impression.   Is there any research that offers guidance on how these biases interact in different situations?   (For example, research on how these biases are affected by the nature of an experience, or its duration, might indicate which effect is more likely to prevail in a given situation.) "
752,How do patients with Cotard's Syndrome rationalize environmental interactions?,"A patient with Cotard's Syndrome (also called ""Cotard delusion"" and ""Walking Corpse Syndrome"") has the delusion that he or she is dead (and sometimes immortal), either figuratively or literally, yet continues interacting with their environment and communicating with others.  This seems like a contradiction in it's fundamental diagnosis.  Even in this delusional state, how do they rationalize such interactions?  To converse with people, they would need to believe such people are alive or at least in a state similar to themselves.  Prior knowledge of environmental interactions and social behavior should cause some patients to reflect over their perceived delusional reality at the vary least.  How do patients with Cotard's Syndrome rationalize interactions in active environments and in social settings?   "
753,Long term effect of using noise generators,"Some people use noise generators as [website][I don't know, but I suspect that longer exposure to senseless information (noise) should have an effect on some part of the brain. I am also suspecting that if ""low-level senseless information"" (i.e. static noise) has an effect, ""high-level senseless information"" (i.e. random combinations of patterns) could have a similar effect on a deeper cognitive level, but that is wild guessing.] "
754,What happens psychologically to a Robinson Crusoe?,"In 2000 film Cast Away Tom Hanks's hero is stranded on an uninhabited island, Robinson Crusoe style, and after a while starts talking to a volleyball. And I thought: what would actually happen to a person with total social isolation (not necessarily stranded on an island)? How would their cognitive functions, behavior, mental health, skills change? There are many variables that might influence the changes happening to a person.   Time: when each psychological change starts to appear? Age: how would children, teenagers, adults and elderly differ? Socialization: what if the person simply has less social interactions? (e.g. prison, remote living) Pre-existing mental issues: how would depression, schizophrenia, personality disorders or any other disorder influence the change during isolation? Any other variable?  "
755,What is fear in humans and what does it do?,"From researching conventional understandings of fear, it can be a response to a perceived dangerous situation. But this definition seems very limited because fear seems to depend very much on context.   If someone is in a place where there is a natural disaster and there may be in clear present danger then that fear seems pretty sensible and obvious for the person to do what they can to become safe  A sportsman doing a risky activity are scared for their own safety and deal with that feeling in order to perform.  Even as I write this trying to give easy examples, these two seem very different. The first being an act of god creating fear and the second, a deliberate confrontation of fear.   What is fear? What is the effect of fear on a human? Why sometimes to humans do things that create feelings of fear? Where does it live in the mind? How /where does it persist? "
756,Pleasure and reward,"What exactly is pleasure?  Is pleasure in some sense 'thoughts'? If you are given opiates, you will feel some sort of pleasure, even if you don't think about anything, but perhaps you are having some sort of more primitive 'thoughts' that can't be detected.  Is pleasure just some sort of indicator of your neurotransmitters? Just as you might feel hot/cold, you might feel pleasure/pain. If it's not this way, and instead perhaps the previous (pleasure are some type of thoughts), then perhaps favorable levels of neurotrasmitters make pleasurable thoughts more likely to occur, explaining the correlation with neurotransmitters and various feelings.  By what way does a person decide to be pragmatic, in something like the marshmallow test? Is there some sort of pleasure that occurs, if you follow a pragmatic decision?  Or could it be that we naturally have a strong tendency to have almost obsessive thoughts of the future, and being rational about it? Meaning, we might not even get any sort of pleasure from being pragmatic - it's just something that we do, because we get repetitive thoughts of ""that's reasonable"" ? "
757,How can I understand the phenomenon of mood better?,"I have been trying to understand the psychology of liking, for example a particular object(human or non-human). But I am unable to proceed with my experiments(I am just an amateur) because I myself discover that I like things at one moment and show no interest in them some other moment in time. Most of the things I see depend also on my mood. So it is this aspect called ""mood"" upon which I request the community members to throw some light upon.  What is the psychology of mood? Are there any books or mature/good reference materials to understand this phenomenon of mood better? "
758,How can we use EEG data to predict urge of smoking?,"I am from Computer Sciences background. The problem which I want to target is to be able to successfully predict (to a degree) that a person is going to smoke in near future.   I have a brainwave sensor which gives me EEG. I am interested in using this data to predict the urge of smoking. My questions are as follows:    Is is possible to do such kind of analysis? If yes, what are the key terms I should explore to understand the relation between EEG values and urge of smoking.  If no, what should be the data which I should try to get to solve this problem?   I do not seek complete answer, I only seek pointers to helpful literature. "
759,How can we analyse user behavior to predict urge of smoking?,"The problem which I want to target is to be able to successfully predict (to a degree) that a person is going to smoke in near future.   I want to look at the relationship between chemical reactions in the body, user behavior and urge for smoking. My questions are as follows:   What happens inside the body which makes the user feel an urge to smoke. By this, I mean are there specific 'chemicals' which are released in the body? Can we measure it?  Is there a relation between user behavior and urge of smoking? If yes, please help me understand it or point me towards literature which supports the same.   Please point me towards (even remotely relevant) literature which can help me in finding answers to some of these questions.  "
760,Is the brain more active when you do something in a dream or when awake?,"If brain activity is measured using EEG, is the brain more active when asleep and dreaming of doing something or doing the same thing when awake?  Of course, if you do exercise (eg. running) when awake, it probably activates the brain much more, but what about low intensity activity, eg. dreaming of painting, etc? "
761,"As adults, is it possible for thoughts to originate from our own thinking?","We, as human beings, formulate our own thoughts and notions about everything that we perceive. As we grow up, we acquire knowledge through different means (like parents, teachers, books, movies etc.) which shape our thinking.   My question is that as an adult, if we experience something for the first time - is it possible for us to formulate thoughts about it which originate entirely from our own thinking? If yes, how can we realize it?   Example: While growing up I have seen death in many movies, read about it in many books. But in real life I experienced the death of someone close to me quite recently. I am interested in knowing that is it possible for me to understand it without getting influenced by the knowledge which I already have?   I will be thankful if it is possible to get some pointers regarding the same - how to unlearn everything we know and start afresh.  "
762,Psychology of Sympathizing with Death, Why do we sympathize in general when we see something or someone dying even if we personally don't know it/them? Is there any species other than humans which sympathize with the death of its own species? Is there any species other than humans which sympathize with the death of other species?  
763,How effective are online providers of paid participants for psychological experiments?,"I'm looking for places to recruit participants for online experiments, and in particular, for experiments using Inquisit Web. My lab used to recruit participants through M-Turk but that's no longer an option for us.  I saw similar questions:   How to use Mechanical Turk for longer studies (i.e., 30 minutes+)? Where to post online psychology studies for participant recruitment? Where to recruit paid participants for online Inquisit experiments?   While searching for a suitable platform to recruit and compensate participants online, I came across several resources:   www.findparticipants.com www.socialsci.com www.cognilab.com  (Might not be relevant for Inquisit, as they offer their own platform for experiment construction and presentation)   How effective are these resources, or alternatives in recruiting paid participants for online psychology studies? "
764,Can fMRI and EEG signals be generated from NEF models?,"The basic function of the NEF is to map the outside world onto neurons, using the firing rates of the neurons. It also supports various neuron models. Have these firing rates been used to create EEG and fMRI signals to replicate experimental data before? If so, how? "
765,Does heritability define the person in terms of the population?,I recently read a statement that goes like this: heritability is a population construct. Isn't heritability dependent on genetic differences? Can someone provide an example of what it means to be a population construct? Thanks 
766,Why is sensory substitution not that successful?,"By successful, I mean made it out to the large world market or being massively funded. After looking online it seems that the most relevant research is the one done by Bach-y-Rita about the seeing with tongue in the 70's. Since then there were no significant breakthroughs. Is there a reason for that? Did someone prove that brain plasticity is limited? "
767,Is 'intuition' related to 'extrasensory perception'?,"I come from a computer science background and am a big time AI enthusiast. I am trying to think about how can we map 'intuition' to a process in artificial intelligence. As I understand, 'intuition' means generating (correct) knowledge (for ourselves) about something without knowing 'how' we did it. This leads to the following questions:   Is 'intuition' related to 'extrasensory perception' (ESP)? As far as I know, ESP is not accepted by the scientific community but I could not conclude the same about 'intuition'.  If they are related, how does scientific community explain 'intuition'?    I seek pointers to relevant literature which would help me understand intuition from the perspective of cognitive sciences. My thought process has inclined me towards believing that there is nothing like 'intuition' and everything is deterministic which is why an AI can never be intuitive. "
768,Success cause passion more than passion cause success,"What are the good psychology studies about this hypothesis ?  From an evolutionary standpoint, it would makes sense on a group level. When a few people starts doing a new thing, if one a them sees that he is better at it than the other directly around him, he would have a greater probability to like doing this new thing. The group would be composed of more specialized people each good at what they do, and therefore with better surviving chances.  Where is it possible to find resources about this subject ?  "
769,What is the evolutionary purpose of envy?,"I am seeking for a general explanation within the context of evolutionary psychology.   1) What is the purpose of envy?  2) Is it safe to assume that experiences with envy should reach a maximum during  peak reproductive years? Is it a causal relationship, or just correlation?  (To add to the above: At least in modern societies, where basic survival has been for the most part dealt with, how often can envy be ultimately traced back and attributed to primordial instincts?)  I also have a more specific question, which is the following:  3) In the context of a romantic relationship, assuming there are no other potential mates as external threats, and the two partners are not competing for resources in the same domain, are there any reasons for which romantic partners could be envious of each other?  I am not a psychologist, so please feel free to edit the question if you think it lacks specificity. "
770,Can stress be sustained without reflective thought processes,"My question is whether the feeling of stress goes away progressively in the absence of reflective thought.   Example: you notice someone looking at you and think ""maybe I have something on my face"". Let us assume that this produces stress. If you do not use your internal dialog or any kind of visualization etc., is there any way that the stress can continue/grow or will it inevitably subside?  Has there been any research on this? "
771,How many dendrite connections vs axon terminals does a multipolar cerebral neuron have?,"I find countless places stating that neurons have tens of thousands of ""connections"" or ""synapses"" and one axon.  Do neurons have tens of thousands of dendrite connections, and a few axon terminals; or a few dendrite connections and tens of thousands of axon terminals; or tens of thousands of each?  When a neuron's action potential is triggered, how many other neurons does it affect? "
772,What are the practical uses of ontologies?,"I have read many papers and books about ontologies, and I am trying to figure out that how they are used in a real project. For example, how can the ontology for a soccer player robot can be defined and used with a cognitive architecture in order to make it intelligent?  Are ontologies relations between terms in that domain of knowledge (for example relation between the ball and foot word, and physical rules definition and their relation with the foot and ball movement) or relations between tactics, strategies and different mixture of tactics?  Are there any clear examples of ontology usage in real projects and their combining usage with the cognitive architectures like ACT-R for augmenting the cognitive architecture? "
773,Is it conceivable to transmit all sound information in the tactile modality?,"You may have heard of Evelyn Glennie, an acclaimed solo virtuoso percussionist. She has been profoundly deaf from the age of 12, but learned to differentiate pitch tactilely. She had absolute pitch, which obviously helped. She plays bare feet in order ""to hear"".   She can also help accoustical engineers, as she can sense the air pressure.  In her TED talk, she describes that she hears music like everybody. There seem to be no doubts that she has the same perception of music than any other great musician when the sound information, in the form of vibration, can be treated by her musical brain.  This seems to show that musical information can be accurately transmitted through tactile vibration. My question : is it conceivable to transmit all sound information in the tactile modality ?  Are tactile detectors sufficiently sensitive to let through all/most of the sound information ?    I guess language is very particular and it would be impossible to differentiate words directly from sound vibrations, but maybe the sound signal could be modified in a way to make speech sounds more distinguishable.  If possible, I guess it could have great applications, helping deaf people, and maybe enabling communication in noisy environment. "
774,"What is so ""potential"" about action potentials?","When an action potential is propagating through a neuron, it seems to me that the time for ""potential of action"" is over, and that we are now just in a state of ""action"". Why don't we just call action potentials ""action""? Where is the potential for action when the neuron itself is undergoing action? In fact, when a neuron is at rest, it is said to have a ""resting potential"". To me this seems more like a ""resting state"" and an ""action state"". So what is so potential about ""action potentials""? "
775,Explanatory gaps in the formation and propagation of action potentials,"To my understanding, the steps of an action potential are as follows:   The neuron is at rest--there is a negative charge (K ions) inside the cell, and a positive charge (Na ions) outside the cell. Pumps work hard, pumping in K and pumping out Na to maintain this polarization. Excitatory NTs bind with the dendrites. As soon as it's over a certain threshold it triggers an action potential. The inside of the cell depolarizes, and the depolarized ""chunk"" propagates through the axon.   Now here's my confusion:  A. How do neurotransmitters manage to depolarize the inside of the cell? Do they force the cell to give up pumping out Na ions? Do the neurotransmitters themselves contain positively charged ions that the ion pumps are not sensitive to?  B. When the cell depolarizes, the electrical impulse travels down the axon. When this happens, Na+ and K+ ions rapidly pass through the membrane as the signal fires. (Like this picture) [website]Why are ions being pumped in and out of the axon in such a way to propagate an action potential? Why isn't it just a positively charged signal running through the axon, without regard to the outside environment? (please let me know if this is unclear!) "

777,Dearth of research on treating Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) with Baclofen,"[website]The above study from 1984 at Stanford found that oral administration of baclofen somewhat improved sleep in patients with PLM-associated arousals. The results seem fairly positive, with the finding essentially that although baclofen increased the number of PLMs, it decreased their amplitude, and decreased the length of the arousals associated with PLMs.   My question then is why does there seem to be no follow-up research on the treatment of PLMD (i.e. arousals caused by PLMs) with baclofen? I understand that RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) is accompanied by PLMS in about 80% of RLS cases, and since dopaminergics and anti-convulsants are generally more effective treatment for RLS than are muscle relaxants (like baclofen) the research on RLS and baclofen is not extensive. But in cases of PLM-associated arousals unaccompanied by sensations of restlessness (RLS), why is there no further research on the seemingly promising treatment of baclofen? "
778,Dichotic listening tasks and crosstalk,"In a dichotic listening task where participants listen to different (frequency-wise) musical tones through headphones, is cross talk to the contralateral cochlea of each ear through bone conduction a source of noise to be taken into consideration, or is it insignificant? If it is a source of noise, are there any ways to eliminate physically or computationally any such effect? "

780,How do I choose the correct sigma when applying a Gaussian filter to a fixation density map?,"I am currently analysing some eye tracking data which I recorded in the lab.  For my fixation density maps I calculate tables showing the number of times participants made a fixation at a specific coordinate on the screen. I then filter them with a gaussian filter (with the matlab function imgaussfilter), however I am not sure how to choose sigma sensibly. I would like to adapt to a paper I based my experiment on. In the paper they used a '2D circular Gaussian Kernel with 0.5° full width at half maximum'. I am not fully sure what this means. Does degree mean visual degree? How can I transfer this to my analysis?  Best regards,  Anna "
781,Is there any reason why chunking the digit span test would not help,"Is there any reason why chunking the digit span test would not help, and what is the average score without chunking? By chunking I mean any rehearsal besides saying the numbers one time as they appear.  I asked a similar question already:  Does the digit span test draw on any executive functions besides working memory, if &quot;chunking&quot; is not used?  Just intrigued why chunking might not work as well (and it's trivial that it won't always work as well), or not at all. "
782,Is the negative correlation between (higher) moral judgement and authoritarianism and/or ethnocentrism confirmed?,"I found an interesting 1989 study by van Ijzendoorn [negatively] correlating the level of moral judgment, measured using Kohlberg dilemmas, with some measure of authoritarianism and another of ethnocentrism:     Although much has been written about the moral basis of authoritarianism,   empirical research on the relationship between moral judgment level and   authoritarian and ethnocentric attitudes has been sparse. In this study, I hypothesized   that higher levels of moral judgment are related to anti-authoritarian and antiethnocentric   attitudes, whereas lower moral levels predict the presence of authoritarian   and ethnocentric opinions. Dutch university students (n = 126) and high school   students (n = 88) completed the Sociomoral Reflection Objective Measure (SROM)   and scales for authoritarianism and ethnocentrism. Results in the two samples converge:   Moral judgment level indeed appears to be related to authoritarianism in the   expected direction and—to a lesser extent—to ethnocentrism äs well.   Have these findings (either for authoritarianism or ethnocentrism) been confirmed in other studies?  (The ethnocentrism scale used by van Ijzendoorn seems pretty obscure; it was only published in Dutch. He used a Dutch version of Adorno's F scale for authoritarianism.)  There's also a World Values Survey nowadays:     Much of the variation in human values between societies boils down to two broad dimensions: a first dimension of “traditional vs. secular-rational values” and a second dimension of “survival vs. self-expression values.”   On the first dimension, traditional values emphasize religiosity, national pride, respect for authority, obedience and marriage. Secular-rational values emphasize the opposite on each of these accounts. [...]   That seems to suggest that in such more ""traditional"" societies, people would ""fail"" the Kohlberg dilemmas more often. Is that actually the case? (This would be an indirect way to confirm van Ijzendoorn's findings.) "
783,Where can I find recent research on the role of context effect in perception of similarity?,"BACKGROUND. I’m writing a paper on the role of similarity in the theories of concept empiricism developed by the British Empiricists Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, and how the idea of context effect from modern cognitive psychology could be used to better understand these theories. The basic idea I’d like to develop in my paper is that similarity is contextual, relative to a frame of reference, and this can explain how a general abstract idea (on Locke’s theory of abstraction) or a set of similar ideas held together in the mind that are called up by awareness of an exemplar (on Berkeley and Hume’s theory of general ideas) can be formed from particular instances none of which are identical: while not identical, they are similar to each other in a certain context, relative to a certain frame of reference, and thus can be classified together by the mind (e.g. scarlet and crimson are not identical but are similar to each other, in context, relative to aquamarine; or mammals are all different from each other but similar to each other relative to birds; or birds and mammals are different but relative to plants are similar. Etc.)  QUESTION. I am unfamiliar with cognitive psychology and the literature on context effect. Where can I find recent papers on context effect? What is the best way to go about finding references, especially with experimental data, on context effect? I am aware of a paper which discusses context effect very well (Tversky, A. (1977). Features of similarity. Psychological review, 84, 327-352 doi: 10.1037/0033-295X.84.4.327). However, I’d appreciate any help I could get on finding more recent work on this phenomenon, preferably (but not necessarily) which further develops or supports Tversky. "

787,Frissons on demand,"Have you ever listened to music and it gives you ""chills?"" This response is called a ""frisson,"" a french word meaning ""to shiver.""  When I want to access certain emotional and inspirationally charged visualisations I get frissons that I can create or stop at will. I practice this exercise when I need a quick energy/mood boost. It feels very calming and relaxing, as if pure wave-like energy is ebbing and flowing - pulsating throughout my body.   [tex] What percentage of people experience frissons?  [tex] What percentage of people can create frissons at will?  Wikipedia says about this topic:     Frisson (French for 'shiver') is a sensation somewhat like shivering, usually caused by stimuli other than cold. It is typically expressed as an overwhelming emotional response combined with piloerection (goosebumps). Stimuli that produce a response are specific to the individual.   Frisson is of short duration, usually no more than 4–5 seconds, usually pleasurable.[1] Typical stimuli include loud passages of music and passages that violate some level of musical expectation.[2]   Found this article about ""voluntary piloerection:""  [website]"
788,What if MBTI differs a lot for short-term and long-term lifestyle?,"Regarding the famous MBTI test, I am confused about how stable are the four indicators?  As of my experience, most people are certain whether they are introverted or extroverted. For the other three indicators, however, for some people it differs a lot for short-term and long-term actions. For example, I know a lot of people who are:   Extremely XNFP for short-time actions (e.g. what to do for tonight). They procrastinate a lot and do stuff based on their feelings. but at the same time are extremely conservative and XSTJ for important life decisions (e.g. choosing a career, finding a research topic, etc.). Their such decisions are almost accurate and based on logical reasoning.   How could we effectively use MBTI interpretations for such people? "
789,What pro- or anti-environmental behaviors are feasible to measure objectively rather than with self-report?,"One of the central challenges in understanding pro-environmental behavior is measurement. Currently, most researchers (including myself) lean on self-report of behavior.  I'm looking for a brainstorm. What kinds of pro-environmental behaviors might be realistically measured by researchers? I think there's room for more creativity. I'd love to hear some ideas. For example, recycling bins have been measured at the curb for weight (time-consuming), electrical meters have been read by students (time-consuming), household water usage has been measured by partnering with a water district (long-term negotiation due to privacy).... there are also laboratory tasks such as recycling, donation, and turning out the lights, but these are lower-quality measures because they only occur once.  There's room here for more creativity. What other pro- or anti-environmental behaviors can be observed by researchers in the real world or in an online survey? I'm looking for a brainstorm, not a literature review. I work in this area and know the key papers well. Thank you for any suggestions! "

792,Are there researched approaches to learning a subject more quickly?,"TLDR at bottom.  So from my knowledge(correct me if I'm wrong) there is no evidence to suggest that we can improve general intelligence. But what about improving skills/intuition in specialized fields like programming or mathematics?   I went through this course on coursera called Learning how to learn by Barbara Oakley(engineering professor) who suggests the following to quickly learn new subjects:    Pomodoro technique 25 minutes study 5 min break Eliminate Distractions Do not neglect memory training. Recalling what you have studied is a great way to learn. Practice and consistency.  Cramming is bad - it takes time to 'build neural chunks' as she says. I wasn't sure if this was based off of actual science or just conceptual.    I do not like method 1 at all from my experience. Often times when I am going through technical textbooks and I have a timer randomly go off on me at 25 minutes in the session, I find myself jumping from my seat and my productivity wanes. However, timers at around 45 minutes(where my brain seems to slow down) does not have this kind of effect.  But in Cal Newports Deep Work book, he suggests:   Absolutely no distractions. Even delete social media from your life. Isolation can be a very ideal way of achieving deep levels of focus  Be consistent. Do not tap in to willpower Use 'rituals' to turn the deep work mode on.    From my experience, point 1 has severely reduced my ADHD symptoms and as a result my productivity has greatly improved. But even then, I still wonder to myself how much validity there are to these two professors approaches? Neither are neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, or psychology professors. I want to know if there is some kind of research, evidence(strong or weak), that there are more effective approaches to learning a specific field at a much faster pace. I have also read summaries of 'Peak' by Anders Erikson who is an apparent authority in this topic but I still haven't found anything eye opening.   Basically, is it possible to learn a subject at a much faster pace through the use of different studying techniques such as mnemonics, spaced repetition, etc. "
793,Correlation between anxiety disorders and PTSD,"The mega study on the genetic correlations of psychiatric (and neurological) disorders published in Science this summer has one interesting non-correlation: between anxiety disorders and PTSD.

794,Definition of cognitive load,"Wikipedia's page on cognitive load starts with     In cognitive psychology, cognitive load refers to the effort being used in the working memory. Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. [...]   The page does not seem well written because it quickly gets to odd specifics like:     High cognitive load in the elderly has been shown to affect their center of balance.[5]    Is that first quote a good definition or is too narrow? Is cognitive load really all about working memory? "
795,What is the name of the phenomenon that would make me choose A over B because I was influenced by a trend?,"I've looked at these 1,2,3 and I don't think they answer my question fully.  Let's say it's election time and I'm on the fence about who to vote for. I see some survey on the news and seeing party A has more vote intentions, it tends to sway my decision towards party A.  Closer to home, I see a question or answer on SE and I may feel swayed to vote +1 or -1 if there are pre-existing votes that have been cast.   What would this phenomenon be called (if there is a name for it other than simple influence or conformity)? Also, can there be a bias for going against what the current trend is?  "
796,How is the human brain evolving?,"I came across this article which states that brain takes about 20% of the body's energy. This is quite a lot compared to its size. Somewhere I read that even if this is a lot, this must be an absolute requirement otherwise by the theory of evolution, such high energy requirement brains would already have been eliminated.  My question is we know evolution is never stationary, so what is the recent trend (last 4000-5000 years) in the usage of brain energy? To me only 2 cases are possible (in an evolutionary stable sense):   We are evolving to require less brain power for the same functionality, but the size of functionality remains same (i.e. we are able to think the same thing with same power requirement). We are evolving to require more brain power for the same functionality, but the size of functionalities increase(i.e. we are now able to think the bigger things but the power requirement increases).   I might be wrong in the above 2 statements or it may seem redundant, but I am drawing parallels to IC's here in a broader sense.  Also can these generalisations be extended to the evolution of animal brain also?  Any kind of speculative answer based on logic would also be nice. "
797,Find the panda among snowmen!,"  I just saw this picture puzzle, and found it easily by doing a row-by-row scan, but it seems harder to find it just by looking around. I was thinking that the puzzle was intentionally designed to draw attention away from the correct location, by the following features:   Every snowman is different and its nose points in an apparently arbitrary direction, so as to prevent any uniformity that would give the panda away. A sizeable fraction of the snowmen have extra things like scarves, hats, bow-ties and and even candy sticks, most of which are also brightly coloured. These distract the viewer as they automatically spend more time looking at these oddities, especially those with patterns. (Saccades tend to concentrate about them.) The panda ears are almost the same size as the buttons on the chest of each snowman, and the snowmen themselves are positioned such that many of them have their buttons appearing just above the snowmen in front of them at about where the ears should be.   So I was wondering what are the psychological processes that facilitate such visual misdirection. Is it just the saccade mechanism? My second question is whether there are more convincing examples. For other kinds of visual illusions there are plenty of unambiguous examples, but this one does not feel like an illusion as the task is just to find something. "

800,Can someone who is never speaking of himself and present himself as very altruistic be egocentric / narcissistic?,"I've tried to make some searches on egocentrism and its opposite (Allocentrism).  The definitions from Wikipedia are:      Egocentrism is the inability to differentiate between self and other.   More specifically, it is the inability to untangle subjective schemas   from objective reality; an inability to understand or assume any   perspective other than their own.      Although egocentrism and narcissism appear similar, they are not the   same. A person who is egocentric believes they are the center of   attention, like a narcissist, but does not receive gratification by   one's own admiration. An egotist is a person whose ego is greatly   influenced by the approval of others while a narcissist is not.      Allocentrism is a collectivistic personality attribute whereby people   center their attention and actions on other people rather than   themselves.   But since the prosocial actions are often motivated by ego needs (see Polatch effect for the extreme) can we say that among extreme idealistic people (i.e. militants in extreme organizations) we can find Narcissists as well?   A narcissist has absence of self-compassion, he thinks to be perfect. Is there a correlation between some form of Narcissism and altruism?  EDIT: I found this     “(The) Israeli zoologist Amotz Zahavi (suggested that) (a)ltruistic   giving may be an advertisement of dominance and superiority.   Anthropologists know it as the Potlach Effect ...  Only a genuinely   superior individual can afford to advertise the fact by means of a   costly gift ... through costly demonstrations of superiority,   including ostentatious generosity and public spirited risk taking...   (I)f Zahavi is right ... conspicuous generosity (is) a way of buying   unfakeably authentic (self-)advertising.”   (any help at improving the question is very welcome) "
801,When does the brain 'switch on'?,I am pursuing Computational Neuro-Science and learning about human Brain. After some reading I got this doubt that when does the brain actually gets switched on?

802,are statistic results of these two questions equal?,"I am trying to make better user experience for my poll application and one of ideas I have for this is breaking multi choices poll to binary polls.  Is statistical result of a question with these 4 options (a or b or c or d) equals with sum of statistical results of these 6 binary questions?:  (a or b), (a or c), (a or d), (b or c), (b or d), (c or d)  assume I ask these questions from separate people and I ask these questions equally  for example: assume we have a society with 1000 members if we ask all of them the first question, people will answer it with this distribution: a:60%, d:20%, b:15%, c:5%  now assume if we ask those six binary questions from all members of that society and then we sum each vote of winners of each of those questions.  we ask 1000 times a or b and answer is a:600,b:400  we ask 1000 times a or c and answer is a:500,c:500  we ask 1000 times a or d and answer is a:100,d:900 ....)  we sum number of votes on a and it is 1300 =600+500+100  we do similar thing with b,c and d, is this result similar with result of first question?(a:60%, d:20%, b:15%, c:5% ) and is meaning of this result similar with first one? ===update=== @Bruno mention to inconsistency of result of this approach and I think it can be solved if we do not show all combination to all voters. If voter1 chooses ""a"" between ""a"" and ""b"" we do not show questions with any combination of  ""b"".  "
803,How does one explain the irrational fear of approaching problems?,"There is a particular problem I've had since as long as I can remember , but I always managed to shove it to the back of my head and ignore, albeit acknowledging its existence.  I'll provide a bit of relevant background regarding the particular areas in which this issue has profoundly affected me. I'm quite fond of different areas of mathematics and I dare say I'm proficient in at least one of those.  But I've always encountered this shortcoming. Any time I'm supposed to attack a new problem or teach myself a new concept, I feel like a wall rises right in front of me. If I don't see the solution right away I get terrified, especially when I'm in public. Even when I'm by myself at home I find it incredibly hard to just lay some thoughts on the paper if I'm not completely sure of the next logical step in the process of finding a solution.  I get a terrible mixed feeling, one one side itching to solve the problem, on the other side this damned blockage that prevents from going all in.  This made me ask myself ? How is it that I got good with calculus ? And now I realize...what I've been doing all along was looking for solutions of my problems online before trying to even attempt solving a problem and . I haven't told anyone about this because I feel so, so awfully ashamed by it.. But now I'm desperate for help.  By some mysterious process, this made me one of the best mathematics students in my university (CS undergrad). Even though I've absorbed and emulated others' way of thinking I manage to see simple and elegant solutions to a larger number of problems than my peers who've worked so much harder.  At this point, I feel like this irrational fear or mental obstruction suffocates me and stands in my way of truly becoming as good as I hope to become.   This all boils down to :    Why am I so afraid of simply trying ?  What can I do?    It would mean the world to me if you could help, I didn't know where else to go. If you need any clarifications, please feel free to ask. Also, if you can't formulate any advise, I would also appreciate suggestions to  materials/papers that might encapsulate my issue.  Thank you!  "
804,Does the brain generate identical words in different languages similarly?,"Saying (or even just thinking) a word or phrase results from activity in multiple regions of your brain. Of course, we can measure/'map' this activity to some degree; From wikipedia:     EEG measures the brain's electrical activity directly, while other methods record changes in blood flow (e.g., SPECT, fMRI) or metabolic activity (e.g., PET, NIRS), which are indirect markers of brain electrical activity.   The question is, just how precise is this mapping? Is it precise enough to answer the following question? (and if so, has anyone examined it)?  I'm curious if the same word or thought in different languages is produced by the same pattern of brain activity?   For example: does ""hello"" for a native English speaker generate the same signal response as a Spanish speaker saying ""hola""?    More generally, I guess the question I'm asking is: are the signals/activity generated by the brain to create language driven more by the phonetics/orthographics/structure of a word or the meaning/connotation of that word/concept?    Can we quantify that person x speaking the greeting ""hello"" is more/less similar to a Spanish speaker saying ""hola"" than, say, both speakers saying ""a"" (in English a is an article; in Spanish a is equivalent to the English ""to"")?     Two notes / caveats:   I would assume that the same word in different languages would generate different signals in the same individual (i.e., one who comprehends the meaning of the word in both languages). Though perhaps this isn't true (which could also be very interesting). Of course perhaps sex, gender, age, or even just general variation between individuals (or even variation within an individual) might produce slightly different activity signals for the same task/word.

805,Can forgetting labor pain be an evolutionary advantage as animals don't know how to avoid labor?,"I've often heard the claim that women are forgetting, or remembering labour and birth pain as being less severe. Some people say that this mechanism has an evolutionary advantage, as if it didn't exist women would avoid having more babies...  Is this explanation possible? I'm assuming most animals don't know the relation between contraception and labor, so they won't be able to avoid labor even if they wanted...  How long have humans been aware of this relation, and is it possible that evolution has been able to work in that time-span? "

In other words: Is the capacity of the brain (or just too much chaotic data densed together) sometimes a significant factor for an individual's inteligence? Is something practically not worth remembering?  
810,How can a persons good or bad be accurately measured?,"The majority of people who think certain people are bad people are usually because they have been exposed to the bad things they do or also because they measure how bad they are based on only the bad things they do, and vice versa with good. There's several very ethically and morally good people that would never be able to harm anyone regardless of circumstance but there's also good people (on the same scale as the previous example) that (like me) would not think twice about killing someone if it came to a life or death situation or something similar. How could a persons real good or bad be evaluated in an approach that would be decorrelated of errors, unbiased, and as accurate as possible? Would it be best to weigh their wrongdoings?the good things they do? Both? How would they be weighed to provide the most accurate result? "
811,Is Behaviorism incompatible with Cognitive Psychology?,"Both disciplines have historically been at each other's throats, and Radical Behaviorists like B.F. Skinner often completely reject cognitive psychology at a philosophical level.  It seems that today Behaviorism has largely fallen by the wayside but certain principles like Operant Conditioning remain entirely valid.   Are these two philosophies/schools of thought incompatible or part of a greater whole? Is Behaviorism still relevant? "
812,Does caffeine improve performance for habituated consumers?,"I've seen a fair few studies over the while that suggest caffeine increases arousal in the short term and that for some tasks, this will also increase performance (there's a few citations here).  However, as with most drugs, habituation leads to withdrawal effects and adjustment, so that in some senses once a person gets used to caffeine, having a regular dose of caffeine may just bring a person to something like a normal level of functioning.  Thus, in a general sense,  for someone used to consuming a certain level of caffeine, does having that regular quantity increase arousal or performance over and above the level that would be obtained at that moment had the person never got in the habit of consuming caffeine in the first place? "
813,What type of learning mechanism produces a consistent typo?,"There is a typographical error that I make and do so every time I try to type a certain word. Whenever I try to type remember, I type remeber. I do this every time. This is different to a regular typo because most typos happen at random, whereas this mistake is guaranteed to occur. It's not a spelling mistake, because I know how to spell remember, I just don't press all the required keys.  Could it be related to touch-typing? I don't make the typo when I peck out the keys.  I wonder whether it is related to muscle memory, because there are many words with the pattern 'e_e', such as here, there, gene, theme, scene, etc. So where I reach the second e my motor system is primed not to push the key that came before, i.e. m.  It seems that knowledge of spelling and knowledge of typing are not strongly linked in this case.  Is there a mechanism by which I have learnt this mistake? "
814,How to measure emotional intensity?,"This is a follow-up question to: Do people feel emotions less strongly as they grow older?  Basically - I'm wondering - has anyone ever made an empirical measurement of how strongly someone felt happiness, sadness, anger or grief? Is it also possible to compare intensities of emotion between different people? And if so, how? "
815,Perception of time as a function of age,"For many people time seems to run faster as they get older. That is, for an old person an hour, a day or a year seems to be shorter than for a young person.  Is there any hard data for such phenomenon? And if so, what is the cause?  To name a few possibilities it can be about the reaction time (so one have more or less 'turns' in a minute), the relative time comparing to one's age, ways in which memory changes with age or habits (younger may live more active life). Of course, there may be different causes for different time scales. However, I haven't found anything but anecdotal data and home-made theories. "
816,Motivation vs Goal Oriented Behavior,"What's the difference between these two terms when used in the context of cognitive psychology? To the best of my knowledge, research on 'Goal Oriented Behavior' refers to the subset of motivation that involves translating explicitly construed goals into actions the agent can perform in order to accomplish these goals (e.g. means-ends analysis). However, its hard for me to grasp when this is not the case insofar as theories of motivation are concerned.  So are these terms effectively synonyms with 'Goal Oriented Behavior' simply being the more modern verbiage? Or is 'Goal Oriented Behavior' a special subset of Motivation? Or is the relationship between the two terms something else entirely (perhaps each is used in a different field of study). "
817,Is procrastination greater when skill is low and rewards offer low status boost and does this lead to efficient  task allocation in groups?,"I am very interested in procrastination, because it is such a clear sign of lack of motivation. I have a hypothesis about why we procrastinate, which I would like to get tested by you.  The assumption for this hypothesis is that we are more likely to procrastinate on tasks, which we are not good at, or which does not yield a sufficiently large boost in status.  If this assumption is correct, then I believe that a group of people, where all members are able to do all tasks, would become more efficient if those group members who were less efficient at solving a task would procrastinate and never get it done, so it could get solved by someone who is better at it. Similarly, it would be good if the whole group procrastinate on tasks, which do not yield a sufficiently large boost in status, because this way the group can allocate more status to tasks that are more important and this way avoid having the members do tasks, which they just felt like doing.  Questions   Are individuals more likely to procrastinate on tasks that they are not good at? Are individuals more likely to procrastinate on tasks when the rewards in terms of status boost for successfully completing the task are low? Does procrastination serve a functional role in efficiently allocating tasks in groups?  "
818,What is the definition of sanity? How can I prove someone either sane or insane?,"In my experience the definition of insanity is thus:     Insanity: The state of being seriously mentally ill, mad, and/or irrational.   Is there a proper scientific definition of this term? While mentally ill is relatively easily to pin down, the others criteria seem subjective.   Is there any test or method that can be used to prove a subject to be either sane or insane? How can any such test give objectively accurate results for this or another similar definition of insanity?  "
819,Do female victims of rape have an increased risk of becoming a sex offender?,"It's said that men who are molested as children often become molestors when they get older. Is the same true of women who are raped? Is a female victim of rape more likely to become sexually warped in some way, e.g. initiating incest, pursuing children, dressing ""slutty"", protecting someone who molests children?  I figure if it's true that male victims of sexual assault often become predators, then it's likely true of female victims of sexual assault as well. The victims become the victimizers. "
820,"Why is the order of brainwaves not labelled ""alphabetically""?","The brainwave - frequency breakdown is as follows:   Delta wave – (0.1 – 3 Hz) Theta wave – (4 – 7 Hz) Alpha wave – (8 – 15 Hz) Mu wave – (7.5 – 12.5 Hz) SMR wave – (12.5 – 15.5 Hz) Beta wave – (16 – 31 Hz) Gamma wave – (32 – 100 Hz)   Just looking at the greek names, we're going: delta, theta, alpha, mu, beta, gamma (in order of ascending Hz).  Why don't we just relabel them as: mu(0.1-3Hz), theta, delta, gamma, beta, alpha(32-100Hz)? This seems to make more sense to me because the names are now ordinal, like the greek alphabet. Is there a reason that neuroscientists don't care about the order of the greek alphabet? "
821,Is being less emotional a bad thing for motivation?,"We know that emotions increase motivation. The stronger feelings, the more motivated we get to do something about it. We know that humans differ a lot in how emotional we are. In theory that should imply that less emotional people have less motivation in general. Are there any research studies on how much emotions affect our motivation, or how much motivation differs from different people? Or possibly research studies on personality types that are more/less eager to get things done than the average?  For those who need sources to believe that emotions and motivation are linked:  From the study ""EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN LEARNING: CURRENT RESEARCH, FUTURE DIRECTIONS, AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS""     (...) Without emotion and motivation there would be no learning. Emotional   states are integral parts of the adaptive process of learning, which   includes attaching value to objects and events (both outside and   inside oneself), based on a set of needs. (...)      In short, emotion and motivation relate to internal states that are    relevant in the management of goals. For example, motivation has been   defined as modulating and coordinating influence on the direction,   vigor, and composition of behavior (Shizgal, 2003). In line with this   reasoning, emotion is seen as an evaluating response of an event as   relevant to a goal; it is positive when the goal is advanced, negative   when the goal is impeded (Oatley, 2003). Thus, it has been argued that   the key function of emotions in a learning perspective is to decouple   the individual from the necessity to respond unconditionally (Scherer,   2001). As will be discussed below, emotions also embody a crucial part   of the learning process by influencing the associations that are   formed between stimuli, their combinations and behavioral responses. (...)      Studies also show that the emotional intensity, measured as arousal, of a stimuli or a situation increases the allocated attention (e.g. Armory et al., 2002). (...)      Evaluative conditioning (EC) illustrates an active research paradigm within this tradition.   EC combines emotional evaluations and higher order cognitive constructs. (...)   [website]From the study ""The impact of emotion on perception, attention, memory, and decision-making"":     (...) neuropsychological studies have shown that patients with emotional dysfunctions due to brain lesions can be highly impaired in everyday decision-making and social interactions.   Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated how brain regions previously thought to be purely “emotional” (e.g., amygdala) or “cognitive” (e.g., frontal cortex) closely interact to make complex behaviour possible.   Psychology experiments have illustrated how emotion can change our perception, attention, and memory by focusing them on important aspects of the environment. This research has revealed to what extent emotion and cognition are related, or even inseparable. (...)      We define emotion as an event-focused process consisting of (a) specific elicitation mechanisms based on the relevance of a stimulus that (b) shape an emotional response instantaneously across several organismic subsystems, including motivational changes (changes in action tendency, such as approach versus withdrawal), physiological changes (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance), changes in motor expression (in face, voice, and body), and changes in subjective feeling [3, 4]. Emotions are elicited as the individual continuously evaluates objects, events and situations with respect to their relevance for his/her needs, goals, values, and general well-being (appraisal). The detection of a relevant event elicits an adaptive emotional response that mobilises resources that allow the individual to cope with the situation.      When faced with a choice, we evaluate the options, weigh the possible consequences and their probabilities, and choose an option, and are confronted with the consequences. Expected emotions may influence our evaluation of behavioural options (for example, I may expect to be very happy once I buy the new luxury car, or I may have a gut feeling that it’s better to avoid a certain car dealer) and thus inform the choice at hand. Once a decision has been taken, the immediate consequences will also elicit emotions such as joy, relief, regret or disappointment, which may inform future choices or lead us to modify our current choice.      However, recent research has shown that emotion is central to the decision-making process, both as an input and an output [43]. Decisions and their consequences result in emotions (such as joy, relief, regret, or disappointment), and many of our choices are guided by the experience of these emotions or the anticipation of the emotions that may be elicited [interestingly, however, we are not very good at predicting which emotions we will feel in the future, see 44].      According to the somatic marker hypothesis [48], our choices and decisions are informed by bodily reactions that are triggered by emotion. These so-called somatic markers are body states that have been elicited by rewards or punishments in the past and been associated with certain situations or choices. When a person is deliberating several behavioural options, the physiological reactions associated to previous choices are re-enacted or anticipated in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and may inform the current decision, e.g., by helping us reject less advantageous options.      Conclusions   Our review of recent research from the Affective Sciences shows that the duality of reason versus emotion that has been propagated for a long time is not reflected in the architecture of the brain and the functioning of the mind. Emotion and cognition are closely intertwined, complex human behaviour emerges from dynamic interactions between multiple processes and brain networks. Emotion determines how we perceive our world, how we remember it, and which decisions we take. Like any other complex system, emotion may go awry, as illustrated for example by exaggerated attentional bias to threat in anxiety [23] or preferential memory for negative events in depression [56]. However, when functioning normally, emotion should be considered as useful guide, far from being irrational, that helps us navigate our complex environment.   [website]"
822,How to derive the generalization bounds for the classical perceptron model?,"I thank all the commenters for the valuable feedback. I'm trying to improve this question (which I had long ago -- omg I'm getting old).  Is there a way to simply derive the generalization bounds for the classical perceptron model? More specifically, how to derive the maximum number of patterns that a N-large perceptron can store? And in the case of an NxN network of neurons, how to derive the number of patterns (or memories) and their basins of attractions? Are there simple methods, other than the ones invoking replica theory, as it's done in Gardner's works?  More details:  I'm basically referring to the great work of Elizabeth Gardner in this matter. I find that her work is often overlooked in the field of neuroscience, arguably because it is too difficult to understand its mathematical derivation. Yet, her results are so fundamental that many in the field are aware of them.  I couldn't find anywhere a simple explanation of her derivation and the implications of her results, in a terminology that also undergrads could also understand. Of course, I couldn't come up with one myself either. I suppose ""Field Theory for Dummies"" applied to theoretical neuroscience is what I'm really asking for...  See: Gardner, E.

823,"The mathematics of dreams, or better, the dreaming of mathematics","I know that the meaning of dreams is a controversial topic and I do not think that they have a specific meaning, although I am certain, by experience, that dreams are deeply connected with what happens to us in everyday life. That is, most dreams are personal and thus an objective study of dreams would seem a bit of a paradox to me. In any case, I might already have shown my ignorance in the cognitive sciences by giving my misinformed opinion, but I am writing here to ask you how it is possible to prove a relatively simple mathematical theorem in a dream, which happened to me this early morning shortly before waking up. Proving a mathematical theorem is extremely complex, on a cognitive base, how is it possible to prove it while sleeping? My idea was that I registered the theorem and I had it embedded somewhere in my memory and this night it just bubbled up, with no rational implication. What do you think? "

826,Accuracy of methods for detection of dementia in EEG,"I found these methods mentioned in bioengineering and other papers:  Fractal Dimension Measure, Probability Density Function of the Zero-crossing Intervals, Approximate Entropy  But I think every of that method has multiple variants and I have no idea if that methods really work, and if they work with artefacts in EEG or not (sometimes it is not clear from papers proposing these methods).  In some papers (with impact) are mentioned the specificity and sensitivity of some of these methods, but it is validated just on small amount of patient (10-20), is it relevant validation in this case?

Or maybe they're only being whipped... that's so reassuring!  Is there a technical term denoting this kind of dreams? What's their nature? Is it specific to the Western world/culture? Are there other examples of it? "

Look closely at the top two rows.    At first I was startled. My imageviews had reformatted themselves! But no. All the squares are still identically sized.   Question is this: How does this image fool our minds? What can illusions like this tell us about how the brain is wired? "
833,Why do con artists like Frank Abagnale Jr. not feel guilt?,"I just finished watching a video of Frank Abagnale Jr discuss his life history. Who knows if its true, but it is an amazing story. For those who don't know, Frank Abagnale is one of the most infamous con artists in history according to Wikipedia.   What really strikes me about his story is the following: he seems to have an extraordinary memory and storytelling ability. Couple this with good looks, height, and a face that looks older than he is and you can see how he would have the tools to be con artist. But those are also skills that can be used for many many many other disciplines and could have been put to good uses. He could have been a salesman or any number of things.   Some criminals seem really messed up psychologically. He doesn't come across as that. He seems to have an intact psyche that isn't riddled with some abused past. But he is missing some basic emotions like guilt. For instance, he decided to work in a hospital without even considering the safety of patients around him and, according to Wikipedia nearly killed an infant. Another instance is that he took control of a plane when he didn't know how to fly one, obviously putting all the passengers and his own life at risk.  That seems insane! Only until he actually gets in a situation where lives are at stake did he really realize what could happen. Thus, he also seems to have no imagination for the consequences of his actions. He would tell strings of lies basically continuously and never think twice about it, never considering the consequences for businesses of the money they lost.  What part of the brain fails such that a person would act that way? What goes wrong?  "

835,What rules are tested during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task?,"I was reading about the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and although I understand the concept, I'm not clear on what rules are usually tested. Does it always vary between associations between shape, colour and number? For example, let's say I have a card with two red circles. Are the only possible matches to this card something with two shapes on it, red shapes on it or circles on it? Are more complex rules, such as the number of shapes + 1 or circles associate to green also tested? "
836,Is praying the Catholic rosary a meditation and does it enhance brain plasticity?,"Futurism.com says that meditation can shape brains and increase brain plasticity and fit. Can we say that praying the Catholic rosary is a kind of meditation and does this prayer have all the benefits of meditation?  The common practice of the rosary is to say five decades a day each containing an Our Father and ten Hail Marys keeping one's place with a looped string of beads. All Catholics know these prayers by heart and can repeat them almost automatically, so thoughts are directed towards some inner prayer and talk with God during its recital.   Is this a kind of meditation and does it enhance brain plasticity? "
837,Determining if participants learned the objects as a whole or feature by feature,"I want to know if in an experiment participants will learn the object as a whole or feature by feature.  Let's say, my objects are geometric shapes, and its features are color and orientation.  Would it be a good idea if I do something like:        Assign each object a unique color and a unique shape   Randomly assign participants to either color or orientation group   Tell participants to pay attention to ""the"" feature of objects (color or orientation, according to the group they belong) (this ""paying attention"" can be done in several ways, for example by asking participants to do an [tex]back task only with ""the"" feature)   Show objects to the participants on a screen in random order, possibly many times.   Suprise recognition task. Sometimes they will see exactly the same object, sometimes the orientation will be the same, but color will be   different. Sometimes both color and orientation will be different   etc.      My questions are:  Does this experiment measure what I want to measure?  Can you suggest some keywords for the above situation? Binding problem is somehow related but it is not exactly what I am seeking for. "
838,Effectiveness of aversion therapy for procrastination,"Pavlok is a product which is essentially a shock bracelet for Aversion Therapy. It markets itself as an intervention for a range of habits, including procrastination and nail-biting.  Is there any evidence that giving yourself a shock, when you catch yourself procrastinating or when someone else catches you procrastinating, will give you an aversion to the activities used for procrastination? Is it possible the person who receives the feedback would just find new activities? "
839,"Are all dendrites targeted by an axon, or are there a lot of ""empty"" dendrites?","As far as I understand, one neuron can have up to 200 000 dendrites (e.g. purkinje cells). As for axons, there can be only one per neuron, which can divide into thousands (but not hundreds of thousands) of branches at the end.   I assume that each dendrite has one input terminal and each axon branch has one output terminal. I also assume that only dendrites can have input terminals and that only axons' branches can have output terminals. So we can have up to 200 000 input terminals and up to thousands of output terminals per one neuron. So it seems to me like in the whole brain we have more input terminals than output terminals available.  Are my assumptions correct?  If yes, does that mean that there are a lot of redundant dendritic input terminals available? "
840,What safeguards are in place to prevent abuse of power?,"In the U.S., what safeguards are in place to prevent a mentally ill, or just spiteful or incompetent, psychiatrist / psychologist from abusing their position of power? Assuming the person is already practicing.  For example, are there any diagnoses that require an independent second opinion because of the serious consequences of acting on that diagnosis?  Obviously, this is especially important since- given the near complete power someone in this field could have over another person's life trajectory- the field will attract abusive people. "
841,Can a mother's untimely death lead to misogyny?,"Many years ago, in an undergraduate psychology class, we were discussing misogyny, and my professor told us that there was a significantly high number of misogynists who had lost their mothers (specifically that they had died) in their mid to late teens.  He said it was because the teen were angry at their mothers for leaving them, but were unable to process or express what they were feeling, so the anger was redirected into an anger towards all women.  I have tried to find some mention of this theory elsewhere, but cannot seem to formulate the right Google search phrase.  Is this a theory that still has merit, or has it been disproven?  If it is a valid belief, can someone direct me to a book or online documentation which discusses it? "
842,How does the brain process generalizations?,"What is the current thinking on how the brain processes generalizations? For example, the abstract idea of a right angled triangle vs specific instances of right angled triangles? Or the general idea of a cat vs specific instance of cats?  How does a generalization live in the brain? What's the current thinking on how it is encoded?  Medieval philosophers point to such abstractions (that are not material timeless ""things"") to argue that something itself not material and timeless must exist to ""sense"" them i.e. a soul. Which is hogwash. But how does one state the nature of such things in terms of human cognition? What is going on when we consider such abstractions? "
843,How does the neocortex distinguish between perception and imagination?,"From my understanding, the neocortex performs both perception and imagination/planning within the same hierarchical structure. During perception, an area of the neocortex receives current input from sensors and decides on motor actions to execute. During imagination, an area replays previous inputs, or operates on potential future inputs for planning. Actions don't actually get executed during planning.  On the one hand, it seems like both perception and planning are in part executed by the same neural structures. It seems intuitive that the same abstraction mechanism needs to be reused to arrive at the same high-level representations. On the other hand, it seems like the brain still needs to distinguish between them, for example to not executed imagined actions.  The two processes certainly affect each other. Perceiving a difficult situation can cause planning, perception can cause an association to imagine another situation, or imagination sets filters on what we perceive. Are there any explanations if and how the neocortex implements both perception and imagination/planning within the same structures?   Are perception and imagination states that the neocortex areas switch between, or can they be carried out simultaneously? Can multiple areas be involved in planning at the same time?  When an area sends information to another one, how does it signal whether this was perceived or imagined information?  Is there less of a distinction between the two than I'm thinking?  "
844,How will brain-computer interfacing work?,"I have just been reading about Elon Musks new company Neuralink. He claims that it is possible to increase the communication speed between humans and computers by using direct brain interfaces which could help in exchanging large volumes of information in a short period of time. The speed with which humans generate written information is just a few bytes per second. But computers communicate with each other at a very fast rate.     So my doubts are,    Is such a thing even possible? I have this question because I believe that our brain does not understand binary.  It took me a few whole minutes for typing this question. It was not because of my inability to type fast. It was because I had to plan with precision, each sentence I type to avoid grammatical errors and to communicate my question well (and to ensure that my question does not get hit with a series of downvotes). So how does increasing the communication speed between my brain and the computer actually guaranty that I will type this question faster than I'm typing now? If such a thing is actually possible, can you explain (in brief) how will such a method work?   "
845,"Pleasure can be implicated in a chemical reaction in the brain, but does this really affect the intensity of the feeling?","It is true that many, if not all feelings of our mind like euphoria, dysphoria, pleasure, sadness et cetera are linked to a chemical reaction in our brain. This reaction is essentially what causes us to feel these emotions.   However, is the factor that causes us to really feel what we feel inherently biochemical? If so, then what neurobiological property of these reactions causes the intensity of the feeling? For example, what separates plain happiness from blissful ecstasy? "
846,What does it mean for there to be more variance within groups than between groups in IQ?,"I was watching a short YouTube video that comments on the validity of IQ. That video contains the following claim (verbatim):     ""You know nothing about a person's intelligence on the basis of his or her skin color. That is just a fact. There is much more variance among individuals in any racial group than there is between groups...""   This was shortly after he stated that there are real differences in the average IQ of different races.  I find the bold statement confusing and am not certain how to interpret it. I understand what variance means when discussing a single probability distribution however, my learning never extended to variance between distributions. Could someone please explain how this is done and more importantly, why this measure justifies the first (non-bold) statement? "
847,Could the knowledge of the construct of self-efficacy affect the student's aptitude to a certain task?,"I am a tutor for children with learning disabilities and i have read that they have lower levels of perceived self-efficacy than students without this learning disabilities. I decided to deepen the construct of self-efficacy reading something of Bandura and i found that the perception of our efficacy can influence our behaviour and performance outcomes (Bandura, 1977).  So i asked to myself: if people - with or without learning disabilities - knew that they have thoughts (sometimes latent) about their abilities, it would affect their attitude to a certain task? In another way: Could, just the knowledge of self-efficacy, have some influence? "
848,Which long-term effects can hypocortisolism have on behavior?,"Chronic stress can have a serious impact on our physical as well as psychological health due to sustained high levels of the chemicals released in the ‘fight or flight’ response.  In abused children has been noticed a dysregulation of the ""Hypothalamic - Pituitary - Adrenal"" axis and particularly anomalous levels of Cortisol (Hart, et al., 1995).   Cicchetti and Rogosch hypothesize that the reduced activity of the HPA axis may have an adaptive role cause it protects against the consequences of a chronic hypercortisolism (Cicchetti, et al., 2010).

850,What is the most common age for developing psychosis?,"Background: Lately I've been watching a lot of Criminal Minds and in the season that I've just finished, one of the main characters - a 20-something Dr. Spencer Reid - is worried that he might be developing some form of psychosis (as I understood it) due to his mother's long time paranoid schizophrenia. Something he said to another of the main characters made me wonder the following:   At what age does psychosis most commonly develop? If someone has psychosis in the immediate family but has not developed psychosis by their mid-20s, is there an age where they are more likely to develop the illness or a point where if they haven't had it by a given age, they never will?  "
851,Is serotonin conclusively linked to depression?,"Some highlights from the article ""The Depressing News about Anti-Depressants"":     ever since a seminal study in 1998, whose findings were reinforced by landmark research in The Journal of the American Medical Association last month, that evidence has come with a big asterisk. Yes, the drugs are effective, in that they lift depression in most patients. But that benefit is hardly more than what patients get when they, unknowingly and as part of a study, take a dummy pill—a placebo. As more and more scientists who study depression and the drugs that treat it are concluding, that suggests that antidepressants are basically expensive Tic Tacs.      One team of researchers wondered if antidepressants were ""a triumph of marketing over science."" Even defenders of antidepressants agreed that the drugs have ""relatively small"" effects. ""Many have long been unimpressed by the magnitude of the differences observed between treatments and controls,"" psychology researcher Steven Hollon of Vanderbilt University and colleagues wrote—""what some of our colleagues refer to as 'the dirty little secret.' ""In Britain, the agency that assesses which treatments are effective enough for the government to pay for stopped recommending antidepressants as a first-line treatment, especially for mild or moderate depression.      But if experts know that antidepressants are hardly better than placebos, few patients or doctors do. Some doctors have changed their prescribing habits, says Kirsch, but more ""reacted with anger and incredulity.""       Doctors see with their own eyes, and feel with their hearts, that the drugs lift the black cloud from many of their depressed patients. But since doctors are not exactly in the habit of prescribing dummy pills, they have no experience comparing how their patients do on them, and therefore never see that a placebo would be almost as effective as a $4 pill. ""When they prescribe a treatment and it works,"" says Kirsch, ""their natural tendency is to attribute the cure to the treatment."" Hence the widespread ""antidepressants work"" refrain that persists to this day.      Right about here, people scowl and ask how anti-depressants—especially those that raise the brain's levels of serotonin—can possibly have no direct chemical effect on the brain. Surely raising serotonin levels should right the synapses' ""chemical imbalance"" and lift depression. Unfortunately, the serotonin-deficit theory of depression is built on a foundation of tissue paper. How that came to be is a story in itself, but the basics are that in the 1950s scientists discovered, serendipitously, that a drug called iproniazid seemed to help some people with depression. Iproniazid increases brain levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Ergo, low levels of those neurotransmitters must cause depression. More than 50 years on, the presumed effectiveness of antidepressants that act this way remains the chief support for the chemical-imbalance theory of depression. Absent that effectiveness, the theory hasn't a leg to stand on. Direct evidence doesn't exist. Lowering people's serotonin levels does not change their mood. And a new drug, tianeptine, which is sold in France and some other countries (but not the U.S.), turns out to be as effective as Prozac-like antidepressants that keep the synapses well supplied with serotonin. The mechanism of the new drug? It lowers brain levels of serotonin. ""If depression can be equally affected by drugs that increase serotonin and by drugs that decrease it,"" says Kirsch, ""it's hard to imagine how the benefits can be due to their chemical activity.""   Is this article true?  What evidence is there that serotonin is linked to depression? "
852,What are the key predictive traits of therapeutic success?,"In my answer here, to this question : Does hypnotherapy/hypnosis, in any form, for any type of disorder, work?  It brought up the valid question of why people quit therapy. Obviously, if the therapy is not helpful, it is could be construed as a straightforward cause and effect.  People stop therapy or positive coping techniques for a vast number of reasons.   What are the the key predictive factors that cause people to succeed or fail a longer term therapy which has been giving shorter term successes for that individual? "

854,"Are the incidents of autism spectrum disorder on the rise, or is there an increase due to better definition of diagnostic criteria?","Statistics offered by the CDC indicate that the prevalance of autism spectrum disorder in the U.S. went from 1-in-150 children in 2002, up to 1-in-88 by 2008:    A new report released in 2013 shows that this number has risen to 1-in-50.  The most recent study concludes that it is likely that the changes in prevalence are due to an improved awareness/survey techniques:     While it is not   possible to definitively determine the   underlying reason for this trend, several   previous studies that also examined   changes over time in ASD prevalence   estimates within selected birth cohorts   suggest that increasing recognition of   children with ASD has had an important   impact. Evidence from   epidemiologic, genetic, and neuroscience   research points to the prenatal period as   the key exposure window for ASD risk   factors. If the causes of ASD are   related to factors that exist prior to or   occur just after birth, it is unlikely that   changes in ASD prevalence within the   cohorts of children aged 6–13 in   2011–2012 reflect ‘‘true’’ increases in   susceptibility to the condition at these   ages. Rather, changes in prevalence of   parent-reported ASD within these birth   cohorts (children born in 1998–2005)   likely reflect either changes in the   recognition of ASD by health   professionals or survey-based   measurement changes over time   However, there also seems to be a significant support for the idea that ASD is rising to epidemic proportions, and that anything from changes in how many older couples are having children to various environmental factors may be increasing the rate of ASD incidents.     These rising rates inspired Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, to say, ""We have an epidemic on our hands.... It is imperative that the U.S. government steps up its commitment to helping people living with autism today."" Last November, the first congressional hearing on autism in 10 years was held to determine what the federal response should be. (It didn't exactly make front-page news: It aired on CSPAN-3.)   ...and...     ""Now we know there's a host of genetic and environmental factors that are likely involved,"" says Dr. Susan Hyman, professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism.      One possible contributor to autism's rise is that people are having babies later. The chance for gene glitches increases as parents -- especially dads -- age, explains Irva Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist at the MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis.      But delayed childbearing explains only a very small fraction of the rise in autism rates. Environmental factors may turn many autism genes ""on"" or ""off,"" says Hyman.      ""The best studies we have now point to things that babies are exposed to in the womb, when the brain is forming,"" says Hertz-Picciotto. Living in areas with high levels of air pollution (such as near a freeway), having low levels of folic acid, being overweight or diabetic, and having a high fever during pregnancy all seem to up a woman's risk of having a child with autism.   What studies or evidence support an actual increase in the rate of children with ASD?  Presumably there are stronger connections to environmental factors than the infamous Wakefield study, given the comments by Dr. Hyman?  Are there studies that show a strong correlation with increased rates with changes in the  diagnostic criteria, which would support the hypothesis that a significant portion of the increased prevalence is due to improvements in identifying individuals on the spectrum? "
855,Why do we not remember things from the first couple of years of childhood?,"As parents of a soon-to-be three-year-old, my wife and I spend a lot of time planning activities and trips for our son.  However, my wife wanted to hold off on some of the big ones (i.e. Disney World), until he was ""old enough to remember"".  She explained that she was taught (she has a background in Psychology, but has been working in more administrative roles than clinical for quite some time) that people cannot remember things that occur before they are somewhere around 3-4 years old.  What is the mechanism behind this?   Is it safe to assume that some developmental cognitive milestone(s) that must be reached before memories persist?   "
856,The genetics of handedness,"In response to these questions: Are there benefits to learning to write with your non-dominant hand? Spontaneous change of handedness    I used myself as an example for spontaneous handedness change.     Example:  I began as a left hander. I spontaneously changed to a semi-ambidextrous right hander. Two of my three children are true left handers, the other is a true right hander (their father and his family are all right handed). My parents and siblings are right handed.  My maternal grandmother was ambidextrous.    Question:  What are the genetics of handedness? "
857,Failing to recognise one's own work,"Disclaimer:  This is not a self help question, I am using myself as an example to illustrate my question.    Example:  I have posted many questions and answers on this site within a relatively short time. Frequently (and with my blessing) our Mod Jeromy will edit my question titles. He does not edit all of the titles.    I find myself browsing through the site, looking to upvote older questions, looking for unanswered questions. Sometimes (and too often) I come across a question and think, that's interesting, only to realise I posted the question. I do this with answers also. I think that's interesting and see I've posted it.    I can surmise, it is because of the sheer volume, perhaps stress and the inability to process memory.  I am wondering if this is a known condition.  Question:   What causes this phenomena of failing to recognise one's own work? Is it a recognised condition? Which part of our brain is responsible for this? "
858,The relationship between working memory and emotion,"I stumbled up on this article about working memory.  Within a table of indicators of good or poor working memory, it listed the following for adult working memory:     Indicators that a working memory needs exercise         Frequently late to work      Often underestimates time required for a   task      Has problems breaking a project into manageable steps      Often   loses temper with children and spouse      It is the last point:          Often loses temper with children and spouse      This brings me to the question:  Are there  studies examining the relationship between working memory and emotion? If so what are the results? "
859,Does fluency on a psychomotor task result from practice and a focus on accuracy?,"I know this formula, and I don't know where did I read it (or maybe heard about):     Conscious accuracy + continuous practice = spontaneous fluency   It's an educational technique for long-term learning processes which require the learner to develop motor-skills, like playing piano, touch-typing, martial arts, etc.  This formula in brief says that:   You don't have direct control over your brain, and it's a black box to you Your only duty is to provide content for you brain Every action you do during learning process should be consciously accurate You should practice more and more (PMP) You should not care about becoming fluent, as it's not under your direct control After a while, you brain reaches fluency The more you provide accuracy for your conscious mind, and the more you practice, the more fluency you'll get from it   I Googled this formula and to my surprise I found almost nothing related. So, I have this question:  Is this a subject of cognitive sciences? And if so, is it valid? Do we have a theory regarding these arguments for developing motor-skills? "
860,Is abstract knowledge incompatible with literal memorization?,"Let me describe 2 interesting cases :   Solomon Shereshevsky (Luria, 1968) had an almost perfect literal memory. He remembers strings of hundreds of digits for years after only having read them once. I would like to explain this by his awesome synesthesia: everything is encoded in so many ways that everything is considered as new, and so a new memory trace is formed to remember it (we know that ""first time"" experiences are well remembered (Robinson, 1993), as are distinctive features  (Hunt &amp; Worthen, 2006)). Shereshevsky's gift was compensated by big difficulties recognizing (visages, which he considered extremely changing) and had basically no understanding of abstraction: metaphor, figurative language. Kim Peek, the ""real Rainman"", had a rote knowledge of 6000 books, yet was unable to extract abstract information from this knowledge (his memory was like a computer's, basically). He was also unable to understand metaphors.   So, it seems to me that abstraction is incompatible with literal memory: we have to forget some concrete features to get the abstract essence. Is there any scientific literature about an incompatibility between abstraction and rote memorization?  References  Hunt, R. R., &amp; Worthen, J. B. (Eds.). (2006). Distinctiveness and memory.

863,What causes seizures to develop years after a childhood brain injury?,"A friend of mine told me that her daughter was in an accident prior to the age of 12 which resulted in head trauma and brain damage. The child went through an extensive recovery process (relearning how to walk, speak, etc) and made a nearly full recovery, the only symptoms which remained were frequent headaches.  The doctors said at the time of the accident that when the child reached her late teens / early 20s, she might develop seizures. Sure enough, shortly after she turned 18 the seizures began.  What causes seizures to develop years after a childhood brain injury? What is it about the developing brain which can cause years to pass before such seizures begin? "
864,How to design ballot papers with a large number of candidates in a preferential system?,"Background: In the 2013 Australian Federal election, several parties were elected to the senate seemingly because of usability issues related to the ballot paper (see here for discussion). For example:      [The] Australian Sports Party has no policies other than advocating lots   of sport, and won just 0.22 per cent of the vote. But with preferences   from other small parties, they are likely to get a Senate quota ahead of   the second Labor candidate, who had 12.33 per cent.   For those unfamiliar with the Australian federal electoral system, the Senate is the upper house. Each state has an equal number of senators. Election to the senate requires that you achieve a certain percentage of votes in a given state. It is a preferential block voting system. Thus, you can achieve the required votes after preferences have been allocated.  On the current ballot, you can either vote above the line or below the line. Above the line involves ticking a single box and accepting the allocation of preferences of that particular party. Ticking below the line requires that you number every candidate from one to the number of candidates (which could be over 100). Thus, the according to wikipedia about 98% of people vote above the line.  A strange situation arose in the 2013 election where several micro-parties appear to have won senate seats due to a flaw in the combination of the preferential and the above the line system. This seems to have been brought on by a range of factors including a general across the board increase in the vote for micro-parties and collaboration in micro-parties in allocating preferences to each other.  Traditionally, when the likely senator was one of only a few parties, the allocation of preferences was fairly clear. However, many voters if explicitly asked about their preferences, may have put one of the major parties above some of the more obscure parties that seem to have been elected based on preferences.  Thus, there is a problem:   There are too many candidates to make it easy for people to indicate their preferences for all candidates. The preferences implied by putting a 1 in a box ""above the line"" (i.e., accepting the preferences of a given party) may often not be consistent with what a voter would intend their preferences to be were they asked to think about it.   Questions   What is a good way to design ballot papers with a large number of candidates in a preferential system so that it is easy to use and conveys the important aspects of people's preferences? What psychological theory or empirical research justifies such a ballot paper?  "
865,Are Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development supported by empirical evidence?,"I've just come across a (very basic) description of Kohlberg's stages of moral development, and I found the section on the Pre-conventional level of moral reasoning rather suprising.  In particular, stage one, obedience and punishment orientation:       The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development, and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with preconventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong, but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.      In Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. ""The last time I did that I got spanked so I will not do it again."" The worse the punishment for the act is, the more ""bad"" the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is ""egocentric"", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.There is ""deference to superior power or prestige""   What surprised me is the example of moral perception in relation to degree of punishment.  While there does seem to be support for the idea (please feel free to chime in on that question with more authoritative answers!) that spanking can be an effective means of eliminating undesireable behavior, there is a significant amount of evidence citing the general levels of negative impact corporal punishment can have.  Anecdotally, lower levels of punishment seem to have no correlation with Kohlberg's Stage One model.  My son does not seem to equate punishment as indication that an action is 'morally wrong'.  He does understand that if he repeats the behavior, he will likely have to repeat the punishment, but given the experimentations with defiance and self-assertion common to three year olds, he does tend to repeat the behavior at least a few times, in an attempt to push boundaries and see what he can get away with.  Additionally, the one time my son has been exposed to corporal punishment (another child's grandmother decided to spank her son in daycare, right in front of my son, much to my anger and frustration), my son showed no indication that he felt that the boy had done anything wrong, but rather was obsessively concerned as to whether he was okay, and why she would do that to him.  This seems counter to the idea that the punishment instills the idea that the actions which precipitate the punishments are ""morally wrong"", as Kohlberg seems to be asserting.  Am I misunderstanding Kohlberg's Stage One?  Is his theory generally considered reputable?  Most importantly, is there observational data upon which his theory is based, which supports the conclusions he draws? "
866,Is photographic memory possible?,"Photographic memory is a fairly well known phenomena, but is it theoretically possible?  In Marvin Minsky's The Society of Mind claims it is a myth:     ""...we often hear about people with 'photographic memories' that enable them to quickly memorize all the fine details of a complicated picture or a page of text in a few seconds. So far as I can tell, all of these tales are unfounded myths, and only professional magicians or charlatans can produce such demonstrations.""   There have been a few claims of photographic memory, but only one person was ever reported to have passed tests supporting that claim: a woman named Elizabeth, who later married Charles Stromeyer, the man who had performed the studies within which Elizabeth demonstrated these purported skills.    Given the relationship between the researcher and the subject, and lack of reproduced test results, even that one example is rather suspect.  Are there any evidence to support that perfect long-term visual storage and retrieval of memories are theoretically possible?  By what mechanism would this likely work? "
867,Does winning the Fields medal decrease subsequent research achievement?,"I just stumbled on this summary in Slate of a study by Borjas and Doran (2012, FULL TEXT PDF).  To quote the summary:     According to a new study by Harvard's George Borjas and Notre Dame's   Kirk Doran of recipients of the Fields Medal, the most prestigious   prize in mathematics, winning big actually kills productivity.      Mathematicians who win it publish far less in the years afterwards   than similarly brilliant ""contenders""—highly cited mathematicians who   won other prestigious awards before the age of 40 (the cutoff for the   Fields), but not the prize itself. The prize is awarded every four   years to two, three, or four mathematicians. It goes to show that   major awards and recognition can have unintended consequences     I have not yet read the paper. But my first thought would be that a lot would depend on how you define contenders. I also imagine that the criterion of interest is research achievement, and that number of papers is an imperfect index of this.  Questions   Does winning the Fields medal actually decrease the research productivity of winners below what it would have been had they not won the medal? How strong is the evidence presented by Borjas and Doran (2012)? What, if any, limitations does the study have?   References   Borjas, G. J., &amp; Doran, K. B. (2012).

The Math stackexchange and meta stackoverflow includes a lot of this behavior. During a recent instance of this, one site member pointed out the unconstructive nature of ranting on meta and the ranter (after calming down) responded a joke that why we do this would be a question for the Psych SE.

869,What is the impact of showing the amount of unattended notifications to the user?,"What is the difference in cognitive effects on the user between simply showing that there are 'some' unattended notifications, or showing how many notifications there are?  Take Facebook's notification count for example,    as opposed to Windows' PC issues notification  in the system tray.  Of course depending on what the notification is notifying you of, people will respond differently, which is not something I'm interested in. However, I suspect there could be a difference based on where it is being displayed, e.g. whether it  is always visible or not. Would one be preferred over the other in different situations?  I'm mainly interested in a comparative study between the two, but any research which might give additional insights in the two separate representations would help me out as well. "
870,Can the brain work better in stressful conditions?,"I was watching a documentary about the brain the other day, BBC's Human Body - Brain Power. It said that the perception power of the brain increases when you are in a tense situation. For example; if you know that you are about to die because your house is on fire, the brain will perceive everything more quickly than normal. In other words, the brain works better when you are under stress or tensed a lot (because brain wants you to survive; this is only in life or death situations of course)  I was wondering if the same thing happens to a student during an exam. Is it good for a student to be tensed a bit while taking an exam? I mean if you are solving a question at home, you usually make a lot of mistakes, but the frequency of those mistakes decreases during an exam.  Is my observation correct? Or does a student need to be completely calm during an exam? "
871,"Is ""Biophysics of Computation"" still a good book?","Currently I'm studying mathematics (2nd year) and I think I'm pretty into neuroscience. To ""test"" this, I purchased Principles of Computational Modelling in Neuroscience and am considering to get Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons which seems to fit my interests fairly well, as I'd want to steer a middle course: Learn about the biological structure and manner of functioning of neural cells and thus be able to derive and develop models that do not only fulfill one special task (like most machine learning, ... now - an algorithm for face recognition will never challenge its own functioning), but rather resemble our brain.  As Biophysics of Computation was published in 1998, I wanted to know if it is still a good read, or already considered too outdated? "
872,Which commodity technologies offer useful neuroimaging data?,"Do any commodity technologies exist that offer useful neuroimaging data? By commodity I mean lowish cost and not requiring specialist technicians to run.  By useful I mean able to reliably provide some signal at different times from the same subject, even if it is of a limited nature. If so, what are the capabilities of the technology?  For instance, do the cheap EEG machines provide useful data or not?  Are any such technologies likely to become available in the foreseeable future? "

874,Theories of Emotion: Schachter's Two Factor Theory Example,"I'm currently in AP Psychology and studying for the exam using the College Board's course description, which contains sample psychology multiple choice questions. Here is one question, taken from the document:     Lee is about to skydive for the first time. He interprets his racing heart to be the result of his eager anticipation and excitement. This best represents which theory of emotion?      (a) Cannon-Bard      (b) James-Lange      (c) Drive reduction      (d) Schachter’s two factor      (e) Arousal   Immediately, I ruled out A, B, C, and E, leaving ""D"" as the choice. But per the definition of the Schachter two factor theory of emotion (alternatively known as the Schachter-Singer model), an emotion is felt only after there has been a physiological response and a cognitive appraisal of the situation. Here is one source that explains this, but our AP Psychology textbook also explains it in that way. I don't see how that matches the given scenario. Why is this correct? "
875,Why are dream so fast?,"Psychology always tell us the brain is meant to relax during rest/sleep/unconsciousness, but why is it that when one sleep and have a dream, the dreams are so fast that you hardly remember 60% of the dream after you wake up.   Is it that the brain processes faster during sleep? How can you remember at-least 60% of your dream, after you are awake, not after several days, month or years?  "
876,How / when does neurogenesis occur while learning?,"I've heard that learning to Juggle (new things) helps increase neurogenesis. So, what does it depend on?    Does it have to be a physical skill only?  Or can I study / read about Economics(which is new to me) for that? Should I have new emotional experiences like death in family, first time love etc.?   Also, when we try memorize something, say a poem, how is it decided that this has to be stored in the existing neurons or in the new neurons.  I'm aware that while connecting the dots, new connections are formed. "
877,Which personality theories do belong to humanistic?,"I went through literature and I am confused which theories of personality belong to humanistic, in literature there is often just Rogers (who is sometimes also considered to be phenomenologic) and Maslow. Do you know about some other that could be considered for humanistic too? Can I say that all humanistic psychologists created humanistic personality theory (e. g. Allport, Frankl etc.)? "
878,Third time's the Charm: any research into how we learn from error?,"I have often told people that I make a mistake two different ways before I really understand a situation. Is there any research that explains how and why this works? As an analogy, there is something called a ""paperclip tree"", a branching structure of linked paperclips (or any other small objects that can be connected loosely). You can find the longest path through the tree by picking it up anywhere, then grasping the lowest point and picking it up again. Absolute, guaranteed, must work every time.  So, is learning by making two mistakes something like this? Something like triangulation - two points of view? I also find that I have to sleep twice before something is really integrated in to my awareness and memory. After just one sleep it disappears and can't be recalled. This is why I often tell people that I cannot remember yesterday, but before that is clear. Also why naps are so helpful for learning. Any thoughts in how these things all work? Back propagation? Default Processing? Thank you. "
879,Conscious versus Visual Representation Update,"In their paper ""A cortical network that marks the moment when conscious representations are updated"" Stottinger et al claim that there is a network in the anterior insula, medial and inferior frontal regions and inferior parietal cortex that updates conscious representation. However, they did this by studying changing images. Is there any reason to believe that this system is not just for updating visual representations, as opposed to general conscious representation? (note: I only have access to the abstract, so I'm unsure whether this is addressed in the paper)  Full abstract:     In order to survive in a complex, noisy and constantly changing environment we need to categorize the world (e.g., Is this food edible or poisonous?) and we need to update our interpretations when things change. How does our brain update when object categories change from one to the next? We investigated the neural correlates associated with this updating process. We used event-related fMRI while people viewed a sequence of images that morphed from one object (e.g., a plane) to another (e.g., a shark). All participants were naïve as to the identity of the second object. The point at which participants 'saw' the second object was unpredictable and uncontaminated by any dramatic or salient change to the images themselves. The moment when subjective perceptual representations changed activated a circumscribed network including the anterior insula, medial and inferior frontal regions and inferior parietal cortex. In a setting where neither the timing nor nature of the visual transition was predictable, this restricted cortical network signals the time of updating a perceptual representation. The anterior insula and mid-frontal regions (including the ACC) were activated not only at the actual time when change was reported, but also immediately before, suggesting that these areas are also involved in processing alternative options after a mismatch has been detected.

880,Does color constancy overestimate?,"Consider I have a few references from white to yellowish, and I look at them in 2 different lights: a cool-coloured light (white/~6500k) and a warm-coloured light (yellow/~3500k). Firstly, intuitively, I thought that I will perceive the whiter ones to be yellower in yellow light, but I don't -- in fact, it's the opposite: I see the yellower ones whiter in yellow light.  What does it mean? Does it mean that the colour constancy mechanisms of humans notices there's a yellow light and tries to adjust the brain such that I perceive yellowish stuff as white? If so, how come the ones that are intrinsically yellowish are still perceived as white? Does the colour constancy mechanism overestimates how much to correct? "
881,Is there visual focus during a saccade?,"Has anyone succeeded in measuring where the focus is between saccades? Through some kind of nonintrusive brainscan perhaps?

882,How to random assign subjects to a group without any equipment?,"I am working with a clinician and need her to randomly assign patients into one of two groups with the goal of having roughly equal numbers in both groups. The clinician does not have access to a random number generator and it would be inappropriate for her to flip a coin before the allocation. We initially decided upon using the second hand on a clock and splitting on the top/bottom half of the minute, but the exam room does not have a clock and she does not wear a watch.  We are thinking of splitting on the first letter of the first name which is on the patient's chart. We would then flip every couple of weeks whether the first half of the alphabet was in group A or group B. Is this a reasonable approach? Is there a better one? If we go this way, what letter do we split on to give roughly equal sizes? "
883,Is there anything called Genetic Anxiety?,"We inherit a lot from our ancestors, but how much the term Genetic Anxiety is true, and if it is true, can it be cured through the same ways(CBT, Exposure Therapy) or it has to be dealt with medications?

885,Consciousness as sufficient complexity,"First of all, let me state that I am a newcomer to cognitive science in general and this community in particular, so feel free to chew me out if this question is inappropriate in some way.  I have always thought that the definition of consciousness was a question of complexity. In particular, a network would be considered conscious if and only if it had at least as many nodes and connections as the human brain.  I have two sub-questions regarding this definition:   Is there anyone in the literature who espouses this point of view? Is this point of view generally respected among cognitive scientists? What are the potential problems with this definition as it relates to other definitions in cognitive science?  "
886,Inter-subject signal sensitivity estimation?,"Factor loading background  I am using paired comparison methods to estimate estimate respondents’ sensitivity to distinctions in words used to characterize the construct of agreeableness. (e.g, Undemanding = .34 versus Peaceful = .72). The contrast between the words' factor loadings is the signal to be detected.  The stronger loading was alternated between being on the first and second word. I did find that the contrast predicted probability of correct detection (r = .20*).   Experiment background  The stimulus is paired comparison words with each word having a different factor loading (from prior research) based on it's measurement of agreeableness. So each word taps the construct more or less deeply than the other. The contrast between the words in terms of their factor loading is the signal. A set of 122 such paired comparison tasks was developed and the task before the respondent is to select the more agreeable word.  The respondents are students recruited for the research having varying degrees of sensitivity. Each word in the pair only has a factor loading as the estimate of signal and the contrast should be the salient feature in the task.  How to get sensitivity estimate?  I have been using the number of correct “larger” loading detections as the respondent’s score. How might I estimate respondents' sensitivity to the presented signals? "

And what tests should I do to actually prove that statement? Examples are appreciated.  Background I am trying to build some different technology products and I want them to help the user stay more focused than they would using a competitor product of the same kind. The only research I've done so far was to build some interfaces and ask the user how they feel. "
888,Psychological theories about the end of a romantic relationship,"There's no doubt: many couples break and many marriages break, what happens in these cases?  In the loving encounter brain areas aimed at judgment and critical analysis, are clouded by an increase of dopamine: the neurotransmitter that activates our most irrational and euphoric drives. The biology tells us that this pleasant situation lasts a few months (activation of oxytocin receptors) because of the decrease of dopamine in the intersynaptic space.  Which other theories could explain the decline in desire/closeness?   Does exist a split between desire and love?

889,"How can you tell the difference between ""natural"" homosexuality and ""trauma related"" homosexuality","When stumbling across the question: Is homosexuality a mental disorder? I realized that it is very close to a personal question that My wife and I (mostly me to be fair) about the source of homosexuality in sexually abused children and young adults.   First, as I know this is a sensitive subject please understand that my goal is understanding and not offence. I am simply trying to understand a situation that may or may not arise, in our lives.   Let me explain, and hope that this will make this question clearer. My wife and I are currently in the process of becoming Foster parents. One of the things we need to do, is to be honest about where our ""personal lines"" are. For an extreme example you don't want the leader of the KKK to be tasked with raising African American children. However a lot of our interactions are focused on finding much more mild cases of ""Oh I didn't realize that would be a problem for us, I never thought about it that way.""  In recent classes the topics of homosexuality and sexual identity have come up. And while I have no problem with homosexuality as a choice or a pre-disposition. I wonder about homosexuality as a result of trauma.   For example, A teen that decides that he is homosexual, under normal circumstances is fine by me. If it is an active decision and preference then it doesn't matter, it's his choice. If it's a passive trait (for example genetic) then again it doesn't matter. It's like being left handed. It just is, move along. This is summarized for brevity, obviously. But that is a good summary of how we (both my wife and I) feel.   But one of our responsibilities as a Foster parent could include caring for sexually abused children and teens. The question is how can we, or should we try to differentiate between homosexuality as a response to trauma or naturally occurring homosexuality? "
890,Is habituation responsible for inaccurate airport security screenings?,"The U.S. Transportation Security Administration has ""red teams"" who try to sneak dangerous items through airport security.  The security personnel often fail up to 95% of these tests. Is this high failure rate to be expected because of habituation to visual stimulus?  Specifically, a screening agent is expected to find a single weapon amidst thousands of X-rays without a weapon.  If this is habituation, are there techniques for reducing its impact in scenarios such as this? "
891,What do we know about schizophrenia and mathematics?,"Schizophrenia is usually associated with intellectual problems. I don't think that cognitive deficits are only associated with vulnerability to schizophrenia, though there is the much cited     Russell et al (1997) recently proposed that intellectual decline in   schizophrenia was a nothing more than a ‘myth’. They followed up   patients who had received an intelligence test as a child, who then   developed schizophrenia, and had their intelligence re-tested some 19   years later. There were no differences between the child and adult   IQs. However, others have criticised this study on the grounds that   the sample was unrepresentative in that the individuals had presented   to child psychiatry units and were far more intellectually impaired   than subjects in other studies of children who subsequently developed   schizophrenia.   From my research prior to this question, it seems that there is a loss of ability, but likely not chronic decline over the course of the illness, one before or during the transition to psychosis. Another well known meta review claims this, that there's     no support for hypothesizing a degenerative   process in schizophrenia once positive symptoms appear... a static encephalopathy rather than a degenerative process   I've seen it said that it is centered on mathematical ability.  What do we know about mathematical ability pre and post psychosis, in schizophrenia? e.g., was John Nash a worse mathematician after he went mad?  References  Russell, A. J., et al.

892,Have there been any recent replications of the Hofling hospital experiment?,"In the original Hofling hospital experiment (1966):     A person would telephone a nurse, saying that he was a doctor and   giving a fictitious name, asking the nurse to administer 20 mg of a   fictitious drug named ""Astroten"" to a patient, and that he/she would   provide the required signature for the medication later. A bottle   labelled ""Astroten"" had been placed in the drug cabinet, but there was   no drug of that name on the approved list. The label clearly stated   that 10 mg was the maximum daily dose.   There are several reasons why the nurse should refuse the request:   They don't know the doctor They don't know the drug The requested dose is greater than the labelled maximum dose Paperwork was not provided   Nonetheless, 21 of 22 nurses complied.  One of the (many) disturbing aspects of the experiment, is that even with so many reasons to refuse, the nurses tended to obey.  The implication is that with fewer reasons to refuse, they would be even more likely to obey.  This turned out not to be quite true, as per a partial replication by Rank and Jacobson (1977), in which they eliminated one of the reasons: They used a drug known to the nurses (Valium) instead of a fictitious drug, and somewhat counterintuitively got much lower compliance rates.  So if you wanted to have a particular hospital patient ""eliminated"", it seems to me that Hofling provides a simple plan: Make a phone call from a payphone somewhere to the nurse's station at the hospital, pretending to be a doctor, and ask them to administer a lethal dose of some poison - the only caveat is that as Rank and Jacobson showed, you don't want to refer to a drug they are familiar with, so ideally a lethal toxin placed in the drug cabinet ahead of time (or equivalently, a mislabelled toxin).  Rank and Jacobson suggest that perhaps reduction in obedience may be partially due to cultural changes: Changes in the relationship between doctors and nurses, the self-esteem of nurses, changes in the legal landscape and fear of lawsuits, etc.  Have there been any recent replications of the experiment that suggest how easy / hard it is today to have a patient anonymously murdered by a nurse?

893,"If sleeping is related to 'saving information' you've experience, is forgetting related to more energy?","So I was watching this youtube video (Only check 1:05 - 1:25) where it suggested we sleep because the brain needs rest to save/process all information we perceived throughout the day. I directly made the connection to my own body with the following thought:     I can stay up for extended periods without the need of sleep. However, I easily and very quickly forget anything, almost like dementia, but if I try hard, I can remember it.   If the necessity of sleeping is related to the amount of information received, does forgetting information reduces that necessity? And does forgetting result in longer days without being tired?  Keep the jargon and technical details to a human level, please. "

895,"Are there ""awareness"" related mirror neurons or processes in the brain that get activated by awareness?","I'm reading the ""The Power of Now"" book by Ekhart Tolle, in which he describes a spiritual practice by which attention/awareness is focused on the currently experienced mental state. For example, anger, frustration or jealousy are observed without letting them take over. Tolle describes the outcome of this practice as something along the lines of ""these emotions are transmuted into awareness"". I'm interested if there's any evidence in cognitive science to support his claim.   The description reminds me of mirror neurons - observing an emotion in others ""infects"" the observer with the same emotion. There's a small number of deeply connected mirror neurons that permeate the human brain  This makes me ask the question - are there ""awareness"" related mirror neurons or similar structures that get activated by one's own awareness? By which process could the experience of observing emotion increase awareness of the observer?   Update: this wikipedia article has a very brief section on mirror neurons and self awareness:     V.S. Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the   neurological basis of human self-awareness.[70] In an essay written   for the Edge Foundation in 2009 Ramachandran gave the following   explanation of his theory: ""... I also speculated that these neurons   can not only help simulate other people's behavior but can be turned   'inward'—as it were—to create second-order representations or   meta-representations of your own earlier brain processes. This could   be the neural basis of introspection, and of the reciprocity of self   awareness and other awareness.  "
896,Freud's theory regarding child to parent attraction,"This may be a thought from false information but even from some teachers I've heard quotes of how Sigmund Freud had a theory about how children are attracted to their parent of the opposite gender.  I was just thinking, is that the real theory? Or did Freud mean that we are attracted to the person that reminds us of our parent of the opposite gender either physically and/or emotionally? "
897,Cause and cure of silly behavior in children,"What can be some of the causes/reasons that a child (in the 7-year-old range) to speak in a silly voice and in a silly way, more than an average child? I don't know how to be more specific by silly voice and in a silly way, but I mean that the child speaks with a different voice, usually mimicking a spoiled 2-year old in a way that is not the natural way that he usually speaks and It is pretty annoying and not very likable. It happens very often when the child communicates with grown ups. I am guessing it can be an attempt to draw attention or be liked more but I'm not a psychologist so I thought I'd ask. What are some of the causes of this type of behavior in children, and what are some of the cures for it? Is there a difference between causes in girls and boys? If you think I need to ask this question in Parenting SE, please let me know. thanks. "
898,How to quickly estimate the person's level of stress with a mobile based relaxation app?,"I'm writing a simple iPhone relaxation app and am thinking of a very quick test I can do to learn something about the user's level of stress, anxiety, etc. The objective is to measure how effective the app is or to adjust the length of the session.   I thought of using the following measurement process:   Ask the user to trace a line with their finger, prior to relaxation Repeat the tracing process following relaxation Analyze and compare results to the user's previous entry or historic entries for the same user   Does this approach have any merit or validity? What other simple and quick ways are there to gauge how relaxed or stressed the user is?

899,How can you forgive (and not only forget) evildoers without any remorse?,"Given the mental and physical health benefits of forgiveness, how is it usually approached in psychological treatment? Despite hours of reading, I still don't understand, and can't even pinpoint why not. Please remark the following assumptions which restrict my definition of 'malefactor' to forgive:     1. The malefactor fails to repent or rue in any way, such as Mutsuhiro Watanabe (who tortured Captain Louis Zamperini about whom I write below) or the Holocaust perpetrators.       2. I ask about genuine forgiveness of the malefactor, and not merely forgetfulness.      3. The malefactor recognised his/her actions' turpitude but still wilfully executed them.    This question was motivated by such virtuous paragons as  Ms Eva Kor and Capt Louis Zamperini, the latter of whom advised someone else by citing Mark Twain:     “Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it.”   I recognise the futility in simply remaining enraged about past injustices, so I'd argue that one should act to resolve this resentment, such as by apprehending and punishing their captors. This is exactly the argument that has bewitched me but that I'd like to surmount; I want to appreciate: How and why could (even) tortured war veterans and concentration camp survivors decide against any revenge? "
900,How can I structure this question to check for availability bias?,"I'm preparing a survey right now and one of the questions I'm looking to answer is: How much does availability bias effect the decision making process for [given behaviour]?  My question is: What's the best way to structure a survey question, or set of questions to test for this heuristic?  My current thinking is that I shouldn't mention specific options a respondent may select, because doing so will prime the respondents.  i.e. I can't mention specific detergent brands and then ask ""Which detergent brand are you most likely to buy this month?"", as that data won't be valid.  But the possible options a respondent might give if the question is completely open are endless.   Does anybody have any experience in this type of survey and can lend some insight? "
901,Studies modelling learning curves of an overall task and subtasks,"Background  Lee and Anderson (2001) published an article in which they argued  that learning a complex skill can be understood in terms of learning various component skills. They did this by performing a hierarchical task analysis on the Kanfer-Ackerman Air Traffic Control Task. They then re-analysed a dataset where participants performed the task over repeated trials. By examining key logs, they were able to extract out the speed with which overall goals were achieved (e.g., landing planes) as well as subtasks (e.g., moving planes through the hold patterns, etc.). They then analysed the relationship between practice and performance (i.e., the learning curve) for both the overall task and the subtasks. Specifically, they fit three parameter power functions.  I'm currently doing some research exploring similarities and differences between overall and subtask learning curves, and I'm keen to identify other papers that have modelled subtask and overall task performance. However, the learning and performance literature is pretty broad and crosses multiple disciplines, and thus, somewhat challenging to search. I've also tried the cited by link for the article on Google Scholar.  Question:   What, if any, other studies have been published that have modelled the relationship between both practice and subtask performance, and practice and overall task performance?   My preference is for studies where the dependent variable is task/subtask completion time, but any dependent variable representing performance would be interesting.  References   Lee, F.

In the interview, he demonstrates how he's able to perform mathematical transformations in his head by visualizing the numbers as colored shapes. As he explains in the linked clip:     This is 2 * 27:      He visualizes multiplying 2 by 27 as a series of colored triangles.  Is this a known phenomenon, and if so, does it have a name? Do other individuals visualize mathematics like this? Or is this just a 12-year old kid... embellishing (to be polite) his thought process? "
903,What are the benefits of dyslexia?,"Reading the Wikipedia article on Dyslexia, it sounds very negative. The article defines Dyslexia as a learning disability, which I understand it is classified as. However, knowing individuals with dyslexia, they do not consider themselves to have a disability, they say that their brains process information differently. Not worse, just differently. And I can attest to the fact that some of the people I know who are Dyslexic far exceed my abilities in certain areas, namely music, picture / visual / spacial skills, memory, timing, etc.  The Wikipedia article mentions no benefits to dyslexia.    Have any studies been done on benefits of dyslexia?  If so, what were the findings ?  "
904,"What are different ways to determine centroids of fMRI activation, their drawbacks and perks?","I'm reading an older article on bilingualism (Kim, Relkin, Lee, &amp; Hirsch, 1997) for a seminar. They were interested in the spatial separation of two languages in early and late bilinguals.  They determined activated regions and their overlap in two conditions and across two groups.  To determine these areas, they first excluded all voxels where BOLD response difference to baseline was not above their empirically derived false positive rate (p&lt;0.0005) and then used all these voxels as if they had the same activation to determine the ""centre-of-mass"".  They then calculated the distance between the centroids in the two conditions to measure spatial separation and counted the overlapping voxels.  I have some issues with this method:   it seems as if they're throwing away a lot of information by discarding all voxels where activity was not above chance level and maybe more importantly by treating all significantly activated voxels as the same even though there may be significant differences in their activation level  minor: it's volumetric, not mass, so it should be centre of volume, right? It may be a misunderstanding of the workings of fMRI on my part.   They also demonstrated that the derived distance held up well over two orders of magnitude in significance level, but still they didn't differentiate between highly and not-so-highly-but-still-significantly activated voxels. Is this still state-of-the-art?  My questions:   What are different ways to calculate centroids without discarding so much information but still backing up the conclusion inferentially (some sort of spatial confidence area?)?   What are their drawbacks (my lecturer says they all have some, so you can just as well use the above-mentioned multistage method, but this seems like the easy way out)? What is a well-tested method to test spatial separation of activity for two conditions? I'm not asking about demonstrating functional separation, but once you don't treat voxels as on-and-off anymore, calculating degree of overlap becomes less trivial.

905,Has the neuro-linguistic programming visual model been scientifically tested?,"According to the NLP visual model, fast flickers of the eyes in left/right and the 4 diagonal directions map to simple cues related to how a person is thinking. Thease are ""visual constructed"", ""visual remembered"", ""auditory constructed"", ""auditory remembered"", ""kinesthetic"" and ""internal dialogue"".  The same directions are generally mapped to the same cues but not always, additionally the left/right is reversed in the left handed. There are other cues such as in the neck that indicate further when combined with cirtain eye cues, not to be confused with observation of muscle twitches when thinking about an associated action that also occurs in NLP. Sequences of these combine to indicate thought processes.   Have these propositions about these cues been scientifically tested? If so, what are the results?  "
906,Does learning one discipline improve performance in another discipline?,"I have come across a lot of articles that suggest learning across disciplines would improve cognitive abilities. This is more often referred to as Integrative Learning. Also, nowadayas a lot of emphasis seems to be placed on Interdisciplinarity and cross-disciplinary research.  Thus (putting it plainly) if a economist learns psychology, his brain can draw inferences from psychology that could help his cognitive abilities in dealing with economics.    Is this true and supported by facts? If this is true, does the brain automatically interrelates concepts or we need to train the brain in a particular manner? Does this depend on age?   "
907,How do animals recognize other animals of their own species?,"My motivation for this question is dog-based, but I suppose it would apply equally well to humans. How do animals recognize their own kind, particularly where there is large variation in appearance?  The background is that I am reading ""Discrimination of human and dog faces and inversion responses in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris)"" by Racca et al. (2010; Animal Cognition 13: 525-533). These authors show that when dogs are presented upright objects, human faces, and dog faces, they spend more time gazing on novel objects and human faces than they do on familiar ones. However, they spend significantly more time gazing on familiar dog faces than they do on novel ones.  This got me thinking how a dog ""knows"" another face belongs to a dog. Acedotally (which I realize is worth approximately nil in science), my dog reacts very differently to seeing another dog in an adjacent car compared to a person. Given that there is so much phenotypic variation in dogs, how does it know that other animal is a dog, and not a cat or very large rodent? I could understand a lion recognizing another lion, because all lions look more or less the same.  "
908,Neural networks with biologically plausible accounts of neurogenesis,"One of the reasons artificial neural net algorithms like cascade correlation (pdf) have been generating interest is because they start with a minimal topology (just input and output unit) and recruit new hidden units as learning progresses. The draw from cognitive science (especially a lot of developmental psychology work) is an analogy to neuorogenesis (in fact, you will see this analogy mentioned in most papers that use CC-NN).   However, the CC algorithm is not meant as a biologically reasonable algorithm (neither the weight update nor unit recruitment rules are local, for instance), So my question is:     Are there popular neural network algorithms that start with a minimal topology and recruit new hidden units, and update network weights in a neurobiologically plausible manner?   Related questions  How are newly created neurons recruited into existing networks? "
909,Computational models of early learning in children,"   What are currently used biologically plausible computational models/frameworks of early learning in children?   Personally, I have used cascade correlation neural nets to model pronoun acquisition in children, but in hindsight, I consider this framework to be not neurobiologically plausible.   Are there existing computational frameworks that have been used for early-learning and development in children that have a reasonable biologically justification? For example: just being a neural net model is not a reasonable justification, but a neural net model witch has local update rules (like Hebbian learning) and models neurons more realistically (instead of just saying they are a sigmoid function without any further biological justification) would be fine. General non-connectionist frameworks with empirical justification are also of interest, even if they don't have a solid reductionist account.  Notes  I have asked an alternate version of this question on Linguistics.SE that focuses on language acquisition instead of general learning, but considers both children and adults. "
910,How does goal-tracking and sign-tracking behaviour vary across species?,"In Pavlonian (classical) conditioning,  conditioned responses of an animal may vary. Some animals focus on the unconditioned stimulus (ie. food/location of food) while others may focus on the conditioned stimulus (ie. lever or button). These behaviors have been termed 'goal-tracking' and 'sign-tracking' respectively, as defined by Flagel et al. (2007).   What are some known examples of this variation between different species? How does the variation within a species differ across species? Do some species exhibit more or less variation than other species?    Flagel SB, Watson SJ, Robinson TE, Akil H. (2007).

912,How does task difficulty schedule affect the rate and efficiency of perceptual learning?,"In perceptual learning (line length/orientation discrimination, visual target detection, tone frequency discrimination, etc), when training people or animals to perform a task better, is there an optimal schedule for controlling task difficulty, to acheive maximal improvement?  At least 3 reasonable schedules come to (my) mind:   Easy to difficult - In education it is the custom to begin with easy examples or problems, and gradually progress to more difficult ones. Maybe this should work in perceptual learning as well. Interleave different difficulties Always the most difficult possible   Has there been a rigorous comparison of such schedules and their effect on the rate of learning, and the maximal performance level achieved at the end of training?

913,Does dream recall disturb the processes of memory consolidation?,"Psychology in the time of Freud was occupied with dreams.  Relaying these to one's analyst was an important part of treatment.  Fast-forward to less than 100 years later, and we know so much about the importance of sleep in consolidating memories during REM [1][2] and slow-wave sleep [3] (among countless other references I have omitted).    Let us assume dreaming is largely relegated to REM (ignoring dreams experienced during stage 2 sleep). If we recall our dreams at a later time then is it detrimental to any subsequent process of memory consolidation?  If our dream represents a state through which our brain is passing to consolidate memory, what is the effect of recalling that intermediate state and potentially storing it back in long-term memory?

914,"Why do I type ""it's"" when I know it should be ""its""","I know the difference between ""its"" and ""it's"". When I read it, even in my own writing, I can see incorrect usages almost instantly. However, when I type, I often type ""it's"" when I should write ""its."" The opposite problem is rare (""its"" when it should be ""it's""). I don't even notice that I've written it incorrectly unless I proof-read my writing.  So, why do I do this?  I've looked at these questions and answers:  Why do you sometimes write down one word while actually intending to write another?  What type of learning mechanism produces a consistent typo?  But neither really seem to address this case. The first accepted answer refers to speech errors and centers around sounds and phonemes. Since there isn't anything phonetically different between ""it's"" and ""its"" I can't see how I have stumbled into this problem:     When mentally planning the next word in a sentence, we must choose the   appropriate lemma. By selecting the units in a neural network that   correspond to a certain lemma, it spreads activation to the   corresponding morphemes, which in turn spreads activation to its   corresponding phonemes. When the activation of a phoneme unit exceeds   a certain threshold, it is selected for utterance (e.g., spreads   activation to the motor units that allow us to speak).   The second answer refers specifically to mechanical typing errors arising from looking at text (which I am not doing) and striking the wrong key. These errors don't seem to cover my situation:        Salthouse mentions the taxonomy of typing errors proposed by Wells    (1916) of ""substitutions, intrusions, ommissions, and  transpositions"", and also cites empirical estimates of prevalence of   different types of errors.   ""Many substitution errors involve adjacent keys.""   ""Most transposition errors are cross-hand rather than within-hand""      My problem is adding unnecessary punctuation and not a mechanical error or phonetic/psycholinguistic error. Am I wrong? "
915,Are liars inclined to lie to themselves?,"Reading the famous quote of Oliver Sacks, can we draw conclusions about liars?     ""We speak not only to tell other people what we think, but to tell ourselves what we think. Speech is a part of thought."" [Oliver Sacks]   If speech is part of thought, then maybe liars can begin making fallacious thoughts in the long run?  Is there scientific evidence that suggests that speech affects thinking, possibly in relation to (pathological) liars? "
916,How does chronic stress improve memory processes?,"There seems to be more information on the detrimental effects of stress on memory.  There is evidence to the contrary.  Stress effects on memory: an update and integration. Schwabe L, et al  doi: 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.07.002     It is well known that stressful experiences may affect learning and memory processes. Less clear is the exact nature of these stress effects on memory: both enhancing and impairing effects have been reported.   I am interested in the research available on stress positively effecting memory.  What are the biological reasons for stress enhancing memory processes?  There is a related question Can the brain work better in stressful conditions?; I am interested more in chronic stress. An examination of the effects of acute stress on memory, I believe, warrants a separate discussion. "
917,Why do people get syllables mixed up when trying to recall words?,"This question is related to this question. It could be a dupe, but I am more interested in whether this is a form of ""dyslexic"" thinking (for want of a better expression)?  I posted this question on SE English:  Antonym for ameliorate  Where I could not recall the word deleterious and was remembering it as: detiliorate (a non-existent word). I was miss remembering the order of the syllables. plus some other confusion.   I was confusing the de-le-terious with de-ti-liorate, that is, I had inverted the ""L"" and ""T"" sounds in the syllables.    Why do people tend to get sounds mixed up in this way? What is the process behind this?   "
918,"Why do soldiers seldom ""fight to the death"" even if they are going to be killed anyway?","At the siege of Masada, a group of heavily outnumbered Jewish soldiers elected to commit suicide en masse, rather than to be captured by the besieging Romans, who would probably have committed them to a tortuous death by crucifixion. Such an action is highly unusual, almost unique in the annals of history.  During the Spartacus slave revolt, some 6,000 rebels were captured and crucified. Why did they choose this over death in battle? (As rebelling slaves, they were outlaws, not foreign prisoners who could expect to be allowed to live.) And why might this be true of others in similar straits (e.g. partisans captured by Nazis in World War II)? "

920,Differences between the way men and women interpret body language,"There are many socially accepted ideas about the differences between men and women, I am wondering how much of this is misconception or based in reality.  I was reading this question: How important is eye contact for attraction between a man and woman? and found some interesting discussion in the comments.  I quote from this answer:        females are very good at picking up sublties like that - however, they are very bad at explaining them usually.    I quote from one of the comments:       ""Females . . . are very bad at explaining them usually""? That seems like an unnecessarily dangerous statement--humans in general are quite bad at pinpointing reasons for social behavior   I found this article: Gender Affects Body Language Reading Arseny A. Sokolov, et al doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00016     The findings show that gender affects accuracy rather than speed of body language reading. This effect, however, is modulated by emotional content of actions: males surpass in recognition accuracy of happy actions, whereas females tend to excel in recognition of hostile angry knocking. Advantage of women in recognition accuracy of neutral actions suggests that females are better tuned to the lack of emotional content in body actions. The study provides novel insights into understanding of gender effects in body language reading, and helps to shed light on gender vulnerability to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental impairments in visual social cognition.   However, this is only one study, and it raises the interesting point that women may be better at interpreting ""lack of emotional content"".  Has current research reached a consensus on the  differences between the way men and women interpret body language? If so; What are the proposed reasons for these differences? "
921,What kind of feed-back scheme is there for a back-propagation feed-forward ANN for self-learning of touching a coordinate with robot arm?,"I'm a beginner in this topic and are learning how to build an artificial neural network and different types of training associated with them.   Right now, I'm trying to figure out self learning. For example, there is a robot arm consisting of two joints and three parts. The objective is the distance from target (I need the arm to touch the target), neural network inputs are the coordinates of the target, the output is the joint angles of the arm. But, the error is the distance of hand to target.   Since I'm using an error-back-propagation feed-forward neural network, its error is only the output and desired output, but I need it to find the desired output (target joint angle) itself and take the error from distance, not joint angle. How can this be done?   More clearly, what kind of feed-back scheme is there for a back-propagation feed-forward ANN for self-learning of touching a coordinate with robot arm? "
922,Waking around the same time without an alarm,"Anecdotal background  I find that regardless of what time I go to bed, or how exhausted I am, I always wake up the next morning between 5 and 6am.  This is despite my alarm being consistently set for 6:15am.  I used to work in an industry, over 15 years ago, where earlier morning starts were part of the job (started work at 6am then), but none quite as drastic since then.  I do not take naps, either.  This happens irrespective of the conditions (temperature, etc).  So, I do not have a fixed time of sleep and it is not necessarily easy to get of bed at that time (some mornings here are very cold).  The question  What are the neurological triggers that cause someone to continually wake up at a set time in the morning, regardless of time of sleep and conditions?  Note - this not a self help question.  I have read the questions and answers for ""What defines the easiest time to get out of bed in the morning for humans?"" and ""How are people able to wake themselves up after a pre-specified amount of time?"" and they did not quite have the answers I am after. "
923,Does correcting responses after feedback lead to better learning?,"In a typical supervised learning experiment, one might present visual stimuli, e.g. faces, one after another and ask participants to classify each one into one of two categories, e.g. A and B. Usually participants are not required to DO anything after getting feedback - they just wait, and eventually the next trial appears. Does learning improve if, when the response is incorrect, participants are required to change their response to the correct one before proceeding?  To provide some context - unlike the ""typical"" experiment described above, I am using educationally relevant materials - mathematics story problems. They are still binary forced choice, but responses are given using radio buttons instead of the usual ""press P or Q"", so to correct an incorrect response, participants would have to go change the radio button response.  More specifically, since details were requested, all of the problems are story problems involving the concept of ""sampling with replacement"". Before doing the problems, participants read an instructional passage explaining the general formula for sampling with replacement problems. This passage explains that each problem involves two numbers, a and b, where a indicates the number of sampling events and b indicates the size of the sampled set. The problems ask for the number of different possible outcomes, which is given by the formula a^b. Thus, to solve the problems, it is only necessary to figure out which number is the number of sampling events and which the size of the sampled set. Here is a sample problem:     A group of friends is eating at a restaurant. Each person chooses a meal from the menu. (It is possible for multiple people to choose the same meal.) In how many different ways can the friends choose their meals, if there are 4 friends and 5 meals?      Answers:      4^5      5^4   I can think of at least two reasons why they MIGHT learn better from doing this. First, it might improve motivation - they know it's a pain in the neck when they answer wrong, so they're more motivated to answer right. Second, it might have a cognitive benefit, in that they would encode the correct and incorrect answers more strongly because they have to actually respond in some way.  On the other hand, there could be a negative effect in that it interrupts the flow of the trials. Doing a large number of trials quickly, pop pop pop, could increase learners' fluency, and such benefits could be decreased by the proposed requirement.  On the third hand, it might be even more beneficial to use an even more extreme version of the proposed requirement, e.g. present several questions at once and only tell them that SOME are wrong, not WHICH ones, so they have to think about it even more. Of course this could encourage them to figure out ways to play the system and could be even worse with respect to the possible negative effect I mentioned.  Anyone have any evidence or speculations about this? "
924,"Why do ""cool"" colors, which are actually warmer, look cool, and vice versa?","Why do cool colors look cool that are in fact warmer, and why do warm colors look warm when they are actually cooler?  Blue wavelength has higher energy than red, i.e, blue flame is hotter than red flame, but still blue seems cool. Is it due to it being the color of water or the sky? "
925,Is workaholism similar to any addiction or are there other neurological mechanisms at play?,"Some people are seemingly 'addicted' to their work and by doing work itself, almost to the point of precluding all other activities and interactions (usually social).  By this question, I mean when people go beyond a 'passion' for the work, into an almost obsessive approach.  (I have met a few people like this).  Is this addiction to work similar to other addictions?  or is there something else triggering this almost obsessive work-ethic to the preclusion of almost all other activities?  I am after peer-refereed articles about any studies that have been performed on this. "
926,Is there a conflict between Mindfulness-based and Acceptance-based Therapies and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)?,"Mindfulness-based and Acceptance-based therapies are gaining vast momentum in the treatment of mental illnesses. These therapy modalities are seen to share some similarity with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) (Ost, 2008), however, I am curious to know what conflicts exist in a therapist-client relationship when adopting some of the techniques/foundations from both therapy forms?  For example, in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) - defusion (the process of distancing ourselves from our throughts) seems to present some form of conflict to CBT which suggests that cognitive restructuring is fundamental to behavioural change, i.e. ""trying to change our thoughts"". There may be some conflict within a therapeutic setting.  Questions:   What conflicts can occur in the therapist-client relationship when using mindfulness and acceptance exercises with cognitive behaviour therapy exercises? In what ways may the two groups complement each other in achieving therapeutic outcomes ^ for the client?   ^ Therapeutic outcomes can be assumed as symptomatic alleviation of the mental illness or any other positive outcome towards the alleviation of a mental illness.  Some further examples would be great.  References:   Öst, L.G. (2008). Efficacy of the third wave of behavioral therapies: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

932,"Can't we teach other intelligent animals ""complex"" languages?","I assume I'm not the first person to think about this, but I find this idea very useful, and if it works it would really be a major breakthrough (IMO, more important than getting to space).  Animals already have their own ""kind-of-language"", but it is based more on feelings, moods, and whatever the sounds/body-language naturally inspire, and not on abstract thought. Given that there are primates capable of using sign language, I am left to believe that the barriers preventing animals from learning to speak are not simply their smaller brains, but their inability to pronounce the letters of most human languages and the lack of incentive or a good teacher (human parents are the equivalent language-teacher for the human-baby)  The scenario I though of would be the following (I used chimps as an example, but you can replace it with other animals if you wish): A group of world-class language-scientists develop a language with words and letters that can be easily pronounced by chimps. The language could even be constructed to be a very ""beginner"" language, to ease the learning process, as long as it keeps its properties of being able to express various thoughts and ideas.     A few people then spend a some years to learn and practice this language until they can speak it more or less fluently, and adopt a baby chimp (or more) to raise, like a human baby.  There are, of course, a lot of details left to discuss. The ""parent"" should probably form a close bond with the chimp, so that it trusts them and pays attention to them. Luck is also a factor, as maybe only some current chimps would be able to pass this experiment.  In summary, my question is: Are there currently any species likely to be able to learn a language specifically made for them? And if yes, is there nobody researching this? I want to talk with my cat!  I am interested in your thoughts about this, and in any useful information you might have regarding this subject. "
933,Can a borderline-autistic adult force themselves to improve?,"It is agreed that Autism Spectrum disorders / Aspergers etc cannot be 'cured'; they can be managed with coping strategies, and suppressed with medicines, but not solved at the root level. [Source: ""autism is not an illness or disease and cannot be cured""]   There are amazing positive changes available to people through Neuro Linguistic Programming or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (and many others)... [Source: the NHS, plus do I really have to supply proof that talking - without drugs - can help some people make behavioural changes?!] ...but I worry that certain autistic traits are so embedded in the brain that large changes would not be accessible to those on the spectrum.    So how do those with autism know how hard to push themselves to improve skills that the rest of the population find easier? E.G. Someone might find that endless hours of effort can help them overcome a pedantic obsession of control/detail... but any time spent trying to halt their adherence to routine is a wasted effort.  Is there a way to tell which traits are worth battling, and which are unsolvable?  And what about people on the borderline (self-diagnosed, or appearing very autistic in some areas but not in others). Are their unwanted traits more easily solvable just because they do not have the full set of symptoms? "
934,"Relationship and differences between psychosomatic, somatoform and idiopathic disorders","I'm really confused because it seems to me these terms overlap to some extent.  Psychosomatic disorder     psychosomatic adj.   1. of or pertaining to a physical disorder that is caused or notably influenced by emotional factors. American Heritage Dictionary      psychosomatic   1. (Psychology) of or relating to disorders, such as stomach ulcers, thought to be caused or aggravated by psychological factors such as   stress Collins English Dictionary   somatoform disorder (called somatic symptom disorder since DSM-V)     denoting physical symptoms that can not be attributed to organic   disease and appear to be of psychic origin.  Miller-Keane   Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied   Health      denoting physical symptoms that cannot be attributed to organic   disease and appear to be psychogenic. Dorland's Medical   Dictionary for Health Consumers   In both cases these terms seem to be used for physical symptoms which rather than being attributed to physical conditions, are based on mental factors, ie., psychogenic.  Also, three of these definitions are framed in terms of ""thought to be caused by psychological factors"", ""appear to be of psychic origin"" and ""appear to be psychogenic."" Given that these three terms imply cause is not known with certainty they are idiopathic, right?     idiopathic adj. Of, relating to, or designating a disease   having no known cause. American Heritage Dictionary   From looking at these two meanings of psychosomatic disorder and somatoform disorder, am I mistaken in perceiving them the same way, or at least confusingly almost the same thing? One says ""relating to disorders ... thought to be caused or aggravated by psychological factors"" and the other says ""denoting physical symptoms ... (that) appear to be of psychic origin.""  Could someone clarify what the differences are in light of the definitions, which seem quite the same to me? "
935,"Why does ""name it to tame it"" work from an evolutionary psychology perspective?","There seems to exist a phenomenon where being aware of one's feelings gives us power over them. I have seen this in everyday life, but the strongest piece of evidence I've seen is from a talk by UCLA Psychology professor Dan Siegel who talks about his research putting people in brain scanners and getting them to name their emotions, and he says:     If you can get her left brain to name the emotion, her left brain will   squirt soothing neurotransmitters into her lower brain   My question is: why do we have this mechanism? Do we have any idea how it evolved and what sort of evolutionary pressures or environments led to it? (Should I be asking Siegel himself? :P) "

939,Finding largest level of imperceptible noise in an image,"Suppose that we want to find the ""largest level"" of a random noise that can safely be added to an image such that the resultant noisy image cannot be distinguishable from the original noise-free image. For this purpose, we design the following subjective experiment:  Let I be the reference (noise-free) image. We first add a high level of noise to I to get a noisy image J. We then display I and J side by side, and ask a user to reduce the level of the noise in J gradually using a slider until he/she cannot distinguish between the reference image and the noisy image. The resultant level is then considered as the largest level of imperceptible noise for I.  But do you think that this experiment is technically sound? Also, can we use an adaptive procedure like QUEST to find the desired threshold/noise level? What do you think? "

I know there is a lot of concern with veterans and PTSD, but I am more interested in all the other situations/civilian cases of PTSD. From what I have read, there are overlapping symptoms between PTSD and TBI? Is it possible for someone to have PTSD from damage to the brain and not from a specific event?  "
941,"How to explain utility function from personality, beliefs and ongoing emotions?","Economists widely use utility function (and more broader approach called hedonistic regression) but are there explanations or derivations of utility function from the perspective of cognitive sciences or psychology which can take into account personality, beliefs and experience (memory) and ongoing emotions (affects)? Clearly one should start with the Maslov pyramid that determines goals and needs and then one can proceed to explain why different people value differently one and the same goods or services? Are there such research trends, some keywords, terms, notable researchers in this area?  I have read only about incorporation of altruism in the utility function of neoclassical economics, about hypberbolic discount function and so on. But I have not managed to find more practical explanation of utility function.  This question has the following context: I am trying to model the economic behavior or BDI agent - agent with Beliefs/Desires/Intentions. BDI is the most popular approach for modelling cognitive agents. Recent research (e.g. [website]Is there some research along this lines?  This should be promising area of research. Because common approach to economic analysis and prediction is connected with Data Science and statistical methods (conjoint analysis and hedonic regression).

943,Possible links of the dreaming and hypnotic state,"Recently I was asked a question that made me stuck: ""how does dreaming states and hypnotic state differ?"". What available EEG, fMRI and other means of obtaining data on the brain activity show in such cases?  How much is known about changes of the brain activity when brain moves from wakefulness to sleep?  For now, I only found tiny mentioning of the similarity between the REM state and hypnosis in Wikipedia article (part about Joe Griffin and Ivan Tyrrell), but there wasn't mentioning of the real similarities like EEG rhythms or brain activity scan data.  The person asking the question mentioned a competent specialist having several decades of practice (I don't know who it is).  He told he heard an intriguing (at least for me) idea from this specialist: ""when the person starts to sleep, there is a moment of a high susceptibility to the hypnosis""; I'd like to know a bit more about that: is that right, or maybe there is some misunderstanding? Maybe there are good materials on this particular topic? "
944,What causes emotions?,"I have absolutely no knowledge of psychology. But I am wondering what causes emotions in human? Emotions such as happiness, sadness, love, hate etc. Is there some sort of hormones responsible for this? How does brain understands this and is there a way to control this?  "

Is there any research on objective differences between the types (without using NEO-PI-R or other Big5 inventories as the objective reference)? "
946,how can the development of sexual preferences be influenced?,"I am wondering about the development of sexual fetishes, not necessarily in its meaning of having a sexual affection for inanimate objects, but in its broader meaning of any type of sexual abnormality. As far as I know, such preferences develop through conditioning; i.e. in a state of arousal something not related to sex is perceived and assosiated with one's feelings. For example, one might experience a leather outfit while being aroused and develop a fetish for them.  This is quite a harmless example, but many fetishes may actually be harmful and an individual may want to prevent its development. For the sake of argument, a castration fetish could be considered extremely dangerous, leading to potential self harm at some point in the future.  Would a person who experiences arousal from such a fetish be able to prevent it from emerging? As an example, one could avoid masturbation while thinking of the unwanted fetish. This on the other hand would lead to repression of these unfulfilled desires and could possibly backfire.  Can the development of sexual preferences be actually stopped and/or influenced, and if so, what would be the best way to do so? "
947,Which is a better statistical option to compare differences across groups?,"I have two groups (13 experimental and 13 control participants) performing on two cognitive tasks. I have accuracy (omissions, commissions) and reaction time measurement from each test for each person. To avoid type-I error, I was suggested to decrease my number of DVs, I now have d-prime (d') and reaction time (RT) as the DVs (both continuous). I would like to compare performances on both the tasks, across both the groups. My questions pertaining to this design are:   Is d-prime a good measurement to substitute accuracy scores ? or could you please suggest a unitary index that would reflect behavioral performance (from omissions, commissions, RT data) Should I do a one way MANOVA? (IV- groups; DV- test1 d', test2 d', test1 RT, test2 RT)? or Should I do a mixed model MANOVA? (if yes, how to do this, what are my DVs)?  "
948,"Does neuroplasticity cancel the notion of ""aptitudes"" as a natural gift?","Considering the definition of neuroplasticity as the capability of our brain to rewire itself by forming new neural connections throughout the life, it seems to me that our brain is like a programmable computer and all we have to do is to input new codes and debug/delete/re-program what we have internalized from our parents and the environment.  Having that in mind, this notion that people are being born by some special gifts called ""aptitudes"" loses its credibility. According to what aptitude pros say: ""Aptitudes are natural talents born differently in every individual and they are special abilities for doing, or learning to do, certain kinds of things which is unique in every person.""  It seems to me that what we have in our unconscious ""to some extent"" can be controlled by what we consciously decide to do and therefore, neuroplasticity seems more true to me than being born by special gifts called ""aptitudes"". Am I correct? or, there is still more to know about the relationship between ""neuroplasticity"" and ""aptitudes""? "
949,Models relating neuron firing to oscillatory dynamics,"Many papers published seem to focused on oscillations to characterize synchronisation and communication between different brain areas. For example, this paper from Voytek et. al where communication between brain areas increases with the abstractedness of the task.

In other words, given spiking data and location of a neuron ensemble, would it be possible to model the types of oscillations that might be read? "

In other words, can we perform some operation on the ABCD-trained network and end up with a network identical to one that has been trained only on A,C, and D? "
952,Is it possible that human behavior cannot be formalized as an optimization problem?,"It is common to explain humans behavior by having the brain follow a certain objective function, that may have been formed through evolution. Given the objective function and infinite computing resources, we could apply reinforcement learning to simulate human behavior.  However, is it be possible that behavior emerges from other processes that do not have a clear objective function? Is there any related work in cognitive science? "
953,"How to interpret strong, significant correlations between dimensions on a measure?","I have been provided datasets from two questionnaires, with the aim of exploring any relationships between the factors measured by one, and factors measured by the other. One questionnaire looks at personality (big 5 type stuff), while the other looks at self-assessed capability (self-efficacy). Note, however, that I am performing exploratory research - I'm looking for correlations, rather than suggesting causation.  The questionnaires each feature approximately 60 questions, which fit within a number of dimensions. I didn't construct the questionnaires, so, as part of the analysis I looked at the correlation coefficients of scores between dimensions within each questionnaire, before looking at the correlations of dimensions between questionnaires (I hope I'm making sense!).  What I've found is that almost all the dimensions within the questionnaire measuring self-efficacy correlate with each other, to a strong degree (more than ±0.5) significant at the 0.01 level.  My experience in questionnaire design and analysis is limited, however, this result seems instinctively bad. Having done some reading around the issue, I have come across ""multicollinearity"", however, as I am not performing regression (because I'm not looking for causation), I don't think this is the appropriate term. Similarly, I have come across the term ""factor loading"", but, again, I'm not doing factor analysis here, so I don't think this is applicable.  My, albeit naive, understanding is that either the factors are all measuring the same (or a very similar) thing (an issue with construct validity, maybe?), or the factors are all different, but strongly and significantly related (in which case, is this an issue?)  My overall question is this: Am I correct in this understanding / is there a way (or multiple ways) to explain what's going on here? And, for bonus points, does this issue (if it even is an issue) have a technical term?  As always, many thanks in advance! "
954,Is our sense of smell heightened when we are asleep?,"My question is whether our sense of smell is stronger when we sleep? From an evolutionary perspective this could have been beneficial in terms of runaway camp fires, marauding saber tooth tigers or the testosterone of night-raiding cave men.   Does this effect back off when we wake, as our eyesight comes into play? And, if so, how do we account for the claims that many people die in  night time house fires before they wake up?  I'm aware that the brain is able to desensitise itself to certain smells and go about its olfactory business elsewhere. That second sniff of fresh-ground coffee beans is never as good as the first.  I'd say that most people assume they are 'a bit slow' first thing in the morning until they 'wake up properly', but is this true?  "
955,Episodic Memory Decoding,"I'm planning a study on memorability of episodic events. Therefore, participants record a couple of hours of their daily life using an egocentric camera (encoding). After a certain time, they are shown snippets from the recording and judge whether they remember it or not (decoding).  I don't have a psychological background, hence I have some questions:   How long should the snippets be? Currently, we have 5sec videos, separated by 10sec margin. I know chunking, however, it happens in encoding phase, I'm looking for an equivalent in decoding. Maybe showing a few frames from the video is better than playing video? How long should the time between encoding and decoding be? Currently, it's 6 to 8 days. I'm aware of Time Scale Similarity. I've found a work that suggests that asking people whether they remember or not is sensible. However, any further evidence would be great. I think Experiences of Remembering, Knowing, and Guessing is also highly related.   As this is a scientific work, references are highly appreciated. "
956,Does the peripheral nervous system processes information like central neurons do?,"Neural coding deals with the problem on how neurons or a network of neurons processes a stimulus and creates a response in form of electrical action potentials. Information then might be encoded in the rate of the action potentials or their timing.  My questions now are:   Do nerves, e.g. in the arm of a human, merely ""relay"" any information, or do they also process incoming signals in any way? As a result, the electrical signal would then differ when measured at the beginning and the end of a nerve. Can a nerve be stimulated at one point with a certain electrical signal as input (with varying rate etc. to encode information) and can the output be measured at another point?    If I understood correctly, this is done at a electroneuronography (ENoG) only that the electrical stimulus is not varying in rate or other properties.  Any links to research that deals with similar things would be great.    "
957,Do people with birth defects feel phantom limbs?,"The phenomenon of phantom limbs in people who have lost arms or legs to amputation is pretty well-established. It makes a fair amount of sense. The ""brain mapping"" of the limb (and for that matter the nerves that led to it) don't go away just because the limb does.  But what about people who never had the limb? Does a person who was born with one arm due to a birth defect ever ""feel"" the second arm that should be there? "
958,"Who do we count as ""intelligent"" and why?","Most of my friends, for instance, say they want an ""intelligent"" girlfriend. Now, I know this is a philosophical question and a matter of opinion, and there is a similar question on intelligence looking for a scientific or some other formulaic way to label someone as intelligent, what I'm interested in is the social psychology aspect of it: what do they mean? What do people in this day and age think ""intelligent"" means? Don't they just call that to whoever is counted as intelligent by what they see as social standards? Then what are the universal standards and why? "
959,How do we know how to cry?,"When a baby is born they already know how to cry. If you inflict pain, their reaction is to cry.   My question is NOT why do they cry because that is obvious: they are uncomfortable, they are cold, they have been squeezed or as my Mom would say: They are crying because this world is evil and they don't want to be here.   To further remove any confusion: I do not care why they cry.   I had no luck finding anything online except this Q&amp;A with this answer:     So your first natural response is to cry, or as you like to think of it, to produce noises from your vocal throat. This is an inbuilt response. As you grow up you notice every time you emit this noise you are given food, attention, and your basic needs are accounted for. This is a learned response.   The interesting bit from the above quote is:     produce noises from your vocal throat.    Question   Why do humans know crying?  If it is not crying and you call it noises from vocal throat then why do babies produce those noises instead of noises such as laughter noises? Clearly they know that the crying type noise will get us to provide them comfort but the laughing type will not.    Perhaps when they are in the womb they can feel when the mother cries, it causes discomfort; so maybe they learn it that way through association. But that begs the question: Why don't they learn laughing in the womb as well?   I will downvote answers that try to state why babies cry since I made it clear that is not my question.  "
960,What is acquaintance and how can it help a person?,"An acquaintance party is :     ... a college party held at the begining of the semester where students have the opportunity to meet each other. (source)   Since this party is always held in different schools in most countries, it made me wonder if its purpose goes further than just having fun, or getting to know University.   How does this party help a person personally/professionally? What is the main goal of this celebration, aside from having fun? "

963,What explains the characteristics of the receptive fields of simple cells in V1?,"Here is a YouTube video of a Hubel &amp; Wiesel experiment from 1965 in the visual cortex. The video shows the experimenters outlining the receptive field of a simple cell in the first part of the video using symbols. Crosses are used for excitatory responses, and triangles for inhibitory responses.   As shown in the video, neuron firing rate increased when the edge of a bar of light touched the crosses present on the top left. It is not just the orientation and location of light bar, but it seems that the light bar's edge is defining the firing rate, and thus determines the receptive field. So, the oriented receptive field of the cell seems to be defined w.r.t to the stimulus edges, rather than the bright and dark regions stimulating the on-center and off-surround parts of the receptive field. It seems that the simple cell was getting triggered when the edge of the light bar touched the three lines made by cross marks and triangles in that particular orientation. So, the cell under consideration was responding to edges at three separate locations.  Is my understanding correct ? Please help me in understanding how oriented receptive fields made up with center-surround concept explain the excitation at the edge observed. Perhaps it can be seen as the derivative of a box-like receptive field, or an oriented receptive field. "
964,"Correlation between ""mechanical aptitude"" and IQ","I am an economist working in labour market issues. It is common in my field to divide jobs between those who are intensive in ""manual"" tasks and those who are intensive in ""cognitive"" tasks (e.g. here). I want to find evidence about the correlation between the ""ability"" these jobs require. In particular, I am looking for studies showing the correlation between ""manual ability"" (perhaps mechanical aptitudes, dexterity, etc) and ""cognitive ability"" (perhaps general intelligence, IQ, etc).    Most of the references I have found are literally from the first half of last century (e.g. here, here, here, here, here, or here, including work by Spearman, which apparently started this line of research, and has become widely used as a description of different types of ""intelligence"").   Interestingly, the first old reference above, in page 8, finds a high degree of correlation (0.6 to 0.7), whereas the second old reference states that      The theory that general intelligence and mechanical ability are distinct    traits is consistently confirmed by the low correlations found between tests of intelligence and mechanical ability.    but does not provide references. The third old reference, in page 101 of the pdf document, states that the correlation is low (below .30).  Regarding modern references, I have found very few, and I am not sure they are relevant for what I am looking for. For example, this study find predictive power of fine motor skills in mathematical tests. This study find a high correlation between general intelligence and motor skills relating learning taekwondo. This study finds that general intelligence is correlated with job performance across occupations.  So, I am not satisfied with these references. Can you suggest me better literature? Am I using the wrong concepts? Are the references provided above ""sufficient""? Any guidance on these issues is very much appreciated! "
965,What are the most used statistical methods in WM research besides (generalized) linear modeling?,"I mean, by cognitive psychologists. I skimmed over a few articles from Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience and Trends in Cognitive Science and concluded that ANOVAs and t-tests are mostly used (without effect sizes). I'm sure that there are more scientific journals of cognitive psychology than these two, and I guess, that there are also more advanced statistical tools than comparing groups. For example, in social psychology, structural equations modelling and mediation analysis are in fashion.  When asking this question, I had working memory in mind.  Common methods to measure working memory empirically are, among others: dual task paradigms, n-back tasks and composites of simple memory measures. The main statistical tools that are applied to these measures seem to be mainly ANOVAs, t-tests, and other variations on traditional linear modeling, but what are the alternatives?  What are the most used statistical methods in WM research besides (generalized) linear modeling? "
966,"Are there any studies (fMRI scans, etc) showing why some people (supposedly) are more open to hypnotism?","In this article published in Harper's magazine back in 1996, journalist David Foster Wallace described his experience with hypnotist Nigel Ellery (see the last section of the article, titled ""THE HEADLINE ENTERTAINMENT""). Mr Ellery was providing part of the entertainment on the cruise ship that David was on.  As to hypnotism, David writes that:     First off, we learn that not everyone is susceptible to serious hypnosis: Nigel Ellery puts the Celebrity Show Lounge's whole 300-plus crowd through some simple in-your-seat tests to determine who is suggestibly ""gifted"" enough to ""participate"" in the ""fun"" to come.   In the footnote to that paragraph just quoted, David writes that:     I, who know from hard experience that I am hypnotizable, think about sports statistics and deliberately flunk a couple of the tests to avoid getting up there.   The question I wanted to ask is, are there any studies looking into why some people would be more susceptible to hypnotism?  What I am particularly interested in is whether this has something to do with a habitual activation or inactivation of parts of the brain, or perhaps the levels of some neuromodulators? "
967,Why do men have greater variance than women in mental test scores?,"Hedges and Nowell (1995) write that      Sex differences in central tendency, variability, and numbers of high   scores on mental tests have been extensively studied. Research has not   always seemed to yield consistent results, partly because most studies   have not used representative samples of national populations. An   analysis of mental test scores from six studies that used national   probability samples provided evidence that although average sex   differences have been generally small and stable over time, the test   scores of males consistently have larger variance. Except in tests of   reading comprehension, perceptual speed, and associative memory, males   typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring   individuals.   However, they don't really say anything about the reason for this aside from that ""Our results shed little light on the origins of sex differences in [...] variability"" (p45).  What theories are there of the reasons for this sex difference in variability on mental tests, and how strong is the evidence to support these theories? "
968,Do ADHD drugs harm the brain?,"Particularly, the amphetamine ""vyvanse"". If one was to take a 30mg dose once a day for 50+ years, would it damage brain function at all?

These are some of the questions I have regarding ADHD amphetamines. "
969,Does 3rd person reference to self change perception of self?,"If you refer to yourself in the third person for a day how does your understanding of self change?

Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (American Psychological Association, 2014) talks about precision of measurement in several places, but does not seem to provide any references.  Also, to what extent is precision of measurement in IRT theory similar to or different from absolute agreement in score (as opposed to inter-rater reliability or test reliability as measured by alpha) in CTT?

973,What color is this dress? -- And why do some see it as white and gold and others see it as black and blue?,"Here's the dress (and keep reading, this is actually a serious question):    This question about this image has apparently become quite a rapidly spreading meme on the internet. And after conducting my own little home experiment I can see why! My brother an law looked at this image on the same screen as I did and said matter-of-factly that the dress is black and blue. I, on the other hand can't see this as anything but gold and white. I tried this question with a few others with similar results.  So the question is... what is going on here? What is causing this to either appear strongly as black and blue or gold and white? "
974,Do introverts engage in too much self-control or do they lack impulsivity?,"Regardless of whether people are extraverts or introverts, if they are asked to act in an extraverted way, this improves their mood (for example Zelenski and others 2012). My question is concerns the reasons for why introverts don't engage in extraverted behavior. According to dual process models of behavior (for example Strack, Deutsch, 2014), human behavior is a combination of impulses and more reflective behavior (for example self-control). It strikes me that extraverted behavior is often quite impulsive (e.g. posting a funny picture of oneself on facebook). So, do introverts lack these impulses, or are they too inclined to keep them under control? Is there any research that has tried to disentangle the two processes?  "
975,Do women talk more than men?,"If you believe the stereotype, women are much more talkative then men. Is there a kernel of truth to this stereotype?

976,"How else can we eliminate wrong underlying beliefs, when even science fails?","Source: Why Do Many Reasonable People Doubt Science?, 2015 March, by Joel Achenbach     [Andrew] Shtulman [of Occidental College] ’s research indicates that as we become scientifically literate, we repress our naive beliefs but never eliminate them entirely. They lurk in our brains, chirping at us as we try to make sense of the world.   This staggered and overwhelmed me: How else can we correct, improve, and refine our lurking, substratal intuitions or instincts that are wrong? I ask NOT about simply  accepting or tolerating facts or science superficially (as insinuated by this excerpt), and remain traumatised.      Footnote: The author has a BA in Politics, and not in science, if this implies anything?  "
977,How did the concepts of left and right direction develop in the human mind?,"I hope this is the correct forum to ask; if not, please migrate to a better place.  How did humans came to agree on a distinction between the directions ""right"" and ""left""? I could think of two alternative ways:   Biology: the right hand is usually stronger, so humans can agree that the direction of the stronger hand is ""right"" and the other direction is ""left"". Astronomy: in the northern hemisphere, when people look to the direction of the rising sun (= east), they see it turning slightly to the right of them (= south). So they could agree that the direction the sun turns to is ""right"" and the other direction is ""left"".   Is there any evidence to one or the other or to another explanation? "
978,Is volition a reality or an illusion?,"Keeping religious sentiments aside, here is a question raised on the Buddhism SE that attempts to answer a similar question from the Buddhist point of view.  You see, Buddhism has a concept of anatman or no-self that attempts to explain the conditioned-self as a cause-and-effect phenomena arising through the interaction of the five aggregates (sensations, mental-formations, thoughts, feelings, etc.) and doesn't have a permanent or essential existence of its own. However, I would like to know what does the science or psychology has to say about this?  Does something called I exists as a soul/essence separate from the physical body? More importantly, does volition, or more commonly called will-power exists or it is just an illusion?  A practical Experiment:  Suppose I (as soul/mind/any-other-hypothetical) decide to lift my arm right now, and the very next instant my arm lifted in the air. I would like to know what exactly triggered the decision to lift? If it were I (soul/mind/etc..) that made the decision, then why would  electrodes attached to my brain show that the impulse to move the hand came before I was aware of it? The electrodes reading seem to imply that:   Either the arm has a mind of its own apart from the primary mind (sort of a separate CPU core in a multi-core processor) that took the decision (seems less likely to me). OR Some external force (in nature) triggered the decision (seems more likely to me).   I would like to know what is Psychology's take on this?  EDIT: The conventional explanation to this in terms of the subconscious being the causal factor seems incomplete at best. As mentioned in a comment on @ArnonWeinberg's answer, all it means is that we don't know. Subconscious seems like a hypothetical chaos that we ascribe all phenomena that we are unable to explain scientifically. In the above experiment for instance, what caused the subconscious mind to make that decision at that exact moment? "
979,Sleep deprivation and task performance,"Case: In case of an adult, the average adult sleep time required is 7.5 to 8 hours. Suppose the person (aged between 23-29) has slept only 6 hours, or less than the average time (7.5 to 8 hours).   Does sleep deprivation lasting for a day cause mood swings in that particular day? Do we loose grasping abilities due to sleep deprivation? Does sleep deprivation affect our reasoning abilities?  "
980,How can Semantic Pointer Architecture be used to capture dynamical systems?,"Most uses of SPA I've seen seem to be representing static systems, such as recognizing digits, categorizing images, rapid variable creation (also called ""completing a pattern"") and planning a path for writing those digits back out.

982,Is the depletion effect of self-control reliable?,"Although a lot of research (Muraven, 1998) has indicated the ego depletion of self-control, a recent paper (Xu, 2014) claims that they fail to replicate the depletion effect: impaired performance in subsequent tasks.  So, is the depletion effect of self-control reliable?  References   Muraven, M., Tice, D. M., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (1998). Self-control as a limited resource: Regulatory depletion patterns.

983,Are you more successful if you publicly commit to pursuing a difficult goal?,"If you have an ambitious goal, does it help to publicly commit to that goal? For example, if someone is training for a long distance triathlon but doesn't know whether he/she will be able to pull it off or not. This person could tell his/her friends about my goal or post it on Facebook. What consequences does it have for people, if they do that? On the one hand, it might push them more, because they don't want to be embarrassed in front of others if they fail. On the other hand, this is a pretty negative focus and might be distractive. "

Is this a relevant topic for investigation? If not, why? "
985,How does raw IQ change over the lifespan at the group-level?,"In the classic review of intelligence research (Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns), Neisser et al (1996) write the following     Stability. Intelligence test scores are fairly stable during   development. When Jones and Bayley (1941) tested a sample of children   annually throughout childhood and adolescence, for example, scores   obtained at age 18 were correlated r = .77 with scores that had been   obtained at age 6 and r = .89 with scores from age 12. When scores   were averaged across several successive tests to remove short-term   fluctuations, the correlations were even higher. The mean for ages 17   and 18 was correlated r = .86 with the mean for ages 5, 6, and 7, and   r = .96 with the mean for ages 11, 12, and 13. (For comparable   findings in a more recent study, see Moffitt, Caspi, Harkness, &amp;   Silva, 1993.) Nevertheless, IQ scores do change over time. In the same   study (Jones &amp; Bayley, 1941), the average change between age 12 and   age 17 was 7.1 IQ points; some individuals changed as much as 18   points.   Typically, IQ scores are standardised for age and thus remove age related differences.  My question is  What is the  relationship between age and raw intelligence test score at the group-level from around age 5 and into adultyhood?  From what I've read, I understand that at the group-level intelligence increases monotonically with age during childhood and that it levels-off at some point (perhaps around 18?). Also, below a certain age (e.g., in infancy), completely different tests are required to measured intelligence. I also understand that individuals may experience various trajectories (e.g., some might plateau earlier, etc.), but I'm interested in the group-level. Thus, an ideal answer would probably provide a sense of the functional form of the increase in intelligence over childhood and adolescence.   My first thought for an answer was to look at the test manual for a standardised child intelligence test, such as the WISC, but I don't currently have easy access to that.  References   Jones, H. E., and Bayley, N. (1941). The Berkeley Growth Study. Child Development, 12, 167-173. Moffitt, T. E., Gabrielli, W. F., Mednick, S. A., &amp; Schulsinger, E (1981).

986,Does language and/or culture affect an individual's cognitive capacity?,"Some languages have multiple expressions to identify, address, comprehend, and interpret a single concept and/or experience.

Does language create a bottleneck situation where the available lexicon used to define certain aspects of cognition and its experiences are inadequate for understanding the true definition of that experience?

987,"By learning to read and write upside down, what did I do to myself?","If you've ever read Encyclopedia Brown books, you'll be familiar with the backwards writing in the back of the book that explains the solution to the case.  When I was in my mid-late teens (I don't remember the age exactly) I decided to teach myself to read/write upside down (and backwards?). I can read most text fairly well when the page is upside down (and have no problems with the upside down unicode text people post on Facebook), and I am able to write upside down with relative ease.  However, since developing that skill I have fairly extreme difficulties remembering how to write lowercase b's and d's, and I've had to use a trick I've heard dyslexics use and I remind myself that a 'b' points towards the end of a word.  I have no problems reading words with the characters, or typing them on the computer when I want a 'b' or a 'd', only when I'm writing it.  Did I give myself a very limited form of dyslexia? "
988,How much information is lost when conveying an experience or emotion to another person?,Certain languages have words that do not literally translate into any another language.  There is already a small loss of information in this sense.    Emotions are a personal experience and the gravity and meaning of them are dependent on the person who experiences them.  The same goes for all conscious experiences.  So how much information is lost when one person is trying to convey these personal experiences with another person?  Will actions carry more relevant data than words when explaining a personal experience?  Is there any way to quantify the loss in translation of experiences?

990,What can we learn from the neural networks of C.elegans to understand human brains?,"Recently I am reading some works about Caenorhabditis Elegans. A C.elegans has 302 neurons and we already know the function and connection of every one of their neurons so that we can exactly reconstruct it by computer programs. Also, C.elegans have a couple of sensory inputs, and a kind of intelligence (they can learn something).  The question is: what can we learn from C.elegans, so that we can understand Human brains?  To specify, I want to know:   What's the relationship between C.elegans and Human beings (or primates)? Is there any route in the terms of evolution? Does the neural system of C.elegans still exist in human brains, as either a working or an idle part?    I am a computer scientist working on artificial intelligence. My purpose is to clarify the mechanisms of the Human brain. I hope C.elegans could help but I don't know much about biology.  "
991,Why are people inclined to praise or fear the unknown?,"Human beings are inclined to ""praise"" the unknown, and are often afraid of the unknown. This inclination has led to the creation of mythology and many gods. To this date we are still carrying this habit on our daily lives.    ""Oh, look at these crop circles, aliens must have created them!"" ""Oh, he can bend the spoon! He must have psychic power!"" ""Nah, earth must be standing over the oxen horns, otherwise it would fall down!"" ""It makes sense! You adjust your balance with the wrist band exerting bioenergy! Here I come!""

""Since you have a BS degree. You must be a heck of a genius! Now can you please answer this question of geography/history/so on?"" (I usually encounter such questions from ignorant people. They regard me as Mr. Know it all, as they don't know what university infact is.) and most striking example of all is God of the Gaps.   To further exemplify my claim, Wikipedia quotes God of the Gaps as a variant of argument from ignorance.     The term God-of-the-gaps argument can refer to a position that assumes   an act of God as the explanation for an unknown phenomenon, which is a   variant of an argument from ignorance.[9][10] Such an argument is   sometimes reduced to the following form:         There is a gap in understanding of some aspect of the natural world.   Therefore the cause must be supernatural.         One example of such an argument, which uses God as an explanation of   one of the current gaps in biological science, is as follows: ""Because   current science can't figure out exactly how life started, it must be   God who caused life to start.""   But this answer is rather specific and not satisfying for me. I think there lies a cognitive bias that drives human beings to prefer to praise/fear the unknown over showing reasoning and critical thinking when we are faced to the unknown.   Update: This scene from The Gods Must Be Crazy is spot on! Don't miss it :)  Questions   Does scientific research support the claims made above about the importance of this tendency to praise or fear the unknown? Is there an exact term for this tendency? Is Occam's Razor the right term for this? What does scientific research tell us about why humans have this tendency?  "
992,What is the most complex artificial neural network created to date?,A few years ago I wrote a research paper for college on neural networks.  At the time IBM's Blue Brain was the clear winner. Some rumor went around that they were close to emulating a brain the complexity of a cat; this has since been debunked.   At the time their research was groundbreaking and previously even emulating the brain of a C. Elegans seemed far-fetched.  Describing the complexity of neural networks is complex but I'll define number of synapses or neurons as an easily measurable scale of complexity.  What is the most complex working artificial neural network? What is the relative complexity of this network compared to an animal's brain? 
993,What is an effective metric of complexity for an Artificial Neural Network?,"After asking the question What is the most complex neural network... I realized I don't really have a good metric of ""complexity"" in a general sense. The simplest measure would likely be count of neurons or number of synapses, but that fails to take into account the structure of the network.  A couple measures of complexity are discussed in the paper Complexity of Predictive Neural Networks  but they are very specific to a single task. One is the amount of work needed to learn a certain thing, and the other is how many neurons are needed to approximate a certain function.  Rough, animal based measures are often employees for the sake of grabbing headlines; such as the incorrect claims that The Blue Brain Project had emulated a neural network ""as complex as"" a cat's brain. C. elegans is a common and seemingly attainable level of complexity for an artificial neural network.   Animal based measures are relateable to the layman but seem questionable, especially when comparing a neural network to that of an animal who's neural network has not been completely mapped (as C. elegans has).  What is a meaningful measure by which artificial neural networks can be measured? How are such networks currently compared? Can any such metric appropriately measure complexity of such a system? "
994,Is it possible to improve reading speed and visual comprehension by doing exercises?,"Background  I'm trying to capture detailed information from the images in my visual memory, mainly text.  My daily life requires reading many documents on varying topics. I want to increase my reading speed and comprehension so that I can see text blocks as a whole; that is I see them not as meaningful text, but an image to be processed later. Perhaps then I would be able to iterate over the images in memory faster than I can with my eyes.   However, when I need to remember the details of a topic, I can visually remember the location of the text in the document, but I can't recall details such as whole sentences.  I'm trying to improve my visual memory by this simple exercise:    chose a random image from flickr  have a look at it for a few seconds  eyes closed, try to rebuild the image from memory    but normally I can not remember many of the details from the image, even if it's not very detailed.  When I try this exercise with text blocks, I mostly end up ""reading the block"". It's hard to treat a text block as an image without reading it. So I normally fail at visualizing it in my memory.  Questions   Is it possible to improve reading speed, reading comprehension, and visual comprehension through visualisation exercises like those above? If not with the above exercises, are there other exercises that can improve such skills?  "
995,Is variation in human brain size related to mental functioning?,"It seems that the head size of human beings has evolved to be relatively similar, yet there is still some amount of variation. While I'm sure the correlation is not absolute, I read that larger heads do imply larger brains.   Thus, my questions:   What is the correlation between head size and brain size? What is the relationship between brain size and mental processing ability (e.g., intelligence, emotional responses to certain stimuli, reaction time, etc)?  Why might these correlations exist or not exist?  "
996,How to efficiently locate existing psychology and social science measures?,"Whenever I start a new research project, I typically have to find questions and scales that have proven validity in measuring constructs of interest (e.g., psychological / political science / social science scales). This can often be quite time consuming, and often there are issues of cost and copyright to consider.  Questions   What are general tips for efficiently and cost effectively locating measures for a given construct? Are there any databases that make it easy to locate such measures? Is there anything like a StackOverflow/PatternLibrary/Best Practices compendium of measures or advice on locating measures?  "
997,Why would psychotic symptoms return 8 months after stopping seroquel instead of immediately?,"I have a friend who experienced a cannabis induced psychosis about 5 years ago. He was on seroquel for about 4 years. However, since seroquel caused intense side effects, he decided to stop it cold turkey 8 months ago. At first he had very bad symptoms, which got weaker and weaker for 4 months. However, after 8 months abstinence, his psychotic symptoms returned in full force.  Why would the return of the psychotic symptoms take 8 months to return after abstinence from the drug? What does that tell us? "
998,Reference signal when measuring EEG,"When performing EEG, a number of electrodes are placed on the scalp to measure the electric potential difference between those locations and a reference. In the unipolar configuration, the reference is often the signal on another electrode (and is common to all measurement electrodes) or an average of the all measurement electrodes. In the bipolar configuration, the reference is specific to each measurement electrode (and is often another electrode located nearby). For examples, see here and here.  Questions:   For the unipolar configuration, why can't we just use Earth ground as our reference instead of having a reference electrode or performing an average of measurements on all the electrodes? For the bipolar configuration, if the electrodes are too close to each other, wouldn't we measure very low voltages since much of the signal appearing on one electrode would also be picked up by the other?  "
999,What happens in the brain that allows access to a previous unavailable memory?,"What happens in the brain that allows you access to a memory previous unavailable?  For example I forgot the name of someone I've known for years. Two weeks later, without notice, ""Diana"" popped up.   Why was it not accessible when I found I couldn't remember?  What was the chemistry that occurred that allowed it to happen later?  (Secondarily, is this the same breakdown in dementia and alzheimer's? That is, a breakdown of the 'search memory' mechanism? Or is that the memories themselves are 'losing coherence.')  "
1000,Is there an audio equivalent of eidetic memory?,"In this YouTube video by The Blaze it is claimed that Ted Cruz has ""audiographic"" memory. He does seem to have quite a good memory based on videos I've seen of him, but I'm not sure if Glenn Beck is exaggerating and I can't find the Wall Street Journal article he's referring to.  I know about eidetic memory (photographic memory):     ... is an ability to vividly recall images from memory after only a   few instances of exposure, with high precision for a brief time after   exposure, without using a mnemonic device.   Is there something similar for audio exposures and recall? Audiographic memory does not seem an academic term. Is this phenomenon discussed in academia? "
1001,Are men genetically programmed to seek multiple sexual partners more than women?,"[website]I saw this question on skeptic stackexchange.  Someone says obviously yes.  The reasoning is that men have cheap sperm and females have expensive eggs. Hence, most males, in most species, will have the male seeking multiple sexual partners than women.  Is this true?  If so, what would be good reliable sources?  Is this obvious?  I thought the idea that men seek quantity is like the central term of evolutionary psychology in sexual selection. "
1002,"In a class room setting, why do people look at you when you are asking a question?","Picture this scenario:   You are a student enrolled in a large class You arrived slightly late to the class, so you are sitting at the back of the class You raise your hands to ask the teacher a question.  As you speak, you observe that the entire class turn their body sideways to look at you, even the students who are sitting in the front row. You feel self-conscious    Three thoughts are now going through your mind:   What are ""ears"" for, again? It must be really uncomfortable and awkward to twist your body like that. What is the incurred ""loss"" if the other students did not look at you and simply listened?   Can some expert chime in the reasoning as to why students have to look at you when they are listening?  Could this be some sort of form of peer pressure?  Could the act of looking help to localize the sound (or synthesize the information) in some way?   Do we look so we can prejudge? For example, if we see that the asker/speaker is another professor, we pay more attention to the question as it might be more sophisticated than asked by a student. "
1003,situations might cause a PTSD,"I recently came to realize something which happened almost 10 years back, which I didn't realized then, but upon recollecting the past events I went in to PTSD. But the persons who where involved in that incident didn't consider it to be a big issue.   So my questions are, How long after the incident will PTSD happen?  And what incidents can be categorized as an traumatic incident ?   What situations might cause a PTSD for a person ?   "
1004,"How to help an adult that has grown up, but was unloved by their parents?","Is there anything that can be done to support a person that was raised without any love from their parents? Does it help to make them feel loved, or does rather that core hurt need to be tackled? In other words, can love from friends and relatives reduce the hurt, or does the issue need to be confronted directly? "
1005,Emotional energy exchange between bodies?,"I'm not sure on which platform to ask this question:  Is it possible to exchange emotional energy between two bodies via acts of goodwill? Two examples of acts of goodwill are: Help someone with their groceries, and buy someone a thoughtful gift. Is it possible that in these examples, both bodies gain emotional energy, which both bodies can store and then have the ability to dispatch subsequently to other bodies?  Science has proven that doing an act of goodwill for someone else benefits both parties.  So what if the human network stopped doing acts of goodwill? Would the network suffer in some way? For example, I do know that babies die if they are not held. What if all bodies in the network lost the ability to do acts of goodwill to another?   Would all the babies die?   If so, that would be very dangerous to society, because we would all go extinct. So shouldn't we be looking into this?     Thanks to the late great David Hawkins, MD, Ph.D., we have proof that emotions have measurable energy and can either foster or negate actual cell life. Dr. Hawkins’s groundbreaking work, as explained in his book Power vs. Force, shows how a person’s log level--the measurable energy level in their magnetic field--increases as that person experiences more positive emotions. Hawkins’s most interesting finding was that cells actually died when the log level was below 200, where the emotions of scorn, hate, anxiety, shame, regret, despair, blame, and humiliation reside. So it’s key to regulate and manage our emotional state, not just for our overall well-being (and that of those around us) but also for our physical health.   [website]"
1006,Why is the theory of mind named as such?,"   Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc.—to oneself, and to others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.   So am I correct in saying that for a dyadic relationship, there are 2 ""theories of mind"", and for a group of [tex] person, there would be [tex] ""theories of mind""? I understand a system of inferences is properly called as ""theory"", but when so many people has different theory it loses the universal connotation as commonly used in ""theory of planned behavior"" or ""theory of gravitation"". Should it better be named as ""theory-forming of other's minds""?  "
1007,Is theory of mind formation accelerated by bilingualism?,Kovács (2009) reported that bilingual children were better at solving a false belief task critical to the fully developed theory of mind (ToM).  Has this study been replicated or criticized by others? I.e. is it uncontroversial that bilingualism accelerates ToM development? 
1008,Does similar writing style tell us the writers are similar with respect to some measure/perspective?,"Does similar writing style in small texts such as on Twitter or long texts such as articles/novels tell us anything about similarity between    ""thinking process""  OR ""personality""   OR ""writing preferences"" etc.,    of the writers?    For some instances we can be sure about such correlation, for example persons who like to use abbreviation(short-form), e.g. nite(“night”) or abbreviation(acronym), e.g. lol (“laugh out loud”), or emoticons in short-texts like tweets, are hesitant to write long words(I couldn't find any research on this , but this is being said after a small survey by me and also this deduction seems trivial). Of course, there can be a number of reasons for some preferred writing style like role of culture.  Similarly can we say something about relation between the people who follow similar writing style? By similar writing style, I meant following kind of things,   short-text : use of emoticon vs writing emotion in plain text short-text : use of Non-dictionary slang, e.g. that was well mint vs “that was very good” long-text and short-text : preference to adjectives than combination of verb and adverb   Is there any resource throwing light in this direction in a scientific way? "
1009,How does the brain’s visual memory work?,"I have read a lot about people who are good memorizing images (visual type memory), music, words, numbers, etc. but I have never read a lot about how all these things are ""saved"" in our brain.  I am not trying to understand the biological part, that is far away from my competences, I am talking more about a more general layer, like what we actually memorize?  I will start from an example: what do we ""save"" when we remember an image?   Do we memorize all the ""pixels"" as a computer would?  "
1010,What determines whether sensitization or desensitization occurs?,"I am familiar with desensitization. For example, if you are afraid of driving, driving every day will eventually reduce your fear, desensitizing you.  But today I came across another concept, that of sensitization.  I looked up the wiki article on Sensitization, which says at the end,     Sensitization may also contribute to psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, panic anxiety and mood disorders.   So which is it then? What determines whether repeated exposure to something sensitizes someone or desensitizes them? With the example of PTSD, for instance, should not repeated exposure to war actually desensitize people?  I searched google scholar but could not find a paper that discusses both sensitization and desensitization.  Mostly discuss the latter, in terms of reducing fears.    Appreciate any references or books that might help me understand this.    Thanks you. "
1011,What are the effects of rejection from both parents on a child?,How would rejection from both parents affect a child?   How would they act? what would their personality be like? And the most important question of all: What would help them get rid of or at least lessen these effects?

If you could also explain the results to answer my question I would appreciate it? 
1013,What are the dangers of using mindfulness-based techniques for individuals suffering from Schizophrenia?,"I am unable to find much research on the application of mindfulnesss for those suffering from Schizophrenia. A recent study by Chien and Lee (2013) focuses on the application of a psychoeducation program for Chinese patients with Schizophrenia. However, I do not have the pleasure of reading this but findings indicate that it can improve psychosocial functioning ([website]Though the study show promising results for alleviating symptoms in Schizophrenic patients, I feel - prima facie - that there might be a risk in exacerbating symptoms by educating Schizophrenic patients to adopt a non-judgmental awareness towards positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusional thinking. I am a supporter of mindfulness-based interventions except I can't seem to find much literature on its limitations and risks for Schizophrenia.  As the neurological and biological evidence around Schizophrenia is far from conclusive, I am narrowing this down to only psychological and ethical risks/dangers that could potentially arise from mindfulness practice and Schizophrenic individuals. For clarity around the theory underpinning Schizophrenia, I would refer to the Theory of Mind as the overarching philosophical foundation for understanding Schizophrenia and interactions with mindfulness practice. A definition is given by Pedersen et al (2012):     ""Theory of mind (ToM), the ability to think about mental states such as   thoughts and beliefs in oneself and others, is a complex cognitive   function that requires the integration of information from multiple   sources. Substantial evidence has accumulated that patients with   schizophrenia have impaired ToM functions (Sprong et al., 2007; Bora   et al., 2009) that result in social-interactive deﬁcits.""   On a cognitive perspective, what dangers does mindfulness pose to a Schizophrenic individual's ability to discern their self-concept and their relations with the world?   Example  This is purely for illustrative purposes.  X suffers from Schizophrenia and visual hallucinations. X does engage in mindfulness practice regularly. His/her mindfulness practice involves paying non-judgmental attention in the present moment. Initially, X paid too much attention to the occasional visual hallucinations through his mindfulness exercises. This triggered a higher amount of distress and anxiety for X and caused him/her to believe in the 'reality' of the hallucination. It could be said that there may be a potential danger that existed in the initial stages of X's introduction to mindfulness practice.  Questions   What are the dangers of using mindfulness-based techniques for individuals suffering from Schizophrenia? What are the mechanisms that make mindfulness practice effective when an individual is experiencing a delusional episode?   EDIT:  I have provided some more information around the scope of the question primarily around what type of 'dangers' could result from the interaction between mindfulness practice and those suffering from Schizophrenia.

It's a widely accepted, and experienced, that being disturbed doesn't make it a good night sleep, but is it because of this 'not picking up where you stopped'?  Could you point me to some data about this? "
1018,Why do people walk in a circle when they are blindfolded and intend to walk in a straight line?,"Why does someone with eyes tied follow a circular path if left to walk in a huge yard(kilometers), that occurs even if he thinks that he is walking in a straight line?  In my opinion once you drawn a well enough curve your balance shift towards inner side of circle and you fullfill to spiralate inwards. But what shifts the balance inward? "
1019,Could the basis of love be the expectation of a future benefit?,"Say you meet an attractive person of the opposite gender (or of the same gender, as the case may be). You are attracted to this person because of one or more salient qualities, intelligence, personality, or good looks. You revel in this discovery and look forward to being able to enjoy this person's desirable qualities. More to the point, you expect that your appreciation of someone will help generate an appreciation of you by that person, with your other qualities doing the rest. Even if this person doesn't fully reciprocate, if s/he agrees to spend time with, and perhaps ""date"" you, this might be the beginning of love.  But suppose the object of your affection studiously ignores you, or worse, seems to date everyone except you, not noticing, or downplaying your attention and your good qualities. You no longer have any reasonable expectation of benefiting from whatever desirable qualities this person may have. Does your potential love now turn into hate, or at least jealousy?  Some people will poinr to the love of parents and children, and the fact that a parent may seem to blindly love a worthless child (or in a few cases, the opposite). But the fact is that the parent-child relationship is bound by real ties; each person possesses roughly half of the other's genes. That would probably create a strong expectation that whatever benefits the other person produces in life will accrue to you at some point.  Can love exist in a seeming vacuum, that is with the realization that the beloved does not have the power to benefit you in any way, or worse, has no intention of ever benefiting you in any way? "
1020,Why do humans enjoy works of fiction?,"Why humans (most of them, and certainly all those around me) enjoy fictional stories in one form or the other - novels, films, theater performances?

1022,How do family conflicts and childhood experiences influence passive-aggressive behaviours in the workplace?,"Possibly related but not a duplicate - ""How does the personality of a successful leader influence the development of his children?""  Workplace behaviours and personality traits, e.g. passive-aggressive behaviours, can be highly influenced by family conflicts and childhood experiences. Blanch and Aluja (2009) distinguish between work interfering with family (WIF) and family interfering with work (FIW):     Work–family conﬂict (WFC) has become an important dimension in the   study of individual differences at work. This concept has been deﬁned   as a form of inter-role conﬂict in which the role pressures from work   and family are mutually incompatible, identifying at least three types   of WFC: time, strain and behaviour based conﬂict (Greenhaus &amp; Beutell,   1985). Two main directions are generally considered in WFC research:   work interfering with family (WIF), and family interfering with work   (FIW) (Frone, Russell, &amp; Cooper, 1992).   Conflicts in the family environment may contribute to passive-aggressive behaviours in the workplace. Rejection at home can influence personality traits of the individual (Rohner, 1980):     The rejected child is especially likely to become hostile, aggressive,   or passive-aggressive if  rejection takes the form of parental   hostility.   Organisations cannot function optimally if its employees exhibit passive-aggressive behaviours that are a result of past or current family conflicts. These behaviours can have an impact on culture as well (Forbes, 2013). Passive-aggressive behaviours are becoming common in the workplace and I'm interested to know what are the antecedents of passive-aggressive behaviours in the workplace that arise from family conflicts and past childhood experiences.  Questions   What are the antecedents for passive-aggressive behaviours in the workplace that are influenced by past or current family conflicts and early childhood experiences? And are there any supporting studies describing this link?   References   Blanch, A. &amp; Aluja, A. (2009). Work, family and personality: A study of work–family conﬂict.

1024,Can short-term hunger influence anger?,"We know that hunger, whether short-lived or prolonged, causes physiological changes in our bodies. These may have psychological effects too as brain functions are slowed down and can have an impact on psychological processes. In fact, long-term memory formation can be enhanced by mild food-deprivation (Hirano et al, 2013). If hunger influences brain function, then it may have an effect on our emotional states.  Questions   Therefore, if one is hungry (mild food deprivation), is one more likely to exhibit anger generally more so than if one did not experience the hunger? Are there any studies demonstrating angry responses positive influenced by hunger in people compared to responses by people who were not hungry?

At first, information goes back and forth between various parts of the cortex and the hippocampus. That's how a long term memory is being formed. Once it is formed the hippocampus is not necessary to retrieve the memory. It can be bypassed.  The question is do we know how it is possible? How does the hippocampus (and maybe the Papez circuit) associate informations from various areas of the cortex to make one memory? Do we have a physical explanation that makes sense? "
1035,How are movements stored in the brain?,"The high level flow of information through the brain for the purpose of motor control is well established. It is also known the cerebellum stores many different movements, while also participating in the fine-tuning and coordination of movements. However, how are these movements stored? Are they stored on a per-limb basis, based on activity or by some other methodology entirely? "
1036,How do the motor system and Central Pattern Generators interact?,"Central Pattern Generators are populations of neurons found in the spinal chord that assist in the creation of rhythmic movements. See ""Human spinal locomotor control is based on flexibly organized burst generators"" by Danner et al, for a recent publication on the topic. How does the brain-based motor system interact with these pattern generators? Do they operate mostly independently or is there some feedback being communicated? If there is feedback, what type of information is it transmitting? "
1037,Is there any research showing we only like to see/read information on themes/topics/ideas we like?,"I have been thinking about how using social networks (like Facebook, Twitter and etc) have been changing the way we think. For example, Facebook feed is tailored on the basis of what we like. On Twitter, I usually follow people whose ideas I adhere to. So we are being introduced to information we like more and more thereby making us biased towards ideas that we like.  My question is: can you kindly point me to research studies that show we like to see/read information on themes/topics/ideas that we like?  Can you kindly give me some pointers on that? Thanks in advance. "
1038,How do I obtain recordings of the P300 wave of the event-related potential in the EEG?,"I am trying to understand how to analyze the ERP (Event-Related Potentials) from EEG recordings and in particular  the P300 wave.  I have come up with a few questions which I hope you might be able to help with:   I assume that the number of repetitions of the stimulus should give better results, but I am not sure why. On the one hand, it should help, because averaged results are usually better in electrophysiology. On the other hand, maybe there is some unwanted adaptation effect in the subject? So, are repetitions wanted in this kind of experiment? There are time points in which I didn't expect P300 but the brain activity was not 0. I understand that there is always a background activity in the brain, but maybe there is more to it? And if so, are there certain frequencies that are expected in the EEG? When I analyze the data using an average response, should I assume anything on the P300 response? What is the recommended sample Rate I should use? I guess there should be an advantage for high sample rates to increase resolution, but I am not sure about that. Am I right, or maybe a lower sample rate has advantages that I am not aware of?  "
1039,Can the desire to change a romantic partner ever be satisfied?,"Based on the typical relationship advise: ""Don't try to change your partner"" and such, I would say that many people want to see their romantic partners behaving just a little bit differently. It is a common thinking pattern.   For example, a person may be wanting for the strong and independent partner to be more caring and compassionate. Or wanting for a partner to spend more time listening, or being more punctual, etc.   These thoughts can be summarized as ""Our relationship would be perfect if only he/she did XYZ"". In other words, people expects to experience relationship bliss when their partner complies with their wishes.   It seems to me that the XYZ is always a moving target, and can never actually be fulfilled, a sort of mirage, just out of reach. This makes me think these thoughts could be caused by some neurochemical process.  Is expectation of relationship bliss, conditional on XYZ is just a side effect of some neurochemical process? Is it an expression of seeking novelty in a relationship (""same, but different"")?  Edit: To clarify what I mean by Neurochemical:  If a person ingests 8 shots of hard liquor, there's a new chemical -alcohol introduced into blood circulation. In a short time alcohol will affect cognition regardless of any protests from the person's higher order cognition. A person cannot will themselves to not feel the effects of the chemical and act normal.  The ingested chemical affects the brain (neurochemical?). Until the chemical is cleared from the circulation or neutralized, the person will continue experiencing cognitive effects of the chemical compound.   By neurochemical process I meant an indigenous process by which brain can release a brain affecting chemical/hormone that will act according to the model above. Adrenaline in fight/flight response is an example of such chemical. Maybe Oxytocin is another example. I know of words like psychoactive, psychedelic, neuromodulator and less scientific terms like ""mind altering"", but none of these seemed to fit.  "
1040,The line between fantasy and reality,"It is already well known that imagining certain things can have a physiological effect on us. For example, imagining an intense situation can cause the heart rate to go up, while imagining a quiet, safe place might have the opposite effect (or maybe that one is simply a result of distracting oneself from whatever may cause unrest).  Another example would be imagining yourself doing something you don't want to do. From what I understand, this reduces the stress of anticipating work.  I wonder, though, what exactly separates this from actually doing what you imagine? what are the differences in the physiological effects? How different is the activation of the brain? (aside from the obvious - for example, imagining something physical happening to you, such as being punched, won't actually cause any bruising) "
1041,"Problem with IQ tests in Murray's ""The Bell Curve""?",Murray's The Bell Curve came up in a discussion recently.  I have a very clear memory of reading a review of the book at the time it came out.  The reviewer claimed that one of the many problems with Murray's methodology was that he relied on IQ tests written in English but given to African students whose first language was French.  I cannot find a link to this anywhere. Anyone have any info on this?  Is the critique accurate?  Is it possible that I am remembering the review of some other work? 
1042,Can personality be measured without self-report or peer-report?,"There's lots of evidence on personality correlating to various behavior, like speed when talking, words used, walking pace, types of books owned, reactions to situations, colors on clothing, +++. Is there any research on the opposite, measuring personality based on behavior?  How reliable would it be to measure someones personality based on behavior?  "
1043,Why do people hide wealth?,I was reading about Panama leaks and I was wondering why do people keep their wealth secret? What's the psychology behind it?  
1044,How come that someone understands an utterance only after a few moments?,"I have seen and experienced the following phenomena. It often happen in a work environment but can happen anytime and anywhere:  1) Person A is doing something that requires full concentration (like reading or thinking deeply).  2) Person B suddenly ask/say something to Person A  3) Person A replied with ""What do you say?"" or ""Pardon please"" (or something similar, as if he/she doesn't hear what person B said) after some brief pause/delay.  4) Person B didn't answer back (optional)  5) Person A answers/responses (before Person B repeats what he/she said) to Person B (as if he/she heard it fully)  Is there a psychological term that describes/explain it? How it is happening? What is its effect with the brain of Person A if there is?  P.S. I don't know what is the right tag for it. "
1045,Is there any evidence for a bias towards perceiving darker surfaces as 'figure' rather than 'ground'?,"Given that surfaces which capture attention are more likely to be perceived as figures (or figures attract attention more than ground does?), is there a bias associated with the luminance of a surface? For example, we often see dark figures (e.g., text) on white paper.  Do you know of any literature to suggest a bias where darker surfaces are shown to attract attention more effectively than lighter surfaces (or vice versa)?  Or, alternatively, is there data available on a possible bias where figure-ground segmentation is more likely to occur for a dark figure on a white ground (or vice versa)? "
1046,Environmental cleanliness: what is cognitively fresh?,"The concept of freshness has developed over the last century to involve a range of sensations and responses to tastes, smells and feelings associated with foods, the environment and cleaning products. But what is it that contributes or tells us that something is fresh from a neurocognitive perspective? It seems unlikely that freshness be merely the absence of negative stimuli that promote a disgust response, as freshness is often associated as a positive response.   I know this is a wide ranging question, however there is surprisingly little research on a concept that advertisers use daily, to promote cleaning products. Its unusual that such a important perception and its associated behaviour has so little academic research. Funny how merely watching the adverts between TV shows can make you curious!  EDIT:  The exact questions are...   What are the cognitive factors that make humans or animals perceive something to be fresh/clean? What are the neurocognitve mechanisms underlying these processes?  "
1047,The meaning of a long gaze : supposed to indicate agreeableness in new-borns but suprise in infants,"Several studies on new-born and infant are based on the gaze, but depending on the age of the subject, the assumption is different. For new-born, a long gaze is supposed to mean that what they look at is agreeable. For infants, a long gaze is supposed to means that they are surprised.  On what are these two assumptions based? Can they be verified?  If yes, at what age does the meaning of a long gaze change? And why does it change?  "
1048,In what order do you preprocess EEG data?,"I am fairly new to EEG research and I am unsure what the best ordering is for preprocessing data. Do you correct for baseline and filter the data before you go on with artifact rejection/correction, or the other way around?   I can imagine the former to be correct, because baseline correction and filtering makes it easier to interpret the data visually, making it easier to identify artifacts. However, if you filter the data first, some artifacts may become less severe, making it difficult to have artifact rejection be done automatically.   What are your thoughts? "
1049,EEG Signal quality,"I'm a EEG hobbyist using Olimex EEG SMT, and I'm using 4 dry, active electrodes to record EEG signals (the Olimex uses bipolar montage, so I actually have 2 channels). However, I cannot measure any waves apart from eye movement and hand/leg movement. I'm thinking of spending more money to improve my EEG setup but I don't know exactly why I'm getting this poor quality recordings.  Why I am not getting better results? Do I need conductive paste or do I need more channels? Would conductive paste improve my results? How much? Would more channels improve the signal together with signal processing? "
1050,Does the human visual system implement (adaptive) histogram equalization?,"The human visual system is very good at 'cancelling out' shadows and other lightning effects, and focusing on the contrast in images. A famous example of this is Adelson's checker shadow illusion:    In the above image, cell A and B are the same exact colour, yet we see cell B as significantly lighter than cell B.  In this case, if I wanted to get a machine to make an observation similar to the human perception, I would use a technique like adaptive histogram equalization to enhance the contrasts and eliminate the shadows and lighting effects.  In computational terms, histogram equalization works by taking the cumulative distribution of the histogram of pixel intensities and stretching it to be a line. This transformation makes the histogram uniform, and thus maximizes the entropy and amount of information conveyed by each bit -- giving an information theoretic justification for why one would want detectors that use this sort of transform. Adaptive histogram equalization works the same way but instead of transforming the global histogram, first divides the image into a large number of tiles and then normalizes each tile. This tends to amplify the signal, while 'cancelling out' the local background due to effects like shadows or lighting gradients.  Laughlin (1981) showed that the large monopolar cells in the insect compound eye -- specifically in Calliphora stygia -- implement histogram equalization through their neural coding to cancel out the ambient contrast of typical natural scenes. Has something similar been shown in vertebrate visual systems? In particular, in the human -- or similar -- visual system?   Further, Laughlin (1981) could not look at adaptation of the eye to a specific scene, and was comparing to a static typical environment, has this research been extended to look at dynamic changes in the coding pattern in response to specific scenes?  References  Laughlin, S. (1981). A simple coding procedure enhances a neuron's information capacity. Zeitschrift für Naturforschung c, 36(9-10), 910-912. "
1051,Mapping Sustained Attention on the brain (EEG),"I am doing a study to the effects of sustained attention on Situation Awareness, i.e. how well one perceives and understands the relevant information in their direct environment (in both space and time) and the ability to make predictions about the near future. I want to use EEG to measure the participants sustained attention by calculating the mean power in the Alpha frequency band, over two second periods.  I am in doubt however, over which channels I should calculate this average. Perceptual related brain responses usually occur in the occipital lobe and other more posterior located regions, but where do I draw the line? Are there some references that may support such a decision?  "
1052,Why do hallucinations appear in depression?,"We all know the stories of people who saw a miracle in the deepist troubles like gangsters who turned to faith - or an older example could be the miracles in jail in the Bible (Acts: Peter and Paul).  How wide-spread is the phenomenon where people expierence hallucinations in a depressing situation? What is the neurological cause? And what hormones (neurotrasmitters) participate on this phenomenon?  Please concentrate on the neurological point of view, rather than on the psychological aspects.  Thank you. "
1053,Can subliminal affirmations really use the subconscious mind to naturally reshape your nose?,"My reflexive response to this is no, however, I have noticed two different phenomenon which begs to re-assess.  (Please see and read video description and some comments: [website]Firstly, in my work, I have met some adults with severe debilitating mental special needs. The ones that peaked my re-assessment on this subject, were ones who as young children, were only considered slightly ""slow"" but physically did not look different than their peers. Then around a certain age (one at 7 for example), went through a terrible reaction like massive seizures or food poisoning, making them loose all mental facilities, permanently. Now, at a much older age, their facial features are completely altered to what we associate some severely mentally debilitated people with. I prefer not to describe if possible, the point is the actual bone structure and other features seem to have shaped very differently now. However, they were not born that way and the only thing that changed was mind and brain function.  Secondly, there seems to be a staggering number of people online and especially on YouTube, bewildered and claiming that subliminal programing videos have allowed them to change their facial features. With this large sample population (even if half were fake), I think it merits some sort of assessment.  Can one use their subconscious in some fashion to change the shape of something on their body? "
1054,Is there a (evolutionary) purpose of self-pity?,"I stumbled across the quote from Charlie Munger;     Generally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought, self-pity gets pretty close to paranoia, and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse, you do not want to drift into self-pity.   And while there seems to be a basic agreement that emotions in general have an evolutionary advantage to ""anticipate and solve problems and avoid potential pitfalls"", I was wondering which positive effects the ""disastrous modes of thought"" might have.  The discussion on envy clearly shows that there is a envy-spectrum. And certain modes of envy do contain a positive effect.  And while revenge might not lead to peace and harmony I understand its connection from a the evolutionary point of view.  But what purpose does self-pity have? Why do we feel it? "
1055,What variables allow one to empirically and scientifically quantify trends for learning curves?,"Specifically, I am trying to quantify trends in learning for certain mediums of audio-visual communication, and what I've gathered so far suggests that there are 4 distinguishable types, being linear, logarithmic (or possibly asymptotic), exponential and ogive. How can I go from peoples qualitative observations to an actual mathematical function to show these patterns for a specific medium? Would one measure...success rate over time and that's it? Or what?

1056,What cognitive bias (loosely) makes us all the more susceptible to the golden age fallacy,Why do the good ol' days seem better than they actually are? Is this a result of an error in human thought or is it because things are actually worsening? 
1057,"What is the name of the ""Things are more visible once you learn about them"" phenomenon?","(Excuse the horrible title of this question. I just can't find the proper (?) words. Please edit as pleased.)  It happens many times to me that when I learn about something (e.g. a word, a concept, etc), I suddenly start to see it in many places. This is not due to a change in external circumstances but to ""the way you look at things"".  For example, I recently learned the word ""oftentimes"". I was not aware it existed before. And yet, I suddenly started to see it in many places, so that it caughts my attention. Naturally, people did not suddenly started to use this word, so this was clearly a change in my perception, due to ""conceptual learning"".  My question is, is there a word for this psychological phenomenon? I hardly find the proper words to search for this, so my efforts at the moment have been pointless. "
1058,Relative distance,"Humans have an intuition of when two objects or places are close or far away from each other which is seems to be relative rather than absolute. One might say that Germany is close to France, my house is close to the supermarket, etc., and then say that two plants in the backyard are far from each other.  Even when this is subjective, based on what do we classify two objects as being far, close, or somewhere in-between? Is it just the the size of the objects? what about objects of very different sizes like a house and a pen?   What about the distance from us to the objects? Would we consider two trees to be close when we are very far away, but then consider them far away when we are close to them?  What are the parameters that we base this decision on?  How would a computer classify two objects in such a way that it ""mimics"" the human decision.  "
1059,Which filter should be applied to the EEG signal for the stress stimulus?,"I am a student in electrical and electronics engineering. I just started working with EEG. I perform a stress test on subjects and record EEG activities with a 5-sensor headset. I use Matlab for analysis. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me the best method for data analysis. Do we expect the signal to be localized at a certain frequency range in the EEG data under stress stimulus? If so, what is the frequency range? Which filter should be applied to the EEG signal for the stress stimulus? "
1060,How to use a QUEST staircase in 2-AFC?,"Firstly, I need to declare that I am not psychologyst, however I am currently working on visual recognition research. To be precise, I working on face recognition deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder. I am in charge of doing an experiment but I feel I come to a dead end even though I didn't even start with it.  As I mentioned above, I investigate face recognition deficits in ASD. I will use faces and objects. For this task I will use 2-AFC match-to-sample task. I need to morph faces and objects and for this purpose I need to use a QUEST staircase for measure morph distance at which participants could discriminate between items with 75% accuracy.   Here is the problem: I don't know how to use a QUEST staircase. Or better say, I don't know how can I decide how many trials should I have, which morph distance should I use between items, how should I know which morph distracter should I use, should I use in the beginning easy test pairs and what exactly does it  means, is 85%-morph distracter is an easy pair, etc.? As you can see I don't know to do an experiment, it is almost completely new field for me.   I am trying to find my answers in: Psychophysics: A Practical Introduction by   Kingdom &amp; Prins; Experimental Design by Cunningham &amp; Wallraven; Visual Psychophysics by Lu &amp; Dosher just to mention a few. However, I wish to find some book or article where I can see an example step by step how to make a similar experiment, i.e. AFC. I know there is bunch of information but I am just overwhelmed and lost.  What literature/ web sites/ blogs etc. can you suggest to me? How/ where to start?  "
1061,Name or theory for a particular phenomenon pertaining to ideological possession,"Is there a name or a theory for when someone alters a truth to strengthen their point(delusion)?   For instance, remember when President Trump carried out his plan to deport ""illegal"" immigrants and the lefties painted a different picture by their ""Day without immigrant"" story to portray the administrators as cold mean bullies, as opposed to saying ""Day without ILLEGAL immigrants""?   It is a phenomenon where individuals will consciously alter something, not intentionally to lie malevolently, but strengthen their (obviously) weak point(something to do with ideological possession).  Is there an official name or theory for this, like, ""So-and-so's theory of  such and such"" or is there rather a study with conclusive data/research on the phenomenon? "
1062,Ambiguity in self-evaluating Likert-scale questions,"I am concerned that when Likert-scale type questions are used in self-evaluation questions, the results are ambiguous and would like to know if it's possible to address this ambiguity.  Interpersonal Reactivity Index  Although I have seen this in multiple questionnaires, in this question, I would like to focus on it's use in the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), which is used to measure empathy. The index is a set of questions that must be answered according to a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from ""Does Not Describe Me Well"" to ""Describes Very Well"".  Ambiguity Concerns  Consider this question from the IRI:        I daydream and fantasize, with some regularity, about things that might happen to me.      In this case, my concern is the temporal descriptor ""with some regularity"". How is someone filling this survey supposed to determine what the population mean of ""regular"" means? Is it once a week? Once a month?  I have similar concerns about the following question:        I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.       What is ""often""? What depth/duration do the ""tender, concerned feelings"" require to qualify for this question?  How to Address Ambiguity  How is this ambiguity of language, in regards to personal assessment, addressed in these types of surveys? It seems like a better designed survey would first try to establish the person's view of the general population in terms of range of feelings it's trying to describe, as well as the duration and frequency. Consequently, the person's assessment of the general population could be taken into account for their own personal assessment.  Have concerns similar to this been addressed before in other contexts? "
1063,How does alcohol increase firing rate in Golgi cells?,"I understood that ethanol increases Golgi cell firing by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase channels, which makes granule cells receive more GABAergic input from the GABA that Golgi cells relase. Some paragraph in this paper are not clear to me. It says that      ethanol increased spontaneous firing frequency and depolarized the membrane potential in the perforated-patch configuration, but also that ethanol does not significantly affect firing frequency or membrane potential response to current injection.   How does it work? "
1064,Is it possible to increase/train your intelligence?,"Is it possible to raise your IQ (best correlate for g I know of)? Does brain training help?   I have never taken a psychologist administered IQ test before, but I did take a reputable online IQ test and experienced a shift of 20+ IQ points over a two/three year period. I didn't do the tests incessantly, did it once, then revisited the test a few years later, and I was testing 20+ points higher than my previous score.  "
1065,"What is ""intelligence"" in ""artificial intelligence""?","As far as Artificial Intelligence is concerned, what is ""intelligence""? The definition I see on various sites like Wikipedia:            Intelligence has been defined in many different ways including as one's capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, planning, creativity, and problem solving             Merriam Webster:         The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations :  reason; also :  the skilled use of reason.        The ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (such as tests).      etc seem to be a bit broad and nebulous, and not necessarily what I would be thinking of if I wanted to build an AI, or evaluate the intelligence of non human life-forms.              The definition I currently go with is:              General problem solving ability.               However, I'm not sure if this is broad enough to encompass all we think of when we say ""intelligence"" in the context of AI, or what we would be looking for in ""intelligent"" life-forms. What's a useful definition of intelligence. Broad enough to encompass all the we consider when we think intelligence, yet narrow enough to exclude particular idiosyncrasies of specific intelligent agents? A universal definition of intelligence applicable to all intelligent agents.  "
1066,Is speech perceived as set of phonemes by human?,"I am currently trying to understand how speech is being perceived and understood. I am currently aware of the workings of inner ears and the basilar membrane and its frequency filtering, but going from an acoustic signal to something meaningful such as perceiving speech is still very unclear. I am working with implementing speech recognition software, and what we do is recognising basic speech units namely phonemes, but it this is how the auditory system perceives speech?.. is speech perceived as basic units, or just something man made? or is the perception of speech (very) different, and how different? "
1067,Is the order of stimulus pairings in second order conditioning relevant?,"In second order conditioning next to a CS1 + US also a CS2 + CS1 association is learned so that also CS2 will cause a CR. Is the order in which the stimuli associations are learned (CS1 + US and CS2 + CS1) relevant for the strength of the CS2 -> CR association?  To make an example: A student gets a bad grade in an exam (CS1) and due to a extremely negative response of his / her parents (screaming, punishment = US) the student develops a fear response to exams in general (single trial fear conditioning; the response ""exam -> fear"" was learned). Does the student already responds with fear to any stimuli (CS2) which signals a upcoming exam although this association was learned earlier before the fear conditioning? Is it necessary that the association CS2 + CS1 is learned after the CS1 + US association or doesn't it matter?  Explanation of the abbrevations: In classical conditioning a association between an unconditioned stimuli (US) and a conditioned stimuli (CS) is learned so that the person also responds with the response to the conditioned stimuli which he / she has previously shown to the unconditioned stimulus. The classical example is Pavlov's experiment with a dog. A bell was ringing (CS) whenever food was presented to the dog (US). After a while the dog salivates (CR) whenever the bell rings (without presenting the food). Thus the response ""bell -> salivation"" was learned.  In second order conditioning next to an association of an unconditioned stimulus (US) and a first conditioned stimulus (CS1) also an association of a second conditioned stimulus (CS2) with the first conditioned stimulus (CS1) is learned. Thus the person / the animal also responses with a conditioned response (CR) similar or equal to the unconditioned response (UR) to the second stimulus even though that the association CS2+US was directly presented before. "
1068,Understanding fear as a response in classical conditioning,"I have difficulties to understand fear as a response to a stimuli. In my view fear occurs as a anticipation of a possible threat in the (nearby) future. Fear prepares the organism so that it can react faster to the threat (eg. fight or flight response). Thus, the order of the stimulus (threat) and the response (fear) is changed (""fear -> threat"" instead of ""threat -> fear""). So I would describe this connection as ""preparation -> stimulus"" instead of ""stimulus -> response"".  I would argue that stimuli which cause fear (eg. loud noise) are predictors of a threat. Thus for the reaction ""loud noise -> fear"" we have a second order conditioning since the association ""loud noise -> threat"" was created before.  In a similar way I would describe other fear conditioning processes. When for example a student develops a test anxiety, after multiple exams a student often experience (extremely) negative responds which he / she experience as a threat. Thus he / she learns the connection ""exam -> threat"" and responds with fear at upcoming exams in order to prepare herself / himself for the anticipated threat.  My Questions:   Is this a valid description of fear conditioning? Is it in general possible that in classical conditioning the order ""stimulus -> response"" is changed to ""preparation behavior -> stimulus""?  "
1069,"How is compassion ""derailed"" into self-pity","Following up on my previous question on the possible benefit of self-pity, I would like to understand the process which is responsible to create self-pity.  As @AliceD pointed out self-pity could very well be the collateral result of empathy. However, it seems to me there are a lot more people feeling empathy than people experiencing self-pity.  There is famous quote attributed Viktor E. Frankl:     Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.   Can the idea behind this quote be used to answer my question? In other words self-pity originates in the capability of empathy and the inability to choose the response?  "
1070,What is the relationship between language and the level of comprehension of consciousness?,"I asked a similar/related question a couple days ago about how language and/or culture affect an individual's cognitive capacity.  I'm looking for materials, if any, on the subject of a language's relationship with the level of comprehension of consciousness.  For example, if a specific language doesn't have the right words to describe the biological aspects of visual perception, will the individual using that language be able to comprehend all aspects of consciousness as well as an individual using a language which has the words to describe the event?  I've read The Rediscovery of the Mind by John Searle and it discusses some issues of how our current state of understanding consciousness is a function of the scientific progressions of society.  He talks about how we could be misunderstanding/misinterpreting the fundamentals of consciousness when we use out-dated and/or inaccurate definitions &amp; concepts as a scaffold for defining current theories of consciousness.    Are there any books, studies, theories, or relevant materials on this topic? "
1071,"Modern replacement for Panksepp's ""Affective Neuroscience"" book?","Jaak Panksepp's book (Amazon link here) is a phenomenal and highly readable systems-based introduction to not only affective neuroscience, but the neuroscience of motivation in general.  The problem is that the book is fourteen years old (don't be fooled by the copyright from the Amazon link, which is for the softcover edition) which makes it from the ice age in neuroscience terms.  Is there a comparable but more modern reference?  I am not a neuroscientist; even if I were, trying to assemble a corpus of journal papers would be a lengthy and redundant process; and even if I accomplished it, my hodgepodge primer would lack the larger synthesis that makes Panksepp's book so good.  Is there anything good that covers similar ground written in the last five years?  EDIT: It suddenly occurred to me that, thanks to the wonders of the internet, I could ask Jaak Panksepp directly.  It turns out that his followup book, ""Archeology of Mind"", is indeed intended to be a kind of update and spiritual successor to ""Affective Neuroscience.""  So the best followup to Panksepp will be the next book by Panksepp.  Now if it would hurry up and get released... "
1072,What are good examples of applying dynamical systems in cognitive science?,"I'm a mathematics and physics student very much interested in cognitive science.

What papers would you recommend?  "
1073,What skills are required to build simulations of the human brain?,"I want to build a system that has the ability to gather data from the internet in order to build a cognitive model of the human brain. The model should be able to answer the questions required by a robot. Also, I would like to apply an AI inference engine to get more important information to the robot.  If I want to do build such a model, what ""skill list"" do I need? What skills would be most important? What ""opensource project"" might be helpful?    added:  Thank everyone who encourage me. You let me have more brave to build a human brain mind model(not brain structure).   Let me introduce myself. I have some CS and EE background and now research on robotics area. I love cognitive science so much so I want to figure out how to let robot really have the mind like human to achieve goal more clever. Thank the hint of @Jeromy Anglim, I give a video youtube example:James and Rosie Preparing Popcorn and Sandwiches  That video shows two robot cooperate together to make a sandwich with cognitive architecture(CRAM or Cogito) based on ROS(Robot OS,ROS map,ROS Navigation Video) system. After reading their papers I found that they just using database or downloading web page instructions or using very well structured pages which are for human (ex.CYC,OpenMind Indoor Common Sense database,Semantic web,ORO,SUMO,Wikipedia,google images,germandeli).  Also I found that many free resources,any article on WWW should be most important database. The most important thing is how to build a system that can read natural language and have a model (maybe based on CRAM cognitive architecture) to understand it,because CRAM has a very good knowledge processor(KNOWROB,M. Tenorth and M. Beetz, “KnowRob — Knowledge Processing for Autonomous Personal Robots,” in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent RObots and Systems., 2009.). If perhaps, I want to collect all linux opencourse libraries to make it more fast and robust. I also begin to take online machine learning course on stanford.   My goal is to build a human mind model can learn,have some innovation,and find intelligent solutions to dedicate itself to human society.But my first step is to find a way that robot can try to understand all kinds of data on the WWW (any data that it can't understand just warn the first 10,and ignore others), and structure them as an intelligent interaction system which can answer knowledge or skill questions which can be search on google. The most important of that system is try to use all information on the web clever with robust libraries( I don't want to reinvent wheels).  I know it is a long term project, but I loving and willing to achieve in my whole life.  Because this is an integration project and any success in that will make a big change in the world just as ROS in robotics also an integration project and very active on most top robotics research centers and in the beginning on industry now. I know My own energy is not enough for this purpose, but I can gather all the power of opensource and volunteers in the world to do it together~^^ (Now is the day which techs are really enough for this project like computer speed,WWW,advanced research papers,opensourse libraries,free opencourseware lessons,..., what a lack is a group of excellent people volunteer to make it become true to help anyone who use this project.)

1074,Why are mind maps recommended for study and recap?,"In both my last year of high school and my freshmen year at the university, I got strong recommendations to study using mind maps - especially because this is apparently better to cope with large amounts of new information.   Is mind mapping effective in learning and reflecting on information? If so, how does mind mapping help in learning and reflecting on information?  "
1075,How are newly created neurons recruited into existing networks?,"As far as I understand, the basics of neurogenesis (abstracted down to the level that makes sense to a computer scientist) is as follows:   Neural progenitor cells differentiate into new neurons that have zero (or very few) synaptic connections, but are sensitive to the local chemistry. (Optional) Sometimes (such as in adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb) these immature neurons-to-be are produced far away from where they are needed and follow standard pathways to migrate to the correct brain region The immature neuron extends dendrites towards upstream neurons and starts to develop an axon The immature neuron extends axon towards downstream neurons, and The neuron matures and becomes indistinguishable from the network it joined.   I've eliminated many of the biological details, since I want to just capture the details (more info). The part that seems to be not well described, and my question, is:   How do neurons select where to make their initial dendrite and axon connections? How/when does a given network notify the progenitor cells that they should differentiate?     Partial results  Cecchi et al. (2001) proposed a model where the new neurons produce initial connections randomly, and then the only the ones that contribute to the function of the network end up firing frequently and surviving, and the rest die. This inspired by the observation of high death rate among immature neurons. However, there is not biological evidence to support that the initial connections are in fact random, and I hope that there has been more evidence gathered since the early work in 2001.  Notes   This question is motivated by the search for computational models with a biologically reasonable account of neurogenesis. I am looking for some sort of abstract local explanation to my questions at-least at the rule-of-thumb level. For examples, if I was asking about plasticity of established connections (and not neurogenesis in particular), then Hebb's ""neurons that fire together wire together"" would be a sufficient answer, although STDP would be a better one. However, I do not need all the biological details, just the high level rule if one is known.

1076,What are the major changes in the APA Publication Manual from 5th to 6th editions?,"A lot of journals use APA style for journal article submissions. In 2009 APA released the 6th edition with several changes to the 5th edition.    What's a good summary of the important changes in the 6th edition? Or, alternatively, what is a good online resource listing these changes?  "
1077,Defining shyness towards strangers in confrontational situations,"First of all, I would like to stress that I am not a cogsci person and I have almost no background in those areas of science.  The question is whether there exists a definition of a phenomenon I recently encoutered: A person is shy, but only in confrontational situations - has no social phobia regarding making friends and so on. Furthermore, this ""shyness"" is only demonstrated towards strangers, i.e. the person in question has no problem confronting somebody they know. Lastly, the problem occurs only in person, not over the Internet or telephone.   All in all, the question is - is this phenomenon described somewhere? And most importantly - does it have a name? Maybe it has already been defined and studied by someone.    Meaning of confrontational  By 'confrontational' I mean 'having different opinions' or 'having to sort out a disagreement'. To provide an example illustrating the problem:   After being ripped off at a restaurant (food bad, late, cold, etc), the person prefers to let the whole thing go and pay rather than argue with the waiter (thus avoiding an in-person confrontation). But, If the person were ordering a pizza over a phone and it did not arrive for an hour, they would have no problem calling the restaurant and discussing the problem.   I'm not a native speaker :) Hope the above description clarifies the problem a little bit.  "
1078,Do characters in a dream have their own separate thoughts or identity?,"I am very curious as to if any research has been done in this area, or if such a question even can be researched given the current tools and methods available to cognitive scientists. When one dreams, one may experience interactions with other characters, be those characters based on people one knows in their waking life or characters new to the dreamer. I'm interested to understand more about how the interactions between the dreamer within the dream state and these characters inside the dream work.  Do the characters in one's dream actually have their own thoughts? That is, does the mind ""sandbox"" each character, keeping track of what each dream character is thinking? When characters in a dream speak or act, what determines what actions they will take? Are their words and actions simply based upon a sense of empathy, or does the mind somehow maintain separate ""conscious states"" for each dream character? (A better word for that is appreciated, if there is one)  Or, as I suspect, is this concept simply too abstract for us to research given our current level of technology and understanding about how dreams work at a fundamental level?  Edit: As an alternative way of asking this question, has any research been done looking for possible relationships between characters within a dream and other better-understood areas of personality, for example multiple personality disorder? "
1079,How can consumers  obtain an image and analysis of their own brain?,"What resources are there for consumers who wish to get a detailed analysis of their personal brain function?  (besides consumer EEG machines...)  That is, how do I get access to an fMRI scan?  What's the current price range for such a thing?  Do I have to be a grad student/researcher?   Furthermore, how do I get a detailed analysis of anything that could be interesting/out of the ordinary? "
1080,Why do some people seem to disregard the choice of doing nothing (The Zero Choice)?,"In many areas of life we have a choice between multiple options: if we are hungry and we want to go out to eat, we have a number of places to choose from (McDonalds, etc).  However, we also still have the 'Zero Choice' (my terminology) of not eating out at all and getting food some other way.  In my personal life, I've noticed (perhaps falsly) that a fair number of people, once they've made a general choice (in the example: eating out), they disregard the 'Zero Choice' (not eating out) and become fixated on the sub-choices (where to eat out).  Is there a noticable difference in mental activity between people who don't consider the 'Zero Choice' and people who do?    Original Question:      In my life I've noticed that people rarely see the 'nothing' choice.    Rather than choosing this or that, there is also the choice of   neither and both.  People I've interacted with often weigh their   both, this, and that options fairly well, but many completely   miss the neither/nothing option.      More specifically, I've seen this in a couple girlfriends I've had and   a couple guy friends also.  When trying to decide what to do, they'll   settle on a type of activity (active/passive -> general category ->   couple options) and then choose between a couple options.  However,   rarely in these options do they include the idea of something   completely different.  Meanwhile, this is something I do without   thinking; other options are always present to me, and I have no   difficulty in seeing, weighing, or choosing the neither option.      These are poor examples and for that I apologize; but is this a   recognized phenomenon? What neural differences are there between   people who process the nothing option and people who don't?      Has this even been researched at all?  Cursory Googling (the most   available to me right now) has revealed nothing; I could be searching   for the wrong thing though...  "
1081,Why would the brain flip the images perceived by your eyes?,"The following is a common scientific statement, which you don't have to google long for to find:     The eye views images upside-down in the manner of a camera lens, but   our brains reinterpret this input to allow us to see things the   correct way up.     My first question is quite straightforward: Is this statement valid?  I don't understand why you should come to the conclusion that your brain should 'flip' the image. Wouldn't your brain be able to cope just fine without flipping it? If anything I would suspect the brain to not flip the image, if there is no reason to do so.  In order for this statement to be valid, I would expect a scientific theory/experiment from which can be concluded that the brain does process the vision in such a way that, after it being processed all subsequent processing occurs on the 'inverted' image. That seems to me to be the most logical interpretation of 'to flip'. "
1082,Accuracy of social judgements of observers watching business meetings,"I'm very interested in how people size one another up in social situations and in particular what we key in on when we are making these judgements.    Let's make an imaginary experiment.   I make several video tapes of actual business meetings just prior to when they begin. I edit the videos so that all explicit characterizations of the people are cut out (e.g. you wouldn't here one person address another person as ""sir"" or ""ma'am""). I also get several simultaneous camera angles on each meeting. So basically you're seeing the people freely interact.  Now, I want you as the subject to watch the videos and tell me what you think the people are like. Who's the leader? Who is smart? Who is ineffective? Who is conniving? Etc.  Next, I ask you why you made each of these judgements, and I attempt to elicit very explicit rationale - such as ""people who slump in their seats seem ineffective to me"" or ""people who hold their chins higher seem like leaders to me"".    Can anyone point me to discussions of real experiments similar to this?  In particular I'm interested in   How accurate humans tend to be in quickly ""sizing up"" people. How aware people are of why they are making these judgements and aware of what they are cueing in on. What is it that they are actually cueing  in on?    I'm more interested in all types of social appraisals, (intelligence, wealth, honesty, etc.), but I'm most interested in appraisals of leadership qualities. "
1083,Difference in frequencies of mistakes between use of left-right vs. up-down,"I have no hard data, but from my personal experience in people specifying right or left directions (similarly east or west) and up or down (north or south, top or bottom), people frequently make mistakes with specifying left or right much more often.  1) Is there some hard data on such a difference in frequencies?  2) If so, does cognitive-neuroscience address this difference?  (Certainly, there are physical properties of our world that enforce the distinction between up and down (gravity) but not between left and right although people do generally have a right-hand motor bias.) "
1084,How does de-myelination occur in multiple sclerosis?,"From what I understand, only the oligodendrocytes are affected in multiple sclerosis, and they are attacked by T cells which cross the blood-brain barrier. This leads me to two questions:   How is the blood-brain barrier affected in MS that allows T lymphocytes to cross the barrier? Why do the T lymphocytes attack the oligodendrocytes? And when they do, what is the mechanism for de-myelination?   Thank you in advance! "
1085,How does Parkinson's disease result in tremors?,"From what I understand, Parkinson's disease is caused by the death of dopamine producing cells in the substantia nigra, however I don't understand how that causses the symptoms of Parkinson's. I am particularly interested in the tremor aspect of the disease, although it would be great if someone could also explain how the other psychiatric problems arise (dementia, emotional problems and sleep issues).  The reason for this question is that I am trying to understand how deep brain stimulation (DBS) is able to stop the tremours in Parkinson's, or at least reduce their severity, and whether DBS could also help in the other symptoms of Parkinson's.  What causes the tremors in Parkinson's disease? Why do Parkinson's patients develop dementia, emotional problems and sleep issues?  Why does Deep Brain Stimulation alleviate tremors in Parkinson's disease? Can DBS help other Parkinson's symptoms? "
1086,Study showing how different ages of children learn about balancing objects,"I'm trying to track down a source for an idea I saw in a documentary a while ago (sorry, no idea where!) It demonstrated how children learn differently at different ages, through showing them balancing an unevenly weighted bar (in other words, a bar that looks the same along its length, but is in fact heavier at one end).  Loosely, the programme suggested that: young children (toddlers?) can get such a bar to balance intuitively, through ""trial-and-error""; slightly older children (5?) try to balance the bar half way, and so say ""it won't balance""; older children again, understand that the bar is not evenly weighted and so once again realise that experimentation is needed to find the balancing point.  Am I completely imagining that I saw some research of this kind? Or does anybody know where I can find a link to such a piece of research? "
1087,Is there another word for 'affective control'?,"In this paper, the authors use the term 'affective control' or the slightly longer form 'affective cognitive control capacity' to mean 'the ability to regulate emotions or manipulate emotional material in the service of task goals'. However wherever I Google 'affective control' I get results that seem to pertain to either Affective Control Theory (which is a much broader theory and seems to be unrelated) or the study in question.   Is there another expression for the ability to manipulate or regulate emotions and emotional material? Are there any domains I can research to learn more? I've heard Emotional Intelligence before (full disclosure though, I haven't read the Daniel Goleman book), but that seems to relate more to learned knowledge - whereas it seems affective control is more related to working memory and capacity to process and manipulate material. "
1088,What makes disengaged participants tired / exhausted after corporate meetings?,"Why do disengaged people feel tired, fatigued or unfocused after long, ""boring"" corporate style meetings? (there is an agenda, but not everyone participates?) Over the years I've observed dozens of meetings where a 6-8 of ""optional"" people get invited, but only 1-2 people really talk, while the rest are disengaged and are checking email, etc.  Is it related to long period of inactivity, lack of engagement or mirror neurons reading each other's emotions?  Another way to put it : Why do periods of cognitive inactivity or lack of engagement result in people feeling tired? "
1089,Obsessions: Synopsis and Effects,"I've been thinking about this topic quite a lot recently. What exactly is obsession ? Is it a good trait indicating perseverance for a goal ? Or is it a sign of a psychological disorder ? Is it a sort of fixation ? Is isolation its main cause ? Also, is there a reason why geniuses are often obsessed with their fields and thus, driven to insanity ?  I think the most famous kinds of obsessions are obsessions with computers, chess, books and maths. However, is there a general theory to define obsession ? Giving examples of obsessions with different fields would clear doubts. "
1090,"What are the effects of the ""blue eyes/brown eyes"" racism exercise?","In the ""blue eyes/brown eyes"" exercise created by Jane Elliott in the 1960s, she divided a group of schoolchildren by eye color and characterized one of them (e.g., the blue eyed group) as an inferior group. The aim of the exercise is to show how racism works and how it feels to be discriminated against.  Is the exercise effective? What are the psychological consequences of it? Does the exercise still ""work"" today? What are the ethics when this exercise is done with adults or children? "
1091,What is the evidence to suggest that the introvert/extrovert distinction is a shallow distinction?,"The author here claims:     A great leader knows that making room for both extroverts and introverts to share their thoughts could be the key to whether or not their next project succeeds or fails.    This document purports:     Carl Jung and the authors of the Myers–Briggs provide a different perspective and suggest that everyone has both an extraverted side and an introverted side, with one being more dominant than the other. Rather than focusing on interpersonal behavior, however, Jung defined introversion as an ""attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents"" (focus on one's inner psychic activity); and extraversion as ""an attitude type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object"" (the outside world)   The commentator writes:     The distinction between introvert and extrovert is shallow psychology. They are sometimes used condescendingly by angsty individuals at either side of the imaginary spectrum. The truth isn't even that most people fall somewhere in between. There is no gray area, because these matters are not black and white. Their use leads to generalization and over-simplification of delicate subject matter. Introvert vs. extrovert is always a sledgehammer where a scalpel is required.   My question is: What is the evidence to suggest that the introvert/extrovert distinction is a shallow distinction? "
1092,Why do those with viral infections feel better after wrongly taking antibiotics?,"Though I'm unversed in science, I accept and understand that bacteria differ from viruses; so antibiotics don't help in viral infections. Regardless, because older family members still allege that antibiotics have mitigated their colds, can psychology explain their misbelief?   They claim that within a day of taking antibiotics, their ability to speak returns and  their sore throats are soothed. I can attest to this improvement; they do feel better. I'm also unversed in psychology, but can some placebo effect (again, NOT the antibiotics themselves) truly contrive such genuine relief? "
1093,Is there a hierarchy of gestalt visual stimuli processing?,"Let's say that we have a set of shapes. They can be grouped according to the different Gestalt laws of grouping. However, different Gestalt principles will divide the set into different groups, e.g. grouping by proximity will give us A,B,C | D,E,F, and grouping by similarity will give us A,B,D,F | C, E.  Is it possible to predict which laws would gain precedence over the others? What's the ""order of processing"" of the different visual properties? "
1094,Correlation between selfie and Narcissism,Are there scientific evidence to correlate selfie pictures and Narcissism? I am curious when and after what threshold does self love move into the Narcissistic phase?  
1095,Do alpha waves vanish when I open my eyes in a dark room?,Alpha brain waves show up in your EEG when you close your eyes.   Do they vanish when I open my eyes in a dark room? To put it in a different way: Is it necessary to have your eyes shut or that you don't see anthing? 
1096,Tell-tale signs of ability to present information in clear and elegant visual form,"How does one's ability to present (systemize) information into a clear and understandable format (e.g. through tables/ diagrams/ interactive interfaces/ multimedia/ etc) usually show?   (In other words, how can you spot ""a born information architect""?)  I guess some psychometric tests measure that, but is there anything more immediate? E.g. my own suspicion is that a trait of such gift would have something to do with pursuit of efficiency in life and aversion to unnecessary complication in all its forms - visual ones, as well as social ones (e.g. bureaucracy, wordiness, hypocrisy, etc). "
1097,Curved/angled geometrical forms and association with femininity/ masculinity,Is there any research or theoretical reasoning on a strong inclination of human mind to associate curved forms with femininity and angled ones with masculinity?  A similar concept of association is the Maluma/ takete or Bouba/kiki effect.   Another example is font perception. Articles: - [website]- [website]- [website]- [website]
1098,Does the type of informational representation of a question in a research survey affect answers?,"Does the type of data format used to represent questions in empirical research affect the depth and quality of that research? For example, most questionnaires use written text as a data format. Would results differ if the same questions, under the same rules, were asked in person for example? I have memories of some platform presenting survey questions in a game-like interface, e.g. instead of asking you in text if you would rather purchase a cup of coffee over a cup of tea with five dollars, it displayed dollar banknotes as images and you had to move them with the mouse cursor towards either the image of a cup of tea or the image of a cup of coffee.  (My own speculation is that questions should be in a data format as close as possible to the data format used in the actual event we are researching about, but yet I am not certain that this would necessarily bring the highest possible fidelity to what's in the mind of the respondent.) "
1099,Efficient learning strategies?,"When learning a new subject or a skill, is it more effective to break practice into small sub-skills and focus on them for months until they have been fully mastered, or to practice each small sub-skill together?   For example, if someone wants to learn a new programming language, should they take one basic topic and practice it over and over before diving into other topic? How did leading experts acquire their expertise?  Are there effective general strategies for learning and acquiring expertise? "
1100,Is there a region of the brain that mediates pain in a manner reminiscent of the mesolimbic pathway?,"The mesolimbic dopamine pathway is a common neural pathway upon which rewards converge AKA the pleasure pathway.  So I am trying to find a comparable pathway in the brain for pain -- is there such a thing? Ideally, one where a probe could be inserted and stimulated to induce intractable pain in the victim. Is there anything reminiscent of the mesolimbic pathway but for pain, perhaps with some sort of somatosensory mapping?   What you never thought about using Deep Brain Stimulation to torture someone before?  "
1101,"Is ""havening"" pseudo-scientific or effective?",A fairly recent answer here offering havening as a therapy has only upvotes. But a quick internet search found a rather brief and contested Wikipedia page alleging havening is pseudo-scientific.  So what's the status of this technique/therapy in psychology? E.g are there meta-analyses showing that it's effective? And how is the quality of primary research assessed in this area? E.g. is the sub-field reasonably free of publication bias (which nowadays is also assessed in the better-off meta-analyses)? 
1102,Can addiction develop to the absence of a normally present negative stimulus?,"I am wondering, can someone become addicted to the absence or the removal of a negative stimulus? Normally, addiction is associated with pleasure-inducing drugs, like opiates and amphetamines as notorious examples. These compounds induce massive release of dopamine in the limbic system, ultimately leading to addiction. Addiction is a collection of behaviors:      Addiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain,   impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of   significant problems with one’s behaviors and interpersonal   relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other   chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and   remission.   It is known that training can be assisted by positive reinforcement (well done! here's a candy), or by negative reinforcement (wrong! here's an electroshock). Can addiction be caused by either? In other words, suppose someone is constantly aware of something unpleasant (pain, itching, unwanted perceptions such as tinnitus (ringing in the ears), negative emotions or thoughts) can the removal/lessening of such a stimulus lead to an addiction of the means to remove it?   For the sake of the question I think it is sufficient to focus the question on one (e.g., craving), or several of the symptoms, as existing studies, if any, may have focused on only one or few of the symptoms of addiction.  In short: are there studies on the addiction to the absence / removal of a negative stimulus?      This question was fueled by the comments to an earlier question  "
1103,What's the psychological reason for the fascination with gossiping or scandalous life?,"Why do people find fascination in a tabloid magazine, paparazzi magazine, gossiping or whether prince and kings are dating or not or if actors, actresses, singers having any scandalous affairs or not?  I find gossiping similar to character assassination.  I have no business in their lives.  So what's the psychological reason for the fascination with gossiping or scandalous life? "
1104,Why does emotional pain sometimes feels like physical pain?,"So here's a question from a newbie. I read somewhere that emotional pain can last as long as 20 minutes. Anything painful you feel beyond that is just a result of overthinking.   Well whatever it is, why does it effect our overall being so much? We feel that actual clenching pain in our heart like it will stop beating any minute. The pain is that strong. Our sleep and eating patterns get disturbed.   Why? It's just an emotion. Why can't our bodies seem to differentiate between emotional pain and physical hurt?  "
1105,What is an empirical proof that two concepts are not independent/orthogonal?,"Given there are two psychological concepts A and B that are considered to be independent/orthogonal.  Would the following empirical results proof the opposite? If not why?  In the first experiment A is the independent variable with two conditions: high and low A. B is identically induced in both conditions and measured as the dependent variable. In the high A condition high B is measured. In the low A condition low B is measured. The second experiment is analog to the first one, except with A and B reversed: in the high B condition high A is measured, and in the low B condition low A is measured.  References to papers that use similiar arguments would be very helpful. "
1106,How do we imagine? How do images have qualia?,"After reading a bit about qualia and hard problem of consiousness, I came up to theoretical solution. The reason why we have this problem is because we can imagine. We can imagine an object visible to us as red being green, for example. Green fire. Even if we never saw it in the reality.  But how do we imagine? How do those images have properties named by people as qualia? I can imagine a blue cube or a red cube, or a red sphere, and visual periphery is not involved here, I can do it with closed eyes.  What parts of our brain are responsible for imagination? How does the brain ""give"" qualia (form, color, smell, etc.) to images? What differs in my brain when I imagine a red cube from when I imagine a blue cube? And are qualia stored in our memory? "
1107,Body temperature increasing when trying to solve difficult problems,"[ I am unsure if this is the correct site to ask this question ]  I am a HS student, currently studying IT and personally I focus on the field of software (programming) and of course where there is programming there are problems which require you to have the skills to solve problems that occur. So I wanted to improve my skills by trying to solve problems and I've been doing some on hackerrank.   However, whenever i try to solve a problem which is difficult to me and that I'm not capable of understanding it, I begin ""overheating"", literally. This keeps me from taking further steps to learn about the problems and different ways to approach to the solution. Basically, I feel  like a moron and stop working on the problem.   my question to you is, why do I ""overheat"" (body temp. increases) when i try to solve problems that are difficult to me?  is it because I don't have a goal which motivates me hard enough or am I just... a moron ? Is there are way to ""turn off"" this overwhelming feeling?  EDIT :  After some more research i've come across this article which I believe could be the answer to my question (not sure). "

And I get the following error:  File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/cfv_egi.py"", line 281, in ns.BeginSession()   File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/egi/simple.py"", line 799, in       BeginSession self._socket.write( message )   File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/egi/socket_wrapper.py"", line 58, in write self._connection.write( data ) AttributeError: Socket instance has no attribute '_connection' 6.9777 WARNING  When I change the port to another one with a server, it gives me the below:  Traceback (most recent call last): File     ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/cfv_egi.py"", line 281, in ns.BeginSession()   File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/egi/simple.py"", line 804, in BeginSession return self.GetServerResponse()   File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/egi/simple.py"", line 783, in GetServerResponse  raise Eggog( ""unexpected character code returned from server: '%s'"" % (code, ) )  egi.simple.Eggog: unexpected character code returned from server: 'R'   So summarizing my question,   Is it correct that I am supposed to input the IPv4 address of the NetStation machine? How do I figure out what port number I need to input? Do I use the port numbers listed from using “Network Utility” app in the mac? When running the psychopy code that makes me connect to the machine, what needs to be setup in the Netstation computer? ie. do I need to have netstation software running?   Thank you. Any help or pointers would be appreciated! "
1109,Nature vs. nurture in irritability?,"For example, personally I'm quite irritable. It's not hard to irritate me and I swear either through an inner voice or whisper very often, but not out-loud. That does not happen very often. This is hardly likely due to some temporal cause.  But at the same time it seems there are people who are less irritable. How much of this is due to nature and how much is due to nurture? Are there any studies? "
1110,"What does ""they tend within and between classes"" mean in 'The Irreducible Mind'?","I am a philosophy student but I'm also interested in philosophy of mind, a field that overlaps issues in psychology and neuroscience these days. This passage is taken from a similar multidisciplinary book but this particular passage is mentioning various neuroimaging techniques. I have difficulty understanding what is meant by the embolden phrase. I am not sure whether ""within and between"" has a technical or simply a semantic/grammatical significance. In either case I remain confused. And hence I was not sure which site if at all is appropriate for asking clarification.   Within page 17 of the book Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century by Kelly, et al. (2007), it says...     The third development was the advent and maturation of the functional   neuroimaging technologies mentioned in the Introduction, which enable   us to observe directly, without opening up the skull , the activity of   the working human brain. Two principal classes of such methods are   currently available, although others are under development.12 The   first provides measures of the electric and magnetic fields directly   generated by neuroelectric activity in populations of suitably located   and oriented cortical neurons (electroencephalography [EEG]; magnetoencephalography [MEG]).   The second provides measures of hemodynamic or metabolic consequences   of neural activity such as local changes of blood flow, glucose   consumption, or blood oxygenation (especially positron emission   tomography [PET]; and functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]).   All these technologies are complex and expensive, and they tend within   and between classes to have complementary strengths and weaknesses   (see, e.g., Nunez &amp; Silberstein, 2000; Toga &amp; Mazziotta, 1996; Wikswo,   Gevins, &amp; Williamson, 1993). Together, they undoubtedly constitute a   major methodological advance for cognitive neuroscience. Indeed,   scarcely an issue now goes by of any cognitive neuroscience journal   that does not contain one or more papers featuring images outfitted   with colored spots identifying regions of ""significant"" brain   ""activation"" produced by some stimulus or task.13   I first posted the passage to esl and english.se but the answers I got were not definitive.   An answerer on esl.se told me it may have to do with within-subject and between-subject experiment methods or convey a similar meaning.   On english.se I was told it could simply be the common phrasal verb ""tend to"" with ""within and between"" breaking it up as a parenthetical clause with commas missed. That is it can be rewritten as ""they tend, within and between classes, to have...""   In either case I don't know what ""classes"" the author is talking about. Are these classes of the imaging devices he enumerates? This latter question could be quite technical. Still excuse me if this was not the right question for this site.  References  Kelly, E.

1111,Is Paul's Churchland claim about qualia supported by science?,"Knowledge argument:     Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like ""red"", ""blue"", and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ""The sky is blue"". [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not?   Paul's Chuchland answer is:     According to Paul Churchland, Mary might be considered to be like a feral child. Feral children have suffered extreme isolation during childhood. Technically when Mary leaves the room, she would not have the ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain has to learn and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the visual cortex. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of brain development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.   But can't I really see new color if I never experienced some mixture of wavelengths prior? I thought that the person who saw only 90% of spectrum for the whole life still would gain new experience when seeing something from remaining 10%.  I know cone cells are responsible for color perception. They are located on retina of eyes. Most people have three of them, but there can be more or less. Signals from them travel to parvocellular cells and to koniocellular cells. It's not clear how color is processed there, as far as I am aware. Then signals travel to visual cortex from there. And V1 is said to be the most influential part of visual cortex. But I am not sure how V4 is responsible for color perception.  Is there scientific support for his claim? Or instead, is there scientific support for the opposite? "
1112,Nature vs. Nurture,"In the following I have 4 questions which I think are too interleaved to separate into 4 different posts. I hope it's not a duplicate, but I didn't find here similar posts.  My understanding (as a layman, based on few non-professional books and some googling) is that the current ""state of the art"" regrading the age-old question in the title, is essentially as following:   For pretty much any reliable measurement researchers could come up with (in relation to cognitive capabilities, personality traits, interests, confidence, success, etc), 100% of the variance could be attributed to heredity and nonshared-environment (typically in approximately 50-50 split between the two), and effectively 0% of the variance is attributed to shared-environment.  My impression is that the research is vast, the data is ample, and the conclusions are overwhelmingly consistent and accepted.  My first intermediate question: is the above description correct?   Now, that trichotomy, as I understand it, goes like this: by ""heredity"" people refer to anything identical twins that grow separately share (so mainly genetic and epigenetic factors), by ""nonshared-environment"" people refer to anything identical twins that grow together do not share (specific social interactions, different life experience, etc), and by ""shared environment"" people refer to the things non-sibling that grow together share (same parents and family, same home, same neighborhood, same school, same lifestyle etc).  My second intermediate question: is this description correct?  If so, it basically means that a pair of identical twins that grew up together, is indistinguishable from a pair of identical twins that grew up separately, and that a pair of any two random people is indistinguishable from any two non-sibling that grew up in the same home with the same parents.  In shorts, sharing home does not make people more similar, with respect to most reliably measurable properties.  My third intermediate question: are there any notable exceptions? Known traits whose variance is meaningfully explained by the shared-environment?  My forth and last question: Is the socioeconomic status of the family is part of the shared-environment? It seems as it should be (if my description above is not too-wrong), but then it implies that it has no effect on anything other than the future socioeconomic status of the children. Is this really case?  Do things like the neighborhood and schools quality have no intrinsic effect (e.g. on intelligence, inclination to violence, occupational aptitude, religiousness, etc)? "
1113,What is the basis of the belief that modern psychology demonstrates that words themselves can be hurtful and verbal aggression should be wed out?,"I'm sorry for the length of this question, but to ask it I'll need to refer to two concepts.  Firstly, we see the escalating trend to weed out any and all examples of even very minor negativity or aggression in words. Those are deemed unacceptable, addressees of such messages may be called 'victims', and telling people to 'grow a thicker skin' is explicitly declared a non-solution to the problem. Examples of this are many: StackExchange's new Code of Conduct, strict rules of communication Riot Games is trying to enforce in League of Legends, punishing people for jokes, firing employees for not being nice enough to their colleagues, etc etc.  It is claimed that such policies are backed up by modern psychology:     One major mistake in this reasoning is ""unlike with sticks and stones, with words the addressees have the choice: to accept the message or to drop it"". They do not, the message will be received and the emotional reaction will happen, emotions are not subject to conscious control. One can choose to ""get over it"", but the same can be said of sticks and stones, so the real issue is the damage assessment. One reason for the new consensus is the undermining of folk misconceptions that heavily weigh physical damage over emotional one (as in the saying) by modern psychology.   -- @Conifold     Humans are social creatures. If a grief stricken person can be consoled by words and interactions. Why would you not expect the opposite to be equally effective that is turning a happy person depressed and mentelly unwell? To say that people should just ""ignore it"" is to assign all blame to the victim but that's not fair and ignores everything we know about human behaviour.   -- @Cell  Here I have to jump for a short while to the second concept... Monika and Marcin Gajda, in their book ""Rozwój. Jak współpracować z łaską"" (which is a Polish book on self-development that claims to be based on psychology and is written from an extensive Christian angle) introduces the concept of ""emotional sovereignty"". It distinguishes five levels of this sovereignty:   Submission. For example, if a bum insults me, I'll have the rest of my day screwed because I'll think how useless I must be that even a bum holds me in contempt. Entering a symmetrical conflict. Here I'll insult back the bum or even start physically fighting him to defend my good name. Ignoring aggressively. Here, feeling superior to the bum, I'll walk away, maybe mumbling something silently to myself. Assertiveness. As described by modern psychology. Merciful love. Told you the book is written with an extensive Christian angle. Here, with no contempt, feelings of superiority, aggression, urges of vengeance, or anything of this sort on my side, I'll look at the bum with compassion, seeing how miserable he must be to behave that way.   The book claims that people can - and should - work themselves from the lower levels to the higher levels, for their own good. Staying on the lower levels is harmful, also from the psychological point of view, for the people who stay there. Also the book claims that a person may be on different levels in relation to different people: for example, a person may be on the 5th level with regard to this exemplary 'bum', but on the lowest level with regard to one's own mother. (Important: This self-development is not supposed to include trying to control one's own emotions).  And here is where the two concepts meet, at least in my mind. If such 'abusive' words and messages are treated as 'big deal', if growing a thicker skin is not to be advised, if, having received such messages, the correct action to take is deemed to be to report the offender to whoever is in charge of the community, if, as psychologists want, not attempting to stop receiving these messages is not respecting oneself enough… Then such beliefs and policies seem to me to hurt, rather than protecting, 'victims' of verbal abuse, because effectively they teach them to stay at the lower levels of emotional sovereignty. If, instead of attempting to cleanse the word of all verbal 'negativity', the emphasis was on empowering the addressees of such messages to be 'sovereign' over them, then the old adage that 'sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me' would become true. On the other hand, the current emphasis of fighting the 'abusive' messages themselves seems to me to give the abusers the power to actually hurt the receivers of the verbal abuse: and that's a lot of power to place in improper hands.  I understand that my reasoning may be very well wrong, as the general consensus seems to be in the opposite. Then do both models not contradict themselves, regardless of whatever would seem to me to be the case? Or is Gajdowie's model of emotional sovereignty wrong?  EDIT: Just to clarify: The precise point that is hard to reconcile for me is this one: It is impossible for the receiver of the 'abusive' messages to avoid being damaged by such messages (the quoted comments) vs it is possible (Gajdowie) "
1114,System 1 and 2 thinking and unconcious,Research says there is system 1 and 2 thinking.   My question is how is system and and 2 thinking related to unconcious mind? Can we say for example system 1 thinking is unconcious mind? 
1115,Is mapping sound frequencies to the vertical axis universal?,"Shrill notes are said to be ""high"", and rumbles are said to be ""low"".  Humans seem to metaphorically map frequency to the vertical axis, and in the cultures that I know of, high frequency is considered ""up"".   Is this a universal phenomenon? Are there any cultures that map it upside-down, or in a completely different way? (For example, smaller objects tend to produce higher pitches. Are there any cultures that say that a pitch is ""small"" instead of ""high""?) Does this convention pre-date the scientific understanding of sound waves? If it is universal (or nearly so), is there any neurological hard-wiring that would cause that mapping?  "
1116,Scientific evidence about studying and learning strategies,"As many of you, I'm trying to improve learning strategies. I've tried mnemotecnics, breaking study-time into small chunks, and going for a walk when stuck with maths, physics or chemistry problems.   After seeing Study Less Study Smart by Marty Lobdell I got more interested in the subject. He states these strategies:   Study break Reward system Dedicated study area (Behavior Reinforcement) Rote memorization vs. Active learning Sleeping (REM  Sleep) Taking notes (and expanding those) Study from books (SQ3R = Survey,  Question,  Read,  Recite,  Review Mnemonics (Acronyms, Coin Sayings, Interactive Images)   Question  I am not really aware which learning strategies are confirmed by experiments, so what I'm looking for is the following:   Where can I start to read simple papers, reviews or essays on the science about learning and studying strategies?  "
1117,Sensory dissonance: Will the visual or auditory channel win?,"Is there any research showing that our visual channel takes precedence over the auditory channel (or vice versa) if there is some dissonance between them?  Examples:   Say a person driving a car approaches at fast speed a road split bang in the middle, the person next to her shouts ""Right!!!"" but raises his arm and clearly pointing to the left. Being shown the word 'Red' (coloured red) but simultaneously hearing the word 'Blue', will subjects press the red or the blue button?    "
1118,Why does sensory deprivation cause hallucinations?,"John C. Lilly performed the seminal experiment about sensory deprivation. The author isolated people in a sensory deprivation tank and they reported having experienced hallucinations.    Richard Feyman reported about his own experiences with isolation tanks in the collection of essays Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!  I am curious about the reason of this effect. If we are deprived of our senses (being perfectly sane and without drugs), why do we start to hallucinate? What happens inside our brains?  "
1119,Why do many people not use tabbed navigation (e.g. in an internet browser)?,"I have noticed that many people do not use tabs even though tabs have been around in browsers for some time. I have been noticing that people either do not differentiate tabs as specific navigational elements (e.g. a web page with tabs) or do not use them even when they know what purpose they serve. A lot of people have not even heard the word ""tab"".  These are only my personal impressions so I am curious to learn if you  have noticed otherwise. Also I know a free add-on for MS Office which gives you a tabbed window. As far as I know it is not a massive success.  Why do some/ most people find it hard to use tabbed navigation (e.g. in an internet browser)?    Here is an informal study (blog published, 21 participants, all Firefox users, all students or friends of the author) that shows that most (of the recruited participants) do use tabs, but about half of the participants use them only rarely (""4 tabs for every 100 navigation actions""): [website]Since the sample in this study is not very representative (Firefox users have made a concious choice regarding browser usage and are therefore more aware of browser functionality; 21 is an extremely low number for analysing common behavior) we might safely assume that other user types (those using pre-installed browsers; those not friends to a computer nerd) will use tabs even less.    update:   a speculation just occurred to me: what if people, generally, find navigation much easier on a vertical (e.g. book contents/ web site left menu/ Win Explorer folder tree/ etc) or if not finding it easier, at least expect it there, while navigation ver a horizontal is either more difficult for some reason or unhabitual?  "
1120,Can we enter data at the speed of thought?,"I have the subjective personal experience that the speed at which I can enter information in a computer through a keyboard is so slow and my thoughts ""run"" so fast, that I find it an especially frustrating experience to compose a text on a computer or do a translation.  Is there any research studying the effects of computer keyboard data entry speed compared to the speed at which thinking happens (or the speed of speech, the latter measurable) or just some paper elaborating on a correlation between the speed of data input and the subjective feeling of smooth mind work?   Maybe research with stenographers (supposed to be able to write at the speed of speech) would be a good direction? An article suggesting such correlation:  (Plover, the Open Source Steno Program: Writing and Coding With Steno). "
1121,"What exactly is IQ, and how to develop or improve it?","Some people are said to have exceptionally high IQ. What exactly is that supposed to mean?  Is it possible to develop high IQ if one doesn't have it? If yes, then how? "
1122,How can the mind be trained to accept ongoing mental or emotional suffering?,"We have physical, emotional and mental needs and wants; some tangible, some intangible.  In the case where we know that some of our needs and/or wants are not going to be met; how can the mind be trained to accept the reality with an ongoing craving, learn to accept the reality and live with it, as opposed to escaping within one's imagination dreaming of the past or the future?  For example:  In a committed relationship where one person is not receiving romantic, emotional and sexual pleasures, how can that person learn to accept these facts without continually fantasising and desiring these pleasures with someone else? "
1123,Does initial 0-3 years of age have any effects for a permanent bonding to happen between the parents and their children?,"My brother (age: 37) is least attached to our parents. At the time of his birth, our parents had left him with our grandmother. He saw our parents, for the first time, at the age of 3 years. He has lived with them after that till his high school.  I was wondering whether initial 0-3 years of age have any effects (positive/negative) for a permanent bonding to happen between the parents and their children? Or it isn't about age at all?  "
1124,Why do humans' eyes enter an unfocused gaze when recalling a memory or imagining something?,The question is self-explanatory (I hope).  Is this trait unique to humans?    Does the direction of the unfocused gaze indicate anything about which physical part of the brain is being utilized?  Is the hippocampus physically linked to the optic nerve and muscles surrounding the eye?  Is this effect related to other phenomena that are life threatening and deprive areas of the body and/or perception deemed unnecessary for survival? 
1125,What evolutionary process(es) are thought to have enabled humans to experience dreams?,"As some theories suggest, most, if not all, biological features in organisms exist due to environmental factors that trigger the organism's eventual adaptation to these factors for survival purposes.    This characteristic of organisms can be tested and retested to be true, so assuming this is the case, why did humans (and disputedly other organisms), develop the process of experiencing dreams?  Not to be confused with conscious imaginations - potentializing events/experiences - what evolutionary purpose does dreaming of unrealistic events/experiences serve?  Also, consider nightmares and their anxiety producing feelings which the organism would most likely avoid if the event/experience were real. "
1126,How do certain frequencies of sound induce psychological states?,"As one example, a specific low frequency beyond our hearing perception can make people feel nauseous and even vomit.  I'm sure there are more documented studies surrounding the correlation of auditory induced states, but how and/or why does this occur?  Also, does this phenomenon happen to deaf people as well? "
1127,"How to analyse accuracy, hits and false alarms in e-prime?","It's the first time for me to do analyses with e-prime, and I have to analyse some data from an experiment. The data are, at the moment, in e-prime. I'd like to have the accuracy, the hits, and the false alarms for every subject.  When I am in the anaylse window:    Accuracy: I drop the subjects into the rows, and the Target ACC into the Data window. But do I take the ACC mean or the ACC count? Hits: Isn't it the same as accuracy? And, if not, what is the difference? False Alarms: do I just count them? How can I make it then comparable over different tasks (some tasks have more trials than the others).  "
1128,What causes fetishes? Are they sexual disorders?,"Why do people have fetishes,  such as foot fetishes? How do such fetishes form? Are childhood incidents the main cause of fetishes? Are fetishes a sexual disorder? "
1129,What areas of mathematics support the study of cognitive science?,"Which areas of mathematics can be formally studied in a cognitive science major? Or: which areas of mathematics can support the study of brain. Some areas that seem relevant would be: mathematical logic, graph theory, linear algebra. Is any element of topology relevant? Please direct to links/sources if possible. Is network science being used in these fields? I am asking this question, as I want to study further in mathematics, and would love it if I could do so while pursuing cognitive science. "
1130,Reducing ceiling effect with a Likert scale measure,"I am designing a psychology study in which the main endpoint is the perceived effectiveness of various medical treatments. In pilot trials, we used a bipolar Likert scale to measure perceived effectiveness:   Very ineffective Ineffective Somewhat ineffective Somewhat effective Effective Very effective   Unfortunately, pilot data indicate a major ceiling effect. Combining two similar pilot trials (n=73), only four responses had perceived effectiveness below ""Somewhat effective"":   (I'm overlaying a dotplot on a standard boxplot here.)  Are other psychometric scales better suited to separating  the clustered responses at the high end of the scale? Does adding more items to the Likert scale (say, increasing to 8 options) improve matters without sacrificing too much reliability? References especially appreciated where possible. "
1131,How can I create a set of comparable symbols of different shapes?,"I was thinking about doing a small experiment during university course where participants have to answer a personality quiz and then they have to compare different symbols (like triangles, rectangles of different ratios) on a split screen view, comparing two symbols at the same time, choose the preferred one and taking reaction time. Just to get information about common preferences for shapes! Obviously these symbols should have some basic information in common (pixel density, color) so shouldn't be completely different.   How can I create a set of symbols that have the same area even if they varied in geometrical form (ratio)? How should I decide which forms in which ratios should be presented? "
1132,"Is there such a person as a ""social"" homosexual?","One of my former work colleagues was an (unhappily) married woman, who divorced her husband. Afterward, she ""dated"" (and lived with) a number of women.  Apparently ""sex"" wasn't the driving force in her new lifestyle. It was more that she wanted the dominant ""man's"" role in her relationships (she was a ""boss"" at work).  Conversely, could there be a male homosexual that was such mainly because of a submissive, passive, nature rather than sexuality?  And could such a woman and such a man find mutual happiness is a socially ""roles reversed"" relationahip between a dominant ""masculine"" woman and a submissive ""feminine"" man, while enjoying their natural physical ""fit?"" "
1133,How does motivation relate to performance and to fun and to recognition?,"Many studies indicate that for tasks that require cognitive skills and creative thinking, monetary reward does not work to improve performance. Rather, we should give people purpose, autonomy and mastery to make them part of something bigger and give them the freedom to do what they think is important to solve the problem.  But while that might get people to perform better at a certain task, how does this relate to motivation? Are purpose, autonomy and mastery more intrinsic-oriented and could motivation be more long-term (extrinsic) oriented in terms of profit (in the broadest sense, including all costs and benefits)?  Any thoughts or even scientific insights on this? "
1134,"When a person starts to scratch, why does this often start others to scratch?","Often, when a person starts scratching and complains of being itchy, whether they suggest there might be a bug biting them (for example fleas, head lice, mites) another person with them will start to feel itchy, just at the thought of it. The cause may not always be an insect.  This seems to occur with sources of itching that cannot be seem, (for example with mosquitos that produce large bites and can usually be seen flying around, people may not tich unless being bitten. In fact they sometime joke how they are usually the ones being bitten and aren't now and the like), but this could be a false assumption on my part.  Why is it that people can feel itchy when another person feels itchy and starts scratching and complaining?  What happens within the brain, what changes occur neurochemically and along which neural networks and regions?  Is this influenced by how visible the cause of the itch and the resulting marks left by this (example bites)?  Is there theory about the evolutionary purpose of this, perhaps it is a survival mechanism to help prevent infestation?  Answers can address only one of these aspects being asked, as it encompasses many fields. "
1135,Which is more true about learning?,"I think / guess using multiple sources for education / learning is much better than using one source; I mean by source, visual, auditory, etc... So at best I could learn from a person face-to-face, then watching some video, then reading a tutorial with graphs, etc...  but what about keeping reading and accumulating knowledge by forcing info by the act of just reading here and there, until the piece of info ""clicks"".. is that a good thing? What is bad about this method? what is good? It seems like to be clutter compared to the way of learning mentioned above this paragraph... "
1136,Active Learning vs. Engaged Learning,"I have seen both of these in different research publications, but after searching for a while, I was not able to find the difference. I'll appreciate it if you explain the difference and give me some references to learn more about the difference.  Some links to publications about Active learning:  [website][website][website]Some links to publications about engaged learning:  [website][website][website][website]"
1137,EEGlab: power spectral density from a single EEG lead,"I was trying to get power spectral density of a time-series data. The sleep recording software we use, doesn't allow to export EDF format of an interval, only of the whole record, but it allows to extract an ASCII file with uV value of a single lead. We are selecting the visually ""cleaner"" part of a longer dot test task.  The way I'm proceeding now, is to   import them in eeglab,  use FIR automatic filter with 0.5 - 28 low hi pass run this script  [power, freq] = spectopo(EEG.data(chanNr, :), 0, sampRate, 'winsize', 512, 'freqfac', 2,'freqrange',[0 28]); (chanNr = 1 and sampRate =512)    I am not familiar with signal analysis, am I proceeding in the proper way? The output I get from spectopo in the power variable, is uV squared, right? "
1138,Is there a name for sudden addiction relieving clarity?,"I struggled for years to quit smoking, then after many failed attempts I stopped without any difficulty. I've also experienced this on other things, like when I'll want to do something but I lack the discipline to do it, then eventually I'll have a surge of energy and willpower that will make it easy for me to get anything done.    What is the psychology behind this yo-yo surge of willpower? How can I encourage my mind and body to bring on that heightened willpower? "
1139,What is the current status of Paraphrenia?,"First mentioned by Kalbhaum in 1863, and better known by Kraepelin's descriptions in 1912, paraphrenia seems to be forgotten after the publication of DSM-III. It is always described by its nosology, late onset, with very systematized delirium and typical theme, without losing too much contact with reality.   In general, it seems to have been fused with schizophrenia, persistent delirium, affective paraphrenia, and paranoid affection. Commonly described among delirium and schizophrenia.  ICD-10 includes it in F22 as a type of persistent delusional ideas, in ICD-9 included in paranoid states. It is not included in DSM-IV or DSM-V.  There are plenty descriptive studies, but few reviews with a focus on paraphrenia.   Can anyone find a well-focused and detailed experimental review or trial? Do psychology / psychiatry associations claim it? Are there manuals that address it in diagnosis or didactically (not in general form but with detailed author)? Are there any authors especially focused on this disorder?     1. I am not interested in medication;  2. I am not interested in comorbidities such as paranoid affection (described as very characterized by a characteristic affection and there is some confusion with directly paranoid affection, affective paraphrenia).  3. I am not interested whether it appears to be closely related to paranoid schizophrenia (confusion due to systematized delirium). "
1140,Can animals develop mental disorders that are unique or similar to our own?,"I just had a discussion with someone about mental illnesses in people (specifically talking about Capgraw delusion, alien hand syndrome, and walking corpse syndrome) and how some people's lives can be ruined by mental disorders.   Then I had a thought: Do animals also get mental disorders? I don't think I've ever heard anybody suggest it before...we all just assume animals are just animals and do animal stuff. Some people might say, ""Oh, that cat is crazy."" but maybe it's actually suffering from a mental disorder?  I mean, we all know animals can suffer dramatic trauma and be psychologically scarred by it...but humans can seemingly develop mental disorders without previous physical trauma and we also develop very odd mental disorders (like Capgraw delusion).   So logically, I just have to wonder if animals can develop mental disorders that are unique or similar to our own. "
1141,Fear Conditioning and Hippocampal Remapping,"Have there been any studies that explore how much generalization across contexts occurs with fear conditioning?    The ""context"" that the animal thinks it is in can be observed through the ""map"" that the hippocampal place cell network is using at a point in time.  Different ""contexts"" have different ""maps"".  This is known as global remapping.  I might think that the conditioned fear response would only occur in situations for which there is no hippocampal remapping as compared to the original conditioned environment (i.e. the hippocampus is using the same ""map"" as the original conditioned environment).    Is there evidence supporting that assumption? "
1142,Which Meditation Techniques Correlate Best with Certain Brain-Waves?,"Which meditation techniques are better at ""entraining(?)"" specifically desired brainwaves?  For each brainwave range, (Alpha, Theta, etc) - are certain meditative technique more effective?  For example, I was recently told that ""Kundalini"" was most effective towards Theta Waves, and Mindfulness more effective towards Alpha-Waves...    I had found this, but does the research indicate that some meditative techniques are actually more effective at generating ""high amplitude oscillations"" for each brainwave range? ...     EEG Derived Neuronal Dynamics during Meditation: Progress and Challenges           2.1.1. Zen Meditation -      Zen meditation, a type of Buddhist meditation, is characterized by increase in slow alpha power, reflecting more internalized attention, and fast theta power, reflecting enhanced mindfulness in frontal area [9, 13]. Long-term practitioners show alpha1 rise in frontal region and beta rise over occipital regions [14].          2.1.2. CHAN Meditation - Researchers correlated occipital alpha wave rise during eye closed relaxation and frontal alpha wave (representing mindfulness) during CHAN meditation          2.2. Transcending Meditation (TM) - Various physiological and neural effects in long-term Jacobson's Progressive Relaxation (PR) meditators (a classical method of relaxation), TM meditators, and group of beginners in PR were recorded [28].

I have also found studies which examine the effect of short exercises (10-15 minutes, medium intensity) which has also found to have ""improved affective experience and enhanced cognitive processing""   What is the effect of a long workout (over 1h) on the mental capabilites?

1145,Is there a limit on the rate at which incoming information can be comprehended?,"I recently started a course on ""Speed Reading"", which aim is to read faster whilst holding the level of comprehension constant (so not to its detriment, but not aimed at improving comprehension either).  Now, for the case of reading, I imagine we can define a rate at which information is been given to the brain. So, the faster you read (holding comprehension constant), the higher such rate is. Clearly, the aim of such training programs like ""speed reading"" is to move that rate up.   Is there an upper limit to such rate, perhaps because of biological reasons? Does it depends on the person? Can we say, for example, that it is biologically impossible to comprehend a text reading faster than 1,000 words per minute? Is there any evidence of such limit? This information would be useful to understand the scope of improvement possible on this issue. "
1146,Is there a word or phrase that describes emotional self harm?,"Is psychologically/mentally self harming yourself on purpose possible, where you look for things that trigger you (trigger your anxiety, stress or PTSD), not to desensitise yourself but to hurt yourself? Is there a word for it? "
1147,"What causes passion, psychologically and chemically, and how does it last?","I recently finished reading ""Habits of a happy brain"", which discusses the role of oxytocin, serotonin, endorphin, dopamine, and cortisol in seeking behavior.  The book argues that we evolved to direct ourselves towards things that would promote our survival, and each of these hormones has a role to play in either strengthening certain behaviors, or encouraging us to move on from certain behaviors - one of the ways this is done is ""Dopamine/Serotonin disappointment"" (I don't recall if it was also relevant for oxytocin), which lessens the reward - and seems to have evolved because it encouraged us to move on and try to do even better.  But the book makes no mention of passion*, or how it fits in into all these discoveries.  Specifically, I wonder, how is passion possible in light of these ""disappointments""? I'd imagine passion involves a significant feeling of reward. Is there another hormone involved, one that's less... disappointing?  And how does passion develop into what it is? I am a big believer in the claim (which also appears in the book) that we evolved to seek ways to survive, and that what makes us happy (or sad, or stressed) is perceived by us as helpful (or detrimental) to our survival. How does one connect something to the need for survival in such a way that gives him so much energy and continuously rewards him for doing it?  And, being practical as always, How can I get me some of them passion? (Don't worry, it's for a good cause)  *Please note that I am specifically talking about passion towards a thing/hobby, as opposed to towards a partner. I don't know how much overlap there is, but I wouldn't go there before I delve into the (surely extensive) body of research into love. "
1148,What are the best known causes and treatments for apathy?,"Has any extensive research been done into what the most common causes of apathy are and are there any treatments with a highly reported success rate? If so, what are these?  For clarification of what apathy is, it is a state of desensitization, where subjects seem to strongly lack any observable moods, and have severely dampened feelings and/or emotions. One well known side effect is that apathetic people often struggle to motivate themselves to perform tasks.  (From wikipedia)     Apathy is a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, and concern. Apathy is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation, and/or passion. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, and/or physical life and the world.   Other questions specifically about apathy: What are the cognitive and neurological bases for apathy?  Some research about pathological apathy I was able to find: [website]"
1149,Question about perceived stubborn behavior patterns,Is there a relative diagnosis for someone who can't simply adapt to and/or use something that is already established?  This type of personality would also need to have their own idea to validate their selection/alternative for peer acceptance.  It could be either severe (I'm guessing this would be narcissistic personality disorder) or mild.  Is this common or categorized in some way?  And are there ways of dealing with this type of personality/behavior? 
1150,What is the difference between Symbolism and Abstract thinking in Piaget's Theory?,"I'm having trouble understanding the difference between symbols and abstract thinking in Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory. Piaget says that in the preoperational stage, children 2-7 years old can think of things in terms of symbols, and that abstract thinking forms in the formal operational stage. I thought symbols are a part of abstract thinking, perhaps because symbols, to me, seem abstract. So, what does the theory mean when it refers to ""abstract thinking?"" Can someone give me a concrete example delineating the difference between the abstract thinking and symbolism parts in their respective stages? Much thanks!  "
1151,Do we know what is happening inside the brain when a person is hit in the head?,"For the purposes of this question, I will use the example of a legally sanctioned athletic contest (i.e., a boxing match), rather than criminal activity or accidents, but the question certainly applies to any brain trauma that has similar effects.  Anyone who watches boxing and other fighting sports knows that when a fighter is hit hard in the head or face, a few things are very likely to happen (links lead to videos showing examples of the effect in question):   The legs either go stiff, go limp, or begin to wobble;  sometimes, they seem to move in unpredictable, involuntary ways. The eyes glaze over and seem to lose focus The fighter will stumble and fall, sometimes after a slight delay Mobility and coordination are profoundly reduced The fighter appears to lose spatial awareness and orientation, sometimes even seeming to be confused as to where he/she is In some cases, the fighter will immediately lose consciousness, but I am more interested in the alternative - that is, a serious blow to the brain that results in the above effects, but doesn't render the victim totally unconscious.   Obviously, when the face or head suffers a strong, sudden impact from the front, back, or sides (or, in cases like an uppercut punch, from below, and to the bottom of the chin), momentum causes the brain to strike one or more surfaces inside the skull, so there is some mechanical/physical injury going on - in short, the person who was hit has a concussion.  I know that this can cause significant, long-term damage to the brain and nervous system, but I am interested in the short-term, immediate effects.  Is this physical/mechanical injury the sole reason we see the symptoms I've described above?  Are there separate processes taking place (e.g., abnormal electrical/chemical activity causing the symptoms described above)?  Or does the physical/mechanical injury cause other types of abnormal activity in the brain/nervous system?  In short, do we know what is happening inside the brain after a hard blow, causing such pronounced effects, described above, in the rest of the body? "
1152,Bragging is bad for your reputation... but there is one exception: What is going on?,"It might be that this question is not suitable for this SE site so feel free to close.  Several scientific studies prove what we all kind of know: That bragging is being frowned upon - see e.g. this article and the references within: How to boast on the sly (The Atlantic, April 2016)  Yet by now we all know one person who does basically nothing else but bragging, boasting, telling us that he is the most wonderful person on the planet... and let me hasten to add that seemingly people not only accept it but really embrace it and even seem to love it: Of course I am talking about Donald Trump!  My question What is going on? What has the psychological literature to say about this seemingly paradox phenomenon? "
1153,Consciousness and neural grafting,"You have two friends: Alice and Bob. Suppose you have a way to remove a healthy neuron from Alice's brain and conserve it in some safe place. And, viceversa, suppose you have a way to graft this neuron in a certain region of Bob's brain (assuming the new neuron will develop connections with the others nearby).  Then keep repeating the following two steps:   remove one neuron from Alice and another from Bob, both possibly from the same region; graft Alice's neuron in Bob's brain and viceversa (again, both in the same region)   until all neurons have been exchanged.  After we have exchanged all the neurons, will Alice and Bob still feel the same? If so, consider this: let v be the speed at which we complete the entire operation, with v = 1 meaning instant exchange and v = 0 meaning infinite time (no exhange at all). What would be the maximum possible value of v such that Bob and Alice still feel the same after the operation? "
1154,Why is Internet Addiction Disorder not listed in the DSM-5 manual?,Disclaimer - I am not a student of psychology.

1157,How does one internalize the delayed reward of exercise?,"For the past few years my target has been to work out every morning (resistance training). On average I have only made it to the gym around 2 out of every 5 mornings. On days on which I do make it, I feel hugely improved mood and productivity. So,   What is the current state of research at the intersection of delayed reward and exercise? Can motivation can be improved short- or long-term?  "
1158,"What does the statement mean ""50% of happiness is determined by genetics""?","I posted the question ""Is 50% of a happiness determined by genetics?"" on Skeptics but realize I don't fully understand the claim. What does it mean that 50% of happiness is determined by genetics?  Does it mean that each time a person is happy, 50% of the reason they are happy is because of genetics? How can that possibly make sense as happiness is a human construct so why wouldn't the genetic factor apply the same to other emotions like sadness?  Is an example of how genetics determines happiness, that someone is predisposed to liking chocolate, so if they're happy when eating chocolate cake, genetics is 50% of the reason they are happy? Is that the claim?  Does this mean that an unhappy person can't do that much to become happy?   EDIT: would it be correct to say a person can change their level of happiness by +/-50%? Is this what the claim is saying?   TL;DR does the statement mean a person has at most 50% control over how happy they are?  CBS New York reports on research presenting this claim. "
1159,Do ALL decisions arouse cognitive dissonance?,"I continue to see an oversimplification in the descriptions of the options available that arouse cognitive dissonance: some websites state that all decisions have positive and negative aspects that will lead to dissonance and some say that dissonance is aroused only when a decision is made between two equally desirable options.  In other words, do ALL decisions arouse cognitive dissonance? Or just the decisions made between options that are equally or near-equally desirable?   For example, if I were to choose between an Ivy league college or a SUNY school, I don't think I would very much regret going to the Ivy league school and not the other (or would I be reducing dissonance by telling myself that?). However, the website explaining cognitive dissonance simply labels these options as ""colleges"".  Also what if the decision making was something trivial (in my perceptions)? Do whimsical decisions arouse dissonance as well?   For example, if I had a very large sum of money and I was selecting between two equally desirable cars, and I could very easily afford both, would I still experience much dissonance?  "
1160,Can neuron change from excitatory to inhibitory (and vice versa) over time?,"According to this answer a neuron can release only specific type of neurotransmitters at the time, however, could it change over time? For example a neuron that now releases only inhibitory neurotransmitters, after a few days will turn into a neuron releasing only excitatory neurotransmitters. If it is possible, then what does it depend on (mathematical models appreciated)? "
1161,Can LSD connect sensory regions in the brain?,"How is it possible that after using LSD you can hear sounds and see colours?   I have my own experience with this phenomenon. When I´m lying totally relaxed in bed and suddenly a door is closed loudly, I see an explosion of colours. Are the two brain regions responsible for hearing and seeing, if you´re totally relaxed (for example just before falling asleep), somehow more connected with each other? "
1162,"Would Artificial Super-Intelligence From Science Fiction ""Speed Up"" The Brain and Wear it Out Faster Leading to Earlier Death?","In stories such as Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes, the main character, Charlie Gordon, receives an operation on his brain that triples his intelligence.  Could something like this be achieved if the brain is somehow sped up and forced to do more in less time? And wouldn't something like this cause the brain to deteriorate rapidly from being ""worn out"" by so much use?  I found in this article that as the brain ages, it will shrink and will have larger fissures in it. In the story, after what seems to have been a short life, the mouse dies and is dissected. The mouse's brain is found to have much larger fissures and have shrinked.  Is this wearing out or aging of the brain due to increased activity by surgical means accurate in any way? "
1163,Group differences reflecting different use of a rating scale vs actual difference in perception,"I was reading a paper that reports average ratings of chords by two different groups of subjects (trained musicians, and non-musicians).     The paper makes the argument that ""These group differences may reflect either the manner in which the two groups of subjects used the rating scale or in their perceptions of the chords.""  Obviously, one would hope that the latter is the case rather than the former, although from this graph one can't be sure since error bars, which would be very informative in this case, are not shown. My question is: is it correct to say that the answer to this question can be given if one compares the variances across groups, e.g.with Levine's test? And that, if found to be unequal, one can argue that the group difference reflects an artefact, i.e. a difference in the way the two groups of subjects used the rating scale? "
1164,Why are Children always so interested in adults?,"I work as a kindergarten teacher, and it's always fascinating to me that children are so quick to be affectionate and take interest in what their teacher is doing.  Is there an evolutionary reason for this behaviour? Are children genetically programmed from birth to be loving and to affect the emotional bonds of adults around them, in order to receive more resources (food, shelter, etc., for survival)? "
1165,What if people understand or interpret words differently in their mind?,"Let's think about it, we have all adopted to learn the meaning of words through experiences or emotions. We didn't learn each and every word from a dictionary. What if I understand a word slightly differently in my complex mind? Could it result in some sort of pessimistic or optimistic or abstract outcome? And how often is this case true in our society? "
1166,How does architecture impact cognition and mental health?,"Research indicates that scenic, natural environments positively impact human health and mental well-being [1][2]. But what about the impact of man-made architecture and various architectural styles on human cognition and well-being - has any empirical research investigated this? Are there any arguments in cognitive science that support the claim that we respond differently to different architectural surroundings? Moreover, is there anything known about the validity of the concept of universal/objective aesthetics in architecture, grounded on neurobiology?  Specifically, I'm interested in comparing the impact of various architectural styles and their inherent philosophies on our cognition (health, creativity, pro-social behavior ...). Personally, I noticed that I feel much more calm, focused and creative in cities with classical architecture and its many derivatives, e.g. historical Vienna or Venice - the architecture itself seems to impact my perception of the world. In contrast, more contemporary architecture that represents, roughly, primarily pragmatism - think megalopolis like NYC or industrial Chicago - invokes in me much more negative feelings of alienation and nihilism, to put it shortly. I wonder how common this is, and to what extent it could be explained with nature rather than nurture. "
1167,How valid are reaction times collected from online studies?,"Online studies promise the possibility of greatly increased numbers of and variability in populations to study, but there are many potential concerns and need for validation, and diving in head first seems imprudent.   Here, I am interested in the ability to collect response time data online compared to a standard computer setup (e.g., a PsychToolbox or E-Prime based study with keyboard input, not a response box) in an on-site experiment booth. While these studies have their own limitations, such as being insuitable for experiments where very high fidelity RT data is critical to the study, I am merely interested in whether online studies differ significantly from them.   Are online RTs different from on-site RTs within tasks? Is the theoretical floor on online RTs in general different from that of on-site RTs?  "
1168,Are Pareto charts identified in the cognitive sciences (and for willpower in particular)?,"I'm a layman when it comes to the cognitive sciences. I've read some number of popular self-help books, but not any academic journals. I've noticed that many times a book suggests some techniques for willpower, anxiety management etc., but will never list them out in a prioritized fashion.   While there might be some variation based on the circumstances and the individuals involved, I feel like a one or a few techniques should always dominate the list. The effectiveness of techniques that deal with different cognitive issues is most likely somwhat geometrically distributed (all else being equal), i.e., most of the time they obey the power law (most techniques are moderately effective, but a few are really effective).    In particular I'm currently interested in effective techniques for willpower. I'm aware of which techniques are recommended (split a task into subtasks, positive self-talk and many more), but what are their relative effectiveness? Are there some well-executed studies out there that determined which techniques work comparatively better?  What are effective and generalizable self-regulatory skills and strategies?  How do their relative efficacy compare? "
1169,"Are there any EEG procedures currently available/in development that can formulate letters/words from deliberate, internal monologue?","I am thinking of the combination of an EEG-like device and software to monitor and analyze (very) deliberate thoughts of letters/words.   The input would be in the form of raw electrical brain activity from the EEG and the output from the software analysis would be in the form of text (the pattern-matched words/letters).   The software would be trained to recognize specific patterns of electrical impulses and form conclusions on what letter/word matches the best.   I have been interested in the idea of an input-less and effort-less HID such as this for a while now, mainly for personal enjoyment--I've entertained thoughts of working on documents with vim on the bed with a projector aimed at the ceiling--but realize that something like this would be of immense help to the disabled too.   I'm confident that teams are working right now on such problems, but my searches have yielded no results.   Here are some of my questions.   Can anyone direct me to some relevant articles and papers?  What is the current state of progress regarding the formulation of useful information from neural firing patterns and raw brain activity?  Are current EEG and other-brain scanning devices available right now capable enough to detect and form distinctions between impulses such as the internalization of, say, letters ""K"" vs ""F""?.    Can something like the OpenBCI do this? Can something like the Emotiv system do this? They have two models, the ""EPOC / EPOC+"" and ""Insight"". The former offers 14 EEG channels while the latter offers only 5. Is 5 sufficient for such purposes?  Is it a problem of insufficient hardware sensing resolution or the inability to pattern match such noisy data?    I looked at this post too but it did not answer my questions: Can we draw conclusions about content of thoughts from neural firing patterns?    Found some interesting links   OpenEEG, but it looks dead now Very promising and exactly what I was looking for: OpenBCI, An Open Source Brain-Computer Interface For Makers More EEG info: Selecting an EEG Device Emotiv EEGs, also looks promising: Are recent affordable EEG devices any good?

1170,What are the neural substrates of retrieval induced forgetting?,"Retrieval-induced effects  It is well known that practicing retrieval of remembered items increases the probability of correctly recalling that item in future tests: the testing effect. Retrieval-induced forgetting (RIFo) and retrieval-induced facilitation (RIFa) are less known, but related phenomena with, in my view, large theoretical and practical implications for cognitive memory research and educational theory.   In RIFo, learned items associated with a remembered item subjected to retrieval practice appear to suffer from increased forgetting in future tests (Anderson, Bjork and Bjork, 1994). Some papers report that the inverse also appears to occur: in RIFa, the probability of recalling associated remembered items also increases (Chan, 2009). RIFo appears to be a reasonably robust phenomenon with many replications, while RIFa is not as well established an effect.  The cognitive neuroscience of RIF  Where the classical view might have attributed the effect to relative strengthening of associations and decay, modern theories revolve around variations on an automatic inhibition process associated with recall attempts (Anderson, Bjork and Bjork, 2000). This might suggest that the PFC and frontal cortex more generally should be doing most of the legwork here, but is that empirically the case?   What are the known neural substrates of RIFo (and RIFa) effects?  References   Anderson, M. C., Bjork, E. L., &amp; Bjork, R. A. (2000).

1171,"What is the relation between measures, constructs and concepts?","It is uncontroversial to say that the cognitive sciences do not exclusively deal with directly observable phenomena, but nonetheless aim to study the physical causes of behavior and cognition scientifically. ""Grasping"", for instance, is directly observable, but cognitive science also studies ""intelligence,"" which is not directly observable, at least not for all conceptualizations of intelligence.   When cognitive science studies such an unobserved quantity, the difference between the general concept, the unobserved construct, and the direct measure is sometimes rendered implicit. More colloquially: go far enough down the methodological rabbit hole for an unobserved construct, and you will likely eventually find a patient zero paper that defines a broad folk concept, then makes a spherical-cow or just-so statement that a construct maps on to the concept.  Example: Working memory  For an illustration of a just-so definition, take Baddeley and Hitch's definition of working memory in their seminal 1974 work as a replacement for the classical short-term/long-term memory model:     a system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of information   (The relationship rendered implicit here is [""memory"" -> STM/LTM -> WM/LTM].)  To be fair to Baddeley &amp; Hitch, and so as not to single them out, Baddeley has later defended this problem with their model on productivity and guide to discovery grounds (Baddeley, 2007). I find this quite reasonable, and I do not mean to impugn their excellent research or the model's productivity in any way, only to use the example as an illustration for the question.   Problem of implicit relations  Implicit relations are antithetical to the practice of science because they engender unstated assumptions and hidden theoretical incompatibilities. It is also antithetical to science communication and scientific literacy, because important words like ""intelligence"" and ""memory"" become effectively polyvalent, with subtly different meanings that are not apparent without considerable study. The relationship between IQ and intelligence is the prototypical example.  Question  What is the relation between measures, constructs and concepts as actually used in the cognitive sciences? (Contrast intelligence or memory with grasping or walking, if concrete examples are helpful.)  Please read my comments to the question and current answer before asking for additional information.

1172,How can items from a general self-esteem/efficacy measure be changed to measure context specific self-esteem/efficacy?,"I am very interested in a survey employing a Likert type scale in my research. I have come across the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. I would like to use this scale to get a sense of how subjects feel about their self-esteem during their trial in my research.   The questions will stay consistent with Rosenberg’s test model keeping five of the items positively worded and keeping five negatively worded using the four-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree.    Can the scale questions be ""changed""/presented without losing validity in the self-esteem measurement?   If not, then how do I let participants answer questions in the context of my experiment and what I am trying to improve? For example, I would like to know how they feel about learning a new language (e.g., Japanese) using a traditional method. Then I present a new method and ask again how they feel about learning the same new language? I would like to capture feedback from participants that would let me know if they feel better/more confident about learning a new language by utilizing a new method/approach?   The Rosenberg questions are extremely general (I believe this is the beauty of it) which means it can yield stronger more general results. However, from my limited knowledge, I believe a generally confident person would answer those questions positively most of the time which means filling-out this scale before and after an experiment wouldn't conclude drastic result/change. However, if those questions were directed towards an issue that the subjects in the experiment all find difficult, then I believe their subjective answer to the questions would show considerable change if a *new method promises to improve their perceived intuition over a traditional method?     The following are the questions from Rosenberg’s self-esteem scale:   I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others. I feel that I have a number of good qualities.  All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure. I am able to do things as well as most other people. I feel I do not have much to be proud of.  I take a positive attitude toward myself.  On the whole, I am satisfied with myself. I wish I could have more respect for myself. I certainly feel useless at times. At times I think I am no good at all.   If a Rosenberg scale shouldn't be used in this case, then what would be an appropriate scale?  I was originally looking at The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE). However, I would still ask the same qustions of GSE that I have of Rosenberg's Scale. How can I ""retro-fit"" GSE to make it in the context of say learning a language &amp; self-efficacy?   The following are the questions from the GSE scale:   I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough. If someone opposes me, I can find the means and ways to get what I want. It is easy for me to stick to my aims and accomplish my goals. I am confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events. Thanks to my resourcefulness, I know how to handle unforeseen situations. I can solve most problems if I invest the necessary effort. I can remain calm when facing difficulties because I can rely on my coping abilities. When I am confronted with a problem, I can usually find several solutions. If I am in trouble, I can usually think of a solution. I can usually handle whatever comes my way.  "
1173,What are proper EEG frequency bands and electrode placements for imagined speech?,"I am doing an EEG experiment about imagined speech recognition. Which frequencies will have the most relevant information? I chose the frequency band [4-40] Hz as a start, mainly because of signal processing considerations. Filtering out the remaining frequencies basically removes the DC voltage and most of the EOC artifacts.  Which frequencies should I select? Also which channels will contain the signal (i.e., the most relevant data)? "
1174,Do 10.000 hours of practice make you an expert?,"With his book ""Outliers"" Malcolm Gladwell has widely popularized the idea that the requirement to become an expert in any field is largely to invest at least 10.000 hours of deliberate practice.   What is the scientific basis of this conclusion? It seems to have originated from this research by Ericsson et al. (1993). In what way does this paper support the conclusion of a 10.000 hour rule? What is the current state of the research on this question?   Reference  Ericsson, K. A., Krampe, R. T., &amp; Tesch-Römer, C. (1993).

1175,Do hints improve memorization when using spaced repetition?,"For example, I'm learning geography using the spaced repetition method. I have some program which asks me questions like, ""In which country Melbourne is located?"", and I have to recall the country (assuming I've studied the material and at least once seen Melbourne on the map). This program also gives me two possible hints when I can't recall the answer:   If I choose ""obvious hint"" it says ""kangaroo"", which for me is a straight giveaway for ""Australia"". If I choose ""vague hint"" it says ""hell"". After thinking a while, I may come up with this: ""There's the Devil in Hell. There's an animal called Tasmanian Devil, which lives on the island Tasmania, which is near the Australia.""   The idea in both cases is to not show the answer right away when I can't recall it, but rather force me (more or less) to try recalling it once again, but now with some additional information.  Questions:   Do obvious hints help memorization at all? As you saw, the hint ""Australia"" is as good as just showing me the answer, but maybe it helps building association in my memory which helps recalling the answer later. Do vague hints help more? I assume yes, since they trigger some associations in my memory, but I have no proofs.   Of course, the ""obviousness"" of a hint is very subjective, but the idea behind it should be clear: ""obvious"" hints are just one or two associations away from answers, while ""vague"" ones form longer association chains.  EDIT: There is a related question with an answer which mentions elaborative rehearsal and depth of processing, but I'm not sure if those processes are involved here, since hints are mostly related to an answer (""Kangaroos live in Australia""), not a question (""kangaroos"" and ""Melbourne"" are not associated in my memories, neither do ""hell"" and ""Melbourne"").

1176,Why do humans need emotions?,"If the emotions' only purpose is to stimulate certain behavior, why can't this task just as effectively, or even more effectively be done by the reasoning part of the brain?  Are emotions really necessary for survival? "
1177,How do Hemispatial Neglect patients react when told of their disability?,"Hemispatial Neglect patients are known to have Anosognosia meaning they don't recognize their disability. These patients neglect either their left or right field of vision entirely, as if they couldn't see anything on that side of their body.  How do these patients react when directly confronted with the fact of their disability? Hemispatial Neglect can be treated as it is an issue of attention not lack of sensation. Are these patients able to focus on the neglected area (before treatment) if explicitly told to do so?   Wikipedia notes a delusional form of the disorder:     Neglect may also present as a delusional form, where the patient denies ownership of a limb or an entire side of the body. Since this delusion often occurs alone without the accompaniment of other delusions, it is often labeled as a monothematic delusion.   So some patients may outright deny that the neglected side of their body exist, but this does not seem to exist in all cases of the disorder. "
1178,Is stimulus generalization acquired due to inability to discriminate stimuli?,"The classic case of Stimulus Generalization is Little Albert. The About.com link also explains it in terms of dogs. I note that in both cases, it seems highly likely that the subject (dog or infant) is unable to discriminate stimuli or unable to determine which part of the stimulus is relevant.  Have there been studies on stimulus generalization in adults?   Specifically, I wonder if stimulus generalization results from the inability to determine what part of an unconditioned stimulus (white rat) is associated with the conditioned stimulus (loud noise).   I know that discrimination can be caused by conditioning with relevant stimuli and extincting non-relevant stimuli, but would an adult human generalize fear to a general stimulus or a specific one and why? "
1179,Is there evidence that listening to music can aid/hinder concentration or performance?,"I, like many computer programmers, love to listen to music while I work. I have always believed that music helps me stay focused and motivated, and improves my performance on many types of tasks, espescially ""busywork"". However my company's CEO disagrees with me, and believes that music is a distraction and leads to reduced productivity. Have any studies been done on whether listening to music while performing a task improves or hinders one's ability to perform that task? Is there a consensus in the cognitive science community regarding this? "
1180,What neurobiological changes are associated with the end of the critical period in children?,"Developing children are in a critical period during which they are much better at learning certain tasks like speaking a language. After the critical period ends, children have a qualitatively more difficult time learning these tasks.  What specific changes in a child's brain are responsible for the drastic difference in learning during and after the critical period? Are these changes just to the plasticity and rate of neuorogenesis?   Notes   The best understood critical period is phoneme recognition and production; I am fine with answers that are specialized to this task.  It is important to explain how the neurobiological changes produce a change in learning that seems so qualitatively different and sudden compared to the gradual decreases in learning at other times.     Related questions  How is a young child able to learn language so easily?  Why does neuroplasticity decrease in adults?  Computational models of early learning in children "
1181,How do humans optimize noisy multi-variable functions in experimental settings?,"Imagine an experiment like this:  A participant is asked to optimize an unknown function (let's say minimize) . On each trial the participant provides several input values, and receives an output value. Now also imagine that the output is noisy, in that the same inputs lead to an output plus a  random component.   To think of but one of many possible specific examples imagine the following function  [tex]  where [tex] is normally distributed, mean = 0, sd = 3.   On each trial, the participant would provide a value for [tex], [tex], and [tex]. And they would obtain a [tex] value based on this underlying function. Their aim would be to minimise the value of [tex]. They have not been told the underlying functional form. They only know that there is a global minimum and that there is a random component.  I'm interested in reading about the strategies used by humans to do this task in experimental settings. Note I'm not directly interested in how computers do the task or how programmers and mathematicians might complete this task.  Questions   What are some good references for learning about the literature on how humans learn to optimize noisy multi-variable functions? What are some of the key findings on how humans optimize noisy multi-variable functions?  "
1182,Simulate colorblindness in non-colorblind individuals,"Is there any way by which individuals with normal color vision could ""see"" the effects of Deuteranopia or any of the common colorblindness types, say by using special lenses or anything?   Color vision deficits can be approximated via filters on images or video, but is there any way, via special lenses/eyeware or lighting that normal color vision participants could be made to actually perceive a scene as if they had a color vision deficiency from a normal colored object or representation? "
1183,What causes systematic under- or over-estimation of general knowledge quantities?,"What psychological theories predict whether individuals will underestimate or overestimate when responding to particular kinds of general knowledge quantity questions?  For instance, I have seen an unpublished study in which people were asked to guess the weight of the fuel in a certain space shuttle, and almost everyone wildly underestimated the weight. Then in another question they were asked to guess the weight of the horse which won the last Kentucky Derby and the responses were distributed fairly evenly around the truth. Why is this?  I think that the heuristics and biases literature must be relevant here, but I haven't found any citations that allow me to make predictions which are sufficiently specific. "
1184,What can cognitive psychology tell us about the results of the Stanford Prison Experiment?,"One of the experiments that are always taught as prime examples of social psychology in action is the Stanford Prison Experiment     In 1971, Zimbardo accepted a tenured position as professor of psychology at Stanford University. With a government grant from the U.S. Office of Naval Research, he conducted the Stanford prison study in which 24 normal college students were randomly assigned to be ""prisoners"" or ""guards"" in a mock prison located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford (three additional college students were selected as alternates, only one of which participated in the study). The two week planned study into the psychology of prison life ended only after 6 days due to emotional trauma being experienced by the participants. The students quickly began acting out their roles, with ""guards"" becoming sadistic and ""prisoners"" showing extreme passivity and depression.      *from the Philip Zimbardo article   I realize there have been scores of scholarly articles written about the subject in the intervening time, but most of the abstracts dealt with the aspects of social psychology that were pertinent even in the last decade with the atrocities at Abu Ghraib.  All of that is painful yet certainly necessary to ponder, but I'm curious about the cognitive aspects of the study.  What facets of, for example, motivation does this study (and others like it) bring out?  What can be said about our sense of logical reasoning under these circumstances?  What sorts of qualia could one use to model this behavior in an agent? "
1185,Are there any laws of memory?,"Several years ago, my adviser wrote an article discussing the observation that a hundred years of studying memory had not resulted in the discovery of a ""law"" of memory. He wrote (p. 247):     When one reads or hears the claim that “repetition improves retention”   or that “generating information enhances recall” or that “forgetting   follows a power function” or all other statements of the form that   “variable X has a consistent effect on variable Y,” one can be certain   that the claim is both true and false. It is true in that conditions   can be found under which the rule holds (otherwise the claim would not   be made), but false in that a skeptic can always say: “Very nice work,   but your ﬁnding depends on many other conditions. Change those and   your effect will go away.”   Has the story changed since 2008? Can anyone cite a proven true law of memory? If not, what's the closest thing memory has? The idea of transfer-appropriate processing is the closest I can name, is there something more substantial?  "
1186,Is it possible to create a false memory by trying to remember something that eludes you?,"Sometimes I have difficulty remembering the specifics of an event, specifically if I'm tired or possibly have recently consumed alcohol. A close friend of mine has gotten me in the habit of specifically trying not to think about the details of what I'm trying to remember if I am unclear on them at any given moment. The reasoning is, if one starts to think about varions on what happened, trying ""too hard"" to remember the details of an event, then one might alter one's memory by the very act of trying to remember. Instead, I try to stop thinking about the details of the specific memory, and sometimes they will just come to me suddenly (often hours r days later).  Have any studies shown such a phenomenon to exist? Is it possible to create a false memory by trying to remember something that eludes you? "
1187,"Are autonomy, mastery, and purpose the most important motivators?","I've watched the amazing TED talk where Daniel Pink lays out the contrarian notion that greater extrinsic motivators are unimportant (and sometimes detrimental) in comparison to three intrinsic motivators: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.  But is he wrong? I've only found some criticisms of the study he based the former on (that greater material rewards do not work for ""cognitive"" tasks) on a similar discussion board. That's not what I'm really concerned about, though.   My main question is: Are the three motivators of autonomy, mastery, and purpose the most important aspects to motivation? "
1188,Refinements of Rescorla-Wagner model of classical conditioning,"The Rescorla-Wagner model is one of the most commonly discussed mathematical models of classical conditioning. It was wildly popular when it came out in 1972, and very successful. The same math, is used in the delta-rule which is a special case of back-propagation with a single layer. In neural network research, the back-propagation algorithm has been refined and replaced over the years. However, for basic classical conditioning, I am not aware of any significant advances over the RW-model. It is still often cited as the model for classical conditioning in textbooks.  However, it is well know that there are numerous conditioning experiments the RW-model cannot explain, for a detailed references, see pages 370 to 378 of Miller et al. (1995). Hence the question:  Is there a modern refinement of the Rescorla-Wagner model that addressed all 23 failures listed in Miller et al. (1995)? How does this refinement relate to refinements of back-propagation?    References  Miller, R.R., Barnet, R.C., &amp; Grahame, N.J. (1995) ""Assessment of the Rescorla-Wagner model.""

1189,Can you improve your intelligence by practising?,"According to this article  [website]your intelligence as an adult is to 80 % determined by genetics:  Despite the well-known difference in twin-based heritability for intelligence in childhood (0.45) and adulthood (0.80),  If you are born with a strong predisposition for limited cognitive abilities, can you do something to improve the situation?  Compare with more physical traits. To win a medal in the Olympic Games you probably need to have an outstanding predisposition for that specific sport BUT unless you have a very negative predisposition for something (such a limping and trying to be a marathon runner) you can by hard work become a ""good amateur"", probably ending up in the top 10 %, and maybe even top 1 % or so, ""just"" by a lot of work. (However, top 1 % won't give you any medal on most regional or national championship so you are still a loooong way from the olympics).  It is obvious what you need to do to achieve that: play a lot of tennis (if tennis is the sport you want to be a good amateur in) combined with some more generic weight and fitness training.  Can you achieve similar results (top 1-10 %) with regards to your cognitive abilities with hard work? Why? Why not? How? "
1190,Can a CT scan have advserse cognitive effects on the brain?,"If the normal Xrays scans, despite the low amount of radiation (equivalent to a few hours of background radiation, can be sufficient to cause a burning sensation, then I wonder if the much higher dose of a CT head scan can cause some adverse cognitive effects? Also, is it possible that the Xrays make the neurons fire at random? "
1191,Questions regarding schizophrenic prodromal progression,"I have been researching schizophrenia(sz) for a long while now, especially concerning the prodromal and ultra high risk(UHR) phases. Diagnostic criteria, symptom progression, remission rates, etc. But I haven't been able to find research of prodromal ""symptom wave"" patterns. In developed sz, psychosis and other symptoms exhibit a wave formation, waxing and waning. Is such a wave pattern present in some form as the disorder develops? If so, how long can a wave of 'downtime' versus more severe symptoms last?  I also am having trouble getting a full understanding of the diagnostic criteria for prodromal and UHR, though UHR doesn't seem to be well-defined anyway. The symptom lists vary slightly per paper, but in only one have I seen any mention of sensory processing issues developing in prodrome, and PTSD-like hypervigilance seems to not be mentioned much. Are these symptoms not as common in prodrome? There are other symptoms(eye contact avoidance, social ability degradation, dissociation etc.) that I have the same question about but I don't want to get too long.  I have other questions, but mainly I am looking for any sz specialist or someone experienced with sz willing to help me iron out these details with their experience. I'd like to message them if possible. This matter is of personal concern to me. I haven't added any sources or detail because this question is more opening up the possibility for a correspondence, and it would take a long time to explain everything. It would be strictly objective and not related to therapy of any sort. I hope this question is not inappropriate for this forum. "
1192,How can be explained from an evolutionary perspective the fact that some successful people do not want to have children?,"According to David Funder, Douglas Kenrick proposed a revised version of Maslow's hierarchy from an evolutionary perspective (1). He said that human beings will strive to move from 1 to 7 in a pyramid.    Immediate physiological needs.  Self-protection.  Affiliation.  Status-esteem.  Mate acquisition.  Mate retention.  Parenting.    But my questions are:   How can we explain from an evolutionary perspective that some ""successful"" species, choose consciously to avoid parenthood at all? Does it conflict with the evolutionary perspective that every human would try to parenting? If not, how is it supposed to be interpreted?

1193,Is eye movement important with eyes-closed EMDR therapy?,"Original EMDR therapy involved a subject with open eyes tracking a target that moves side to side.  It is now common for EMDR to use devices like electronic ""tappers"" to alternately stimulate the left and right sides of the subject's body, leaving the subject free to close his eyes and engage in visualizations related to the trauma being treated.  In general, during wakeful visualizations with my eyes closed I often move my eyes in a manner similar to REM sleep.  I have tried a few sessions of EMDR and found it to be uncannily effective.  During closed-eye EMDR I sometimes find myself engaging in REM based on my visualizations, and other times find my eyes moving side to side in synchrony with the ""tappers.""  My question: Are there any studies or theories that suggest eye movement in closed-eye EMDR is relevant to the efficacy of the therapy?  E.g., does it matter whether the closed eyes move side to side if there is some other bilateral stimulation? "
1194,Can the consumer level Tobii Eye Trackers be used for research?,"Tobii sells both 'consumer' (Tobii eye tracking) and 'research' eye trackers (Tobii pro).  In their help article ""Can I use a Tobii Eye Tracker for research purposes?"" they state:     If you want to develop software for analytical purposes,   post-processing or aggregation of eye tracking data across multiple   users using an eye tracker from Tobii Tech, please contact the SDK   Licensing team since you will need to obtain a special license to do   so.   On the Developer zone they state:      Tobii’s consumer eye trackers are primarily intended for personal   interaction use and not for analytical purposes. Any application that   stores or transfers eye tracking data must have a special license from   Tobii.   They elaborate on this in ""Analytical Use of Eye Tracking Data"":     Tobii distinguishes applications in two categories: Interaction Use and Analytical Use. Depending on the intended use of your application, you may need to apply for a specific license.      ...      Beyond real-time interaction, knowing where we focus our attention   brings value to a range of applications within behavioral research,   usability testing, streaming of gaze data and even health assessments.   These applications would involve transferring, storing and   analyzing/aggregating the eye tracking data which is defined by Tobii   as Analytical Use. For any application that store or transfer eye   tracking data you must obtain a special Analytical Use license from   Tobii.   What they are much less clear on is:   Why do they introduce this separate licensing model? Surely, it has to do with pricing and the availability of Tobii pro eye trackers, but this still sounds like a very odd, hard to enforce, business model. How do they intend to enforce this? Can they sell a product and simply ask of buyers not to use it for a certain purpose? How difficult is it to obtain a license? Does anyone have experience with this? What are the inherent limitations of the consumer level eye tracker compared to the professional eye trackers?  "
1195,Repeating a rumor that you started?,"I've heard that repeating a rumor by denying it only serves to reinforce the rumor.   [website]Try to avoid reinforcing minor rumors by repeating them in order to deny them.  [website]Even a denial can be a repetition of a rumor."" (Just ask Senator John Kerry, whose 2004 presidential bid sunk thanks to whispers about his swift-boat service in Vietnam—even though most of the media stories were about how the rumors were false.)  [website]If it was you who started the rumor in the first place, don't deny it. Instead of reacting to what others will think of you, admit what you did wrong out of character.  But what about in cases where I told something about myself that was less than flattering, or even downright embarrassing, and am now regretting having said? Does the same principle -- repeat it in any way by denying, asking to keep silent about the matter etc... -- result in heightening the possibility that it will spread to other people, because of the effects of priming?  Or is it the case that if I ask him/her specifically to not repeat the rumor, that he/she will more likely comply compared to if I kept silent about the matter? "
1196,Why can't we learn what we don't like?,"The school system as we know it, is &amp; has been shaping students to fit the system which they live in and throughout this process, the students are forced to learn(mostly memorize) subjects which they do not have any interest in whatsoever and because of this they can't score high in school. It is as if our brains are trying to avoid information, which is out of interest, as much as possible. But when there's something in interest it is damn easy to collect and comprehend that information.  Let's assume that you are a programmer and you are greatly amazed by that, you love solving problems and develop software, you read lots of documentations and contribute on other peoples projects without even having to worry about ""remembering"" what you're reading, everything is easily understood and there's no issue with that. But when you have to learn about politics and how the system works, it appears as cancer to your eyes because you have no interest in it, there's no will to collect that information and therefore you score low in that subject.  now my question is: Why can't we learn what we don't like? (what we're not interested in?) "
1197,Differentiations of Imposter Syndrome,"How can Imposter Syndrome be differentiated from actually possessing its symptoms? For example, one of the symptoms is the feeling that the person does not possesses extra intelligence, but that they have tricked their peers into such false perceptions.   Perhaps either one is true, either they posses special skills in scamming the public, so to say. Or they have imposter syndrome, but how can one truly know? Especially after coming across the fact that descriptions of such states exist.   In short, how do we differentiate imposter syndrome from [one who feels like] an actual imposter?  Please comment for clarifications "
1198,Why do people bid on online auctions sooner than a few seconds before it ends?,"This is something that has always puzzled me about human behavior on online auction platforms. I am talking about a specific platform where you can sell almost any item you want with a starting bid and a fixed time until the auction ends. People then can place a bid at any time, thus increasing the current price. The current price is always last bid + 0.5 currency. When the auction ends the highest bidder gets the item for the current price, with a percentage going to the platform. E.g. if the starting bid is 1 currency and someone bids 50 currency, the price is at 1.5 currency, until someone else places another bid, e.g. 20 currency, which would push the price to 20.50 currency, with the first bidder still being in the lead.  And that's exactly the crux. No one except the highest bidder knows what the highest bid is. People tend to place a bid, see it's not high enough and then increase their own bid in small currency steps, often going beyond what they originally were willing to pay. Also anyone who bids early risks that someone else tries to bid more than them, while when they bid late that chance is reduced, especially because there isn't any time for anyone to bid again.  For the platform this is good. For sellers this is good. For buyers, not so much. It's super irrational. They just drive the price up by bidding.  If buyers would just wait till a few seconds before the auction ends, and then place exactly the highest amount they are willing to pay, the item would sell for less, and they wouldn't be drawn into a bidding war that escalates the amount they are willing to pay. Even if it slightly decreases their chance of getting the item, unless it's a super rare thing there are so many items from different sellers, it would still be rational to behave this way until they succeed on one of the items. If unsuccessful too often, they could then conciously decide to increase the amount they are willing to pay - to adjust to the market price, not escalate in a bidding war.  Of course the platform wouldn't profit as much then, but I doubt buyers behave this way out of charity for them. So the question is: Why are people behaving this way? Are they really not aware of this? Do they not care? Is bidding to them just fun? Is this in some way related to gambling?  (I have asked this same question a few years ago on a Q&amp;A in my native language, and the unanimous answer was: ""Bidding is how that platform works, you obviously don't understand it,"" which leads me to believe that the answer is people really are not aware, but I don't get why not.)  I have been selling items on a particular platform for over a decade and absolutely profited from this irrational behavior, but at the same time I am so confused by my fellow humans. "
1199,Do in-depth explanations help a hypochondriac?,"I have in my circle a person that is a hypochondriac and harbors fears regarding things the person considers me an expert in. So I often get asked questions like: ""Can this make me sick?"", ""Can it cause cancer used in this or that way?"" etc.   I don't always know how to react, should I try to placate the person's fear and gloss over certain potentially problematic corner cases, or should I go in-depth and explain every nook and cranny of the topic?  I usually go down into the weeds and try to explain in detail what would limit exposure and why. Sort of the ""teach a person to fish"" kind of approach. I consider this the most honest way.  But it sometimes seems, that all the person wants to hear is: Don't worry about it. Don't do &lt;insert-commonly-known-worst-case&gt; and you'll be fine.  It honors me that I have so much trust put into my words, but sometimes I worry if I am doing the right thing. How can I support the professional treatment for this condition that person is already undergoing?  EDIT: Just to be clear: There is no real substantial danger to the person. The topic is commonly regarded as not entirely clear and sufficiently scary even to the non-diagnosed hypochondriac, but scientifically and morally it is completely ok to say, don't use it too much and don't worry about it.

1200,THC and the Brain damage,Are people who react badly(paranoia/more severe anxiety) to weed/THC at risk for damaging effects to the brain compared to the general population?    Does a certain type of brain chemistry/neuro disease get exacerbated from heavy THC usage contributing to substantial damage that is other wise not a problem?   Apparently an one of my dad's uncle had some condition that was worsened by weed and essentially retarded him. 
1201,Implementing new procedures / guidelines in companies,"I'm teaching evidence-based practice and implementation science to midwifery students, i.e. how to evaluate research findings e.g. regarding new therapies and diagnostics and how to plan the implementation of new procedures into clinical practice. The question of how new procedures/guidelines can be implemented most successfully into an organization is obviously pretty complex and depends e.g. on the willingness of the co-workers to change their behaviour, but also on the organizational culture, leaders etc. Several models exist how implementations should be planned or evaluated (Williams et al., 2015), but I feel like the field is not very advanced in terms of theory building and the possibility to predict the success of implementation.  I assume there exist a lot of similarities to 'implementation science' or whatever it is called in organizational psychology, i.e. I assume that there exists also research on how to implement new procedures/guidelines in private companies etc. What is a good starting point/literature review for this kind of research?  Williams, B., Perillo, S., &amp; Brown, T. (2015). What are the factors of organisational culture in health care settings that act as barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice?

1202,What's the difference between flaws of character and a personality disorder?,"Okay, I have read this question and 2 answers and I don't believe these are the same questions.  It's not about legal status or the moral appropriateness of punishment by society.  And it's not about the neural basis of volition (and how that can get messed up, physically), I don't think.  It's more like why isn't some personality disorder (like narcissistic or borderline) simply considered a character flaw?  Like: that narcissist is arrogant and conceited and brags because he wants to be and likes it.  Or: that borderline is demanding and manipulative and hateful because she wants to be and it serves her.  So that is the first question.  The second question is how to relate with these troubled persons? When does one hold the other personally accountable for their decisions and actions and when does one go into treatment mode as a caregiver would a patient or a dependent loved one?  Caregiver is flawed human being with their own issues and not professional in any field related to psychology or mental health.  But, outside the domain of the law and criminal responsibility, how should a regular ""civilian"" or ""layperson"" relate to persons (immediate family, extended family, coworker, friend or acquaintance) with NPD or BPD?  When should a person treat the NPD or BPD as a selfish asshole (with moral judgement and sometimes disdain) and when as a sick or weak person that is perhaps just very needy (and/or difficult)? "
1203,"Psychology Research, Questionnaire Help Needed","I am Computer Science student and studying Psychology as an elective. Now I was required to conduct a research on any topic. I chose: Negative Effects of Permissive Parenting Style on Youth of Pakistan. I am having difficulty in making Questionnaire (since I have very little experience about it). I want your expertise to know which approach is better. I have following two approaches of making questionnaire.  First Approach:  Topic: Negative Effects of Permissive Parenting Style on Youth of Pakistan  1-Do you think that permissive parenting style has negative effects on Pakistani youth?  2-Would you like to adopt permissive parenting style if you happen to become a parent?  3-Do you think that permissive parenting is one of the reasons that Pakistani youth lacks self-discipline?  4-Do you think that the element of not listening to anyone, in Pakistani youth is because of their brought up by permissive parents?  5-Do you think that students of universities in Pakistan do not perform well in academics because they are not afraid of their parents' reaction on getting failed?  6-Do you think that parents should be friendly enough, so that their children do not hesitate to share any problem?  7-Do you think that in Pakistan, permissive parenting should be encouraged?  8-Do you think that blurred line between parents and children leads to domestic conflicts?  9-Do you think that children become creative in a restriction free environment?  10-Do you think that permissive parenting makes relationship with children conflict-free?  11-Do you think that youth of Pakistan do not abide by rules because they are not enforced by any rule under the permissive environment?  12-Do you think that, in Pakistan, drugs is more often among the youngesters having permissive parents?  13-Do you think that the parents being soft spoken, builds strong emotional understanding in children?  14-Do you think that under permissive environment, children will lack decision-making skills?  15-Do you think that friendly environment in home teaches children social skills?  Second Approach: What do you think about the following statements?  ⦁ Your parent really expect you to follow family rules.  ⦁ Your parent try to know where you go at night.  ⦁ Your parent know exactly where you are most afternoons after school.  ⦁ When your parent tell you to do something, they expect you to do it immediately without any question.  ⦁ Your parent get very upset if you try to disagree with them.  ⦁ It is a bad idea to question authority.  ⦁ A person must have clear long term goals.  ⦁ You would rather do something beside studying during extra time.  ⦁ If you like something, you want to have it no matter what.  ⦁ You have a healthy diet.  In the first approach, direct questions with binary options are given.  In the second approach, first 5 questions are used to depict whether the subject is permissive or not. Next five questions are used to know what are the effects on permissive parenting. "
1204,How does the brain create original thoughts?,"Since the generation of thoughts requires the coordination of various parts of the brain, how does the brain know which parts to activate to develop unique ideas? Does the brain randomly activate its various regions until it happens upon a unique thought?   Is the creation of unique, original, and creative ideas a function of the brain alone, or does the brain require an outside stimulus to engender creative or unique thinking?  There are many instances of great thinkers arriving at groundbreaking ideas from mere observation of nature and society. For example, Einstein developed his equivalence principle by thinking about elevators (mundane, everyday machines).  So, in summary, does the brain need outside stimulation to think imaginatively, and how does the brain coordinate its different parts to generate unique ideas? "
1205,"How is the term ""physiological measurement"" defined?",Does the measurement have to be subconscious?  Can measurement such as eye-tracking be counted as physiological measurement? (I thought it is because of its relatively subconscious nature until I saw this.) 
1206,Is it possible to quantify 'pettiness' in a personality?,"Petty is a word that is pretty clearly defined:     Not very important or serious      Relating to things that are not very important or serious   I'm interested in measuring the degree that someone is likely to be focused on, or taking issue with things that most would consider to be trivial, unimportant or nonsensical. For instance, when interviewing a candidate for a position, how could I determine how likely this person is to latch onto issues that most would forget about within minutes of them occurring?  To better illustrate what I'm trying to measure, suppose someone was exposed to the following bits of information in a day:   The company lost over 14 billion in revenue due to gum-chewing The city government outlawed all use of purple on Wednesdays We realized that alien civilizations exist on Mars and have been emulating us by what they pick up from our radio emissions, and formed boy bands A co-worker wasn't wearing the exact color socks specified in the employee handbook   Despite the magnificence of events 1 - 3, the type of person very likely to place an inordinate amount of focus on all things petty can only dwell on number 4.   Is there a term for this and, moreover, a test to determine the degree of it in an individual's personality? "
1207,Effect of time limits on problem solving,"I recently took part in psychological testing as part of a recruitment process to a job. I was not happy about the evaluation I got and I asked for a feedback discussion with the psychologist. The psychologist told me (among other things), that I could perform well in a situation that was undisturbed, when I could concentrate and when there was no time limit. But isn't that true about all people?    Do there exist individuals, who start performing better when there is time pressure?  Of course there may be such individuals, but what would be a general rule that would apply to most normal mortal individuals?    The scores I got were slightly above average in IQ tests (there were also personality tests). So I should not have problems with solving problems fast, too. At least I performed like other normal average people do. Still the psychologist wanted to stress the fact that I can perform well when I can concentrate and there is no time limit.  There were no tests in which I would have been disturbed in any manner. The tests were largely automated and the test room was a quiet classroom. Other applicants, other test subjects like me, were all also doing their tests quietly in front of computers. As far as I can recall, most IQ tests did have a time limit. "
1208,Impact of the first love experience,"When we become adults, we think that love is for adults only associating it with sexual relations but I'm sure that all of us have loved or have had some admiration for the daughter of the neighborhood or a girl attending the same school: that's an idyllic love, I'm sure.  If we know that childhood is characterized by a strong learning capacities and that the learned experiences will have a strong impact on the future behavior of the child, thus the future man or woman, can someone accept easily to see the girl(for a man) or the boy(for a girl) that he/she  dreamt in married with another one (when he begins his adulthood).  Isn't such a heart-breaking experience, that can prevent our mind from trying to build new relationships (since we can not replace, at least in our mind,the representation of the loved one while it's becoming a nightmare in the same time)?   And when our mind survive this chaos, will he seek to find someone  resembling the one loved during childhood without that we even notice?   How is it that people overcome the initial pain of failed love to feel brave enough to risk such pain again when starting relationships? Do people tend to look for someone who reminds them of their first love? Is there any studies or statistics for married couples that were ""in love"" since childhood?  "
1209,"Does cognitive & behavioral schools have any analysis for ""sympathy"" & ""compassion""?","The Cambridge Dictionaries define the word compassion as:      a strong feeling of sympathy and sadness for the suffering or bad luck of others and a wish to help them   A sample might be when you see a homeless kid, suffering the cold of the winter, and you would like to help him have a warm home for at least one night. This desire is very powerful in some people, such that they become altruists (preferring benefits of others over their personal benefits) and very weak in some other people (egoists who prefer their benefits over benefit of other people).  Is there any analysis for this attribute in cognitive sciences (or behaviorism)? By any analysis I mean are they being studied under the domain of cognitive sciences or not, and if so, what are the most known and accepted theories for them? "
1210,What are the clues on how 'vivid' someone's sensory imagination is?,"For example, I can imagine me eating barbecue with some details, like appearance,  smell, temperature, taste etc, and I end up experiencing all these qualities to a certain extent. But I guess each one of us feels it with a different intensity. Is there a way to verify that? Are different levels of sensory imagination associated with some personality traits?  I think this is a related question, but it does not talk about the intensity of it: What happens when a person &quot;imagines&quot; how food could taste like just from looking at it?   "
1211,What are the possible causes of pettiness?,"There is a question about pettiness Is it possible to quantify &#39;pettiness&#39; in a personality?   Which gives a good example of how some people can focus on seemingly unimportant issues, when there are more obvious issues that would seem to warrant attention.  What would cause a person to focus, even fixate on small, petty things; for example:    a co-worker's tardiness, when the employer's company is facing a takeover and jobs may be lost.   the makeup one of the school Mum's was wearing, when there's been a robbery at the school   I am wondering what the possible causes of pettiness may be?   "
1212,Are there any vocal chord experiments that attempt to synthesize communication externally?,"I have an idea for an experiment.  Basically, the experiment would be to create a novel transmission of visual information via the human vocal chords, but not as a traditional human spoken language per se.    The vocal chords are first trained by an external instrument to produce a specific pattern that is associated with an image such as a simple circle.  In addition, a ""listening"" machine is calibrated to process the sounds emanating from the vocal chords.    At first, this doesn't sound so different than language as we use it now and how we interact with voice-recognition technology such as Siri, but what if the vocal chords were trained to produce patterns an order of magnitude more quickly than what is currently achievable?  The current world record for speaking is 637 words per minute or 10 words per second.    Also, the patterns that I am thinking of would completely bypass our language processing centers and be immediately received by our visual cortex (or something like that).  After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.  So, are there any vocal chord experiments that attempt to synthesize communication externally or come anywhere close to what I am proposing? "
1213,How does one make a decision between different cognitive tests for the same construct?,"I would like to measure peak cognitive performance in healthy individuals, for situation awareness, reaction time, visuo-spatial processing etc. I am interested in both within-subject and between-subject changes for pre-post test interventions.   There are a number of 'standardised' and 'validated' commercial test batteries that have been used in both clinical and healthy populations. Could anyone explain what is the difference between using the 'visuo-spatial processing' test module in ANAM as compared to the same module in CANTAB, PenScreen etc etc?  What is a principled way to choose which test battery module to use?  Many thanks. "
1214,Solving T-shaped maze (probability learning): differences between rats and humans,"From Jonah Lehrer's book ""How We Decide"", he mentions the experiments with rats and Yale undergraduates.  I found the paper that (presumably) matches the experiment of rats.     Brunswik, E. (1939). Probability as a determiner of rat behavior. Journal of Experimental    Psychology, 25, 175–197. [Reprinted in Hammond, K. R., &amp; Stewart, T. R., 2001]   But the results seem to be somewhat different from what he described.  Could anyone tell me where I can find the paper about Yale graduates performing the maze task?  Here's the excerpt from the book,     ""Look, for example, at this elegant little experiment:   A rat was put in a T-shaped maze with a few morsels of food   placed on either the far right or the far left side of the enclosure.   The placement of the food was random, but the dice were rigged:   over the long run, the food was placed on the left side 60 percent   of the time. How did the rat respond? It quickly realized that the   left side was more rewarding. As a result, it always went to the   left of the maze, which resulted in a 60 percent success rate. The   rat didn't strive for perfection. It didn't search for a unified theory   of the T-shaped maze. It just accepted the inherent uncertainty   of the reward and learned to settle for the option that usually   gave the best outcome.   The experiment was repeated with Yale undergraduates. Unlike   the rat, the students, with their elaborate networks of dopamine   neurons, stubbornly searched for the elusive pattern that   determined the placement of the reward. They made predictions   and then tried to learn from their prediction errors. The problem   was that there was nothing to predict; the apparent randomness   was real. Because the students refused to settle for a 60 percent   success rate, they ended up with a 52 percent success rate. Although   most of the students were convinced that they were making   progress toward identifying the underlying algorithm, they   were, in actuality, outsmarted by a rat.""  "
1215,Do we negatively perceive people who wear glasses?,"Do we negatively perceive people who wear glasses? If so, why? Is it cultural stereotypes, a simple case of homophily, or is there more to it? "
1216,Why do we anchor our happiness to short term situational comparisons rather than large scale events?,"Why does our happiness seem to be most affected by recent, short term happenings rather than the high level trends of our lives?  For example, a person has begun their life in a very humble or even disadvantaged position: poor education, a lack of parental involvement, and an exposure to drug addiction. This same person, through through their own fortitude manages, to change their life trajectory so that they have a comfortable job, a home in a safe part of town, and many loving friendships. Why then, despite having overcome such odds, are they still likely to be happy or unhappy based on small, localized daily situations, like getting into a disagreement at work or having a friend cancel plans.   To phrase the question a different way, why do large scale personal achievements often have less impact on our moment to moment satisfaction than whatever we're experiencing right now? "
1217,Why does a person get obsessive for those who don't take interest in him?,"Why does a person get obsessive, Specially towards those who don't accept his love or attraction towards them?  Self esteem has such an impact on human life that he wants to preserve his esteem in any way possible. Then why does one get obsessive towards those who have broken the trust he put into them? Why does he try to reason with those who have told him that they don't love him?  Where does his drive to consolidate his self esteem go in such situations? "
1218,Which study design to use: nested case-control or case-cohort?,"I am following a cohort of patients over time from which I am planning to sub-sample a sub-group of patients to pilot a new intervention. The plan is to compare the effectiveness of the new intervention on improving specific outcomes for a sub-sample compared to those did not receive the intervention. the original study is an inception prospective cohort with several followup assessment time points (3 evaluations time points).  Which design is better to use?   Nested Case-Control (the intervention group [participants who have completed the intervention] will be compared to control group [those who didn't receive an intervention] and maybe a third group of normal people from the community) in this case the 2 (or 3) study groups will be matched on age and comorbidities. Case-Cohort design (my understanding for this is that a sub-sample will be randomly selected at the baseline for an intervention and then compared to the rest of the cohort). Both are new to me and not sure if any of these is a superior design over the other one and better to use, and what would be the factors to consider?  "
1219,Conceptual blending,"Is there a mathematical formalization of conceptual blending? I know that feature structures in linguistics or frames in AI can be combined using unification which is a special (simple) case of conceptual blending. How can more complex blends be formalized? To stay in the domain of linguistics, complex predicates (e.g., I made her cry) are said to involve conceptual blending that can't be formalized as unification. "
1220,Is the ability to discern between living and non-living things learnt or innate?,"This question   What optical features do we use to distinguish “life” from “non-life”?  on Philosophy SE prompted me to write this question.  The question poses, do we recognise a living thing, from what we already know to be a living thing.  I am posting some of this to give a background of what prompted this question.  I quote from the original question:       Imagine you see a picture of a tiger: You instantly recognize it being   a living thing, more specific: Something you call ""tiger"". You have   seen tigers before (or at least heard of them and saw pictures or so).   You have some kind of (vague) concept of what a tiger might be and this   thing fits perfectly in it. And you know that a tiger is a living   thing and you believe that what you see is a tiger: So you believe   that the thing you see is a living thing called tiger.   ...      What exactly are the features we all recognize living things kind of accurate (even though when they don't exist in reality and are, just like the Nasobēm, just imaginary animals someone invented)?     I have modified this question to ask:    Is the ability to discern between living and non-living things learnt or innate?  In the original question the OP includes an image of a 'Nasobēm', a make believe creature that looks a little squid like.  "
1221,Which physical properties of a stimulus can a human attend to?,"I am not only curious about speech, but for concreteness in illustrating my question, I consider the case of speech perception. Assume a listener is presented with an acoustic waveform. The wave causes deviations from the atmospheric pressure at the listener's eardrum. Thus, the acoustic pressure as a function of time “comes for free”, so to speak. Mechanically so.  From sound pressure we can derive amplitude, and by the fourier transform, amplitude as a function of time is transformed to the frequency domain. That is, amplitude as a function of time becomes amplitude as a function of frequency. We use this transformation because it reveals properties of the wave which are perceptually relevant, e.g. formant frequencies.  Presumably, listeners can attend to properties of the waveform describable under this transformation.  But what about mathematical models of the acoustic wave which are not simply transformations on the wave, but which derive some richer structure from amplitude fluctuations over time. For instance, what about a model which constructs a higher dimensional representation of the wave from the one-dimensional pressure fluctuations? (Imagine that instead of amplitude being a point moving back and forth along the real number line, the wave is represented as a point moving around in, say, 3-dimensional space). Say that such a model revealed a perceptually relevant property P of the waveform. Would the listener be able to “hear” P directly, or would would she need to engage in some information processing task to recover P from pressure fluctuations over time?*  *I realize that human listeners don't actually manipulate equations in their heads. I use the mathematics just to describe the underlying neural computation. "
1222,Can curiosity be described as an emotion?,"Can curiosity be described as an emotion?   On one hand it is definitely an emotion in the sense that is a feeling. IT feels like you want to know something. Furthermore, it can be pleasant or unpleasant according to the circumstances. So there is a basis for thinking that I could. I am wondering if there are good arguments on why it would be problematic to define curiosity as an emotion?  "
1223,The limits of fear: Could one really survive an encounter with the Alien?,"Please help me out in my effort to better understand the emotion of extreme fear. I will use the example of Ridley Scott’s film “Alien” featuring H.R. Giger’s Xenomorph preying on the crew of the “Nostromo”.  While I believe that the cast and crew of “Alien” did an excellent job in portraying the emotions of the humans during their encounter with an unmentionably vicious and seemingly unstoppable predator in the horrific solitude of space, I keep asking myself:  What are the limits to the fear a human mind can deal with before descending into insanity or causing the individual to enter a stupor? Would a real human being in the shoes of Ellen Ripley be able to survive and preserve her sanity?  Additional questions I don’t seek explicit answers to but which might inform and elucidate my main query are:  How long and how far can adrenaline keep the body and mind alert before fatigue compels a human to rest and sleep regardless of the imminence of existential danger?  Can a bizarrely strange and tremendously terrifying situation effectively neutralize the survival instinct, e.g. by overwhelming the capacity of the mind to process new information and resulting in the individual being awe-struck and incapable of either fighting or fleeing?  Could a certain type of psychopath – because of lack of fear and empathy as well as being out of touch with reality – be significantly better suited to surviving the encounter with such a monster?  Could a (nearly) complete lack of imagination (as a non-deviant character trait) mitigate the adverse effects of fear a person would experience in such a situation? Conversely, would a highly impressionable person succumb and collapse more easily?  Is there a correlation between a sudden and surprising threat and the will for struggle, on the one hand, and a repetitive, “banal” mortal danger from the point of view of helpless people and inertness and lack of resistance, on the other? To clarify: Am I more likely to be able to muster my strength and fight back an enemy, however terrible, that just attacked for the first time, than somebody or something that I have seen methodically, mercilessly and effortlessly destroy all around me?   P.S. As I am inexperienced in neuroscience, I am not completely sure I have used the correct tags. "
1224,Is the Resting Potential and Action Potential Thresholds the same across all neurons in a network?,Does the action potential and resting potential of a given neuron differ from another neuron within the same network or is it constant? If not what determines and affects these potentials and can they change overtime? If so what factor contribute to this change and how? 
1225,Where would a cognitively separated person get their brain signals excited from?,"I suppose there's nothing wrong about the idea that a cognitively separated person could cognitively function as anybody else. But brain as I understand it always needs a potential from some sense. If I suddenly lost all my senses and my brain would stop working for a second would I be able to recover my brain activity?   Otherwise, the brain keeps the same electrical impulses running in the brain so you can't really think of anything new, right? I am really interested just in the way the brain creates new electrical potentials, ""just on his own."" "
1226,Are there studies that compare the accuracy of forecasters that are asked to state probabilities vs. forecasters that are asked to state odds?,"The Good Judgement project asks it's forecasters to estimate the likelihood of events occurring by asking them for probabilities (20%, 60%...). Sport betting usually communicates the odds of an event (1:4, 2:3).   Is there any research done to see whether forecasters using either method make better predictions? Whether either method leads to a lower Briers score? "
1227,Do STDP synapses potentiate AND depress at the same time?,"Do STDP synapses potentiate and depress at the same time? Consider the following scenario where two cells are connected by an STDP synapse: PRE and POST. PRE cell fires two action potentials 2 ms apart (A and C below).     Cell POST fires an action potential (B) equally between the two spikes of the PRE cell. Assuming the STDP curve is symmetrical, would this situation result in no net change of the synaptic weight?  It seems that since B occurs shortly after A, then that would potentiate the synapse. And B occurs shortly before C, then that would depress the synapse by an equal amount. Thus resulting in no net change.   Is it correct, that both depression and facilitation takes place in an STDP synapse simultaneously? "
1228,Official Color-Emotion relations,I'm trying to find colors that trigger different sort of emotions for people. I keep finding different answers for different colors.   Ex.

I'm thinking something like quantified-mind.com but for android. The closest I've been able to find is Brainturk Brain Training, but there doesn't appear to be a way to export results.  It's similar to this question, but for the android: Are there any cognitive test (or test suites) available on the iPad?  My 4 main criteria are (like here):   app should simply measure cognitive or mental skills/abilities, as opposed to training or improving them measurement methods used in the app should be as close to scientific as possible (a lot of game apps failed this requirement)  the tests should take as little time as possible (preferably under 5 min) have a way to export data (e.g. into csv)  "

1235,Spontaneous emotional bonding in traumatic events,"First off, I know next to nothing about cognitive sciences, but I experienced something today that got me curious. So please forgive me for maybe not being able to express my questions adequately.  Today I was driving around with a friend of mine quite late when we passed someone in the bike lane who turned out to be a guy and a girl (probably around my age. I'm 24.) who had crashed while riding a bike down a hill, with her sitting on the handle bar. (Her shoe was completely entangled in the spokes of the front wheel.) The guy was lying unconsciously on the ground, just beside the bike, bleeding heavily from the head, gasping for air, while she was standing next to him with blood all over her face in some state of shock. My friend called 911 and ran off to find a street sign for them to locate us.  (I am trying to shorten this story a bit, but I am still quite shaken by the experience, so I am having a hard time extracting the parts that are relevant to my questions.)  Some other people came by in a car and got out to help, while the guy - totally unresponsive - managed to stand up. They got him to sit down against a fence, still unable to communicate. At some point we realized that they did not speak Danish (we're in Denmark). While the other passersby tried to care for the guy, I got the girl's shoe out of the wheel, because I noticed she was walking around with no shoes and it's quite cold. When I tried to give them to her, she just hugged me. She just hugged me really tight, with her face against my chest, shaking and hyperventilating.   When the police and an ambulance arrived, we were still standing about 5 meters from the guy, still hugging, while everyone else was helping the guy. At this point, she spoke a full sentence for the first time, asking ""Is he okay?"". I told her ""I think so."" and I think at this point she realized what had happened, because it made her cry audibly for the first time during the episode. I imagine she could be blaming herself for the accident. If her foot hadn't gotten in the wheel, they wouldn't have crashed. I asked her if she wanted to go to the ambulance, she said yes and I walked her to it.  Fast forward half an hour. We drove off after talking to the police, and while sitting in the car still shaking, I noticed a strange feeling accompanying the shock of the experience. I felt, and still am feeling (it's about 3 hours ago now) some kind of strange bond with these people. I have never been involved in an accident like that before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I am left with - first of all - a feeling of wanting to meet them again. Not only to see if the guy is all right, but actually, genuinely wanting to get to know them. Second of all, something about the girl hugging me like that, really affected me. It's almost as if I'm experiencing something kind of similar to the feeling of being about to fall in love with someone. Some kind of unexplainable connection. I am quite aware that what I am experiencing only resembles the felling of being in love, and how irrational this is, hence my wondering.   Firstly: her behavior during the incident. What cognitive processes could cause her to seek this kind of comfort in a stranger, while her friend is sitting 5 meters from her, bleeding heavily from the head. It seems like a peculiar reaction to me. Secondly: what cognitive processes could cause me to feel this strange one-sided bond with them? Especially the girl. Why would someone feel like they're  falling in love with a person they don't know, and have only ever spoken a couple of words to, after such an incident?  What effect does that kind of traumatic event have on the forming of emotional bonds between people, during the event?   I would love to know more about this, so if you know of any studies or literature of any kind, please let me know. "
1236,"Do many people have an ""Accompanying Voice"" - an equal they converse with?","A hypnosis professional told me this is true, so I am asking: is it a fact of psychology that many people have a voice that they talk with ""in their head"" which talks back to them and helps solve problems? I find that this voice often has a perspective I never had and presents ideas I had not thought of. But it does not just tell me what to do. When I really get in a fix, it backs off and lets me solve the problem ""by myself"". I am about 50 and it has been there as far back as I can recall.  Is it common to have an ""Accompanying Voice"" and conversations where both voices appear to have equal standing and independence? Is there research which shows this is something other than a hallucination? (After all, an internal monologue is not a hallucination. Why not have two voices in your mind?) The prevailing idea is that voices are hallucinations, but it seems that they could just be parts of the self. This is a cornerstone of Transpersonal Psychology, which uses a dialog method to help people improve self-awareness and solve inner issues.  Addition: Here is some info from a site about this topic, although it does not address my question directly:     Because of prevailing attitudes psychiatry and within society as a   whole, it is important to point out, that there are many people who   hear voices who can cope with their voices and regard them as a   positive part of their lives. Neither is it the case that voices have   always been regarded as a negative experience, throughout history and   even today there are people who hear voices who find their voices   inspirational and comforting.      These are facts, that on the face of it are hard to square with the   negative way that the experience is regarded by psychiatry.   More Addition: Here is a bit about the Voice Dialog technique used in Transpersonal Psychology:     Voice Dialogue Technique   The Voice Dialogue technique allows a client   to gain a deeper sense of inner wisdom and gives them the opportunity   to identify and examine the voices within. Being armed with this   powerful knowledge provides a greater resource from which the client   can draw upon when faced with difficult circumstances. The Voice   Dialogue guides a client into realizing that there are parts of their   inner being that propel them, but they are separate from those parts.   They begin to understand that they are made up of many parts and each   serves a function and has an energy force that sustains it. With this   awareness, a client is able to create a balance among all of his   corresponding and correlating parts and can determine which ones to   silence and which ones to accentuate.      The ""Aware Ego"" in Voice Dialogue   In Voice Dialogue, this heightened   sense of awareness is referred to as the ""aware ego."" An aware ego is   not a trait that one possesses, rather it is a process by which we   begin to know all of the layers of our consciousness on an intimate   level. Because there is an negative for every positive, the aware ego   assumes that you can experience both the beneficial part of your   consciousness and its opposite. With enough insight into your own   identity, you can choose freely which one will serve you better, and   can adjust, alter, and align the parts within to meet your goals for   healing.   To me, this is about using a process which gets underneath assumptions, especially unconscious ones. The biggest assumption is that we are one singular thing that is consistent and understandable. Not So. But we can become master of ourselves. "
1237,Do we have a sub- or super-unconscious?,"Being conscious (awake) and unconscious (asleep) are two mutually exclusive states.  The boundary between them (""falling asleep"") is very pleasant. Why?  Conscious => Unconscious  Some people say sleeping is their favorite thing (or one of); but it's not really sleeping that they love, because they are unconscious and thus unaware of the state they're in; it has to be the boundary between the two that they love so much.  Going the other direction (waking up) is not usually so pleasant. Why not?  Conscious and subconscience are two coexisting areas:  Conscious ------------ Subconscious   e.g., our conscious may realize that the light turned red before we got to the intersection, while our subconscious is noting that the tree on the corner was trimmed yesterday. It may be that we have a ""superconscious,"" too - known as ""intuition"" or such.  But what about in our unconscious state - is there a sub and/or super unconscious, like so:  Superunconscious ---------------- Unconscious ---------------- Subunconscious   ?  If so, which or both? Is that where our dreams live? And why is it that in that part of our unconscious (the dream state) we sometimes seem to have no conscience?  Do we have a subunconscious and/or a superunconscious?  When we cross over from consciousness to unconsciousness, do we ever go straight into the dream state, or is a dreamless unconsciousness always achieved first (we have to get to the dream state from the unconscious state)?  BTW, I realize that dreaming is referred to as a state, but it is not mutually exclusive to unconsciousness (you are dreaming while you are unconscious/sleeping, not dreaming instead of sleeping). "
1238,Does work exist on relative valuations versus numeric valuations?,"I've been trying to use Google Scholar to find something on this issue, but I fear I may not have found anything due to using incorrect terms. I am looking for any work which looks at rating systems and people's use of them (I hope this is the right forum). We are all familiar with the idea of rating things numerically, like out of a scale of 5.   But it is also possible for people to rate things relatively ie A > B and B > C. Other preferences can then be inferred, ie A > C.   In certain instances, where people may be reluctant to provide low ratings, these relative valuations may therefore be useful. I am wondering if this is something which has been looked at in any work that anyone knows of? Is 'relative valuation' the correct term for this? "
1239,Do dissatisfaction with a job and relationships share the same mental mechanism?,"The modern world has two new ways of finding abundance of employment and relationships:   Job boards, career sites and recruiters for finding jobs Online dating sites for finding dates   While seemingly different, they share a couple similarities ~ 20% top performers and 20% top attractive people have really easy time finding the next job or romantic partner.  For example, a talented engineer working at Apple may have 50 recruiters knocking on his door, trying to ""poach"" him to the next hottest job or startup. An attractive woman on Tinder would match with just about any guy she wants and be swamped with messages from guys. Both of these people can find a great (but not perfect) job or a partner easily  From what I've been reading and observing, the ease with which the needs for job/partner can be fulfilled by top percentile of people makes these people devalue the experience. The good things are overlooked once negatives start to show up. This can make a person experience rapid build up of dissatisfaction with the current situation and want to ""trade up"".  This makes me ask: Are the experiences of dissatisfaction with job and relationships, as experienced by people who ""have it easy"" related? Do they use the same mental mechanism?  In a sense, this question is a continuation of this one: How long can a person stay happy, excited and motivated about something new? I'm asking if there's a universal mechanism by which a person starts to seek ""something better"" "
1240,How common are aromantics?,"(Aromantic means lacking romantic attraction to others.)  What percent of people are aromantic? While the percentage of people who are asexual seems to be 1%, I couldn't find anything on what percent of people were aromantic.  And a follow-up question: Is there a correlation between aromanticism and sexual orientation. E.g., are asexual people more likely to be aromantic than heterosexual people? "
1241,Is teacher guidance always necessary to become an expert?,"Is it necessary to have a teacher (or mentor/coach) to master every skill? What if I am taking an online tutorial with pre-recorded videos? Can I count that teacher training?  I have read the concept of deliberate practice and 10,000 hours of practice being needed to become an expert. But my question is whether these 10,000 hours need to be (partially) guided to receive personal feedback and/or coaching, or whether self-learning is sufficient? "
1242,Are the center surround receptive fields learnt or inherited?,"I know that neurons higher in visual pathways can learn their receptive fields after birth, but what about the connections between bipolar cells and Amacarine cells which form center/surround on/off receptive fields?

1244,Standardizing sales data with dollar market data within USA,"In the study of performance...  One approach to standardizing sales data across different regions of the country may be to adjust for the relative wealth/purchasing power of the clientele in a given region. For example selling 50k USD merch in Lubbock, TX is more impressive performance than selling 50k USD merch in Beverly Hills, CA. Although it is possible to use the cases in your sample to build your region-standardized variables, these sample-based estimates can be incredibly biased and in fact could penalize truly high-performing regions.  Does anyone know of a resource? data table? method? that could provide estimates of how dollars equate across major regions of the country... Maybe by zipcode? Maybe this is related to cost of living or median income of region? any ideas?  The more valid, transparent and defensible the estimates (e.g., govt resource), the better. -Thanks! "
1245,Does anyone know of any clinical psychology journals that use a double-blind review process?,"Through this question:   What kind of cognitive psych journals are receptive to clinicians without any publications?  I found out that a colleague of mine should submit a paper she is writing to a clinical psychology journal that uses a double-blind review process. For those who don't know, that means the reviewers don't know who wrote the article and vice versa.   However, I failed to find any such journal through googling.   My Question:   Does anyone happen to know of such a journal? I am looking for one that might accept an article (of a colleague of mine) written on ADHD, a learning disability.   If no such journal exists, what is the closest substitute that still uses a double-blind review process?  Note:   As I mentioned in the previous question, my colleague has developed a process model of the disorder based on 25+ years of clinical practice. She has used her model for several years now and is looking to publish her it to help others better understand the disease.  "
1246,Studies on games where optimal play involves losing for counterfactual gain,"Apologies for not knowing the nomenclature; I'll try to describe what I mean.  The optimal strategies for some imperfect information games involve purposefully doing badly in some cases, so that bluffs are more effective in other cases. You purposefully lose more in some lower margin subtrees, to create confusion in some higher margin subtrees and win more there.  I don't know if poker has this counterfactual property or not. We're talking about something a bit more twisted than just bluffing or hussling. I wrote a blog post describing an example game with this counterfactual property, if that helps.  Personally, I find this counterfactual property counter-intuitive. Intuitively I would have guessed that you should always try to do your best in every case. This intuition gets stronger (and wronger) when I think of it in terms of things that matter a lot (imagine trying to explain to someone that you're purposefully losing a war so that you could counterfactually win it more often in alternate histories! They'd arrest you on the spot!).  Has this particular possible disconnect between intuition and optimal play been investigated? Have there been studies checking if humans have difficulty following optimal strategies that involve losing for counterfactual gain? "
1247,What kind of Psychometric test is this,"I’ve taken this exam as a requirement for a job.  Unfortunately, I forgot what the exam was called. All I can remember is that the exam has 100 items grouped into five or four. Each group of five or four questions contains numerical, logical, and vocabulary questions.

1248,What is the situation called where a strong party uses logical reasoning based on a flawed foundation?,"I am interested in the  situation where two parties (people or organisations) differ in their commitment to exert power where party has more commitment to exert power than the other. The two parties have a dispute on some matter. The strong party builds an argument upon an erroneous point and with great rigour proceeds with some logical conclusions. The strong party is gladly involved in philosophical dispute concerning the validity of all links, but first. The initial point is sold as an axiom.   My question is twofold:   does this situation have name? What is the best strategy to deal with this situation for a weak party?  "

I am looking for existing research and theory around use of concept maps that is close to what I am thinking -- basically what research has already been done in the context of concept maps.  When I say ""concept map"", I am also open to other diagramming techniques like mind map, argument map etc.  Can you suggest some publications that I can read to understand what has been researched in the field on concept maps?

1253,Does Spaun's serial memory exhibit proactive interference and serial searching,"Xuan Choo recentely created a model of serial working memory for Spaun. Does this model of working memory exhibit the effects of proactive interference (as well as changing data types yielding freedom from proactive interference)? Additionally, does this model show signs of exhaustive serial search (the time for answering questions increases as the list gets longer)?

1255,Evidence of 'virtually limitless' long-term memory,"In his paper, 'What do People believe about Memory?', Professor Svein Magnussen of University of Oslo claims:     ... memory science is not aware of any limitation on the amount of information the brain is able to store and retrieve. Most classical papers on the memory for large amounts of information suggest that human long-term memory is virtually limitless.   Please can you provide evidence that well-supports this claim? "
1256,Brain Theory and Paradigm,"In this short piece, physicist Dmitri Krioukov makes the case that we must expect complex systems (such as brains) to reduce to simple physical systems. Furthermore, he cautions that the pure collection of increasingly-large quantities of data on the anatomy and physiology of brains can not be productive in itself; success can only proceed through forward inference from the appropriate theoretical models. In fact, data-collection is only useful at this point insofar as it prompts the formulation of correct theory and the abandonment of the current paradigm, which he compares to the Ptolemaic model of the universe prior to Copernican thinking.   My question then, is this: Assuming scientific brain theory must ultimately be continuous with philosophy of mind, is eliminativism of ""mental"" states and content sufficient and/or necessary in order to instate the paradigm that will create the basis for ""reverse-engineering"" the brain? If not, why not? If so, then what must be eliminated and how would you go about it? What, if anything, must replace the old concepts in order to (begin to) give a thorough account of human behavior and biology? "
1257,Conscious basis for gender identification,What conscious experiences lead a transgender person to identify with the opposite sex?   Physiology is clearly not determining. Sexual orientation is not determining (homosexuality). Clothing preference is not determining (cross-dressing).

1260,Is it fair to categorize the neurons in the output layer of artificial neural networks as grandmother cells?,"I'm interested in how memory is distributed in the brain. That inevitably leads one to think about grandmother cells.  Under my interpretation, a neuron (or a small ensemble) would classify as a grandmother cell, if it activates, without fail, whenever a specific stimulus is presented to a subject, over an extended period of time.  To my knowledge, there is no evidence for the existence of such neurons, except some experiments that show the activation of specific neurons for a short period of time between trial sessions. The last part is important, because to my understanding grandmother cells are explicitly about long term memory.  If I look at most artificial neural networks however, the cells in the output layer usually exactly fit this definition. You can easily train a network to recognize pictures of your grandmother and consistently find the exact same cells active during evaluation whenever such a picture is presented. That's important for a computer of course, because it needs to have a consistent way of telling something is learned.  This would be an important difference to the brain though, because one could argue that any system, involving grandmother cells and that has only a limited number of cells, eventually suffers from overfitting or at least very limited generality.  Is this assessment fair? Is my definition wrong, somehow? Did I miss some evidence? "
1261,When did the old term experimental reagent become experimental subject?,"I've read a paper on an experiment called ""The Feeling of Being Stared at"", which investigates a concept which on Wikipedia is called the psychic staring effect. It was first investigated by psychologist Edward B. Titchener in 1898.  The paper consistently refers to the experimental subjects as ""reagents"".      ""In some of the experiments, the distance between the experimenter and   reagent was varied for the purpose of...""   Page 3 of 6   I'm unfamiliar with this term to refer to subjects, and I assume it's because this is an old paper from 1913. My guess would be that the word means something or something that reacts, and subjects are subjected to stimuli. Is anyone familiar with this term being used generally in experiments around this time period or even today? And if so, when it fell out of fashion and replaced with what we use now: ""subject"". "
1262,"Is ""not going to doctor because of fear of illness"" a psychological disorder?","Some people don't like to go to the doctor because they are afraid of being diagnosed sick in medical examinations or being diagnosed exacerbated when they have an illness even they know if they don't treat the illness it will get worse.   A really large population of these kind of people exists, especially in Asia.  Is it a subtype of hypochondria? Or it is another psychological abnormality or even is normal? "
1263,What is the difference between an Atlas and a Parcellation?,"I come from a computer science background and am just starting out in the area of analyzing brain imaging data (fMRI predominantly) and while going through some of the literature, I am kind of confused about the difference between a brain atlas and a brain parcellation?

Or in other words, is it possible to correlate the process of assigning true/false with some particular feature of the brain? "
1265,Free-to-use parenting style questionnaire,"I'm working on a master's thesis in UX design that I might want to turn into a commercial project later on. The subject matter is use of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) in parenting.  For the research phase, as part of a screener, I want to get a sense of a person's parenting style. I've been looking for questionnaires on evaluating parenting styles and found the Parental Authority Questionnaire.  However, this questionnaire was made to be evaluated by children, not by the parents themselves. Is there an alternate questionnaire for them? Would I be able to use its questions in my screener?

1266,Nociceptor (possible threat signal),"I've read this on Wikipedia:     A nociceptor is a sensory neuron that responds to damaging or   potentially damaging stimuli by sending “possible threat” signals to   the spinal cord and the brain.   What is a ""possible threat"" signal? And, how is it different from a ""real threat"" signal in terms of the way they are transmitted? "
1267,Is Freuds theory of negation testable and does it survive testing?,"Freuds body of work not only provides a basis von clinical practice, but is also often quoted in social sciences and social philosophy. I recently came across a text that references Freuds concept of Verneinung (Negation):     Ein verdrängter Vorstellungs- oder Gedankeninhalt kann also zum Bewusstsein durchdringen, unter der Bedingung, dass er sich verneinen lässt. Die Verneinung ist eine Art, das Verdrängte zur Kenntnis zu nehmen, eigentlich schon eine Aufhebung der Verdrängung, aber freilich keine Annahme des Verdrängten. [...]. Mit Hilfe der Verneinung wird nur die eine Folge des Verdrängungsvorganges rückgängig gemacht, dass dessen Vorstellungsinhalt nicht zum Bewusstsein gelangt. Es resultiert daraus eine Art von intellektueller Annahme des Verdrängten bei Fortbestand des Wesentlichen an der Verdrängung.      A supressed element of thoughts or imaginations can surface in the conscious mind under the condition it can be negated. Negation is away of acknowledging the supressed, actually a repeal of the supression, but of course not an acceptance [...] By way of negation only one consequence of the supression is undone, that the content of the supressed does not become conscious. The result is a kind of intellectual acceptance of the supressed, while the supression mostly persists.   (German text wikipedia, translation mine)  Now my question is, is this aspect of negation testable (=falsifiable) in some way? What where results of such tests, if any? Absent tests that would satisfy a positivist, is there a body of experience from clinical practice that supports (or not) this theory of negation?  I'm aware that there's a lively debate about inhowfar psychoanalysis is  science or pseudoscience. Much of psychoanalysis is not falsifiable, but this specific aspect may be. "
1268,How is addiction distinguished from engagement when making a determination about a person's behaviour?,"Based on some discussions over on another StackExchange forum site over a particular question about user engagement vs. addiction, it was suggested that the question be posed on the Psychology and Neuroscience SE site because it seems to fall into this area of research and is appropriate for the experts in this field to provide an answer.  So the question, phrased slightly differently for this forum:     There have been some recent press about the computer game Fortnite   that has caused concern for parents of children that are spending   excessive time playing due to its seemingly addictive effect on   players (many of whom are young children).   Digital designers working on games often aim to increase engagement using strategies like gamification. Assuming that engagement with an activity involves some similar behaviour to those exhibited in addiction, how are those behaviours measured over time to identify at risk users (e.g. problem gamblers)?   Alternatively, if engagement and addiction are completely different behaviours, what are the differences that allows you to distinguish one group from the other? "
1269,"Visual field testing: Choose between Yes/No, 2AFC, and 2IFC task?","As a newbie to psychophysics experiment, I have a small project to do visual field testing on healthy, adult, naive subjects. The experiment stimulus is a small sine grating (0.3 degree, 6 cycles/degree) embedded in one of 25 possible locations in a noise background picture (18 degree). The orientation of the grating, and the contrast of background noise is fixed, and I need to measure the sensitivity (d') at 25 locations given a series of (probably 3) grating contrasts, and a series of stimulus exposure time (50,100,200,300,400 ms).   In a single trial, subject knows where the grating will be located, and maintains fixation at the center of noise background. Then the stimulus will be briefly presented (once in Yes/No and 2AFC, twice in 2IFC) for one of the stimulus exposure time, and subject need to judge whether the grating is present (Yes/No), or is located in which stimulus (2IFC and 2AFC). For a each unique combination of grating location, grating contrast and stimulus exposure time, I plan to do 16-20 repetitions to measure d'. So there are LOTS of trials.  I think this should be a mature experiment, but I am stuck on choosing between the following 3 experiment paradigms. The major problem is the time required to complete the experiment. I have run pilot experiments on all of them.   1-interval yes/no task. This task runs fast, but suffers from changing response bias. Is the response bias going to negatively affect d'? In signal detection theory, d' is insensitive to bias only when the variance of response to signal and signal+noise is equal. However, I don't know whether there is firm experimental evidence to support this. 2AFC task. This task comes from a suggestion in textbook. Instead of presenting one cue of target location on each trial, I can present two cues that is symmetric around fixation point, and subject need to judge which cue location has the grating. The task assumes that human visibility map is central symmetric, and effectively cut the number of locations to half, so it runs even faster than the Yes/No task. However, it is rarely used in literature about visual field testing, what might be the potential drawback? 2IFC task. I see many literatures doing this, but it is the slowest one (more than double of the time for Yes/No). What's worse, because the stimulus is brief presented, and the interval between them is short (400 ms), sometimes subjects report that they ""see the stimulus but forget which interval has it"". So in some of our pilot data, the sensitivity at fovea is lower than in near-peripheral, because subjects had made an error. How do psychophysical researchers overcome the problem of subject error, and the problem of long, boring experiment?   Thanks for any help. "
1270,Is the perception of drawings an acquired skill?,"Most descriptions of visual perception explain how our brains interpret incoming visual stimuli (via feature detection, monocular depth cues, etc.). They then assume that the same process works for interpreting drawings, by which I mean 2D illustrations of objects.  However, there seem to be some cultural differences in the way 2D images are interpreted: for example, the fact that less ""literate""/""developed"" cultures perform better with the Muller-Lyer illusion (as mentioned here).  Taking this idea further, my parents, who lived in a rural area in India, knew one person who had never encountered pictures and couldn't interpret them. It wasn't in her culture. If one showed her a picture of a pig, she wouldn't be able to make out it was a pig, or even an animal. To her, it was just a set of lines on a sheet of paper. I know that story is anecdotal, and several things are unclear (such as whether it worked for photographs vs illustrations, etc.). However, my question is: Is this possible?  Is the ability to interpret drawings a universal one, or is it a skill that (most) people acquire the same way as language or writing? Is there any research on this topic I can read up on? "

1272,Why some papers suggest that losses and gains are coded by the same mechanism while other suggest that distinct circuits anticipate gain and loss?,"In this paper, it states that ""Consistent with neuroimaging evidence suggesting that distinct circuits anticipate gain and loss,..."" However in this paper, it states ""..., these results are consistent with the conclusion that losses and gains are coded by the same mechanism rather than by two separate mechanisms.""  Both papers are from reputable journals and well-cited. So why are there these two contradictory statements? Is it because the papers are in different contexts? (The statements themselves seem to be general statement though.) "
1273,What is the human brain made of?,"I read an article that stated that the human brain contains 60% fat. Is this fatty tissue structural building material? Or does it just serve as an energy source for the mitochondria?   Since our body are also made out of 70% water, is there also a water in our brain?   And the most important question I want to ask is: what percentage of the brain is actually a neuron?  "
1274,How to answer questions that don't seem to be possible to be answered on a Strongly disagree - Strongly agree scale and what's their point?,"I'm continuously being perplexed by psychological tests that display a lot of questions that don't seem to be able to be answered in a simplistic ways, but nevertheless simplistic answers are demanded.  I was subjected to such tests a few times in my life already. Each time the questions were a major challenge for me... until, out of necessity, I was stopping caring about the accuracy of the answers. Instead, I was giving rough estimations, feeling these estimations are almost meaningless.  As an example, I was once subjected to a test whether I was aggressive, submissive, assertive, or manipulative. The test contained questions like ""do I think cunning is an effective way to get what one wants""? Do I think so? Yes, I think it is an effective way insofar people were able to trick me a few times in my life. Do I do this? I try not to and I don't even think I'm any good at it. Nonetheless, such questions clearly contribute to showing that I'm manipulative.  For an other example, let's take the Dark Factor test. We have here questions like:   Most people deserve respect.   My problem with this questions is that, as far as I'm aware, there are many definitions of ""respect"". How am I supposed to answer this question without knowing what definition of respect we're talking about?   The innate respect that, according to many moral theories, is an indefeasible privilege of every human being? The respect that is defined as a person's trustworthiness or ability to perform their duty?  The respect that stems from fearing other person?   All 3 definitions entail radically different answers on my part, including an ""I don't know, I'm not strong enough in philosophy to be able to answer this"" in the first case.  Or another question. ""It is sometimes worth a little suffering on my part to help others in need."" Is it? I believe yes. Can I? Sadly, rarely. Which of these two answers should I give?  Another category are questions like these two: ""It’s wise to keep track of information that you can use against people later."" and ""I feel sorry if things I do upset people."" Here, however, my problems with these questions border critiquing the test itself, so I wonder if I'm not falling to the trap of arrogance. Namely, I have a feeling (maybe very wrong) that this test here treats what is not necessarily immoral as if it was. Is it wise to keep track of information that can be used against people later? In most circumstances likely no. But there are situations when this course of action is both necessary and perfectly ethical, I suppose: to protect oneself from these people anticipated unwarranted attacks. Do I feel sorry if I do things that upset other people? This depends on circumstances even more. If I win a sport match I'm likely to upset my opponents: does my attempts to win a fair game make my personality have dark traits? Escaping one's mother's overprotectiveness is likely to make her even more upset: but as far as I can tell, the psychologists' theories were that it is most healthy and necessary to do this. Nonetheless, I have a feeling that a positive answer to such a question would make one's personality darker in the results.  Could someone explain to me what's the point of such questions and how to answer them? "
1275,Word for person showing psychological projection,Is there any single word for a person who shows more psychological projection (the defence mechanism of attribution of your own undesireable qualities to someone else) than a normal person? And is there a specific term for such condition?Wikipedia link everydayhealth.com  Let me explain my question. A person showing extreme self importance is called a narcissist. So what do we call a person who shows extreme projections? 
1276,how does our brain knows the simialrities between anything?,"If I see your face today then I will recognize you if I see you tomorrow. There must be something similar will happen in my brain for both incident, since the inputs to my body/brain is similar(at least some). So, that means the brain is clustering things/Inputs and I don't force the brain to cluster your face view, this happens automatically. Or may be the brain can calculate how much similar these two views of your face. anyway,may be I am completely wrong.  But the question is then how it does? and It applies for any type of sensor input to our brain.  edit: yeah, it should be more specific. I am talking about neocortex.when some similar incident happens then similar regions in neocortex will active, but how does the brain calculates the similarities? it's like the brain can calculate the similarities between two groups of networks. And I trust this site more than others so I'll ask things here. "
1277,The role of high-performance in neuropsychology,"As far as I understand, neuropsychology gains most of its insights from the reconciliation of lesions of the brain and cognitive impairments. Normal functioning (both of the brain and the mind) plays a less important role in neuropsychology.  My question is:     Which role does cognitive high-performance play in   neuropsychology? Are there attempts to map cognitive high-performance processes to neurophysiological structures and processes? Some examples would be great.   Examples of cognitive high-performance:   eidetic memory (e.g. Stephen Wiltshire) memorization of pi (e.g. Akira Haraguchi) mental calculators (e.g. Gert Mittring) speedcubing (e.g. Lucas Etter) advanced mathematics advanced chess playing   The mere fact that for such high-performers there are possibly enlarged (and internally more strongly and probably more specifically connected) areas of the brain (and connections between them) is not what I am looking for. Especially for the more mathematical and intricate cases there must be more than that.  The main difference between neuropsycholgy by impairment and neuropsychology by high-performance seems to be that in the former case you can more easily perform statistical studies (but also single-case studies), in the latter case you can only perform single-case studies. "
1278,To what extent is it true that both too much stress and too much relaxation lead to mental shortcuts?,"Sometimes rational thought seems to be bypassed in the brain for more automatic behaviour (shortcuts, instinct, intuition, heuristics):   In The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal she writes that high stress can cause automatic 'fight-or-flight' behaviour, which causes the prefrontal cortex for rational thinking to be bypassed. Relaxing yourself can help in reversing the process and becoming more rational again. She calls it the 'stop-and-think' response. In Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman he writes that when someone feels confident that there are no threats facing him their system 2 (rational system) becomes lazy, 'cognitive ease' and starts to depend on heuristics too much.   So, apparently mental shortcuts happen both in situations of high stress (fight or flight) and in situations of confidence and relaxation (cognitive ease).  Question: To what extent is it indeed factually true that both too much relaxation and too much stress can cause mental shortcuts? Please elaborate... "
1279,Does increased neural complexity slows down brain operation speeds?,"If a sensory input is perceived, one needs to process this input from the sensory end organ (sensation) up to the brain (perception). Does a more more complex neural network consume more time than a simple one? For example, does a house fly process visual images faster than a human being?  "
1280,What challenges the ideasthesia balance theory has to answer?,"Ideasthesia ""can be defined as a phenomenon in which activation of concepts produces phenomenal experience"". The examples vary from the Kiki/Bouba phenomenon applied to (possibly) everyone to actually seeing colors in graphemes like in synesthetic people. According to the theory, ""there is a strong similarity between semantics and sensations"".    Figure: Sensation vs. meaning balance shown for hypothetical pieces of entertainment (red), art (yellow) and science (white), as they are broken down into their components. Only an art piece is consistently located in the gray area.  Given that this theory is pretty young (first creation in Wikipedia was in 2012 by presumably one avid contributor on the field, based on their username), I wonder if there are any review or critic on the theory. What challenges does it need to answer? Which theory is it incongruent with?

1281,Does the Perception that Stress Affects Health Matter? The Association with Health and Mortality,"I recently came across the following paper:  Keller, A., Litzelman, K., Wisk, L. E., Maddox, T., Cheng, E. R., Creswell, P. D., &amp; Witt, W. P. (2012). Does the perception that stress affects health matter? The association with health and mortality. Health Psychology, 31(5), 677.     This study tracked about thirty thousand adults in the US for 8 years   and they started by asking people ""How much stress have you   experienced in the last year?"" They also asked, ""Do you believe that   stress is harmful to your health?"" And then they used public death   records to figure out who died. They found that people who experienced   ""a lot of"" stress over the past year had a 43% increased risk of   dying, but that was only true for the people who also believed that   stress is harmful to their health. People who experienced a lot of   stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die.   In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study,   including people who had relatively little stress. The researchers   estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,00   Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that   stress is bad for them, which is over 20,000 deaths a year. If that   estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you,   the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year, ...   [From: Psychologist Kelly McGonigal's TED Talk: How to make stress your friend, Sep, 2013]  Now, my questions is: ""Is this study confounded?"" I think the way they have measured ""How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"" highly depends on the reference point defined individually for the subject. I may see an event as very stressful, and someone else may see the same event as not stressful at all. [For more information about refernce point, please look at: Kahneman, D., &amp; Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica: Journal of the econometric society, 263-291.] On the other hand, they have asked: ""Do you believe that stress is harmful to your health?"" Again answering this question is very subjective depending on the same reference point.  Counter example: imagine subjects A has experienced so much disaster in their life that they have seen very negative health effects of stress. On the other hand, subject B has not experienced that much stress in their life. To both subjects, last year was highly stressful. Obviously, highly stressful for subject A means a complete disaster, and for subject B means a little worse than other years. When you ask them ""Do you believe that stress is harmful to your health?"", obviously, subject A responds yes because they have experienced very negative health effects, but subject B who has not experienced that much stress in their life would probably say no. Now, subject A will probably die earlier than subject B. Could you argue that dying earlier is because of believing stress is bad for you?  I believe this study is loosely measuring a correlation, and they cannot conclude a causal effect in this way. Please let me know if I am missing any point or I do not understand what they have done. "
1282,What are the different theories about how the brain processes speech?,"When we heard speech the brain needs to go through a series of steps to go from the received sounds to a mainly conceptual meaning that follows from the words involved. This involves solving a series of problems along the way like moving from sounds into phonemes, then to words and to sentences, to a possibly holistic meaning of the whole speech. How does the brain solves this problem?  I was told there are many theories, but I don't have any names, except what some people call ""the oscillatory theory of speech perception"" of which I could not find much literature. Do anyone know books and papers that cover this topic, presenting different theories of speech perception, including this ""oscillatory"" theory?  I will greatly appreciate any linked books and papers. "
1283,Any attempts at testing or modeling the 'cognitive conception' of language?,"For those unfamiliar, the 'cognitive conception of language' refers to a claim made by some theorists that, in the words of Carruthers:     ""besides its obvious communicative functions, language also has a direct role to play in normal human cognition (in thinking and reasoning).""   I've found such accounts extremely intriguing, especially that of Daniel Dennett (1994), who basically claims that language is what turns our massively parallel brain into a decent serial processor.  However, I'm distressed that such discussions are generally tethered to the Philosophy of Mind and despite my efforts, I've yet to come across any empirical evidence or cognitive models that are for or against such hypotheses.  So, do such studies exist (or are underway)? Or is there something fundamental to this subject that keeps it only in the realm of armchair discussion?  References   Carruthers, Peter (2002).

1284,What is the current status of tetrachromacy in humans?,"Tetrachromacy is a condition of having four colour channels. There is a hypothesis that some women posses 4 different types of cone cells (each with different opsin responsible for different absorption spectrum) and can process them.   Despite some initial research (e.g. Jameson et al.,  Richer color experience in observers with multiple photopigment opsin gene (2001)) I have found surprisingly little follow-ups.   What is the current status of tetrachromacy in humans? Is it sufficiently confirmed by the experiment, refuted or unresolved?   I am aware that among medical researchers positive 'deviations' can attract less attention than deficits or diseases. Moreover, they may be more prone to methodological mistakes as it is easier to measure deficits against standard criteria.  "

1287,How does the brain act on the information gained via eye saccades?,"I've often heard that the process of saccading can be described as a statistical sampling technique. Specifically, the standard textbook definition of the function of saccades seems to be that the field of vision is too complexity to known in its entirety, so we look at a representative sample of it in order to form a generally adequate representation.  But this conceit seems to be made purely on a loose analogy to much more well defined problems than vision (e.g. anything soluble via Monte Carlo Method), and in the perception literature I haven't found any proposed mechanisms by which this integration of sampled information could occur.  So my question is this: If eye saccading is best thought of as a sampling process, then how does he brain integrate the sampled information? And if not, then what are some viable alternatives to how the brain makes use of the sequence of images producing via saccading?  "

1289,Is positive self-talk beneficial for those with low self-esteem?,"According to the paper Positive Self-Statements: Power for Some, Peril for Others by Wood (2009) positive self-talk is beneficial when the person has a reasonable level of self-esteem in the statement, but harmful when they don't. The PsychCentral article, ""Got Low Self-Esteem? Don’t Ditch the Positive Self-Talk Just Yet"" by Summer Beretsky points out a few issues with the methodology:   Limited sample size Short ""bursts"" rather than more concentrated time to convince themselves Not controlling for whether they believe in the statement they are proclaiming   Are there any other studies that deal with these issues?

1290,Are spaced flashcards effective for learning?,Several apps and sites offer flashcard-based learning that repeat the cards you do poorly on over a period of time (the more inaccurate the answer the closer to each other the repetitions are). One example of this is Super Memo.   Is there rigorous empirical support for these types of flashcard systems working? Do they exploit a known function of memory?  
1291,Does Facebook activity predict job performance?,"I've seen a little bit of discussion in the media about  Facebook being used in selection and recruitment settings.  Assuming an employer can gain access to a person's Facebook profile, have any scientific studies been conducted to assess the following questions:   Does Facebook activity predict job performance? If so, what does Facebook activity measure as seen by correlates with existing scales (e.g., personality, intelligence, integrity, etc.)?  "
1292,Do we understand the non-subjective mechanisms behind pleasure and pain?,"If we are to view pleasure and pain as being essentially synonymous with the more mechanistic concept of reward and punishment (i.e. as a part of learning and motivation system) then do we understand how this actually occurs at a neurobiological level?  At least in ""lower"" animals, pain seems to simply cause an aversion response. Pain motivates the animal to stop whatever it was doing (possibly stopping the pain), and to avoid in the future repeating similar responses to those that preceded (and therefore were possibly causal toward) the incident that caused pain.  This sort of thing is not that hard to replicate in computational models, so it is clearly nothing magical.  Obviously, the subjective ""experience"" of pleasure and pain gets more into philosophy of mind and that's not what I am asking about. I am only concerned about the mechanism which can explain outwardly observable behavior -- especially in simpler animals -- such as the basic stimulus-response-reward/punishment learning that a mouse or bird can do.  Do we understand the mechanism by which a pain signal causes the brain to suppress recently followed decision paths, and a pleasure signal causes the brain to reinforce them?  Or is this still completely mysterious at this time? "
1293,Is dissociative identity disorder a medical condition or artifact of psychotherapy?,"The popular media has offered such examples as ""Eve"" (based on Chris Costner-Sizemore) and ""Sybil"" (based on Shirley Ardell Mason) as sufferers of dissociative identity disorder (at one point known as multiple personality disorder).  Doctors and psychotherapists have wrestled with how to help patients dealing with this diagnosis, but in reality, there is often doubt cast upon the validity of the symptoms.   Studies such as Boysen (2011) offer a retrospective analysis of the origins of symptoms and treatments presented in the literature in the 80s and 90s in an attempt to categorize the outcomes.  However, there's no comparison with control cases, i.e., those who may have faced persistent, horrible abuse or other similar situations and not developed symptoms of the disorder.    Are there recent case control studies that have been done in this area of research?  Is this careful retrospective analyis as far as we have progressed in determining whether these dissociative identities are a medical condition or artifacts of psychotherapy and popular press exposure?

1294,Positive and negative reinforcement and punishment effectiveness,"According to Skinner, positive reinforcement is superior to punishment in altering behavior.     As Skinner discussed, positive reinforcement is superior to punishment   in altering behavior. He maintained that punishment was not simply the   opposite of positive reinforcement; positive reinforcement results in   lasting behavioral modification, whereas punishment changes behavior   only temporarily and presents many detrimental side effects.    From the different combinations of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment and negative punishment, which has been shown to be the most effective in behaviour modification? Also, does combining stimuli like positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement, become more effective?  "
1295,Do the neural substrates behind motivation to retain/dispose of property govern whether certain people view their friends and partners as possessions?,"I'm trying to understand why people have sometimes have the ability to sever ties with valuable connections, e.g., people that have up until that time meant a lot to them.  Colloquially, people use the term ""throw it all away"", and I'm wondering if there's any truth to that.  Hoarders, on the other hand, can place a lot of value on objects that are generally considered to be refuse.     Looking into hoarding and it's associated disorders, I found some very recent information in Wang et al (2012) regarding some of the neural substrates of acquisitive behavior (which forms some of the physiological basis of hoarding).  These researchers found activation in the orbitalfrontal cortex (OFC), a common substrate of obsessive compulsive disorder, associated with acquisitiveness, and activation in the nucleus accumbens (a motor nucleus within the basal ganglia often associated with addictive behaviors) when possessive participants valued a popular ""hot"" item. There was also activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is associated with monetary valuation of a stimulus, during ""disposal"" of items that they had acquired during the experiment.  Firstly, is the treatment of people like property an earmark of any notable (Axis II or otherwise) DSM disorder?   Secondly, in the case where we assume those that do treat others as property to be acquired and disposed of accordingly, do these same anatomical regions in the OFC govern this behavior?       Wang, J.M., Seidler, R.D., et al (2012),The neural bases of acquisitiveness: Decisions to acquire and discard everyday goods differ across frames, items, and individuals.

1296,What are the purported mechanisms of eidetic memory and why is it comorbid with autism?,"Eidetic memory, often called ""photographic"" or ""flashbulb"" memory, is often associated with amazing feats of recall.  Is the mechanism behind this phenomenon an aberration of the visualization of a scene or the way that such visual information is encoded into long-term memory?  We often associate such accurate recall with those that exhibit savantism.  Kim Peek, the model for the character in Rain Man, is not autistic, but according to an overview article (actual reference pdf here), 50% of savants are autistic.  Is there any neurophysiological or anatomical reason why this might be true? "
1297,"How are hallucinations generated, is it related to dreaming?","I was thinking how powerful auditory and visual hallucinations must be, for the individual experiencing them to be unable to distinguish them from reality. I, personally, have not experienced a hallucination, but have experienced vivid dreams and know that when I'm dreaming it can seem real, and at that point, that is my reality (even though I am asleep).  Is there a correlation between the part of the brain responsible for dreaming and hallucinations?  What generates hallucinations, to make them indistinguishable from reality? "

I am specifically interested in discovering what sort of goals and behaviors collecting achievements encourage as opposed to collecting points.  How do end-users respond differently to these methods?  Or do they?  Taking Stack Exchange as an example, we could ask what sort of behaviors are we attempting to encourage with reputation as opposed to badges that require them to be separate entities?  "

1304,How can I incentivize users to perform creative tasks?,"Gamification is often used to incentivize people into performing small, repetitive tasks. For example, as a Stack Overflow user, I receive 2 reputation points for an accepted edit. I can earn badges by reviewing series of potentially problematic questions, etc. This seems to work fairly well since the user is given a reward for a easily achievable objective.  In contrast to this, what elements are required to incentivize users into performing creative tasks? Unlike with small 'assignments', a creative task bears the risk of not being solved satisfactory, therefore the user risks investing an effort without being rewarded.  Simply offering a higher reward introduces its own set of problems like having to deal with cheating, therefore my question:  How can I incentivize users to perform creative tasks (e.g., creating a new recipe)? "
1305,How can employee anxiety over poor evaluation be avoided by management?,"When implementing gamification, what are steps that management can take to prevent a culture of anxiety among employees, when employees feel they are constantly being monitored and begin to worry that they will be judged as poor performers at their work?  For example, employees may grow anxious over things like:   Ranking near the bottom of some leaderboard Having fewer badges than others Not being as excited about the gamification of their work as other employees   What should management avoid to prevent this kind of anxiety?  What can management do proactively to prevent such fears or put them to rest, without getting rid of competition altogether? "

1308,Do the brains of non-altruistic persons mirror the observed experience of suffering?,"Altruistic behavior can have different motivations: from the hope that the help you give will ultimately benefit yourself (social exchange theory) to a selfless wish to alleviate someone's suffering.  Selfless altruism is motivated by empathy. According to C. Daniel Batson, ""if you feel empathy towards another person you will help them, regardless of what you can gain from it"".  An observer experiences empathic concern when brain regions are activated in him that are similar to those activated in a person who is experiencing a particular sensation (cf. mirror neuron).  Do the brains of non-altruistic (selfish, egoistic) persons – i.e. persons who do not show altruistic behavior in the face of suffering – mirror the observed experience of suffering (and is this information simply ignored) or do their brains not mirror the observed emotions at all?  If selfish brains show mirroring, what hems altruistic behavior in selfish brains, or what facilitates it in selfless brains? "
1309,Are colors real?,"We know that we distinguish colors when they fall on our photo receptors in our eyes and neurons pass its signals to our brain to recognise them as the specific colors.  How accurate is it? For example, is there any experiment which can measure whether the color that we see is the real color that is reflected by that object?   I am thinking in terms of relativity. We might be interpreting a color red as red simply because our eyes and neurons and brain interpret it as red.  If this is the case there might be more colors than primary colors can make up which our eyes cant interpret it as a different color itself.  My question is, is there any experiment which can tell us the color we see is the only and real color which is reflected by the object? "
1310,How does the brain calculate velocity?,"How does the human brain calculate velocities? For example, when crossing a road and seeing a car coming towards you, how does the brain actually compute the rough velocity of the vehicle and your own maximum speed as you cross the road so as to judge that you can cross safely without using the relevant physics equations? I am interested particularly in the specific cognitive and/or neural processes and that level of detail rather than just the fact that the brain estimates distance and time taken to cross that distance.   N.B. This question is derived from an earlier post of mine which I was advised to split into two for clarity.  "
1311,How is the focal point determined when looking into a clear sky?,"When looking into a clear blue sky, no cloud, birds, trees or any object to give a frame of reference. When a person is actively looking, as opposed to day dreaming or gazing.  The sky goes for a long distance, and with uninterrupted view, and I guess the first question would be: -  At what point into the atmosphere can the human eye see (which is not a topic for this site), following this,    What I want to know; is at what point to the eyes come to rest and How is the focal point determined?  Another consideration is:  How can this be measured?  Would any attempt to measure this would involve putting a device between the eyes and focal point? "
1312,Cost of EEG devices suitable for neurolinguistic research,"What is the cost of an EEG device (electrodes and other indispensable hardware, software if available for standard office computers, or a whole package with a dedicated computer and software) that is of suitable quality for neurolinguistic research? My own attempts to find information on this were futile. The Wikipedia article quotes low-cost devices from US$ 100 onwards, but I'm guessing the very cheap ones are of rather limited use for research. There is also an OPenEEG project, but I'm looking for an out-of-the-box solution. The commercial suppliers I found online do not quote any prices.  I just need a rough estimate to what amount of money is necessary to do any publishable academic research, and how much solution for average research needs would cost - such as 500 Euros/Dollars, 1,000, 10,000...?

Then, I thought ""How did I know it would move in that direction?"". Being a programmer/game developer I know that to make an object move in a direction, you need to do trigonometry math, and I highly doubt that I can find the cosine and sine of a number in my head.   How did I know in which direction the object was going to travel?  Here is a diagram:  "
1314,Audio Inculcation and Learning,"Suppose I have an audio file of a lecture of a professor explaining something to be learned - a physics concept for example, and I listen to the audio file over and over again, much like how people listen to music while working.   How effective is audio inculcation - listening to an audio file over and over again, even though I'm doing something else and not actively listening to the audio - for learning? How does this affect the subconscious?  Can this tactic be used to change  behavior: For example, recording a voice of  saying ""Do not go on Facebook. Facebook is bad.,"" and listening it to it over and over again, much like one would do with music. "
1315,How to measure stress quantitatively?,"I am wondering what the most straightforward way is to measure stress levels objectively and quantitatively *, and specifically, cognitive load. I am open to suggestions, but my understanding is that pupil dilation and increased skin conductivity are good objective and quantifiable  measures of stress.   My question now is - is there an established opinion which of the two is the preferred method?   The thing is that skin conductance is relatively straightforward. An electrode or two suffices - too easy. Pupillometry, on the other hand, requires either cumbersome glasses or a head-mounted device, or, alternatively, a table-top device necessitating the subject to focus on a restricted field of view (otherwise the camera looses the pupil).  Given we are considering measuring children, an electrode would intuitively be better, as it can be secured firmly to a finger, it allows for easy instructions - 'don't touch it', and it is relatively robust to artifacts, given that puil recordings suffer from eye blinks.   Should we consider practical considerations only and choose skin conductance, or are there compelling reasons to use an eye tracker instead **?   *: we wish to avoid questionnaires due to time constraints **: we don't have money for both :-)   "
1316,Are the sides of the body associated with gender stereotypes?,"For example, creating an experiment in which the words ""male"" and ""female"" would be presented on the left or right side of a screen, and participants had to click a left button for ""male"" and a right button for ""female"" (and vice versa in a second group), would we find shorter reaction times when one gender was presented to a particular side of the participants' bodies?  Are there studies that have researched this? "
1317,Does reading a word without mentally vocalizing it inhibit your ability to comprehend?,"In speed reading, people are taught to read much faster by avoiding the common habit of mentally vocalizing the words in our heads.   Is mental vocalization an unnecessary habit that can be scraped away without inhibiting comprehension?   Or rather, is this common mental process of imaginary vocalization a vital step in the process of comprehension? "
1318,Why do we laugh more easily in social situations?,"I ate lunch and then played pool with a co-worker after lunch today at our office. We get along quite well and talk often. Yet while socially engaged, instead of professionally, I found myself laughing disproportionately at things that were only moderately funny. I did my best to suppress it because it would have been embarrassing to laugh too hard.  After we finished I returned to my computer and began to work on some programming tasks. A few minutes later my wife sent me a funny picture on social media. I could barely control myself and almost burst out loud laughing. Had I seen the image later on in the day I would have not almost gone into a laughing fit.  I noticed this behavior much more often as an adolescent in similar situations than I do now. It seems to be related to my comfort in social situations which has changed as I have grown older.  Why do we laugh harder and more often in social situations? Also, does suppressing laughter bottle it up? Why does this improve as we grow older?  (I may also be interesting to note that he is not my superior. I am a partner in the company and oversee him, so its not related to his having a higher social status in the workplace.) "
1319,Does the number of alternatives in a multiple choice question affect the learning output?,"I have built several apps in Norwegian about hunting, philosophy etc. Students use the app to learn a subject and test their knowledge before doing their exam. In current state i have one question with three alternatives, where one is correct. The student will be presented with the solution to the question after they have chosen the alternative, and not on the end of the test.   For example:  What is the the capital city of Australia?   Canberra Sydney Melbourne   I was wondering if anyone know if there is any research on if students learn more/less/equal by being presented with 4 alternatives instead of three.   For example:  What is the the capital city of Australia?   Canberra Sydney Melbourne Edmunton   Does this have any effect for learning, since it's less probable to just check the correct by chance. Maybe students have to do more active thinking since it's more alternatives to think about, and therefore learn more? "

1321,Why can't hemineglect patients be trained to actively pay attention to their neglected side?,"I'm still having a hard time understanding the symptoms of hemineglect, mainly because perception and attention has been two peas of a pod for most of my experiences.  A Scholarpedia article states that a hemineglect patient is likely to shave just one side of their facial hair (thus having left half of their beard intact).  I also know that while hemineglect patients have harder time attending to the side contralateral to the lesion location, external effort to bring attention to the contralateral side can bring attention to the contralateral side temporarily.  If that is the case and the patient is still familiar with the concept of body symmetry, then my question is:  Why doesn't the patient use their concept of symmetry to force themselves to pay attention to the contralateral side?   Is even the concept of bilateral symmetry affected, possibly because any memory of an object brought up from long-term memory also loses the contralateral side? "
1322,Differential equations in psychology,"I am wondering (and searching with no success) if there are any examples of differential equations in psychology?   I mean, no tutorial explaining what is differenetial equations or even partial differential equations, but a research (like in emotions or social psychology, or cognitive psychology) by psychologists that use these equations to model the data?   [update, 29.05.2016] Stack Community always reminds me that the quality of the answers depends on the question asked. Just as a good question is half of the problem. I'll try to make myself clear with an example. I thought about an article in psychology, say about cognitive dissonance, emotions, coping or else, that use differential equations to decribe phenomenon without invoking physics or chemistry or other hard science. Article by Deboeck &amp; Bergeman introduces pendulum model(Christiaan's comment). But I don't have to refer to physics when doing ordinary squares regression, so that's why I thought it is possible to use differential equations without explicite references to physical models.   June 2, 2016: I never suggested we could ""use differential equations without explicit reference to physical models"". I have always said the same: the mathematical interpretation of cellular processes has lost prominence (owing to further research). The biological processes obviously remain; the interpretation has not been able to hold.  Teresa Pelka "

1324,Effects of Game-based Learning on Motivation for Learning,"I have already asked this question here, but I did not receive my answer. I found this site a more appropriate place to ask it.  I found many studies discovering the impacts of game-based learning on motivation for learning.  For example, these papers  You can also find a summary of them in this book chapter.  However, it is still unclear to me if this motivation is for entertainment or for learning. I was wondering if there is any study showing that students who are adapted to this method of learning have a higher motivation to pursue learning in other forms. My concern is about long-term effects of this method of learning. What is the intrinsic reaction of K-12 students who have adapted to game-based learning when they start higher education in which game-based learning is not provided? Will they have a higher incentive to study? or a lower incentive, because they prefer to play games rather than studying? "
1325,Do we perceive contrast colour patterns easily because of adaptation?,"I can understand that colours are just manipulation of our brain to light rays of different wavelength and energy. We perceive patterns better at higher contrast. Do we perceive patterns better at high contrast because of adaptive processes in our brain, i.e., do we habituate to the colours?  For example, consider a black board; we find texts written by white chalk easier to see than if it was written by blue chalk. Is white chalk on black board a form of adaptation of our brain, or it is always preferred by the brain in comparison to blue? In terms of wave mechanics, the white chalk may cause greater disturbance in the light waves travelling from the black board to our eyes. Please don't consider the case of any eye defects.  "
1326,Information storage capacity of a neural network?,"I seem to remember reading about some equation that states the amount of information that can be held by a neural network with n neurons in it arranged in l layers, or something vaguely like that (n and l probably weren't even the letters in it.) Can anyone help me remember what I'm thinking of?  Note: The original title of the question was, ""What is the storage capacity of the human brain?"" But I realized that's not really what I wanted to know about.  (The brain is a very large neural network. So, if we have an equation for neural networks, we should be able to get an estimate of the information contained in the human brain's neural network.) "
1327,What is the relation of visual quality and distance from the central field of view?,"I have read somewhere that      Our visual perception degrades non-linearly with distance from the   fovea.

Also, is there a scientific reference stating the degradation of vision as a function of degrees in the field of view? "
1328,Is there evidence of a mechanism for transmission of instinct?,"DNA would seem to be the only candidate for propagating instinctual behavior, yet I find that not credible. DNA mainly codes for the production of protein structures (like enzymes) and is mainly about cellular mechanisms like respiration. It is said that we have 99% of our DNA in common with another primate (Chimpanzee? Do we behave much like them?) and that we have about 50% in common with plants (Carl Sagan said an Oak Tree) which would indicate that only cellular-level information is contained in DNA.  It is a mystery how tissues and systems arise, so it should be an even greater mystery how behavior could be somehow passed along in a mechanism for folding proteins. Is there any model that definitely links instincts to DNA, such that if the DNA is altered, the instinctual behavior changes? If not, are there any candidates for the actual mechanism of instinct transmission? "
1329,"Personality Models: The Big Five, the Seven Deadly Sins, and?","In Christian tradition, there are said to be ""seven deadly sins"": Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, and Pride.  In Catholicism specifically, there are sometimes said to be seven virtues, each sin having an opposite: Chastity, Temperance, Charity, Diligence, Patience, Kindness, and Humility.  In a sense, this is a personality model. (Each sin/virtue duality can be thought of as a spectrum, with the sin lying at one end, and the virtue at the other.

1331,Is it possible to bridge implicit and explicit memory?,"It is self evident, from the various studies of Skinner and Pavlov, that a traumatic - or one of a similar nature - experience possesses the tendency to reside within certain schemas through the processes of classical conditioning; exmpli gratia, one may experience unpleasant stings from a wasp ,and thusly bestow fear ( based on that of the pain derived from stings) upon all creatures with similar characteristics through generalisation. And, hence these conditions based upon the creatures may last for prolonged durations, depending upon the frequency and ""intensity"" of the exposure.   However, my question is: could there possibly be a way to bridge implicit memory with declarative in such a process similar to conditioning? So that, as one, for instance, endeavours to memorise a speech, a certain experience associated , despite the fact that the speech may have never encountered the memoriser, could massively boost one's ability to do so.   I acknowledge the fact this question may not only seem far-fetched and implausible but perhaps spawned from ignorance, yet, I am invariably pondering upon ways to increase one's memory a part from the traditional mnemonics and other strategies.   Is it possible to 'bridge' implicit and explicit memory? "

As the timer counts down, the competition gets stiffer - someone is bound to press the button before you. There's speculation that once the timer runs out the game is over.

1336,Could a painful stimulus be effectively used as a learning aid?,"In rats, the application of a painful stimulus has shown an increase in overall arousal and the ability to learn certain behaviours (The study is neatly summed up in this video: Motivation and Reward in Learning). The experiment with electric shocks is shown on the second half.  It is common sense that human beings would naturally avoid painful consequences, but the deliberate application of a noxious stimulus may also elicit a unconscious response, or conditioning, to avoid those behaviours, which would mean a faster learning rate.  Learning could also be improved because pain is an intrinsically meaningful response, while perceived failure is somewhat weaker and less imediate as a motivating agent.  Could small electric shocks, applied by another individual, or a computer program (maybe even self-administered), have any use in learning? At what specific tasks would this technique be more effective? "
1337,Ability to learn math and age of children,"Is age of children strongly related to ability to learn various mathematical topics (e.g., percentages, common fractions)?  I ask because many students in the elementary grades struggle with math concepts and have repeated failure experiences.  If these same children were given a rest and the topics introduced when they are a year or two or three older, would they learn the concepts more easily?  (This is a small facet of a larger question, not specifically asked, is the idea of filling young heads with as much knowledge as possible a good idea for the children who struggle with acquiring such knowledge.

1338,How can we realize when a sociological question is impossible to answer?,"In my language there is a famous common sense statement which tells the populations are swinging back and forth from one extreme to the other.   The idea behind is that, at a sociological level, the influence of many psychological factors (such as the dichotomous thinking and similar cognitive distortions) are leading the  populations to tend to big breaks and changements.   Would it be possible to investigate it from a sociological point of view? How can we realize when a sociological question is impossible to answer? "
1339,Is movement/activity level related to serotonin availability or reuptake rates in the brain?,"I'm aware of this research article that explores the relationship between motion and serotonin systems: 5-HT and motor control: a hypothesis.   Based on the article above, it seems to me that a ""very active"" individual would have serotonergic system firing rapidly throughout the day. Each step or motion would cause activity - Serotonin release in synaptic cleft, then reuptake.   I'm interested in what happens when such ""very active"" individual suddenly cannot perform as much activity every day due to a life change (sedentary job, bed bound in hospital, etc). What happens to the serotonin reuptake when the activity level is dramatically reduced for an extended period of time?   In particular, I'm interested if ""very active"" people have a ""very active"" serotonin reuptake system that clears Serotonin rapidly. Can this be a cause of depression or reduced mood when an activity level is reduced?  "
1340,How to reconcile contrast model (of similarity judgment) with anchor-and-adjust?,"Hastie &amp; Dawes (2009) claims that humans judge whether an instance belongs to a class using the contrast model, where ""we perceive similarity by making (very rapid) comparisons of the attributes of two or more entities whose similarity is being evaluated.""  (Hastie &amp; Dawes (2009).  Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, p. 106)  The book also claims that we often judge using an anchor-and-adjust strategy, considering one factor at a time because of ""our limited attention 'channels' and the selective strategies we have developed to deal with that cognitive limit.""  (p. 72)  Do we employ an anchor-and-adjust strategy when employing the contrast model, i.e., are we contrasting one feature at a time, most salient feature first?  Alternatively, are there situations in which we are forced to work with one variable at a time, but other situations in which we can simultaneously compare multiple variables?   "
1341,The mind as a state of matter or physical system?,"What examples of attempts to formalize a principled physical basis for consciousness and/or a general theory of the mind exist?  I read a fascinating ArXiV preprint last year called Consciousness as a State of Matter. In this paper, physicist Max Tegmark proposed a formalization of consciousness in terms of a distinctive state of matter he termed perceptronium. Tegmark concludes that we may identify conscious systems by use of six principles, which he bases on Tononi's integrated information framework (Tononi, 2008), which I provide primarily for illustration:   Information: A conscious system has substantial information storage capacity. Dynamics: A conscious system has substantial information processing capacity. Independence: A conscious system has substantial independence from the rest of the world. Integration: A conscious system cannot consist of nearly independent parts. Autonomy: A conscious system has substantial dynamics and independence. Utility: An evolved conscious system records mainly information that is useful for it.   (More accessible introductions may be found here and here.)  Formalizing consciousness and the mind?  Tegmark's theory is prototypical of a number of recent jabs at a viable, general theory of the mind defined as what we might call the physical system which causes behavior that I am very excited about. I am also familiar with the somewhat related How Can the Human Mind Occur in the Physical Universe? (Anderson, 2007) as well as the general field of ecological psychology and radical embodied cognitive psychology, e.g. Chemero (2009). Because the content theory behind all of these are so qualitatively different, I would say the common denominator is more methodological and scope-related than strictly empirical, however.  Specifically, these jabs appear to represent a move away from the near-universal dependence on linear models and non-overlapping research scopes, and towards more unifying theories of mind, cognition and behavior. I have some limited awareness of strictly methodological articles such as this recent Psych Methods article which proposes topology as a general tool for the purpose (Butner et al., 2014).   I find that these theories and methodologies, while often flawed in obvious ways (though not necessarily more-so than any others are), raise difficult questions that traditional theories and methodologies do not seem to allow for (Butner et al., 2014 discusses this in some detail). I would be very interested to know more about both general theories and methodologies similar to what I have referenced here, which I hope is sufficient to clarify this complex question.   Formal generalizations allow us to see our fields' otherwise isolated findings in a wider perspective, and allow us to identify the forest we may otherwise miss for the trees. For example, an extremely interesting question raised by Tegmark's formalization is the following quote from the the Medium article:     Tegmark points out that any information stored in a special network known as a Hopfield neural net [a type of neural network which Tegmark deems to satisfy his principles] automatically has this error-correcting facility. However, he calculates that a Hopfield net about the size of the human brain with 10^11 neurons, can only store 37 bits of integrated information.   I think this is a difficult problem for Tononi's content theory to solve in other ways than by claiming Tegmark is somehow not fairly representing the theory, and this line of reasoning potentially has serious implications for all information-based theories. It is often asserted that the brain has incredible computational power ... but we rarely formalize our understanding of what this means. What if we have it all wrong, and it's simply physically and/or mathematically impossible for such a computational system to exist?  Question  What examples of attempts to formalize a principled physical basis for consciousness and/or a general theory of the mind exist?  (Please don't feel discouraged from giving answers based on anything I have referenced. I would not say the information I have provided for anything besides Tegmark's theory constitutes a remotely sufficient answer, so they are fair game.)

1343,Evolution of laughter,"In one of his books (cannot recall title now) Konrad Lorentz (ethology study) describes the phenomenon of the appearance of a friendly smile as a spontaneous inversion of a warning grin. He does not make mention about laughter, though.   I am curious whether there is any work done on the evolution of laughter? Is there a connection with social organization? For example, crocodiles do not laugh.  Are there indicators on connections with a similar inversion mechanism as described above for the warning grin, e.g. a ""warning roar"" turning into laughter, for example? "
1344,Do distractors create false learning in multiple choice questions?,"I use quizzes in teaching, but have started to worry that they do more harm than good.  Here's why: We have all learned from ""the testing effect"" that the act of taking a test is part of the practice that leads to learning.  Say I give my students a multiple choice quiz, immediately after a lecture, to practice. And let's say question looks like this:  ""Who wrote The Blank Slate?  [] Steven Pinker  [] Jessie Pinkman  [] Mr Pink""  A student that did not pay much attention at class, may vaguely recognise the second name, so he checks the middle box and moves on.   Has the student now reinforced the incorrect option, and thus created a net negative learning?  And then, as a part two of the same question:  Does it make a difference if the test is done on the same day as the lecture, when the new knowledge is still fluent, or after sleep, when the new knowledge is consolidated (and weak memories culled)?  Part three: Does it make a difference if the quiz is on paper, and thus gives no direct feedback, or online, and can indicate the correct answer?  I have searched Google Scholar extensively, but not found anything on this. "
1345,Are there rule of thumb regarding sample size when neuroscientific measurements are used?,"According to this paper, 10-25 subjects are enough for an fMRI study.  However, regarding EEG, it only mentioned in this paper that some ""authors concluded that the relatively small sample sizes (average 20 subjects) in these studies are likely responsible for the inconsistent result"". This paper did not give a recommendation of sample size.  Are there a rule of thumb regarding how many subjects should be used for neuroscientific measurements in general? Are there papers regarding this?  Note that I am not currently designing an experiment, but writing a literature review regarding application of neuroscience. So I don't think I can conduct a power analysis as an answerer suggested. "
1346,What is the proper definition of psychopathy?,"I've seen all those checklists of psychopathy traits, read many articles and watched several tutorials - they mention like dozens of characteristics, but never make it clear about the actual meaning of the word.  Is psychopathy the lack of emotion? Is it the lack of empathy? What's the most accurate definition of the term?  Also, a lot of things that I've seen are unclear and contradictory:   A lot of explanations mention ""disregard to social norms"" as an intrinsic trait - but it clearly contradicts the trait of ""self-interest"", because by committing crimes or disregarding norms they harm themselves just as much as they harm people around. That's exactly what some psychopaths respond to allegations that they are dangerous and may commit a crime: ""there's absolutely no reason or benefit of committing crime, so why would I do it?"" A lot of explanations mention ""superficial charm"", while it's unclear how do you even measure that objectively and what does it have to do with mental disorders? Is the evaluating therapist just supposed to tick ""yes"" next to ""superficial charm"" if they personally were charmed by a psychopath, or what? And what does it even have to do with mental health: it's not like ""charm"" is an aura directly projected by brain. It's very unclear about impulsiveness, aggressiveness and impulsivity: some mention them as intrinsic traits of psychopathy, while others claim that they have nothing to do with it. It's also unclear how do they fit together with lack of emotional response or self interest, because they have nothing to do with each other or even contradict each other. Things like ""manipulation"", ""lack of realistic goals"" or ""disregard to safety"" seem like things that 90% of the population would qualify for, at least at some point. What exactly is so special about ""psychopathic"" disregard for safety that makes it stand out from the disregard rutinely demostrated by every chemistry freshman? Is it like they are incapable of understanding the very concept of safety, or what? Are they not only remorseless and aggressive, but also intellectually retarded? Does there exist a negative thing that psychopaths aren't?   In short, to the question of what psychopathy means, everyone says entirely different things, most of which either don't make sense or are self-contradictory. It seems like a blanket term for everything that's considered ""evil"" by society, but doesn't seem like a real mental disorder. Is it even one disorder, or a collective name for several unrelated disorders?  The only thing that I am clear about is that psychopathy is innate (in comparison to sociopathy, which is trauma-induced).  P.S. I have scientific background, but I am not a psychologist - so it's possible that everything in psychology is as ""vague"", and I just don't understand how does this area of science works (although, for example, bipolar disorder was clear enough to me).

1347,"When someone consumes finasteride, what happens neurophysiologically and what mental functions / faculties are altered?","Finasteride is a medication used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness) and enlarged prostates. Reported side effects include male breast enlargement, lowered sex drive, and headaches (among others). Additionally, there have been many anecdotal reports of ""brain fog"" and some reports of individuals unable to recall short-term memories.    Finasteride blocks the conversion from testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by inhibiting 5α-Reductase type II and III. However, it can also have an effect on neurosteroids. From Wikipedia:     Neurosteroids like 3α-androstanediol (derived from DHT) and   allopregnanolone (derived from progesterone) activate the GABA_A   receptor in the brain; because finasteride prevents the formation of   neurosteroids, it functions as a neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor and   may contribute to a reduction of GABA_A activity. Reduction of GABA_A   receptor activation by these neurosteroids has been implicated in   depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.      Additionally to these secondary effects resulting from lowered DHT, finasteride itself also crosses the blood–brain barrier.   Beyond the reduction in GABA_A receptor activation, what effects does finasteride have on the brain (secondary via 5α-Reductase inhibition and lowered DHT, or directly, via crossing the blood-brain barrier) and what kind of functions are altered by it? In particular, is there any likely explanation for headaches, ""brain fog,"" and difficulty with short-term memory recall that some users report?    Perhaps some results of this mouse model generalizes to human brains:     Finasteride treatment and its withdrawal induced neuroinflammation in   hippocampus.   Although, the hippocampus is mostly responsible for long-term, rather than short-term, memory. "

1349,Does the way a popular behaviour is discussed affect whether it would be imitated?,"I think I’ve came across a contradiction in relation to these two phenomenon.  On the one hand there is the following example: there was a vintage advert against pollution whereby a lot of people were shown littering as an example of negative behaviour. This was shown to be contra-effective, because showing certain negative behaviour to be commonly practiced actually made it look more acceptable and resulted in more people engaging in it.  On the other hand there is the copycat effect whereby people would be encouraged to engage in certain behaviour because it is widely discussed (for example, sensational news about murder and suicide, or a novel or series/film about similar topics, resulting in people who had such tendencies imitating the said behaviours). It has been suggested that the way these topics are viewed could prevent people from engaging it the said behaviour (for example, emphasizing the grief of the victims’ relatives).  So does the way certain popular (widely practiced or widely discussed) negative behaviour is viewed actually effect whether or not it will be imitated by those who are prone to that behaviour (the first case suggests that it doesn't, the second case suggests that it does)? Or otherwise, in what way are those two effects different so that no contradiction arises?  (I’m sorry for the lack of references; I read about these topics a long time ago and I’m not sure I can find the sources.) "
1350,Getting useful readings out of GSR sensors while moving?,"I'm currently thinking about a project that would involve using a GSR sensor and an Arduino (Probably the Grove GSR Sensor) to measure Stress levels in a person.   It will not be a research project, but an art project instead. I want to build a device that shows my stress level with some LEDs as indicators. The idea is that I can walk around with it and when I approach people and talk to them the color changes because of my social anxieties. So it doesn't have to be accurate, but if it won't work at all, I might as well scrap the project.  In which ways would movement of the subject distort the readings? Suppose the wearer has heightened physical activity, would the GSR sensor give any useful readings? And if so: any pointers on how to pull this off? "
1351,Sex With Ghosts - Possible Clinical Diagnoses,"Spectrophilia, is described by Wikipedia as the sexual attraction to ghosts or sexual arousal from images in mirrors, as well as the phenomenon of sexual encounters between ghosts and humans.  A quick and easy search shows us that many people claim to have had these encounters, and seem completely convinced of their experiences.  Question:  If someone walked into a psychiatrists office with these claims, (assuming they are seemingly normal otherwise, and have no history of mental illness), what would they most likely be diagnosed with? And what medicine might they be prescribed?     Things we're assuming to be true:      Ghosts aren't real.  "
1352,To what extent is control over when a substance is used relevant to addiction?,"For example, let's say someone uses X amount of heroin a week, and no more than Y a day. If somehow their arm is connected to a device that randomly (unpredictably, but within their ""waking leisure hours"") administers heroin at no more than Y a day and X per week, would users feel as addicted or dependent on the substance? Or would the loss of control, not even necessarily being able to look forward to using the substance every day or at a certain time or after certain events or feelings, make it not nearly as satisfying or addictive? "
1353,How to test people's compatibility for friendship,"I'd like to have a test that would predict whether two people will get along (enjoy conversation and possibly become friends) if they try? The idea is simple: many people pass the test and then, by looking at results, we can find matches for potential friendship. However, I feel that it's not easy to implement if at all possible.  It's obvious how to find shared interests, but I doubt it would be enough to find a match. So, the test should explore some personality characteristics. The question is what should we test for and how to find matches based on results?  I don't have education in psychology or something similar, and I couldn't find any relevant information. There are many articles regarding compatibility for romantic relationship, but that's not the same thing. "
1354,Why are we the smartest species on the whole known universe?,"Why?  One possible reason would be because intelligent give humans, and only humans, evolutionary edge compared to their peers. Gorilla, for example, are strong because strength give Gorilla evolutionary edge. For our species, that's intelligence. But how?  What evolutionary advantage does having high ""intelligence"" does to humans?  My friend told me that the greatest benefit of intelligence is that we ""deceive"" others betters.  Is that the main use of intelligent?  Deceiving others? Many of my mensa friends are honest. If anything I hate lies in any form except for jokes. Also we don't seem to have more children than normies.  How does having, say, high IQ help a person reproduce? "
1355,Linguistic & cross-cultural perceptions of typography,"I have moved this question over from ux.stackexchange in the hope that it is a better fit for this forum and will get a few answers  There is a great deal of information that one can find on the web which discusses the emotional impact that typography can have on the viewer.  To name two recent relevant articles  [website][website]I find myself wondering whether the broad conclusions presented in such articles has any validity when dealing with text in Arabic or in Indian or Far Eastern languages.  And then does the perception of typography for text presented in the latin alphabet change across cultures?  I have come across one study that is both interesting and relevant  [website]Perhaps there is someone on this forum who has studied these issues more thoroughly who might be able to comment?    Some very broad conclusions one can draw fro the Cornerstone study I mention above   Common typefaces that have had a lot of exposure across the world are more likely to be perceived in the same way across cultures. The cross cultural receptiveness to sans serif typefaces is more uniform than serif typefaces While there can be broad agreement at the like/dislike level the evaluation of individual typeface traits - the author uses descriptors such as ""professional"" and ""friendly"" - can vary quiet markedly. Newer typeface innovations such as slab serif and geometric lead to greater difference in perception across cultures (this from the author's conclusion but I am unable to see where this was tested in the work in question)  "
1356,"If the optic nerve transmits to both hemispheres, how do split-brain experiments work?","From what I understand, the optic nerve of each eye transmits information to both hemispheres of the brain. This is unlike other sensory and motor information, where (for example) the right hand is controlled by the left and vice versa.  Most sources I read skip over this information or don't explain it clearly, but I found it stated this way in this Introduction to Psychology ebook and this blog post (quotes pasted below; scroll for it).  However, I also read about split-brain experiments (such as those by Sperry and Gazzaniga) performed on patients who had undergone corpus calloscotomy, where the link between the two hemispheres of their brain was broken. Many of these experiments are vision-based, showing different visual stimuli to each eye and observing reactions in the corresponding hemisphere. But this assumes that the right eye transmits information only to the left, and vice versa, which, according to the other two sources, does not seem to be the case.  Taking it further, this Psychology Today article mentions studies on hemispheric transfer, which showed that subjects could read text more efficiently when fed directly to the right-eye (∵ contralateral control), rather than going to the left eye and then having to be transferred to the left hemisphere for processing—again implying that vision follows the contralateral principle.  Relevant quotes  To avoid forcing people to follow through links, I've pasted the relevant quotes here. Feel free to skip past to my main question below.  The Introduction to Psychology ebook:     Although the principle of contralateral control might lead you to expect   that the left eye would send information to the right brain hemisphere   and vice versa, nature is smarter than that. In fact, the left and   right eyes each send information to both the left and the right   hemisphere, and the visual cortex processes each of the cues   separately and in parallel. This is an adaptational advantage to an   organism that loses sight in one eye, because even if only one eye is   functional, both hemispheres will still receive input from it.   The blog post, titled A dominant preference: Eye or hand?     One of my previous blog posts contained data confirming that a   person’s preferred hand and foot often are aligned on the same side of   the body. This is the case for both left- and right-handers.¹      The neural wiring from eye to brain is more complex. Optic nerve   fibers from one eye travel to both the right and the left hemispheres.   The Psychology Today article:     A team of researchers from UC Santa Barbara, led by Gazzaniga,   recently tested information transfer using MEG. Language is processed   in areas of the temporal lobe on the left side of the head. When you   read with your left eye, the information first ends up in the right   hemisphere and must be transferred to the left hemisphere via the   corpus callosum to be processed. To test the efficiency of the   hemispheric transfer the researchers showed a randomized list of words   and nonsense words to the left or right eye of a number of research   participants. They then measured how effectively the subjects would be   able to distinguish words from nonsense words. The study showed that   subjects were significantly more efficient in determining the nature   of the string of letters when the information was fed directly to the   left hemisphere via the right eye. Apparently the brain has   difficulties processing information that has had to travel long   distances.   My question  Assuming my first information is accurate, here's one explanation I can think of: each eye usually sends information only to the opposite eye, but the optic nerve fibres travel to both hemispheres in case one eye stops functioning, in which case the remaining eye begins transmitting to both hemispheres. That seems a bit of a stretch, though.  So, here's my question: How do vision-based split-brain experiments account for the fact that the optic nerve reaches both hemispheres? Are there other properties of transmission that I'm not aware of (such as my hypothesis above)? Or is the assertion that the optic nerve transmits to both hemispheres simply false? "
1357,Why do we forget what we try to remember?,"Almost everybody has had an experience where someone asks them what their favorite book is, and they immediately forget every single book they have ever read. This infuriating consequence of attempting to dig into memory is mysterious enough by itself. Why does this happen? Why do our memories suddenly disappear when provoked?  I have searched for this and this, but the results don't provide a direct and suitable enough answer. "
1358,Social Media and General Addiction,"I have a question made of four aspects on addiction and dopamine neurobiology.   1. I'm currently wondering whether the addictive potential of social media can be quantified. I'm aware it probably depends on the individual, but I would think an estimate is possible; for example, hardcore drugs may be more objectively more addictive than a sugary snack.   2. I'm also wondering if I'm correct in assuming that, in addiction, the diminution of dopamine receptors would render all activities (aside the addiction itself) less pleasurable. Is this the case?  3. Finally, I'm wondering if the availability of more receptors of dopamine would permit sustained release of this neurotransmitter over time. I.e. several short amounts of dopamine from natural sources would be more 'optimal' than a massive burst at one given time?  4. Finally, I'm wondering if I'm completely off track given Berridge's 'wanting' versus 'liking' distinction, where dopamine mediates wanting and opioids mediate liking. Would pleasure here occur from opioids rather than dopamine?  Thank you "
1359,Fit a psychometric function when the maximum is not 100% (not because of lapse),"I found that currently the form of psychometric function assumes that the proportion correct lies between 0.5-1 given the range of stimulus level, but how to fit a psychometric function when the subject's performance never goes to 1 (and it is not because of lapse)?  An example of how this situation can happen: suppose I want to study how stimulus presentation time affect a small target's visibility in a given peripheral visual field location by a 2AFC task. The target's feature is fixed throughout the experiment. I can imagine that with longer stimulus presentation time (like 1 ms vs. 200 ms), subject can make more correct responses, but because of the limit of peripheral vision, the correct response rate can never go to 100% even if you present the stimulus for a very long time. How can I fit a psychometric function (proportion correct ~ stimulus presentation time) to data like this? "
1360,How to control subject's response bias in 2-interval force choice task,"I am using a two-interval force choice (2IFC) task to estimate detection threshold and choose an appropriate signal level for my following experiment, by estimating sensitivity ([tex]) for each signal level.   Since it is a 2IFC task with signal equally distributed on two intervals, I expect close-to-zero response bias and plan to estimate [tex] directly from proportion correct. After running experiment on 3 subjects (one complete 2500 trials, two complete 1250 trials), two of them show slight response bias (ratio of response to interval 1 vs. 2 is 0.91 and 1.12), but one subject shows large response bias (ratio of response to interval 1 vs. 2 is 0.53).   Here is my question:   For the subject with large response bias, is it still valid to estimate [tex] from proportion correct anymore? And is it still valid to estimate [tex] directly from hit rate and false-alarm rate? If I hope to let this subject to continue participating in this experiment, how should I let him/her to lower response bias? Directly telling him/her ""You have pressed key #1 too often, press key #2 more when you are not sure""? Is it going to interfere the experiment? For future naïve participants, should I let them know do not bias toward one response too much before the start of experiment, or should I tell them only when they have made too much bias? If the latter case, how much bias is considered to be ""too much""?  "
1361,Volition v.s. Cognitive Control v.s. Motivational Salience,"The concepts of volition, cognitive control, and motivational salience, seem quite similar. From the perspective of layman, they all seem to mean ""the extent to which your goals influence your behaviors"".  So, to psychologists, what is the difference? Or are they actually synonyms, even within psychology?    What sparked the question was that it is almost as if multiple discovery has occurred, and different sets of scientists are studying the same thing without realizing it. I realize though that is rather implausible, since psychologists aren't dumb. Surely if they actually were the same thing, someone would have noticed that besides me. So my conclusion is that there actually is some difference that I don't understand, or that they actually are the same, and psychologists know that, but they just haven't effectively communicated that yet (and so the three wikipedia articles should be merged).  Just as an example, it appears that volition, self-control, and willpower are considered synonyms. "
1362,Are there any significant alternatives to the theory that the mind exists?,"Are there any psychological models which do not presuppose the existence of the mind?    In the same way that there are theories of physics which do not presuppose the existence of a luminiferous aether, is the sort of thing that I mean.  Can there be, or is it impossible by definition? "
1363,What are some credible conferences and journals in computational neuroscience?,"I have a background in computer science, and I wish to introduce cognitive sciences to myself, particularly from a computational/mathematical perspective. My motivation for doing this artificial general intelligence research at a later stage.   So far I only know of a few conferences that accept papers in the area of computational neuroscience &amp; machine learning, namely Cosyne, NIPS, ICML, and ICLR that accept papers in computational neuro. I guess that latter two (ICLR and ICML) accept papers which find some significance in ML. As for journals, I do not even know where to begin.  "
1364,The Art of Teaching: What are the most effective & proven methods for successfully imparting a concept/idea to another,"I'm aware this is a bit of a general question &amp; subjectively broad. It's that way on purpose.  It felt like cogsci was the best place for this question and I couldn't find anything really like it anywhere on stackexchange.  I want to know in general, if I need to teach someone a concept and I really want them to understand it...what method, techniques, strategies are there out there which appear to have the biggest impact on the success of a teacher teaching the student a concept?  What other factors should one possibly consider when teaching something to someone else?  (Bias, attention span...how do I deal with these?)   Research for backing up anything you suggest would be ideal, but I don't want that requirement to preclude someone from posting something that could potentially be very effective but just isn't cited somewhere for some reason...maybe they experienced it with a teacher they had.  There can be value in those gems too.    I'd actually like for this post to be one that has universal teaching ideas/strategy in it and not just those applicable to my context below...as sometimes the only thing precluding the use of a teaching strategy in a different or more universal domain from where it came from is the ingenuity of the teacher.      Also, I tried finding a post on stackexchange anywhere containing this question in it's general sense with answers and couldn't....there is stuff on how to teach programming, but that's just programming....some of its ideas are partially applicable universally, but not all of them.    Here is my specific context, although I don't want answers to get too wrapped up in it.  I am teaching via Youtube video and already have planned out 1) Me drawing on a digital screen things while I'm talking 2) Using easy to relate to analogies 3) Obviously any other visuals 4) Pausing to quiz their knowledge on a previous section before they can move ahead 5) Wrapping this up in a hopefully entertaining package  To provide some context and the format/audience...what I'll practically be using this information for:  I am releasing a special documentary style video with the goal making users completely understand the entire path some special research recently published takes, its reasoning for every choice it makes, and the logic for it's sequencing and timing of element.  Thus, instead of me reciting a conclusion from some research paper, I take them through the journey so they understand it.  It's a bit of an intense topic with a profound conclusion...one that most people would also brush off immediately without fully attempting to comprehend first.    It's also extremely technical and includes some involving several tricky concepts from many different domains all at the same time that must be put together all in synchronicity: overarching ideas within biology &amp; evolution, micro &amp; cellular biology, genetics, astronomy, astrobiology, space ethics, the nature of language, information theory &amp; entropy, symbiotics (study of symbols), markings of culture, probabilities &amp; combinations, and...statistics.

1365,How is brain able to evoke almost real physical feelings in dreams?,"How does it do that?  Except for smell, I find brain being able to evoke almost real feels when we are in a dream.  I was even able to make myself get high in a dream. And even in the dream, the brain was actually able to do a good job in giving me the persona of being a High person.  Also, why can't it evoke smell as well? "
1366,Spike-timing-dependent plasticity versus Homeostatic plasticity,"How can spike-timing-dependent plasticity and homeostatic plasticity both be right? If spike-timing-dependent plasticity consistently tries to strengthen connections, but homeostatic plasticity consistently tries to weaken strong connections, wouldn't the two cancel each other out, causing no net plasticity to occur and consequently brains couldn't learn?  I have a pretty good understanding of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, but I just recently came across homeostatic plasticity and I'm trying to understand how both theories can be right. What am I misunderstanding? Can someone help me understand homeostatic plasticity better and how it applies to spike-timing-dependent plasticity? "
1367,Counterfactual thinking and the origin of language,"I want to apologize in advance for my dearth of knowledge concerning cognitive science research and history, I'm an AI student.  I've been reading up on cognitive science/linguistics literature mostly to get a better grasp on the physical symbol system hypothesis/language of thought vs connectionism debate.  I read this very interesting review of Berwick and Chomsky's book ""Why Only Us"" by Ian Tattersall, in which he exposes the authors' idea that language suddenly appeared as a result of a minor mutation in our ancestors' brain 80,000 years ago. However, because of the lack of linguistic archeological artefacts, it is impossible to prove. He then goes on:     If that is true, perhaps the best proxies we can seek for language in   the human archaeological record are objects or activities that reflect the working of symbolic human minds: minds capable   of envisioning that the world could be otherwise than it is at this moment.   And my question is then: why does counterfactual thinking require a symbolic mind? It seems perfectly plausible to imagine a species who can't talk but can still imagine ""other world"" scenarios using his visual system. However, a counter-argument is that animals have a highly developed visual system, yet they can't think counterfactually. (Hariri is famous for saying ""You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him that after he dies, he will get limitless bananas in chimpanzee Heaven."")  This all seems related to the LoT vs Connectionism debate: did we first grow a mind strong enough to do counterfactual thinking, which was also able to process language, or is language and symbolic thought really the precursor to higher level thinking like counterfactual thinking? "
1368,"In I.Q. and Cognitive Tests, What Sequence Patterns Should be Applied?","Nearly every I.Q. and Cognitive test seems to ask questions for the ""next item in the sequence"".   But, there just seems to be so many possibilities, and I can usually find a way that all of the multiple-guess choices could be true.  But, what are the test-givers actually looking for?  For example:   Rotate the image clockwise or counter clockwise on the page, (around the Z axis). Flip the image around the Y Axis, (Vertical Mirror). Flip the image around the X Axis, (Horizontal Mirror). ... Combinations of the above? Cycle the colors through sequences, (like red, green, blue ...), etc., etc.,   Sometimes, I feel that because I am left-handed (or just odd?) - the ""simple"" and ""obvious"" choices seem very, very, relative.  Question:   What are the actual patterns they are expecting people to apply?   If multiple patterns apply, which one do you choose? And, these tests often direct the test-taker to choose the ""simplest"" or ""most obvious"" solution; but, how do you know which one is which?    "
1369,Is a low Emotional Intelligence (EQ) pathological?,"A sufficiently low cognitive intelligence is generally considered in society to be inherently pathological, or at least very nearly so. In fact, until recently, a diagnosis of Intellectual Disability (ID) could formally be made on the basis of a low (below a cutoff value) IQ test score alone, without any evidence that the person's low intelligence actually caused any significant practical problems (e.g. the ""clinically significant distress or impairment"" frequently mentioned in the DSM).  Is there a similar phenomenon with respect to Emotional Intelligence (EQ)? That is, is having a sufficiently low EQ very strongly correlated with or otherwise significantly indicative of a diagnosable medical or psychological disorder, or is there a significant population of people with low (or even abysmally low) EQ's who function well enough in society that they cannot be diagnosed with any disorder?  Please do not simply quip that ""Low EQ==Autism"" unless you have something to back that up! "
1370,Does Emotional Intelligence (EQ) demonstrate the Flynn Effect?,"The Flynn Effect is a well-known phenomenon whereby Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test scores among the general public seem to rise over time.  Does Emotional Intelligence (EQ) demonstrate the Flynn Effect or a similar effect? That is, is there any research indicating that people today are, are likely to be, or appear to be based on their scores more emotionally intelligent than people of the past?  Since the nature of the Flynn Effect in IQ is still controversial (whether it represents true gains in general cognitive ability or whether it represents a measurement error), an answer such as, ""Johnson (2013) observed that average EQ scores rose by 20 points between 2000 and 2010, but he suspects that it was caused mostly by people being coached in the correct answers on EQ tests by reading pop psychology books and browsing online Question and Answer sites rather than a true gain in emotional processing and reasoning abilities."" would be perfectly acceptable.

1372,Is there an accepted age range for peak creativity?,"I have noticed in myself, and others (from afar) that creativity seems to decline with age.  Physically, it's obvious that people peak rather early (say, 25 or 30 or so years of age). But what about when it comes to creativity? Is there a known age range that are typically the most creative years?  If you compare the works of great artists (and I know there are also many exceptions/outliers), it seems most of their ""greatest"" works came earlier in life (for those that lived long lives, that is).  Just a few examples of those who seemed most creative in their younger years, when more of their ""masterpieces"" were created, are:  Music: Dylan, Browne, Springsteen Literature: Twain, Steinbeck, London   I'll leave it to others to add more examples, or refute these. "
1373,"Is Approximate Number System used only for comparing magnitudes of groups of things, or does it also help in actual counting?","By ANS I am referring to this   According to this reddit answer      The human mind has two systems for representing numbers: a subitizing   system for numbers up to four, and an approximate ratio estimation   system for larger numbers.   It means that if we don't know how to count, we can only know about numbers upto 4. Anything more than that and we activate ANS system.  But ANS system can't be useful for counting right? It is useful only when we have two groups of things. It is not useful when we want to estimate a magnitude of a single group of things. Is that correct? "
1374,Conceptual representations in brain by distributed groups of neurons,"It seems generally agreed upon that semantic concepts are distributedly represented by groups and groups of groups of neurons spread over the cortex.  Disregarding the localizations, shapes and connectivity of these groups of neurons, I tried to consider them as sets (in the mathematical sense). Let [tex] be the (probably fuzzy) set corresponding to concept [tex].  The only thing that I would take for granted is that for very similar semantic concepts [tex], [tex] their corresponding sets of neurons [tex] do overlap strongly. Otherwise the model of distributed representation would not make much sense to me.  Other answers aren't so obvious:   Does a more general concept [tex] use more neurons than a more specific concept [tex] - or less? Or does it depend (on what)? How do the sets of neurons of two concepts [tex] with [tex] overlap? Is maybe one a (fuzzy) subset of the other? More generally: How are semantical or extensional relations between two concepts reflected by set theoretic relations between their corresponding sets of neurons? (My intuitive guess is: [tex] is larger than [tex], and [tex] is contained in [tex], i.e. [tex]. But this may be simply wrong.) Does a more important concept [tex] (being used more often) use more neurons than a more rarely used.   I wonder if there is any evidence (empircal or theoretical) that sheds some light on these questions.  [If you think, this question is devoid of scientific meaning or otherwise ill-posed, please let me know why.] "
1375,How do we not think everyone is the same person from a slightly different position?,"When we meet someone and say they have a beard. When we meet another person with a beard. How do we know that is not the same person?  On the other hand, when we see the same person from a slightly different angle we recognise them.  So how do we not over-fit or under-fit on facial recognition?  Is it just practice?  If we just lived on an island with people who looked very different from each other (e.g. the old one, the tall one, the fat one, the bald one, the young one) and then travelled to a country with lots of similar looking people. Would we think they all looked the same? "
1376,LSD and tryptamines harmless or neurotoxic?,"It's commonly stated by numerous people that LSD and trytamines like DMT and psilocin are physically harmless and not neurotoxic. Is there evidence for this?   I recently read 5-meo-Dipt which is a tryptamine might be neurotoxic. Why would 5-meo-Dipt be neurotoxic but DMT and psilocin not be? From my understanding some people micro-dose with LSD and some tryptamines to feel sharper and increase felt intelligence.   Why would one tryptamine neurotoxic and others make someone feel more intelligent? Obviously ""feel"" is self reported and subjective, but I'm assuming there might be some truth to this if people aren't tripping when experiencing these micro dosing effects. LSD isn't a tryptamine, but I think some people do similar things with tryptamines. I'm hoping someone with a better understand of neurology can answer this.   To restate my question are typtamines and LSD generally neurotoxic and if not, could you please link to a study on it and what mechanism makes 5-meo-dipt possibly different, could other factors might have lead to a wrong conclusion, like for example harmful environment stress on rats or do you think all tryptamines are neurotoxic?  I'm trying to understand the possible reasons or lack there of for neurotoxicity in LSD and tryptamines but there seems to be lack of reliable sources. "
1377,Single person with largest number of fMRI scans,Is there a known single test person of whom the largest number of fMRI scans (while performing different tasks) have been recorded?

1379,Anchoring Heuristic: a type of heuristic or the mechanism of functioning of heuristics?,"Heuristic is a mental shortcut that helps us to make decisions and judgments quickly, without spending time analyizing any aspect of reality.  There are several different categories of heuristics, three of them are:   Availability heuristic involves making decisions based upon how easy it is to bring something to mind The representativeness heuristic involves making decisions by comparing the present situation to the most representative mental prototype Base-rate heuristic is a mental shortcut which helps us to make decisions based on probability   I've read another type of heuristic: Anchoring Heuristic that refers to the human tendency to accept and rely on the first piece of information received. I think that every kind of Heuristic uses an anchor to make decisions...  The point is: which is the difference among Anchoring Heuristic and the other types of heuristic?  I mean, to use an information as an anchor, is the mechanism of heuristic in general, isn't it? "

1381,How does speed listening work?,"I've recently gotten into listening to podcasts. Over time, as I get accustomed to the speaker's voice, I'm able to increase the speed of the podcast to as high as 3x speed. It still feels ""normal"" to me, as if the speaker is having a normal-speed conversation with me.   When I turn down the speed to 1x, it sounds unbearably slow. For non-speed-listeners, listen to something at 0.5x or 0.25x, and you'll know what 1x sounds like to speed listeners. It's as if speed listening shifts up a listener's range of acceptable speed, so that lower speeds are no longer in that range.  I know there are plenty of other speed listeners who do the same thing (just Google ""speed listening"" to see for yourself). Yet, others have told me that at this speed, podcasts are basically unintelligible.  Thus, I have a handful of related questions:   What occurs in the brain when a person speed listens?   a. Why does the podcast feel ""normal"" at such fast speeds?   b. Is there a fundamental/biological difference between those who can speed listen and those who can't, or is it a learned ability? Is speed listening detrimental to listening comprehension?  "
1382,Are There National Personality Archetypes?,"I feel like in the U.S where I was born and raised there are definable personality archetypes which fall into obvious stereotypes such as a dry as dust country type accent and life-style, snob, ultra conservative old woman etc What I want to know is if these behaviors have been catalogued and defined. For instances, writers have alleged that there are 11 different ""nations"" in the United States.  What are their bases and why do people conform so rigidly to these types?  "

Here are some examples:   "" Homosexual marriages are quite common today, because armageddon is approaching!"" ""  "" Our country can't develop further, because USA, China and other developed countries are afraid of us!""  "" 9/11!

1384,What concepts of perception should designers be aware of when designing?,"Visual perception is a huge topic, much of which is relevant to the work of a designer. I have identified topics in visual memory, visual cognition and colour perception that are relevant, and I'm sure there is more I don't yet know of.  What would be a good place to start for a designer looking for concepts of perception to be aware of when designing? For example, what books (or other accessible resources, such as web pages, applied research topics) exist that are suitable?  I'm very interested in learning more about visual perception and how it pertains to graphic design. I work predominately in print and environmental graphic design but any area of graphic design should be equally applicable. "
1385,Is Apple's iPhone Retina Display really accurate to human eye resolution?,"Apple based their Retina Display on the following claim, as cited by Wikipedia:     The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen is marketed by Apple as the ""Retina Display"", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 12 inches (305 mm) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.   However some have stated that the resolution of the human retina is significantly higher than Apple's claim:     Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple, working out to 477 ppi at 12 inches (305 mm) from the eyes, or 36 arcseconds per pixel.[44]   My impression of the human eye's ""resolution"" has been that it's significantly higher than the ""Retina"" display.  Is there any objective evidence that supports or refutes Apple's claim that the Retina display matches human eye resolution? Have any studies specifically been done to determine whether humans can differentiate ""Retina"" displays and higher resolution displays at the same distance? "
1386,Does any evidence show that Smartphone users have poorer memory?,"An ages old complaint is that new technology harms memory. Why remember something when you can look it up?   In a course on Human Memory I distinctly recall an interesting discussion on phones and memory, and an interesting point came up; even though smart phones mean we no longer remember phone numbers as often as we used to we have to remember passwords, userids and other trivial bits of information which keeps our encoding skills sharp. However I don't recall and studies to support this hypothesis.  Are there any recent studies to suggest whether users of portable digital tools like smartphones actually perform worse on any memory-related psychometrics?   And no I'm not talking about these extremely questionable Cellphones Harm Memory in Mice stories the media has picked up on. I'm not concerned with electromagnetic radiation's effects on the brain, but rather the effect of having easy access to external information. "
1387,"Is there a reduction of ""Brain Fog"" with fewer hours of sleep?","I've heard patients who complain of ""brain fog"" (and fatigue) claim a reduction in ""brain fog"" (and more mental clarity) when they get fewer hours of sleep (usually less than 5.5 hours).  Here I'd define brain fog as a lack of mental clarity, slow and muddled thinking, trouble stringing thoughts, drowsiness, a reduced ability to focus, a feeling of drifting off, and a reduced ability to shift attention.  Delirium (without hallucination) could be a close medical term.  My questions are:   Any theories on why this may happen? Is anyone familiar with any research regarding less brain fog with less sleep?   I've read in a paper by MacLean and Datta (2007) that sleep deprivation has been successfully used to treat depression, but not so with anxiety.     Indeed, in clinical studies, sleep deprivation has been an effective   form of treatment for major depressive disorders in humans (Clark et   al., 2001; Giedke et al., 2003; Gillin et al., 2001); but deprivation   has shown little or negative results in patients diagnosed with   anxiety disorders (Dinges et al., 1997; Labbate et al., 1998). Results   from recent REM and total sleep deprivation studies in rodents   demonstrate the anxiogenic effect of disrupted sleep (Silva et al.,   2004; Suchecki et al., 2002a; Suchecki et al., 2002b).   Depression and delirium are two distinct things, and I'd be interested in hearing more about how sleep deprivation effects delirium -- since it seems that brain fog is not a widely used term.   Robert Ross MacLean and Subimal Datta (2007). The relationship between anxiety and sleep-wake behavior after stressor exposure in the rat. Brain Res. 2007 August 20; 1164: 72–80. Published online 2007 June 27. doi:  10.1016/j.brainres.2007.06.034     I'm going to update this as I learn more (until I get a reasonable answer), in attempt to both log and share what I'm learning on the subject.     Using imaging, he found that a small area of the cerebral cortex in   the front of the brain  — the anterior cingulate cortex — which was   consistently overactive in depressed patients, quieted to normal   levels of activity after the patients were deprived of sleep. And when   the patients were allowed to sleep, the activity in this area returned   to the elevated levels.    SEJNOWSKI, T. (2010, April 7). In Sleepless Nights, a Hope for Treating Depression - NYTimes.com. Opinion - Opinionator - NYTimes.com.

1388,Running on autopilot,"Sometimes, people say that they are ""running on autopilot"", meaning that they are doing the things that they normally do, without any real conscious involvement. I have read that it is not uncommon for people to drive routes that they regularly drive without any conscious memory of it - I have occasionally done this myself, and it is very unnerving.  But how do we do this? How can we achieve the level of co-ordination and reaction that is required to drive a vehicle for a significant period without involving our conscious mind? I realise that we do a lot of things sub-consciously, but it seems that learned tasks like driving should require at least a minimal conscious engagement.  Incidentally, I am not suggesting that this is dangerous in any sense. I don't think it is. I am just surprised as the level of functioning we are capable of achieving sub-consciously. "
1389,"Is Decision-Making Emotionally Based, with Rationalization as the only Conscious Component?","My interest is in how problem-solving decisions are made, and what, if any skills could be taught to increase people's ability to make effective decisions?  Effective, in this case, means that an external observer finds the decision a sufficient and satisfying solution to the problem given the thinker's current understanding of environment, context, and resources.  I understand the Information Principle of emotion takes the position that emotions are a ""summary"" of all that the unconscious notices about the current situation. (See this link for an excellent overview.)  Given the breadth of its perception, and the faster processing time of its systems, emotion is tremendously powerful as an advisor. The reward system is triggered when a desired choice is contemplated, so is the role primary, rather than advisory? Is conscious thought -- what we come up with when we ""think about our decision"" -- always post hoc, used only for coming up with a way to explain what our feelings told us we wanted?   Regarding skills to increase effectiveness, I wonder at the value of learning to overcome our initial emotional response to allow the more deliberate conscious processes to make a real contribution.  I have heard that trauma victims with absent emotions dither about the smallest decisions, so I'm not talking full suppression.  Is anyone aware of research into the effect of trying to achieve some balance here? "
1390,Can sleep become addictive?,"Can a person become dependent on sleeping (more than they otherwise physically need) in a way that fits the definition of addiction, in the same way some psychology professionals may describe a person as being addicted to other standard needs, such as food, work, exercise?  If so, is there a way to determine whether the ""need"" for more sleep is due to actual physical needs or due to an addictive response?  Have there been any studies on this topic? "
1391,"Is it a good idea to play an instrument while studying? If so, what are the benefits?","We've all heard that listening to classical music and such while studying can be beneficial, but I was wondering about actually playing an instrument? If I were to absentmindedly play my accordion while reading a textbook, would it have any benefit to either my absorption of the material or ability to play music without having to focus on it? Or is this just a bad idea?  Specifically, have there been any studies relevant to this, or is there any other data on the subject? "
1392,Asaccadia adaptation,"Can asaccadia (i.e., lack of saccades, due to neuronal or muscular damage) be overcome? Do other muscles (e.g., neck) compensate? Are the resulting gaze patterns the same as for saccades, and are they involuntary the way saccades are?  Conversely, in normal vision, is the saccade-fixation system specially wired, or is it merely the optimal way to visually examine the world? "
1393,Do some Photosensitive epileptics desire seizures?,"It seems absurd, but from the Wikipedia article on Photosensitive Epilepsy:     Some PSE patients, especially children, may exhibit an uncontrollable fascination with television images that trigger seizures, to such an extent that it may be necessary to physically keep them away from television sets. Some patients (particularly those with cognitive impairments, although most PSE patients have no such impairments) self-induce seizures by waving their fingers in front of their eyes in front of bright light or by other means.   Wikipedia fails to give a citation as to the existence or commonality of this, but it still strikes me as odd.   Have any studies (case studies or preferably experimental results) validated that some PSE patients want or enjoy seizures? Is there some attraction to the causes of these seizures in the patients that causes this behavior? "
1394,What is the effect of merely expecting an interruption on performance?,There's a lot of research about how interruptions affect cognitive performance.

What does these studies conclude about the effect of merely expecting an interruption on performance?  
1395,What do anatomical substrates of conditioned taste aversion tell us about  treatment?,"Conditioned taste aversions (CTAs) or Garcia effect are a byproduct of feeling ill after we've consumed a certain food. These aversions is present even if the illness is not related to ingestion and are difficult to extinguish in humans. This makes sense in light of the fact that in model systems like the rat they are entrenched in brainstem circuitry (Mickley et al., 2011).  With such a deep association taking place, does the likelihood of extinguishing these aversions via cognitive therapy (e.g., CBT) decrease dramatically?  What would be a possible inroad into treating  human subjects with such an aversion?     Mickley GA, Wilson GN, Remus JL, Ramos L, Ketchesin KD, Biesan OR, Luchsinger JR, &amp; Prodan S. (2011).  Periaqueductal gray c-Fos expression varies relative to the method of conditioned taste aversion extinction employed.  Brain Res.;1423:17-29. [website]"
1396,Combinatorial woes,"I am interested in the creation of chunks (aka configural nodes) from smaller chunks and input features (only interested in System 1 cognition).  Unitization studies (e.g. Goldstone (pdf)), suggest that we start with generic features, and slowly combine them into more specific chunks. As we do this unitization, we wouldn't store all of the learned combinations --- a mere 10 input features can be combined in 3.6 million configurations!  Simon suggested generic elements get overwritten by more specific ones at each exposure. but what would you do with the predictions/rules learned about a given chunk? Transfer them to the newly created specific chunk? What if they do not apply at that more specific level?  Nosofsky was suggesting a rule-plus-exception model, where the more generic elements are always stored and their predictions are recorded as general rules; When those predictions are broken, more specific chunks are stored to explain the exceptions to these rules. What does it mean for predictions to be broken? In a probabilistic environment like ours, sometimes a prediction is correct, sometimes it isn't -- updating the weight of the prediction seems much more reasonable than deeming it invalid in favor of an 'exception'.  When do I chunk two co-occurring features? When do I chunk those two with a third? Do I delete the 2-feature chunk in favor of the 3-feature? What do I do with the memories associated with the deleted chunk? "
1397,Why is a lack of response to punishment in adults considered significant in diagnoses?,"It seems that a lack of response to punishment is often considered useful in diagnosing conditions or symptoms. A good example of this may be in diagnosing psychopathy, in which a lack of response to punishment seems to be a defining characteristics. For example:     Their behavior does not reform in response to punishment; they will   impulsively commit crimes despite knowing the consequences they will   likely face. They are among the worst of repeat offenders.”   It seems odd to me that punishment is considered significant, since in many cases a person we consider capable of making their own decisions may not agree that they have done something wrong, in which case why would the punishment be expected to have any effect?   My question is, how is observing a lack of response to punishment useful in diagnosing any kind of psychological condition? Is the assumption that most people will respond in an expected way to punishment? If so, what is that based on? "
1398,Is pedophilia a sexual orientation or a mental disorder?,"There are some different claims being made that pedophilia is a sexual orientation rather than a mental disorder.  At the moment there seems to be a growing group of psychologists advocating that pedophilia is, or at least should be considered a sexual orientation rather than a mental disorder.  For example:     GOOD: You're a member of a growing group of psychologists who say   pedophilia should be considered a sexual orientation. Why?      Quinsey: Part of the definition of pedophilia is a person has a   preference for a particular kind of partner. [...] pedophiles,   unlike other men, show substantial sexual interest in prepubescent   children. As far as we know—and many people have tried—these sexual   interests are not modifiable by any method that’s been tried yet. So   it appears like pedophilia is a sexual orientation. [...] You also can’t modify that   interest; it’s stable through adulthood, just like pedophilia.   Another example:     “Pedophiles are not simply people who commit a small offence from time   to time but rather are grappling with what is equivalent to a sexual   orientation just like another individual may be grappling with   heterosexuality or even homosexuality,” emphasized Van Gijseghem.      “True pedophiles have an exclusive preference for children, which is   the same as having a sexual orientation.  You cannot change this   person’s sexual orientation.” He added, however: “He may however   remain abstinent.”   There is also an advocacy/support group for people attracted to minors, B4UACT, who state in a section from their website (emphasis mine):     Why do you say that minor-attracted people are stereotyped?      Popular beliefs about minor-attracted people are not supported by the   evidence. Research shows that they are no more violent or aggressive   than the general population, nor do they suffer from psychopathology   or personality disorders. As a group, they do not share any particular   characteristics or behaviors other than their feelings of attraction.   As I understand things mental disorders tend to have observable associated symptoms, while a sexual orientation would not as it is just an instinctive attraction (in the general sense of the term).  Are there studies that suggest that pedophilia is a sexual orientation? Do traits typically associated with a mental disorder apply to pedophilia? "
1399,Under what conditions does 60hz video produce visual artifacts?,"There are some important thresholds of frame rate in video playback that effect whether or not animation appears fluid. This wikipedia page about Visible Frame Rate suggests that a framerate of 60 hertz doesn't quite provide enough information fast enough to be seen as fluid in some cases:     However, fast moving objects may require higher frame rates to avoid judder (non-smooth, linear motion) artifacts   When exactly does a higher framerate become necessary? What studies have shown what kinds of motion cause this ""judder""? "
1400,Is performance reducible to brain activity in an unambiguous way?,"As a preface, let me assume that the entirety of mental states and their corresponding behaviors in a person are entirely reducible to the physical activity of neurons sending a variety of chemicals across synaptic clefts at appointed times. There's no extra-logical, metaphysical sense of being that guides our actions e.g. spirits, soul stuff, etc.   Beyond this provision, which is obvious, is the overarching question of how particular networks in the brain control various structural and behavioral faculties in the mind. For example, if we place a person in an MRI and ask them to count to three, we expect to find activation in a portion of the parietal lobe. Just how fine-grained is this activation? If we ask the same person to do the same counting at a different time, will a different network in the same area of the brain be used?   The first question has a corollary to it; a kind of role reversal: given a sufficiently detailed picture of a person's brain, is it possible to more or less describe what the person is doing or thinking?  "
1401,Is there a random walk theory that can account for situations with more than two choices?,"In the article ""Two-stage Dynamic Signal Detection: A Theory of Choice, Decision Time, and Confidence"" from 2010 by Pleskac and Busemeyer, a random walk model is presented for situations where a discrete choice is made (that is, signal present/not present, yes/no, 1/0 et cetera). Here, if there is no time pressure involved, a threshold value is set which has to be reached before an answer is given. Contrary, if there is a time pressure involved, the value at the last time point is used to decide which answer is given, even if the threshold point hasn't been reached at that time.  I wonder whether there are any extension of this model which can incorporate situations with more than two choices (from 3 alternatives and up to a fully continius choice space). I guess you just could incorporate more dimensions (the model referred to above is two-dimensional), but if the answers are non-independent (for example, when using a rating scale), I guess the random walk function would have to be fairly complicated. That is, if strong evidence is accumulated for number 3, how much evidence should be added to 4 and 2? Should evidence be subtracted from 1 and 5?  "
1402,Does the fusiform face area in patients with Prosopagnosia (face blindness) show lower activity under an fMRI?,"I watched last night's episode of 60 minutes (and part 2) about Prosopagnosia (Face Blindness) and found it absolutely fascinating. They mentioned in the segment (Around 5:22 into the second part of the online video) that Nancy Kanwisher of MIT has studied the MRI scans of people without Prosopagnosia and found that the fusiform face area lit up on an MRI when an individual was shown an image of a face.  Nancy Kanwisher then goes on to state the following:     I really did not expect to see a fusiform face area [on an MRI scan of a patient with Prosopagnosia]. [...] And we looked at the data and his face area was beautiful, it was textbook. [...] It tells us that the problem is not that this thing [(the fusiform face area)] does not exist, there it is!     The image shows an MRI scan of a patient who has Prosopagnosia, demonstrating that the patient does have a fusiform face area. However, it was unclear to me whether the fusiform face area of an individual suffering from Prosopagnosia is less active when presented with a face than that of an individual without Prosopagnosia.  What did Nancy Kanwisher find with regards to that? Does the fusiform face area in individuals with Prosopagnosia exist but remains dormant? Or is it just as active but for some other (probably unknown) reason simply fail to relay the proper information to the rest of the brain? "

1406,Why are most popular humans pets carnivores?,"Most popular pets are cats, and dogs. They are all carnivores. Few people have pigs as pets. More commonly, people eat pigs.   Why are some of the most common human housepets carnivores? Does this preference indicate anything more general about the human condition? (for example, do humans love violent beings?)   Note: Cows, horses, and rabbits are cattles, not pets. You don't develop emotional bonding with them. People would scream when dogs are being eaten in China. People don't scream when pigs are being eaten everywhere.  I am talking about the most popular pets that people form bonds with.  I am just wondering that perhaps we use cats in mutually beneficial ways. That is why we love them. Also cats and dogs would retaliate if we hit them.  We uses cows in parasitic ways (as food). That's why we don't love cows. Perhaps a good strategy to be loved is to be reasonably violent? That's what I want to know.  Or perhaps humans love those who kill for them (like our soldiers?). Cats and dogs kill for us or help us kill. That's why we evolve loving them as our ""allies"". Is it possible?  NB: I am well aware that cats are very cute. I prefer rational explanation I can easily verified without referring to some vague emotions. "

1408,Is implicit and explicit memory a useful distinction?,"In principle I understand the distinction. Implicit memory is not consciously recollected but has an automatic character i.e. while I'm solving a task in math, I'm automatically using the concept of numbers and maybe even counting which I have stored in my memory. Explicit memory on the other hand is the conscious recollection of particular bits of memory, like explicitly counting up to ten or maybe remembering my birthday.  What I'm wondering is this: Isn't this distinction somewhat arbitrary? Even if I consciously use a certain piece of memory to solve a task, isn't it the case that I still don't know how I manage to access this particular memory? And is this even only about memory? To me it seems that everything can be stored in some way (how I breathe, my birthday and the range of things I do when taking a shower) and isn't that the only type of memory we have? Shouldn't the distinction then be about how we use the things we have memorized? I mean is there evidence that implicit memory is stored in a structurally different way than explicit memory? Or am I focussing on the wrong question?  I'm asking this question out of pure interest as a cognitive linguist who doesn't have much to do with memory right now. "
1409,Personality traits associated with finishing other people's sentences?,"I read in a North American undergrad psychology textbook, that people who tend to finish another's sentences tend to be emotionally intense. I think ""emotionally intense"" is the wording that they used.

And does anyone know any other traits of people who like to finish another's thoughts?  "
1410,Is remembering a list of words an example of semantic or episodic memory?,"I'm having a hard time making a clear distinction between semantic and episodic memory. When presented with idealized examples, I find the breakdown clear; describing a trip to Paris is an example of episodic memory, describing the structure of a cell is an example of semantic memory.  However, when it comes to experimental settings, things suddenly start to look more murky. For example, say that one is presented 20 words in a sequential fashion and then is asked to repeat as many of these as possible. Are we dealing with episodic memory then? Does it make any difference if one is forced to recollect them in the same order as they appeared? Many researchers seem to consider this situation an example of episodic memory (just as an example, see van der Helm et al., 2011), and indeed, the man who invented the concept of episodic memory also did so at the time of its conception (Tulving, 1972; p.390).  However, later, Tulving has revised his original definition. In a more recent article (Tulving, 2002) he writes:      I had been wrong in 1972 when I had assumed that the traditional, Ebbinghaus-inspired, study/test laboratory experiments of verbal learning and memory had dealt with episodic memory. They had not. Two important features of episodic memory were missing.      One had to do with the contents of what the subjects in the experiments had to learn. Episodic memory is about happenings in particular places at particular times, or about “what,” “where,” and “when” [...] Traditional laboratory experiments, however, were almost invariably concerned with “what.” Subjects are asked, “What do you remember of the presented material?” They report their knowledge in tests such as free recall, cued recall, or recognition. Subjects’ memory for “where” and “when” was hardly ever examined.      The other missing feature was what I referred to in Elements as “recollective experience,” or conscious awareness of what had happened in the past. In traditional experiments the experimenter assumes that the overt behavioral response reflects the subject’s mental state; that is, that behavior is a faithful index of cognition. The reasoning goes something like this: Surely, if the subject recognizes an item in a recognition test, it means that he remembers it from the list, that is, that he has a conscious recollection of the item’s occurrence in the study list. How could it possibly be otherwise?      As subsequent history showed, it could be otherwise. Research on implicit memory [...], or so-called nonconscious memory [...], has overwhelmingly proved that one and the same behavioral response in a study/test experiment could represent conscious awareness of the retrieved item’s experimental history as readily as it could represent total lack of such awareness.   So which one is it? Are there any large disagreements within the community of what episodic memory actually is? Are word list tests seen as something that at least captures a small part of episodic memory? If remembering a list of words isn't an example of episodic memory, then what is it an example of?

1411,Enhance recollection abilites,"I hope this is a good way of asking this question.   I am not generally the guy with the best memory out there, so I looked a bit into it and I am concluding my recollection phase is the weakest. It's seems like I can store a lot but recalling it, I would come under average.   It's not like it has stopped me from doing fine in life, but I am curious about how one can enhance that part, any good reads should you recommend from the scientific literature ?  Thanks.   Augmented :  Well I do recall a lot because I can gather a lot from my memory, but then I stumble often in just getting the first starting point from which I would be able to gather all those memories, i.e : I can remember profusely given someone or something helps me with recalling just a part or the beginning of it. So my recalling issue is really in having a sort of catalogue or dictionary like system : once you get the word you get its definition, my trouble is in getting the word (I hope the analogy is clear). Working memory is short-term memory? Can be, what are symptoms for that ? "
1412,Learned dyslexia? adult predicament from childhood teacher´s incompetence?,"I have a friend, over 30, who is convinced she cannot really read. Of course; she can  read, but she struggles so much with sorting letters into words that she cannot absorb the content. Playing - say - Trivial Pursuit - she looks at the letters; pronounce the words, makes them into sentences, but (says) she does not understand the question until I either answer or say it back to her, or she reads it a second time. She is now, for other reasons, back to school, as she needs to find another profession. I am, in an unofficial capacity, her personal tutor.  The consensus during her school years was that she was extremely dyslectic, a hopeless case, and her teachers let her ""get away with it"": unlike other students, she did not have to read aloud in class etc (this makes me furious to think about, that they did not give her the help she needed).  She is nowhere near stupid, but insists she is, and that she is so dyslectic that there is nothing that can be done about it. Recently, she took a dyslectic-test and consistently get the worst scores possible.  My suspicion is that she is NOT half as dyslectic as she is made out to be: I think this is largely a learned thing. Since teachers gave up on her; why should she believe she can? Yes, she probably is dyslectic, but the result of incompetent teachers have made her predicament much, much worse.  Fact is; when she has to write things, there are not really all that many spelling mistakes, the sentences are coherent, and she is very good at the logic needed to write - say - a (slightly academic) essay, she is excellent at writing stories, petites. She does, however, have a problem extracting the essence of what she reads. I do think though, that this is largely due to the learned view ""I cannot do this, I am too stupid and massively dyslectic"". Interestingly, last semester she consistently got top grades in the (native) language class where both content and spelling was important.  This results in (partly learned?) dyslexia as a ""gateway"" to the crippling thought: ""I am an idiot. Why should I try? I will simply spend my life watching television."".  We do not read single letters in words we are familiar with; we largely see the ""picture"" of a word and make an educated guess/reasonable assumption based on the context. She is visual enough to master this. Having given up on words; there is a possibility that she does not bother to learn them, and hence cannot recognise the word-picture.  I realise this is a very specific example, but my general question is:   How do you teach adults to read? Is it possible to somehow measure the ""I have given up"" against real dyslexia? How is it possible to motivate an adult other than ""you will get good grades if you improve on this""? (grades, as we all know, can at times be a little arbitrary and subjective). Any research on learned dyslexia? Have our acceptance of dyslexia in a way gone too far? (to the point of accepting it and ""giving up"" on students?) Anyone with experience in this?  "
1413,How are sexual cues known by the brain?,Sexual cues have been well established in evolutionary psychology as indicators of genetic compatibility/useful genes.   How does the human brain know that a cue is an indicator of a useful trait in order that a person perceives the trait as being an attractive one? What cognitive mechanisms are involved in the perception of sexual cues as being attractive? 
1414,"Significant baseline, Oddball paradigm","I recently conducted an EEG experiment using a passive Oddball paradigm with two experimental conditions : standard stimuli (occurring with a 85% probability) and deviant stimuli (occurring with a 15% probability). This experiment was conducted on 10 participants.   ERP were recorded with 64 electrodes.   An ANOVA test on the prestimulus baseline period yielded a significant effect of the condition. I have observed a difference between standard stimuli's wave and deviant stimuli's wave. There shouldn't be such a difference between these two but I understood that this difference is caused by a smaller number of trials in the deviant condition than in the standard one.   However, I'm still wondering whether this significant difference can be caused by the small number of participants (n=10) or by too small inter-stimulus interval (ISI=1500ms) ? How do you suggest I should deal with this significant baseline regarding the understanding of MMN/P3 effects ?  I looked on cogsci.SE and I didn't find anything relevant to my question.  "
1415,Evidence-based best practices for writing a gratitude journal,"I was intrigued to read (in the question ""What positive writing exercises improve happiness?"") the idea of a gratitude diary suggested as an intervention that ""causes psychological well-being levels to increase in a lasting way"".  Empirical studies suggest that people who use gratitude journals feel better about their lives and report fewer symptoms of illness. (Emmons &amp; McCullough, 2003; Doverspike; Emmons Lab.)  However, there's also lots of dubious law of attraction-style writing on the topic, like this:     ""Did you know that appreciation, gratitude and love are the highest   forms of vibration? You can only have one vibration at a time, and if   you are noticing what you appreciate and noticing what you are   grateful for, you can't be noticing what you don't like.""   And although studies find gratitude journals to be beneficial, they disagree on the most beneficial ways to keep one. Psychologist William Doverspike says:     ""A daily gratitude intervention (self-guided exercises) resulted in more positive effects tha[n] did the weekly intervention.""   But Jason Marsh of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley says:     ""Writing occasionally (once or twice per week) is more beneficial than daily journaling. In fact, one study by psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky and her colleagues found that people who wrote in their gratitude journals once a week for six weeks reported boosts in happiness afterward; people who wrote three times per week didn’t.""   So: which is likely to be correct in practice? And what best practices for keeping a gratitude journal can be inferred from other research, either specifically about gratitude or more generally in the cognitive sciences?

1416,Is it harder to perform a difficult act or avoid doing a compelling act?,"Suppose what we have a set of choices [tex]. Also suppose that [tex] consists of two ""difficult"" choices [tex] and [tex] that rely on action and inaction respectively. So [tex]. Is it more difficult to perform [tex] or to not perform [tex]?  For example, let [tex] and [tex]. Is it more difficult to perform [tex] or to not perform [tex]? "
1417,Are mnemonics by creating associations good for memory?,"I read a book which says that to remember the lists of arbitrary objects, we should take a well-known ordered list (so that you know what is on the first place, what is on the second) and associate the items of this familiar list with your target list items. This is especially important for abstract objects because our brain can memorize only visual pictures (you can visualize familiar things). For instance, instead of directly memorizing the 10 abstract amendements to (US) constitution, (1.Freedom of Speech, 2.Right to Bear Arms, 3.Protection From Quartering Troops, 4.Freedom from Unreasonable Search and Seizure, and etc), you translate them into a list of visualizable amendment images, (1. Speaker, 2. Gun, 3. Soldier, 4. Spotlight, 5. A picture of you, 6. Judge riding a fast motorcycle, 7. Jury, 8. Excessive amount of money, 9. Making a right turn with your hand over your mouth, 10. State Capitol building). Then, you come up with another, well-known list of visualizable loci objects, e.g. (head top, nose, mouth, ribs, liver, joint, cap, fibula, ball, sand),    Finally, you invent 10 stories, to map the loci items to the amendment images. In overall, ordered loci list serves as a list of keys that we can iterate and, by means of vivid stories, map to the target abstract items.   Yet, I see that you memorize 4 lists (original list, keys and images and stories) in place of single amendment list alone. This is 4x more information. It would be ok if the associations were natural and teach me the world around me. However, they must be absolutely bizzare because they do not exist, unnatural and, secondly, the outlandish pictures are much better memorizable (they call this thinking out-of-the-box)     Also, inventing the stories is too creative task for me. I feel like I waste too much mental energy to create garbage, the stupid associations in my head. Is it right? Won't this mnemotechnique create a mess in my head?  ps  Idriz Zogaj, Daniel Kilov and Joshua Foer are memory athletes that popularize the approach in TED conference. "

1420,Is extreme empathy and compassion considered a disorder?,"Can extreme empathy and compassion get to a point where it is considered a disorder?  For example, if someone is so empathetic, when feeling someones pain it negatively affects their life to the same extent as the person they are feeling for?  Or that someone is so compassionate, that they make choices that ignores their own health and well being because they are taking care of others?  Is this ever diagnosed and if not, why? "
1421,Has anyone done a thorough comparative review of psychotherapeutic approaches?,"Have the efficacy of different psychotherapeutic approaches--e.g., ACT, CBT, DBT, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, Behavioral--been compared?  I'm sure each approach may be more or less effective depending on the individual and the issue being addressed, however, even a qualified comparative review would be helpful to a practitioner (or patient).  Does such a review exist?   "
1422,What makes some criminals glamorous to others?,"Some murderers are glamorized by society while others labeled monsters.  In both cases, they can commit the same terrible crimes and cause the same amounts of pain - yet one can be romanticized the other not.   In extreme cases, some serial murders receive wedding proposals.   How does cognitive science classify this attraction?   Is it just based on the way the criminal looks?   Does physical attraction override reason even to this extent?  When is it ever considered a normal behavior and why? "
1423,Do laypeople think lifestyle changes are effective at preventing and treating disease?,"I'm curious about how laypeople think about healthy lifestyle changes (like eating well, not smoking, exercising) that are scientifically known to help prevent and treat a number of diseases. People are notoriously bad about using such lifestyle changes for a variety of psychological reasons.  Could part of the problem be that they don't believe lifestyle changes are effective? Is there any literature on this? I did look around a bit myself, but did not find anything directly relevant. "
1424,Eating disorders and childhood sexual abuse,"It is my understanding that extreme eating disorders such as bulimia are very intertwined with childhood sexual abuse. Just how strong is that link?  I have a relative who is killing herself with binge drinking and vomiting after almost every meal. If something doesn't give (and soon) she will be dead. I've asked her point blank (as in, ""who molested you and when?"") but she denies it. What are the odds that I'm barking up the wrong tree? "
1425,How accurate is this explanation of memory?,"I'm no cognitive scientist, and this video I'm about to cite is certainly not claiming to be a good cog sci resource, but I have done some studying up on neurology and some of the parts of this guy's (detailed) explanation of how memory works seems different from what I understood.   The video: Film Theory: How to KILL DEADPOOL! (at 6:03) probably gave 85% (or 99%?) of the 7.7 million viewers who watched it the most detailed explanation they'd ever received of how memory works. I'm just curious to know how much of his explanation is accurate.   So, how accurate is this explanation of memory? "
1426,Can the effectiveness of antidepressants be explained by a placebo effect?,"A friend of mine showed me a paper (Kirsch, 2014) where the author claims that antidepressants work mostly through a placebo effect (backed up with relevant citations). Antidepressants are generally serotonin enhancers and their mechanism of action hinges on the premise that there is a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain. But not only do they not work significantly  better than placebos, but also there are antidepressants that do not enhance serotonin but suppress it. There are some that do nothing to serotonin at all, but their therapeutic effects are all the same, according to Hirsch. So the effect is independent of the chemical composition. That means the chemical imbalance theory is wrong. Is my understanding, as a layperson, correct?  If all of this is legitimate, does that makes any sense to take medicines for an ADHD patient as well? I mean, does the placebo effect, if true, affect ADHD patients, too?  I fear that if people get to see this paper, they may misinterpret the results and may refuse to go to a psychiatrist and get treated even if they have legitimate issues. This is alarming, IMO.

1428,What is the relationship between visual attention network and visual stream (Two-streams hypothesis)?,"There are two visual attention networks proposed by Maurizio Corbetta and Gordon L. Shulman (2002). These are top-down and bottom-up attention networks.     One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected.   There are also two ventral streams proposed by Melvyn A. Goodale and A. David Milner (1992). These are ventral stream and dorsal stream.     We propose that the ventral stream of projections from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex plays the major role in the perceptual identification of objects, while the dorsal stream projecting from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region mediates the required sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at such objects.   My question: What is the relationship between these two proposed networks? As in do they affect each other, or is one a preliminary network that occurs before the other? There have been studies on this but I am having difficulty making sense of them.  Example: Visual streams and shifting attention (Brown 2009) [website]  To gain insight into the relationship between M/dorsal and P/ventral activity and deploying visual attention, we used a covert cuing paradigm to manipulate attention while bottom-up and top-down perceptual stimulus variables created M/dorsal and P/ventral-biased conditions. One study examined the object advantage, where responses are faster for within-relative to equidistant between-object shifts of attention. Visual stream contributions to object- and spaced-based attention were revealed using psychophysically equiluminant conditions expected to reduce M/dorsal activity. Other studies investigating visual stream contributions to location-based inhibition of return (IOR) used IOR magnitude as an indicator of the ease or difficulty of deploying spatial attention. Greater IOR was found under P/ventral-biased conditions. Less IOR was found under M/dorsal-biased conditions.   "
1429,How do you call the cognitive bias of not seeing self as the common denominator?,"Imagine an Italian person is living in London. A poll on the street asks them to estimate the total number of Italians in London. This person then gives a highly incorrect, overblown guess. It's simply common for people of a single nationality to notice each other in the crowd or go to the same places, so it's somewhat likely that one would have an inflated estimate in their heads.  Another example would be a ""reverse physical attractiveness stereotype"": a person holding the belief that ""all people are friendly"". However in reality this could be explained by the fact that the person holding the belief is highly attractive.  How do you call this bias? Selection bias seems close, but is there something more specific? "
1430,"If the color black reflects no light, how are we able to see it?","If color as we perceive it is dependent on the wave lengths that are reflected by an object, with white reflecting all hues and black absorbing all, how do we detect a black object?

1431,Does homosexuality correlate with narcissism or finding yourself attractive?,"I'm a heterosexual male. Male bodies do not appeal to me much. I find my own (average) body mediocre. At the same time I find average female bodies rather interesting and attractive. The same goes for faces and ""male"" and ""female"" character traits. So I wonder how homosexuals judge themselves.  Since gay men and lesbian women are attracted to bodies, faces and possibly personalities of the same sex, maybe they find their own bodies, faces and personality more aggreeable on average than the heterosexual, for whom persons of their own kind must by definition lack at least some aspects of attractiveness (i.e. the sexual and erotic appeal).  If this is so, then maybe traits like narcissism are more frequent and disorders like body dysmophic disorder are less frequent among homosexuals. In general terms:  Do homosexuals like themselves more than heterosexuals?  where ""liking"" includes anything from feeling attractive to disorders such as narcissism.  Or doesn't sexual orientation moderate ""self-love"" at all? "
1432,"is Lewin's field theory still used in modern psychology? If yes, what are its applications?","I recently stumbled upon Kurt Lewin's field theory. However, not being very familiar with gestalt psychology, I could not assess whether Lewin's theoretical framework is still used today and if yes, what its applications are.  In other words: Is it still a recognised psychological theory? If yes, what are its application in psychological research and applied psychology? If no: Is it because Lewin's ideas have been proven wrong, because they've been forgotten or because they were never actually accepted within psychology? "

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
1434,EPSP/IPSP amplitude values?,"I'm working with a Hodgkin-Huxley model that receives synaptic inputs from presynaptic neurons. If it receives a spike from an excitatory presynaptic neuron, the voltage of my HH neuron inceases by an amount [tex]. If it receives a spike from an inhibitory neuron, the voltage jumps down by an amount [tex] (so K is the factor controlling how much the voltage drops relative to how much it would increase from an excitatory neuron). I read in textbooks that the ratio of excitatory:inhibitory neurons is generally [tex]. That implies that for the system to be ""balanced"", I should have [tex]. If [tex], then there is a net drift upwards in voltage towards the threshold values, and for [tex], there is a net drift downwards away from the threshold.   I have two sub-questions:  1) Is there a typical value of [tex] (the EPSP amplitude) that is biologically plausible? I've seen anywhere from [tex] and above which is quite a big range. I know that there is often a big range based on stimulus and whatnot, but I'm looking for a biologically reasonable value.  2) What is a typical value of [tex]? In other words, what is the size of a typical IPSP amplitude relative to the EPSP amplitude? I've seen anywhere from the amplitude being the same to the amplitude being 4x the EPSP amplitude (which of course is a mighty big range). "

By silent recognition, I mean any method which does not require actual phonation, although most of the such methods will come under electrophysiology. "
1436,Is it possible to read words a person thinking about via EEG headsets?,"There are now a number of EEG headsets that can capture bran signals and give you raw EEG data from brain. EPOC Emotiv is one the famous one with I guess 14 channel. Now as the title of this post reads, my question is if it is really possible to analyze the raw data and print out what the person is trying to say without speaking? There is a difference between it's not possible and it's too hard to extract the data. From my understanding so far, the signals are different from person to person so perhaps there could be a training program so that the person can train it as to what word he or she meant and the program later can detect the meaning of that particular signal. Is this really possible? If it's hard, how hard it is?  "

1438,"IQ, Intelligence and Critical Thinking","I consider myself to be a very critical and analytical thinker. I can't help obsess over every little detail, consider various perspectives, use-cases, etc. I've been programming since a young age (self-taught). At the same time, I have ADHD and a bad working memory.  If I master something, I find that I can think critically and outside the box much better than someone else. I can utilise it better, build upon it better, etc.  Because of my bad short term memory, I assume i will do generally bad in IQ tests and this is not surprising.   Because of my bad memory, it might take me longer to master something than someone else.   Do IQ tests measure critical thinking ability at all? Or just working memory? IQ and working memory are highly correlated.  "
1439,A mind experiment about probability,"Consider a mind experiment: you are stuck inside a trapped room. There are only two ways for you to go out and you have to choose one. Would you rather go through four traps each with 20% chance of killing you (80% chance to survive each trap), or one trap that has 58% chance of killing you (42% chance to survive the only trap)?  Intuitively I would undoubtedly choose the first option although mathematically I should choose the second option, since mathematically the chances of surviving in the first option is only 40.96%.  Imagining being trapped in such a room, I can easily see myself walk through the four 80% traps one by one without much trouble. But I cannot imagine myself walk through the 42% trap alive without some good luck.  Here are two things I want to know:   Is my intuition similar to most people or not? If this is indeed the most natural intuition, what is the cause that it is different from the mathematical result?  "

Or if there would even be a more accurate solution than using one of theses two? And how is the measurement of the keystroke duration. I've been searching for it but haven't found any data for windows. The only thing I found are these tests Has someone stumbled across a publication regarding the accuracy?  Moreover I don’t know how good RAM and CPU would need to be, right know I am using an ASUS notebook with Intel Core i7 2.6 GHz and 16GB RAM, (Bluetooth, Ethernet. Wi-Fi, Mobile and other kind of connections disabled; desktop visual effects disabled; antivirus, software updates, background programs, and other kind of asynchronous events sources disabled) and the last version of PsychoPy2.  I tried to do preliminary tests to measure the accuracy of my test and to measure the keystroke duration with Psychopy and my keyboard simulating device. Before renting more expensive equipment, I've tried to pretest the accuracy with a 60 fps camera recording the moment of touch and without touch to the device and measuring with Psychopy at the same, to be able to compare these to values to have the accuracy. The 60 fps means, that in between frames there are 16.67 ms. My cheap camera pretest showed, that most of the processing time would be a maximum of approximately 8ms, so that I think I will achieve even lower values with better recording equipment with a higher framerate. But approximately every tenth measurement I have 24-36 ms signal processing.  My questions summarized:   Does anyone know, what the reason might be that approximately every tenth measurement has higher signal processing times? How could I make the measurement of the keystroke duration more accurate? Has anyone measured the keystroke duration accuracy of psychopys2 different functions (e.g iohub and pyglet) in windows himself or stumbled upon literature about this?  "
1441,Can you read in your dreams?,"I had a dream this morning. In my dream, I was using my laptop and I read a fan fiction in the internet. I have never read that fan fiction before (on principle I don't read fan fiction of that particular franchise). Furthermore, the writing style was very unlike me (I would vehemently deny it if such style was attributed to me). Also, the story if that fan fiction is not my particular head canon (if I did decide to write fan fiction, it wouldn't be that particular story).     Also, there were comments on the fan fiction which seemed very organic (the comments espoused a wide variety of opinions on the fan fiction), and contributed to the authenticity.     I did not bother searching for the story of the fan fiction to see if it actually exists, because I felt it was a pointless venture; I haven't read any fan fiction of that particular franchise.  I have read that you cannot read in dreams, and that contradicts my experience.        Can you read in dreams?  Why?    An explanation for my particular dream?   "

1445,Use of the visual cortex in mathematical thinking?,"In modern computers (and programming) one makes alienated use of the high powers of graphical processing units (GPU) for non-graphics-related tasks, enhancing drastically the power of the general purpose central processing units (CPU).  I wonder if any attempts have been made to explain high-performance in abstract (but geometry related) mathematics (by people like William Thurston, Sergej Perelman, Alexander Grothendieck, to name just a few in no specific order) by an extraordinally strong and specific use of the visual cortex (and not only of the associative, speech-related and other parts of the cortex that are usually involved in mathematical thinking). At least the role of ""inner geometric visualization"" is often emphasized (without being completely understood, as I guess - not even what this means).  For example, in his laudation for the Fields medal winner of 1982, William Thurston, C.T.C. Wall says:     Thurston has fantastic geometric insight and vision; his ideas have   completely revolutionized the study of topology in 2 and 3 dimensions,   and brought about a new and fruitful interplay between analysis,   topology and geometry.   So my question is for any study that might have been performed in this direction - or for any theoretical approach that has been made.    [One guiding idea might be the following: Consider the concept of a 5-dimensional hypercube. Just trying hard and often to mentally visualize such a cube (which would correspond to some specific neuronal activities in the visual cortex) would ""improve"" (somehow) mathematical thinking about higher dimensions in other parts of the cortex - even if it's not successfull, i.e. no clear mental picture arises. (Of course, trying to do so would be ""informed"" by those other parts, so dependency is bidirectional.)]     Possible follow-up question (not to be answered here!):      Which characteristics of either the visual cortex or the other parts   of the cortex being concerned with mathematical thinking make it   possible to use the visual cortex in this way (whatever ""this way""   is)? Or could just everyone use it this way?  "

1447,Serializing and deserializing stable states of Hopfield networks,"I am looking for simple artificial neural networks that may perform the following serializing task.  Consider two identical Hopfield networks, one being at rest, the other being in a stable state of acitivity (a subset of its neurons firing synchronously).   The task is to connect these two networks to a serializer and a deserializer network with the serializer  passing only a sequence of signals to the deserializer (along one single line) such that the stable state of the first network will be reconstructed in the second network, just by the specific sequence of signals.  Can be seen at a glance that this task cannot be solved with (de)serializers made out of McCulloch-Pitts neurons alone?   If it can not be solved: which kind of neurons would be needed?  If it can be solved: how (in the most simple way)? (For simplicity's sake you may consider two Hopfield networks of only three MP neurons each.)    Note, that not the total of [tex] (e.g. 3) bits (to describe completely the state of network A) has to be transferred (because of the reconstruction abilities of the identical network B). The other way around: network B might reach the copied state earlier than the end of message arrived. "
1448,Voltage-dependent ion channels as operators,"Does it make sense (or is even the standard approach) to model mathematically a voltage-dependent ion channel not as a function, that maps a voltage to a conductance ([tex]), but as an operator (in the sense of functional analysis), that maps a voltage profile (= function of time = element of a vector space) to a conductance profile (= function of time = element of another vector space)?  Are there references to the literature?  [Considered as operators it would be interesting to know in which ranges (of the vector space of voltage profiles) the channels behave linearly (in mathematical terms: are linear) - so we were done with knowing their behaviour for only a couple of base vectors (= profiles), i.e. square signals of equal height, but different widths. We would learn about rise times and time delays. In other ranges of course they behave quite non-linearily, esp. when the voltage profile crosses the threshold.] "
1449,Effect of plateau in BTSP,"In ""Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields"" by Bittner et al. an alternative to Hebbian plasticity is proposed called Behavioral Time-scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP). Basically, instead of depending on Hebbian plasticity, a calcium-ion plateau can be used to create associations. From the paper:     BTSP can rapidly store the entire sequence of events that occurred for   several seconds before and after plateau-potential initiation within   the synaptic weights of area CA1.   However, despite reading the paper, I'm still confused about the mechanism they think performs this. Does the ""plateau"" cause all spiking neurons to strengthen their connections or does the ""plateau"" use some other mechanism to influence neurons? Is excitation or potentiation even the correct way to understand this? "
1450,What are the criticisms of Jung?,"Jungian psychology seems to have established itself in our culture (books and films draw on its archetypes etc) and, although I am by no means an expert, it seems analytical psychology is broadly considered to have some merit.  What are the main objections, criticisms, and refutations of Jung's ideas?  In particular, are there strong evidence-based contradictions of his ideas? "
1451,Working Memory Timing Information Storage,"In most working-memory tasks, a person is given a list and is asked to recall it in various manners. For example, they could recall it forwards, backwards, freely or try to recall a specific item given it's position.  However, has there been any tests where temporal information is emphasized? For example, consider the scenario where there is 1 second between the presentation of the first and second item in the list, but 2 seconds between the second and third items in the list. I could then ask the person which item was temporally closer to the second item in the list.  Has there been any Working Memory research of this temporal nature? "
1452,What is the cause of differences that are too small to see?,"Consider two identical pieces of paper.  Scenario 1: On both something is drawn in black ink. If the difference between the areas covered in black ink is sufficiently small, I cannot see the difference between the two drawings.   Scenario 2: Now imagine that the same parts are covered with ink, but their color differs. Again, if the difference is sufficiently small, I cannot see the difference.  Firstly: what causes this? I am aware of the terminology of just-noticeable differences/limina, but do not understand precisely what causes them. Is there some discretization of continuous signals going on that causes `nearby signals' to be treated the same way?  Secondly: one person may have better vision than another, but are there physical constraints that are the same for any two persons and that imply that if the difference in scenario 1 or 2 is sufficiently small, no two persons will be able to see a difference?  Addenda: I phrased the question informally by not defining what a `small difference' is, trusting/hoping that this does not lead to confusion. If desired, such statements can be made precise by adopting appropriate distance functions. In scenario 1, one way to measure distance between two areas covered in ink could be to use the Hausdorff distance; likewise, one way to measure the distance between colors in the second scenario could depend on the difference in responsiveness of the three types of cone cells. "
1453,"In the digit span test, why do some strategies work and others don't?","I got a free copy of PEBL, psych experiment software, which includes a couple of standard working memory tests.  When I perform the digit span working memory test, I can repeat the numbers as they appear, and do some basic chunking. For example, I can repeat '3-1-8-4' as ""thirty one"" ""eighty four"". But when I try any other chunking or rehearsal technique I find it impossible to do the task. I think my working memory just empties. My question is why that happens? More specifically -   What cognitive functions do more complex rehearsal and chunking techniques tap into? Is there a means to improve / train those specific cognitive functions? "
1454,Can we identify specific emotions on the basis of fMRI scans?,"I am looking for fMRI studies in which the emotional response of a person listening to music is visible in the fMRI scans, paralleled by a retrospective think aloud report of the person describing his/her emotions while listening. Are there such studies? And did they reveal something comprehensible, i.e. can one see in the fMRI scans how emotions did manifest themselves?  The idea is, that one might be able to distinguish between emotional responses due to characteristic activity patterns or modes, perhaps including the amygdala.   I know of this video with Oliver Sacks being the person, but it disappointed me: we only see that he is emotionally touched stronger by Bach than by Beethoven. But - as I have the impression - we cannot distinguish between positive and negative emotions by just looking at the fMRI scans, can we? "
1455,Ligand-gated ion channels as operators,"Isn't there a perfect analogy between ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels considered (mathematically) as (non-linear) operators, mapping one function (of time) to another one? Voltage-gated channels respond to voltage signals (= functions of time at a given location, not just a voltage), ligand-gated channels respond to neurotransmitter signals (not just neurotransmitters). Both yield a conductance profile (as a function of time, not just a conductance).   Both ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels display some form of hysteresis, i.e. the dependence of the state of a system on its history. Hysteresis can not be modelled by simple mathematical functions (by which dependencies normally are modelled), but maybe better by some non-linear operators.   With respect to the Hodgkin-Huxley model (that AliceD mentions in her answer): In this model (that is also used by Rall) the resistances (= ion channels) are just switched on and off instantaneously. But this may be oversimplified: it takes some time, and it cannot be done with arbitrary frequency. That's why we possibly need operators to describe them.  My question is: Are there references where ligand-gated channels are modelled mathematically as (non-linear) operators? "
1456,What causes people to betray each other when facing the prisoner's dilemma?,"When confronted with the Prisoner's Dilemma, people often refuse to cooperate. Instead, they choose to betray other people, even when cooperation yields a more favorable outcome.   Why do people behave in that way? Is it a genealogical feature which is embedded during evolution?  "
1457,Are studies included in most meta-analyses based on a narrow range of participants?,"This question is mostly quoted from A New Psychology of Women (2017) by Lips, page 63:     Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the studies included in most meta-analyses are based on a narrow range of participants (usually young, North American students) and are not reflective of the populations at large--although this limitation tends to be obscured by the combination of many studies into a single analysis (Halpern, 1995).    I mean, this claim is more than 20 years old. Is it true today? Is there a study that examines the demographics of meta-studies at large or something related? If it is true, is this the case for most psychology research, male-female differences or all studies in the social sciences? "
1458,How can tacit knowledge be measured?,"Question 1: If tacit knowledge is that which can't be written as declarative facts or communicated easily, then how can scientists measure how much of it someone has in a lab?  Question 2: Is it true that tacit knowledge can never be declarative or written down?  Example: Knowledge like ""never tell your immediate boss in this organization what you feel about TPS reports, or you won't be able to get your complaint past upper management"" seems like tacit knowledge. But yet it's written down as a declarative fact. "
1459,"During body-scan ('sweeping') meditation, what does brain-imaging (e.g. fMRI) look like?","I do not know how extensive body scans have been studied with brain-imaging techniques, e.g. fMRI.  Body scan is a meditation technique developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. It was derived from a meditation practice ('sweeping') of the Burmese U Ba Khin tradition.      ""It involves systematically sweeping through the body with the mind,   bringing an affectionate, openhearted, interested attention to its   various regions, customarily starting from the toes of the left foot   and then moving through the entirety of the foot [...] From there, the   focus moves into, successively, and slowly, the entirety of the pelvic   region, including the buttocks and the genitals [...] and finally, to   the face and head.""      ""We are systematically and intentionally moving our attention through   the body, attending to the various sensations in the different   regions. That we can attend to these body sensations at all is quite   remarkable. That we can do it at will, either impulsively or in a more   disciplined systematic way, is even more so.""      ""We might describe what we are doing during a body scan as tuning in   or opening to those sensations, allowing ourselves to become aware of   what is already unfolding.""   I found it quite easy to practice and had interesting and unusual experiences (mostly pleasant).  My question is: Would any brain and brain-imaging expert - given this description - dare to guess roughly how a body scan may look like in a ""brain scanner"", e.g. recorded with fMRI?  I am not such an expert, nevertheless I dare to guess.  Presumably, a body scan will - mainly but not solely - take place in the areas of the cortical homunculus in the primary motor and sensory cortices.    I would guess that it is here that most of body scan related neural activity will occur. But in which manner: how will activity evolve and literally move around, how will it look like in the ""brain scanner""?  Five possibilities come to my mind:   Experts and laymen will see nothing but a generally increased, enigmatically billowing activity of the cortical homunculus. An expert would see some significant patterns, but only vague and hard to communicate. Even the layman could see something:   an overall increased activity of the cortical homunculus with somehow changing peaks of activity (highlights, representing the body region the attentional focus is currently on) a mostly ""dark"" cortical homunculus with a wandering spotlight of activity  a mostly dark cortical homunculus with a fading-in/fading-out spotlight every now and then    Which of these possibilities do you - as a brain and/or brain-imaging expert - consider the most probable one? Other possibilities are welcome!  And of course hints to studies where this question has been experimentally attacked.  (I found one study but didn't delve deeper into it: there are too few images in it.) "
1460,How to understand what a low score or high score is for a particular measure?,"I am trying to use a survey tool to recommend a particular decision.  In my case, I am using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; link here: [website]Lastly, it should be useful to note that from the research paper I linked, I don't yet know the mean values/percentiles, so if that is the right answer, using an example referencing the paper would be most beneficial to my problem.  "
1461,Relation of confidence and problem solving ability,"My personal experiences have shown me multiple times that by only boosting my confidence in my ability to solve a problem,  without gaining any additional knowledge, I was able to solve it!  My question is, has this been studied that to what extent our confidence in our abilities can help us to find a solution for a problem?  If so, can you please provide a link? "
1462,What is the psychological effect of wearing black clothes?,"Background: I read that black is usually favored by people who are dominant. I read that the black color projects dominance, and also hides the person's feelings. Police, for example, adopt black as a color.  However, I also read that black can demonstrate submissiveness. Priests wear black clothes to show submissiveness to God. In addition, sales people and business people who work with clients often wear black suits. Are they trying to appear dominant or submissive?   What is the psychology of wearing black? Does wearing black communicate dominance or submissiveness?  "
1463,Difficulty of expressing thoughts verbally,"Some people find it difficult to express their thoughts verbally. They may often feel that their words don't give their thoughts enough justice, and that their thoughts could've been verbalized better.   What can the causes for this be? Can it be ""cured"" or alleviated, maybe by reading, and participating in conversations?  "
1464,"Thinking, Fast and Slow vs. Mindfulness vs. Flow","I've been wondering how dual-process theory, which is described in Daniel Kahneman's book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"", relates to mindfulness and the state of being in the present moment and the flow experiences coined by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.   Dual-process theory describes two different ways the brain forms thoughts, as described on Wikipedia:         System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic,    subconscious    System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical,    calculating, conscious       Mindfulness is defined on Wikipedia as follows:      Mindfulness is ""the intentional, accepting and non-judgmental focus of   one's attention on the emotions, thoughts and sensations occurring in   the present moment"", which can be trained by meditational practices.    The flow or zone experiences, on the other hand, are defined as follows:      In positive psychology, flow, also known as zone, is the mental state   of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully   immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and   enjoyment in the process of the activity.   How do these relate? Do they overlap, mutually exclude each other or are the same thing or can exist at the same time independently?  Are there any brain studies that would compare the brain's response under each of those states? "
1465,How can we scientifically measure love?,"I want to understand the psychology of love, and I found the Triangular Theory of Love on Wikipedia from this question, which I think is very believable. However, there is a big section on mixed support where it only says a little bit about THAT love was measured, not HOW:     ""Sternberg measured his theory on couples who were roughly the same age (mean age of 28) and whose relationship duration was roughly the same (4 to 5 years).""      ""The two other most obvious problems with Sternberg's theory of love are as follows. The first is a question of the separate nature of the levels of love. The second is a question of the measures that have previously been used to assess the three levels of love.""   Can we scientifically measure love (without just asking the lovers)? How? "
1466,Why are counsellors not supposed to give advice or lead the client? Is it possible for a counsellor not to be leading?,"I’ve taken a course on counselling psychology and have attended a counselling sessions myself. All the literature I’ve read has said counsellors should not give advice. My question is why is this possible?   I know when talking to a counsellor they think they’re being self-empowering by not “giving advice” or asking leading questions, but I don’t believe it’s possible to have a neutral conversation with someone where they have no effect over you. In a sense, is the way councillors/psychologists speaking to people actually underhanded as they try to dress-up advice as non-advice? I know at advance stages of counselling the counsellor is supposed to challenge the client’s incongruent views. Which views the councillor challenges are up to him, so that’s exerting change on the client. Wouldn't it be better for a councillor to clearly say what he thinks instead of trying to trick a client into thinking they came up with the idea? For example if a counsellor says “you’ve listed many bad qualities about your girlfriend” while this may be a fact, the councillor is trying to steer you in a certain direction. Wouldn’t it be more honest to say “you’ve listed many bad qualities about your girlfriend, maybe you should breakup with her?” even though the breaking up bit is considered advice?  UPDATE: I think I've finally found the words to express what I'm thinking. I know councilors are not supposed to give advice and act in a very ""neutral way"" as to allow the client to sort things out for them self, as this is seen as self empowering. It's been my observation that councilors (inadvertently) just find ways to mask what they are asserting as a question or a seemingly neutral statement. For example, client ""my neighbor was parked in my drive way and it made me late for work"", councilor ""I could see how that would make a person mad"" (this implies the correct response would be mad). client: ""my date cancelled on me"", councilor ""do you feel let down?"" (this is planting the idea in his head). Now wouldn't it be better if the councilor gave advice like ""there are plenty of fish in the sea"". I know councilors are not trained to ask leading questions or make leading comments, but as humans, I believe it is inevitable to do this, and it's much better just to say something directly than to (subconsciously) think up a way to hint at it. "
1467,Continuous Basic EEG analysis,"So, I have continuous EEG data from a control group and a test group. The recording was done while the participants were at rest, so no task was performed.  I want to start with some basic analysis, but I am not really sure how to give the first step. The recordings are ~5hours long. I believe it is best to segment the data. Should I perform the analysis on each segment? How do I combine the data of the whole group and then compare it with the other group?  I just started to work with EEG and none of the papers show a clear ""tutorial"" on how to do these basic steps. Any papers or books you could recommend would be of great help!  "
1468,A measure of creativity from mind maps,I have an experiment with 500 students who where asked to solve a general problem.  Each student had the assignment to find as many solutions as possible to the problem in 15 minutes. Solutions where submitted in the form of mind maps (where each node represents a possible solution and connections between nodes are also possible). 500 maps are available for evaluation. All the students were previously trained about the use of mind maps.  The objective would be to get a reliable proxy of each student creativity from their outputs. I'm not sure if this is possible or if the approach is just wrong and one should use a more accepted test to measure creativity. No other test scores are available for this sample.   We are thinking about different approaches such as:   counting the number of generated ideas; using experts to evaluate the characteristics of the creative outputs.   Is there any paper related to the issue? Or any accepted method that could be used to evaluate creativty of the students? 
1469,"The ""Backwards Bike"" and implications for how we think","Here's a video of a guy learning to ride a ""backwards bike"", if you turn the handles left, then the wheel goes right. It took the guy forever to learn to ride a backward bike. He kept remarking that ""any disturbance would make is brain switch back to the old 'normal' bike control system"".   Later in the video, he did something amazing. He tried to ride a normal bike and apparently no longer could. Then after about 20 minutes worth of trying and failing utterly, suddenly the understanding of a normal bike snapped back into his mind, and in the span of about 30 seconds he could ride the bike easily. How did that sudden change happen? What state was his mind in that he couldn't reach back to the old system? And then what suddenly happened so that he was able to?  More generally, is there any research in this area? I think it would be awesome to hook up an EEG to someone and watch as they make this mental leap from one control system to another. Has this ever been done?  Note here (because there appears to be some confusion) that I'm not so much interested in brain plasticity or negative transfer. Those are interesting in their own right, but for this question I'm most interested in the ""switch back"" phenomenon. Why was the individual somehow blocked from reaching the normal bike control system, and how did this barrier so suddenly and so drastically disappear? Apparently there are now two systems in his brain, and they are somehow quarantined from one another. What mechanism makes this possible? And why would such a mechanism be beneficial?  I realize now that I have experienced the same phenomenon with language. I studied Spanish in high school and was pretty good at it. But after learning Japanese it's difficult to ""jump"" back into Spanish speaking mode. And if I'm in Spanish speaking mode it's hard to jump back to Spanish. "
1470,Can observing neutral objects prime the brain to integrate them into new ideas in the waking state?,"I'm aware of a few concepts, primarily from dream research, which indicate that dreams feature or integrate observed objects from the past several days into dream content.   For example, seeing a bike commercial can make a person dream of riding a bike; finding a molten piece of chocolate in one's pocket can make one dream of something brown and sticky. The colloquial term for this phenomenon is ""day residue"", invented by Freud.   Anecdotal evidence from my own life makes me question if something similar happens in the waking state. Do events from the past few days ""prime"" the brain to create new ideas based on those events?  Have there been studies that demonstrated that exposing a person to emotionally neutral objects causes them to come up with ideas related to those objects in the next few days? For example, is seeing art supplies more likely people to start an art project? "
1471,Is there a specific name for the emotion I'm feeling?,"I looked around and it doesn't seem to match the definition of guilt NOR shame.   I made up a lie that works this way:  1.Tell people someone I made up is ""special,"" ""unique,"" and a variety of other things.  2.Lock myself in a paradigm where I both know and don't know I am this person in some way to gain approval or represent my true feelings under the guise of this person expressing them.  3.When people speak of this person, I can somewhat ""feel"" what that person would. So if I feel like a massive loser, I lie and tell people that ""X"" person did something amazing so that when they talk good about them, I can somehow know it links back to me even though I won't admit it to myself.  I've been lying to myself for years and doing it so much that I sometimes hardly realize that it's untrue, or have trained myself so much that it's like it was true and I am conditioned to not admit it's false to myself. Whatever ""X"" person does, I can take credit, so it gives my life some meaning, even if it's not real and I won't consciously admit it or have deluded myself into accepting this.  But I've been doing this with my mother lately and I fear I can't tell her the truth about all of the lies and fake stuff I've told her about this person, and it's making me feel bad but I have no idea how to categorize this emotion. Is it just simply ""bad emotional feeling?"" Is it guilt and shame? I have no idea. My emotions have always been a mystery to me since I never know what I'm feeling. "
1472,"Why does ""six months"" seem like a ""long time"" even when it isn't?","Background: I had a (rental) property  that I was planning to put up for sale. Then I ""changed my mind"" and said that I wanted to wait for the current year's appreciation, and sell in ""six months"" (from the time our conversation took place in early March). The realtor promised to get back to me in six months. That would have been September.  I called back the realtor almost two months later. He was surprised to hear from me so soon. He said,"" I thought you wanted to sell in ""six months."" I said, yes, but we need three months' lead time. Two months to give the tenant 60 days' notice (May and June), under Oregon law, and one month to clean up the place (July). That would give us a target sale date of August (instead of September, originally). OK, I had moved up the sale date one month, but the real issue was three months' lead time.  I had a similar conversation with the property manager, who notified the tenant in March when I first intended to sell, then assured her that this would not happen for a ""long time."" Now we have to tell the tenant that the notice is ""imminent.""  General Question  What are the cognitive processes of how people measure time, and form a view as to whether or not six months is a ""long time? Could the above be an application of e.g. Vierordt's Law, where short intervals are overestimated and longer intervals are underestimated? "

1474,"In the theory of planned behaviour, what is the general term that captures attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control?","The theory of planned behaviour is a model of behaviour that in simple terms assumes that attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioural control influence intention, and intention and actual control influence behavior.  I'm writing a paper that includes a measures of personality and a measure of the theory of planned behaviour. I sometimes need to refer to the variables attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioural control as a set. In particular, I often need to distinguish these variables from the personality variables. However, it typically seems a bit verbose to have to say ""attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioural control"" all the time.  Question:   What is a general word or short phrase to capture attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioural control? Update: Even if it is better to generally refer to the three variables individually, what term describes this set of variables or what makes them distinct from other kinds of psychological variables like personality, intention, etc.?  "
1475,Why do people look in the face or eyes while communicating?,"While communicating, people tend to direct their gazes to the face (particularly eyes) of people. Why don't rather we look at their neck or just their chest or even their hair while communicating with people? What are we looking for?   A sign, a hint about that person's thoughts. Obviously that is the case ,but on the other hand, I think there is something more about that. Take those movie scenes in which people's head cut off their shoulder and they are still alive. I think the whole body doesn't seem human to me, whereas the head seems definitely so. Is it just a stable reference point that we've picked after centuries, or is it a native property specialized for a certain purpose of human kind? "
1476,"Are scintillating scotomas really caused by cortical spreading depression? If so, how is this known to be true?","I have just read about a visual effect called a scintillating scotoma.     Many variations occur, but scintillating scotoma usually begins as a spot of flickering light near or in the center of the visual field, which prevents vision within the scotoma area. The affected area flickers but is not dark. It then gradually expands outward from the initial spot. Vision remains normal beyond the borders of the expanding scotoma(s), with objects melting into the scotoma area background similarly to the physiological blind spot, which means that objects may be seen better by not looking directly at them in the early stages when the spot is in or near the center.       [...]The visual anomaly results from abnormal functioning of portions of the occipital cortex at the back of the brain, not in the eyes nor any component thereof, such as the retinas.3 This is a different disease from retinal migraine, which is monocular (only one eye).   It is a phenomenon that is believed to occur in the brain.      Scintillating scotomas are most commonly caused by cortical spreading depression, a pattern of changes in the behavior of nerves in the brain during a migraine.   That article is short and includes an impressive looking GIF of an optical image of the brain showing a wave-like pattern of blood volume which seems to come from the YouTube video Spreading Depolarization viewed using IOS. Santos et al. Neuroimage 2014 which links to Santos, E. et al. Radial, spiral and reverberating waves of spreading depolarization occur in the gyrencephalic brain NeuroImage, 99, 1 Oct. 2014, pp244-255.  The first Wikipedia article also says:     Symptoms typically appear gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and generally last fewer than 60 minutes, leading to the headache in classic migraine with aura, or resolving without consequence in acephalgic migraine. Many migraine sufferers change from scintillating scotoma as a prodrome to migraine to scintillating scotoma without migraine. Typically the scotoma resolves spontaneously within the stated time frame, leaving no subsequent symptoms, though some report fatigue, nausea, and dizziness as sequelae.   I don't completely understand the language there; I am not sure if it means that scintillating scotoma is always associated with some kind of migraine, or if they also occur as isolated events.  QUESTION: Why is it believed, or how is it known (if it is) that scintillating scotomas are caused by cortical spreading depression? Are these always related to some kind of migraine?

1477,Averaging a linear or nonlinear function treatment,"In a hypothetical PET study, my sample consists of a clinical population which exhibit brain hypermetabolism. I divide my sample into two homogenous groups. One receives a treatment whereas the other does not (control). My analysis is a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design with treatment  (receive treatment, doesn't receive treatment) as the between groups factor and treatment status (pretest, postest) as the within-subjects factor.  The treatment group complete a cognitive task which is expected to reduce the brain hypermetabolism to almost nothing but return to elevated hypermetabolism in up to 2 minutes. In other words, the cognitive task reduces the activity for a short amount of time but slowly the brain hypermetabolism will return to the elevated levels that distinguish our clinical sample. It is not known whether this regression to pretreatment levels will be linear or non linear.  In my design I compare group averages in brain hypermetabolism in the treatment vs. control group pretest and posttest. There should be no difference in our control group in the pretest and posttest stages, but there should be a significant difference in the treatment group.  My question is, is there a standard procedure for obtaining group averages on a linear function? If we know that the brain hypermetabolism returns in &lt;2 minutes, should we average the value of the line across 2 minutes? 1 minute? At the participant level? At the group level?  Alternatively, instead of working out an average, should one calculate the slope of the lines in treatment vs. non-treatment conditions and compare these?  I would much appreciate citations to handle such procedures. "
1478,How are schamata represented in Cognitive Load Theory,"I come across papers that say things like ""if the new information is compatible with the schema, it is accepted"".  I'm not clear on how schemata are represented by theorists in order to make this claim.  For instance, what does ""compatible"" mean?  What are the processes that are modeled by theorists that begin with ""new information"" and end with ""accepted""?   "
1479,What is the current gold standard in double locked storage of therapeutic records?,"I am asking this question in the context of a U.S. (Massachusetts) psychologist performing IPA studies. The interviews will be conducted through Zoom mostly. The recorded interviews will be stored the only way they can be, which is digitally. Has anyone found a specific resource describing how psychologists have dealt with the confidentiality concerns of digital information storage? It used to be that the gold standard for double-locked storage of therapeutic records was to put them in a locked file cabinet or locked room in a locked building. Now that we have electronic records, what are people doing about that? Is it enough to:   Put the electronic storage device (laptop, hard drive, flash drive, whatever) inside a locked room in a locked house? Password protect the storage device, and put it in a locked building Password protect the storage device, and password protect the folder/file Something else?   And what about files in the cloud? Is that a no-no, or is the password protection there sufficient for one of the locks? "

1481,"How to compare effectiveness of psychological treatment for psychological illness, versus medical treatment for medical illness?","I'm a college student. I read somewhere that people often assume that mental health issues do not get better, and that a person ends up seeing a psychiatrist forever. So I was wondering if there was a way to compare treatments for medical vs psychological issues.   Like let's say we pick 10 common physical illnesses and 10 common psychological illnesses. And then look at best treatments for each. For instance, assume sinus infections are the top physical illness and depression is the most common mental illness. Further assume that the best treatment for depression is CBT, and for sinus infection is nasal corticosteroids. How would I go about comparing the effectiveness of  corticosteroids for sinus infections versus CBT for depression?

1483,Intrinsic relevance of ERP polarity: 'negativity' vs 'positivity',"I know that polarity in a EEG signal is arbitrary, and a matter of convention, as clearly explained in this past question.  However, assuming said conventions are well-followed, I wonder whether is there any intrinsic meaning at all to a particular ERP/component being described (as they often are in the literature) as either a positivity or a negativity?   It seems indeed that this aspect (voltage polarity) is a salient-enough feature of EEG components, that they are metonymically referred to by this very feature, e.g. ""this positivity is associated with cognitive process X"", as if the component's sign was just as important as its latency and absolute-value amplitude (which are of course not arbitrary, and clearly meaningful).  Some papers (e.g. Koelsch et al 2005) seem to suggest that some cognitive tasks (e.g. perceiving some deviance in a stimulus) is only associated with one specific polarity, in this case negative:     (..)it is also possible that any kind of deviance-related negativity   has an effect on linguistic syntax processing.   To sum up: is there any intrinsic meaning at all to be found in a ERP's polarity? "

1485,What's that vulnerability/weakness of human psychology which is consciously/subconsciously utilized by politicians or people with authority/fame?,"Below is just an example:  I am from India and I remember that we were promised by our PM, Narendra Modi, that he would bring all the black money from Swiss banks and he will deposit around 15 lac INR into every Indian citizen's account.   Like this, he made a lot of promises. He said ""good days will come"" in 2014 and most of these promises are have not yet been fulfilled, but still most of the people are highly impressed by him.  I know that he is a good orator, but what I don't know is, what is the weakness of ""Being impressed and convinced and remain the same over the time"" is called? And why sometimes the realization takes time to come? "
1486,How to encourage people to experiment/try new things?,"In a New York Times op-ed, Sendhil Mullainathan (professor of economics at Harvard) laments that it is difficult to get people to try new things or experiment. He gives himself as an example, saying that it is difficult for him to try generic soda, even though the cost to him is low, and he drinks 2 liters of Diet Coke daily. However, his article has a relative lack of references to literature on past efforts to get people to try new things.  What methods have been studied to get people to try new things/experiment (without forcing them)? What has worked, and what has been less successful? "

1488,"Excessive empathy, social cues and adaptive behavior evaluation","An article by Gunnar Bartsch of  Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, JMU started me on this line of inquiry.  The original source is no longer available but has been reproduced at ScienceDaily (Bartsch, n.d.)  We generally accept the concept of Compassion Fatigue and Secondary Trauma as an individual choosing to over-do it with regard to empathy and hence the recommendation of better boundaries and self care. I have many studies...saying our Aspergers and ADHD kids have problem with social skills because of low empathy what if the kid falls at the high empathy end of the spectrum?

(Miller et al., 1994)*.   If derealization can be induced by repeating ones own name, I'm wondering if repeating the phrase ""I am me"" causes derealization as well?  Semantic satiation (also semantic saturation) is a psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener"" or is it the state of hyper meta-cognition that makes everything seem foreign? Or maybe it's both?  References  Miller, P. P., Brown, T. A., DiNardo, P. A., &amp; Barlow, D. H. (1994).

1490,"Can you really have ""excessive empathy""?","This question arose out of the question Excessive empathy, social cues and adaptive behavior evaluation whereby excessive empathy was considered to impair interpersonal relationships.  My question is asking if you can actually have too much empathy.  Empathy, not to be confused with sympathy is     the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another's position (Bellet &amp; Maloney, 1991).   When empathising, you can actually feel the emotions the client is feeling, and you need to be able to compartmentalise these feelings by recognising that they are not yours to own.  They are not your feelings, they are the client's feelings. In the psychological fields, they are there to help you to recognise congruency within the client (is the feeling the client expresses, the feeling the client should have?).  As I pointed out in my comment in Excessive empathy, social cues and adaptive behavior evaluation,     the need to break away at times is self-care   The moment you take on the feelings your client has, this is the moment where you are not exercising self-care.  Empathy is a necessity when working within the therapeutic environment and as Bellet &amp; Maloney (1991) points out, it is important within the field of medicine. Therefore, self-care is paramount to practitioner wellbeing within the relevant fields, as I highlighted in my answer to Named conditions that are the result of exposure to psychopathic behavior of another person? to protect against instances of vicarious trauma caused by environmental psychological conditions.  When looking online, there is a PsychologyToday article (Reynolds, 2017) which proposes that you can have too much empathy but I have a problem following her train of thought on her hypothesis.     With empathy, you will feel their stress, anxiety, and anger in your body. You might feel their pain emotionally and physically. If you let these emotions sit in your body, your body and mind can be emotionally hijacked.      Unbridled empathy can lead to concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, making it difficult to release the emotions. Taking on other people’s feelings so that you live their experience can make you susceptible to feelings of depression or hopelessness.   With this passage, there was a citation for:     Blaszczak-Boxe, A. (2017) Too much emotional intelligence is a bad thing. Scientific American Mind [Online] Retreived from: [website]My argument to Reynolds (2017) is that she is describing lack of self-care (lack of compartmentalisation), not excessive empathy, leading to mental health problems within the therapist.  Am I missing something or can there be such a problem as ""excessive empathy""?  If so, how much empathy is excessive and how would you be able to recognise this excess?  References  Bellet, P. S., &amp; Maloney, M. J. (1991). The importance of empathy as an interviewing skill in medicine. Jama, 266(13), 1831-1832. doi: 10.1001/jama.1991.03470130111039  Reynolds, M. (2017).

1491,How does modulation of the activity of an afferent neuron lead to increase in MEP's?,"I was confused reading this:     Another example has been described with the primary motor cortex,   where the afferent axonal synaptic input (Figure 1) can be facilitated   by anodal tDCS (Rahman et al., 2013), leading to the increase in motor   evoked potentials   I interpreted this as saying: a neuron had a greater effect on a downstream neuron because of tDCS, which ultimately lead to more MEP's.  I was confused by the fact that the neuron is an afferent neuron. Since efferent neurons relay signal to muscles I figured the activity of efferent neurons would be more important in the generation of MEP's. Is this not the case?   Does greater activity in an afferent neuron lead to greater activity in an efferent neuron, which then leads to more MEP's?    "

Dr. Jordan B Peterson, a Professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist claims (reference: [website]However, a quick googling would return many articles indicating that IQ tests do not accurately measure intelligence.

1493,Yes-No question in 2AFC staircase test,"I understand the task of a 2AFC test is to select one of the two stimuli presented (e.g. the stronger one), whereas in Yes-No test there is only one stimulus presented. But is it ok to ask a Yes-No question (e.g. was there a difference between A and B?) in a test with 2 stimuli? and can it still be called a 2AFC test? (Or is it valid to do Yes-No test with two stimuli?)  I am asking this with regard to a threshold test using a 2AFC transformed staircase  (2 down 1 up procedure). It'd be a lot easier for subject to respond whether there was a perceivable difference between two stimuli rather than having to choose the stronger one. As my main interest is to see just noticeable difference, which is stronger is not of a concern. However, I guess there must be a specific reason why one stimulus has to be chosen over the other in a 2AFC test (re bias and sensitivity?). And I wonder what would be the implication of using a Yes-No question instead.  Many thanks in advance for your answers. "
1494,How are the brains of mathematicians different from typical people?,"As a biomedical sciences student who also minors in Mathematics, I am often amazed by some of my classmates who really appear to be born for Mathematics (with regards to both their abilities and passions). Is there any research from a psychology/neuroscience perspective that looks at how the brains of these exceptional individuals (or indeed someone who likes Mathematics) function differently to typical individuals?  If indeed there is not systemic evidence showing their brains are different, is there a systematic way we can describe how they view the world differently from people not trained in Mathematics?  "
1495,Perfect events in a random world?,"I have a friend.

Focusing effect?  Please help. "
1496,Amount of noise in (the recognisable definition of) an ERP,"As I understand it, ERPs can be reliably identified only after the noise (inherent to EEG signals, regardless of the task used to evoke the response) has been largely removed, which is done by averaging across multiple repetitions. The ERP in that case is a recognisable-enough pattern in the EEG signal that it can be reliably pointed out in a graph of the averaged trials, for several electrodes, for instance:    Question #1: if the averaging method is trustworthy enough - assuming enough-many reptitions - to make noise components cancel each other out while leaving reliable effects still in, then why are other non-zero sections of (ripples in) the EEG signal also not defined as ERPs, with some attached meaning (e.g. response to some cognitive task), since they have, after all, survived the same denoising procedure?  It would make sense to trust the EEG signal to really not reflect any effect when the intercept (y) is zero. However, in most EEG plots this seems to (very conveniently!) only happen at the t=0 point. The signal then becomes non-zero but only part of is acknowledged as an ERP, whereas the rest seems to be considered noise even though the plotted signal has been denoised.  EDIT: Question #2: why do such ERP plots - obtained by averaging across repetitions and across subjects - never (in my experience) show a confidence band to show the extent of that cross-repetition/-subject variability? Would that information not be of interest? "

1498,In what ways can neurons fire randomly?,"When developing a model of a biologically-plausible neural network, it is important to know all the circumstances under which neurons can fire. But, I am limiting this question to random firing. In what ways, if any, can neurons fire randomly, i.e., without (or regardless of) presynaptic input?  I'm looking for something like:     Between 0 and 6 days of age, rat cortical neurons randomly fire at an average rate of once every 30 minutes. The rate decreases to 0 by age 12 days. Reference: here   (That's just an example)  In what ways can neurons fire randomly? "
1499,How does neural spiking begin in the fetus?,I'm interested in modeling human brain spiking activity. How does the very first spiking activity begin in the fetus?

1500,Can one incubate on a specific idea in one's sleep?,"In this question it is described that intentionally not thinking about a problem can allow the subsonscious to find an answer to the problem; this is known as incubation. I have heard and read it a few times that if you want to solve a tough problem you can read/think about it just before going to bed and let the brain come up with a solution while you sleep.  (I can find no references for this at the moment, however. Sorry)  Also, there have been few cases that provided a solution during sleep. (Benzene structure is one which I remember) Is it mere chance or false advertising, or is the brain really capable of incubating on an idea during sleep?  A robotics guy I saw on TED claimed that he used to keep a notebook by the bed, so that he could jot down the ideas if any came to him during sleep.  Can one's brain incubate on an idea while sleeping? Can one train one's brain to incubate on a specific idea during sleep? "
1501,Why have historically most inventors been men?,"I noticed something strange when I looked at about.com's list of famous historical inventors. You can see that most of the inventors are men, and only a few are women.   Can this be explained by cognitive science in terms of men's brains having better abilities for inventing something?  Or is this due to social factors or something else?  "
1502,To what extent are correlations of father's age with birth defects and autism causal?,"I read the following in the paper today:     Dr Karin Hammarberg ... said that while most   children are born healthy, large studies of parental age were starting   to show higher rates of birth defects and autism in children born to   men over 40.      A recent review of paternal age published in the Asian Journal of   Andrology said an American study of 132,000 men found children of   those over 45 were nearly six times more likely to have an autism   spectrum disorder compared to children born to men under 30.      The review also pointed to a Dutch study of 60,000 births which found   children born to men over 40 were three times more likely to have   autism and a US study of 5 million births which showed men over 50 had   a 15 per cent higher chance of having a baby with birth defects   including congenital heart disease and cleft palates.   However, my first thought was that the age of the father must be highly correlated with the age of the mother. Thus, an alternative explanation is that the higher prevalence of birth defects for older fathers is due to the fact that older fathers typically have babies with older mothers. Of course, the same argument could be made for the reported higher prevalence of birth defects in older mothers (i.e., they're having babies with older fathers).  Questions:   To what extent is paternal age associated with prevalence of birth defects after controlling for maternal age? To what extent is any association between paternal age and prevalence of birth defects causal? (maternal age is the main covariate that I could think of, but there might be other important confounding variables)  "
1503,Do victims of parental abuse and neglect become abusive or neglectful parents?,"The psychology literature suggests that 'good parenting' in early childhood is a crucial helping factor in brain development of child. (e.g., see ""Social Intelligence"" by Goleman.)  Where people grow up without 'good parenting' do they tend to, potentially unconsciously, offer similar 'bad parenting' to their children?  By bad parenting, I mean any abusive and neglectful parenting behavior. Examples:   Getting drunk and beating wife in front of children (abusive).  Never appreciating any success of kid (neglectful).    Does bad parenting breed bad parenting? "
1504,Encoding of abstract concepts in memory,"When you read a book and you want to remember it you can encode the information into mental pictures with associations. This is a technique for remembering the content.    The problem is when you encounter abstract concepts. How would you deal with them to create pictures that are more memorizable?

1505,"What is the current ""accepted"" science behind dream interpretation?","I'm doing some casual reading about dream interpretation (meaning I'm reading the wikipedia entry) and the article mentions that there are several ways of thinking about dreams from a psychological standpoint:     In modern times, various schools of psychology have offered theories about the meaning of dreams.   But the text offers no judgement of which of these approaches is currently believed to be most ""accurate"". It simply lists various scholars and their theories.  What I want to know is: which approach is considered the most ""correct"" by the scientific community and why? Is there a reason to take one of the listed methods of interpretation more seriously than another as a casual layman?  Note that I'm not asking for your subjective answer. I'm looking for any evidence as to whether a specific method is more successful or more pursued by the profession and community in general. "

1511,How to best prepare the mind for a problem identification brainstorm?,"I am a manager of a team of software engineers. We often use brainstorming sessions to generate solutions to problems. We use typical cognitive games, e.g. word association, to ""warm-up"" and facilitate the ideations sessions. These sessions are fruitful.  Tomorrow we are having a brainstorming session to identify problems, not solutions. It would seem that we should prepare our minds with a different technique. Personally, I find that I am best at noticing problems when I am in a negative mindset. Does that hold true against existing research? If so, what would be a good way of getting in to that type of mindset? I would assume causing some kind of mental anguish would facilitate negative thinking. However I don't want to upset my team or do any lasting damage.  Some random ideas that have come to mind include: - Taking a minute to talk about historical atrocities - Having food at the session, but not letting anyone eat  If I go down this road, what would be a good decompression method to get people back in to a positive mindset at the end?

1512,At what age do children typically reach adult reading speed?,"A kid who just started to read puts a lot of effort in processing sentences. These efforts will decrease as he/she gets older and, at some point (around 12, 15?), will read as fast as an adult.  Is there an age when reading speed becomes stable enough to be considered as adult speed?  My guess is that it should depend on each individual (particular pleasure/difficulty to read, variable exposition to written material), but there should be an average measure. I searched the web for some references without success - maybe this question was answered long before the digital era. "

1514,How did Ebbinghaus decide on his number of words in a series?,"Herman Ebbinghaus discovered the forgetting curve, by memorizing series of non-sensical syllables like ""zod"", ""byh"", ""tef"", etc., and than seeing how long it took to forget them.  The results are interesting, but I'm curious as to how he came up with the number of words to remember (the number of words in a series).   Because clearly the more words, the more difficult it would be to remember, which he did mention in his study.    In the study though he mainly used series of 8, 12 or 16 words, and took multiple tests which often came up to be about 104 syllables, but was quite varied. I couldn't find how he came up with those specific numbers of syllables to test, and furthermore it seems that his entire study and curve would be compromised by the amount of words.  For instance a 1 word series may never be forgotten while 10,000 may be unmemorizable.   Is his curve a simply an average of testable results?  Or is there some other reason for the certain number of words that constituted a series that I didn't quite catch?     "

My intuition tells me that this is likely true but I cannot find any evidence for this or a name for such a phenomenon. An example might be if people are given this option: 'How many extra refills would you like to buy?' and were given the options in the following layouts A and B. Would you expect 0/""I do not want to buy any extra refills"" to be chosen more frequently in any A or B? My intuition says B). Is there any evidence that this is true or false?   A) 0 / 1 /2 / 3 / 4 B) I do not want to buy any extra refills / 2 / 3 / 4  "
1517,How do personality tests work that require you to choose one of two statement that applies most to you?,"There are different kinds of psychometric tests, I think the numerical and verbal ones are fair enough, I can see their usefulness. However, I cannot understand how the 'soft' psychometric tests work and how they apply to a particular career.  I just finished one which consisted of 90 'questions', except they were not questions, they were all ""pick one of the two following sentences"" 90 times. Some made sense, such as         Do you like to lead a group.   Do you like to fit in with a group.      But others I could not answer because I could not choose either option for example:        You are slow at planning.   You are slow at making decisions.      I have to answer one. In this case, I'd say that I am not slow in either.  How exactly (detail) do these types of psychometric tests work? A link to an open one would be what I am looking for. How do they create the answers? How do they pair them? Do they change based on your previous answers? "

1519,Psychological explanation for perceptions of the Loch Ness monster,"I previously asked about whether physics could explain the occurrences of the rogue waves which could psychology explain the eyewitnesses' perceptions of the Loch Ness monster? (The Physics.SE question has been put on hold because not all of it is about physics.)    So the question:   What is the psychological explanation for reports of Loch Ness monster? Could it be related to the dark, undulating pattern under the crests of the white-caps?   Edit You are walking along a country lane, when a sudden motion on the water catches your eye. Followed by the sound of a crashing wave. Within seconds, only ripples remain on the surface. You remember the image as shown above. It could be a white-cap on a wave, but everyone who has been to the beach knows that waves come in one-after-another, and there are no other waves, so it can't be a wave. You notice the darker area under the white-cap and realize the only possible explanation is: you have just seen a large animal dive under the surface. Like a sounding whale. (Or monster?).  Loch Ness is located near a major fault line that has seismic activity. Physicists can explain that a wave created by seismic activity is a rogue wave or tsunami. They can also explain why the wave does not reach shore and, why the area under the white-cap is always darker.  So, could a collaboration between physics and psychology show this illusion is a possible explanation for Nessi? "
1520,How are inherited instincts related to deprivation states?,"In Psychology and Life (Chapter 1, 18th edition), the authors (Gerrig and Zimbardo) write that     According to the psychodynamic perspective, behavior is driven, or   motivated, by powerful inner forces. In this view, human actions stem   from inherited instincts, biological drives, and attempts to resolve   conflicts between personal needs and society’s demands. Deprivation   states, physiological arousal, and conflicts provide the power for   behavior just as coal fuels a steam locomotive.   I'm wondering if these two lists ""match up."" In other words:   inherited instincts — deprivation states  biological drives — physiological arousal  attempts to resolve conflicts between personal needs and society’s demands — conflicts   By ""match up, I mean are they related as elements are in the following example:  Freud's structural model of the psyche includes the id, the ego, and the superego, which relate to instinctual drives, the need to develop and maintain an organized and realistic perception of the world, and the internalization of cultural rules, respectively.  It's this ""respectively"" part I'm focused on. Did the authors write those sentences with that sort of relationship in mind?  Thanks. "
1521,Looking for happines in marriage survey according to living/not living together before marriage,"Do you know any research/survey results comparing how happy do people feel in marriage (after a few years) comparing marriages who lived together before marrying and living separately?   There are many studies into comparing divorce rate among spouses living or not living together before marrying, but I think it has a serious flaw - religious views can make couples still live together in marriage even though they feel unhappy. I think feeling happiness could be more interesting statistic.  Is premarital cohabitation associated with later marital satisfaction? "
1522,What are some theories or cognitive models of human imagination?,"What cognitive models of human imagination exist? How does the human imagine things that don't exist?

He can't imagine that until he has some experience about mountaineering whether through a movie, documentary or some reading material and Wikipedia page on Imagination says that      ...without knowledge, imagination can not be developed...   If he has this experience he would be able to imagine himself climbing a mountain. Are there any theories that explain this? "
1523,Is ignoring messages a learned behavior?,"As someone that works troubleshooting stuff, I've seen a surprising amount of people that, when confronted with messages, warnings and errors, tend to seek help fast (or early in the process) in the hope someone will understand what their problem is, rather than reading the error and searching directly for a solution, or solving what they did wrong independently. To illustrate this, consider an example (I'm not sure if this captures the qi of the problem, but here it goes):     User [tex] performs a certain action that leads to the current error/warning/message:           Error: your input was greater than two, please use [tex] tool when input is greater than two.      When the user is presented with an error message, there are 4 things that could happen:   User comes back and uses the correct tool. User tries again until frustrated. User tries again until frustrated and seeks help. User tries again until frustrated, seeks help and doesn't get it. The user either figures out the message or just leaves things as they are.   My question: why do endings 2, 3, and 4 happen? Is the message too difficult for some people to understand, or do they believe they are not wrong and the tool should do what they want or the message should be more calling (IN CAPS or bold)? Do people ignore seemingly perfectly crafted messages? Or have we learned to ignore them, given all the media with which we are bombarded? "
1524,What maladaptive behaviours or cognitive distortions develop as a result of chronic childhood illness?,"It's fairly well documented that childhood trauma (such as chronic illness) can lay the neurochemical groundwork for conditions like depression later in life. A paper, ""The link between childhood trauma and depression: insights from HPA axis studies in humans"", states:     We here summarize results from a series of clinical studies suggesting that childhood trauma in humans is associated with sensitization of the neuroendocrine stress response, glucocorticoid resistance, increased central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) activity, immune activation, and reduced hippocampal volume, closely paralleling several of the neuroendocrine features of depression. Neuroendocrine changes secondary to early-life stress likely reflect risk to develop depression in response to stress, potentially due to failure of a connected neural circuitry implicated in emotional, neuroendocrine and autonomic control to compensate in response to challenge.   ""Late Consequences of Pediatric Chronic Illness"" has some related findings too.  I'm interested in what psychological groundwork might be also laid by early life stress such as childhood illness, also contributing to the development of mental health conditions. For example, I've read of cases where chronic childhood pain may cause the patient to have an unhealthily high acceptance (not tolerance) of stress as an adult, meaning they persist in stressful situations where others would not. They've learned that pain is to be accepted and worked through to an extent beyond which many would think reasonable, and this may lead to stress related illness.  Are there any other maladaptive behaviours, cognitive distortions or similar that commonly occur in adults who experienced chronic childhood illness?  (Also interested in evidence related to my anecdotal example.)  EDIT (31st Dec 2013): Thanks to caseyr547 for his answer. To clarify, I'm particularly interested in answers using the behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic models, as opposed to the biological or stress-vulnerability models. "
1525,Is unsweetened tea 'stronger' than sweetened tea,"I feel that if I have unsweetened tea, it has a stronger hit. i.e. it is more stimulating than a similar cup of tea in which some sugar has been added. I can say the same about coffee.  Is it just me or is it something which is commonly perceived?   Is there a biochemical basis for this feeling or is it psychological due to the slight bitter taste? "
1526,Why do people blame others rather than take responsibility?,"In business classes we are told to be responsible and take responsibility for our action. Get mugged? Well, lock your door next time. That sort of thing.  But that's not how most humans behave. Humans blame others for their mistakes and problems they could have prevented. Why?  What's the benefit of blaming others compared to taking responsibility? "
1527,What is the mechanism behind time perception?,"I wonder if it's known how time perception works at the fundamental level.  For example, to count accurately a minute/hour, do we have to keep track of the time passed counting in our minds or observing our enviroment? In the same way we can't know how much distance we've really travelled if there is no reference frame, if we were totally isolated, would we measure time accurately?  Or we could have some internal clock which helps us to measure time. I think that one problem to test this is that things like hunger, sleep, etc. could also work as clocks, so we can't be totally isolated.  For example, Richard Feynman though that every person could count a minute with some error, but the error will always be the same. "
1528,Can scientific evidence support concepts of the soul?,"In some spiritual premises, the soul is said to belong to the Almighty.  Religions (Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism) all talk about cleansing our inner being because only when it's pure, its actual purpose is served.  But modern science gives evidence that most of the sentiments have a neurological or psychological or physical basis.  Then does this narrow down the concept of the soul (if science opines that it exists at all) to just the element within us that binds all life together?    There are some beliefs that stem out of the concept of soul:   Soul decides who we love (our soul mates) Soul guides us when we are stuck in deciding whether something is moral or immoral Soul is essentially linked to how we live our life  E.g., goodness cleanses our soul, and hatred sullies the soul, and so on.    Do such beliefs have any relevance in the scientific world where everything good or bad is more or less a hormone or environmental adaptation or some other scientific phenomenon?  Do any scientific theories support the existence of a higher form of sacred energy, i.e. soul within us that guides us to a more meaningful existence? "
1529,Which equation is Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve and what do the constants represent?,"First off, I've come across two different forgetting curve equations.    [tex] where [tex] is retention, [tex] is time and [tex] is strength can be found on Wikipedia. And [tex] where [tex] is retention, [tex] is time, [tex] and [tex], can be found in Ebbinghaus's study chapter 7.  I've also seen it here and here also.    My first question is which forgetting curve is correct?  And if both or the latter is, where did the constants [tex] or [tex] come from?  What do they represent?     "
1530,Can one learn not to panic? How?,"It's always impressive to listen to the professionalism of a commercial pilot communicating in a crisis situation, apparently remaining calm and in control in terrifying circumstances, with terrible responsibility. I imagine this occurs because (a) the industry does not promote those who panic to this position and (b) pilots practice a great deal in simulators, learning to cope with crisis calmly.  Am I imagining correctly, here?  To what extent can practice (b) overcome a deficiency in (a) a natural tendency to calmness?  Does practice at staying cool in one field (say, making decisions during play of a fast computer game) transfer to staying cool generally (say, being accosted by an aggressive stranger on the street)?  I read What characterises people who stay calm in crisis situations? and that does relate (a) to calmness in a crisis but I don't think it says anything about (b). "
1531,Is it ethical to deliberately provide incorrect information to participants in a psychological study?,"I've noticed that several psychological studies purport to measure one thing, but once participants enroll, they end up measuring something completely different.  For example, I recently came across a study where participants were told that the study was meant to help create personalized nutrition and exercise programs. The participants were then given fake DNA test results and what was actually measured was their response to the placebo effect of the test results.  What are the ethics of this? Don't such studies make it less likely that people will enroll in such studies in future and degrade the scientific endeavor in general? Is there no way for psychology to make progress without lying to unwitting study-participants. "
1532,Since we know the 5ht2a receptor impacts learning efficiency why has stimulating it not been tried for alleviating learning disabilities?,"If you go on wikipedia or do a search on Google you can quickly find a bunch of articles on the importance of serotonin for impacting the efficacy of learning. Experiments have been run in mice for testing the rate they learn new tasks if 5ht2a is stimulated. There are also studies showing a high degree of correlation between high serotonin levels and high IQs.   If you go far back in history to Timothy Leary's time you find psychologists swearing by psychedelics improving IQ scores, and there is also the Spring Grove LSD experiments where researchers claimed LSD increases IQ scores. If you give someone antipsychotics it blocks 5ht2a, but as a result their thinking also becomes sluggish and processing speed scores on an IQ test decrease.   I get that the fact all psychedelics are illegal makes it fairly hard to study 5ht2a full and partial agonists. Would it not be possible to make a novel chemical hitting that receptor hard, without violating schedule 1? Any other reasons why that research has not been done other than government prohibitions? "
1533,Why does autism sometimes only visibly appear later in life?,"From what I know about the autism spectrum, a lot of people who were diagnosed later in life (not during childhood) didn't ""seem autistic"" until adolescence or young adulthood. Of courses, they had symptoms all this time but it didn't become obvious until later.  Why is that? Do you have some articles/youtube videos that I could read/watch to learn more about this (English or French)? "
1534,Is there a biological equivalent to the bias term used in artificial neural networks?,"For the longest time, I had been thinking that the bias term used in the standard artificial neural network model (the ubiquitous one used in most machine learning implementations) can be interpreted as some kind of 'background' input, maybe similar to LFP.  However, I had previously missed the perspective that the bias term can also be interpreted as a parameter of response selectivity. For instance, a ReLu activated horizontal line detector with 0 bias will fire weakly when given a vertical line input but a sufficiently large negative bias will prevent the detector from firing (which, in the case of a horizontal line detector probably is desirable).  My question is, what would be the neural equivalent of bias and its modification mechanisms? Is the shape of the activation function known to be subject to any learning mechanisms at all? "
1535,Can a person with delusions completely acknowledge their delusions,"I wanted to ask a question for a story I'm writing;  Can a person with delusions completely acknowledge that they have delusions? For example, if someone claims that for a long time he believed certain crucial things about his life to be true (possible things, nothing bizarre; Like his parents being dead and then seeing them at home, him going to a certain school but the school doesn't exist and he actually went to an entirely different one etc.) and then was proven otherwise.   He has no fixations to his previous believes, he's completely open to the possibility of him not being able to differentiate reality (He was open the second he suspected something to be awry).   Would he still fall under the delusional category? If not would it at least be considered an unordinary case? "
1536,Possible applications of the big five personality traits testing in human resource departments,"I am a multimedia artist who is interning in a human resources department of a casino resort. In the department we have daily meetings to discuss updates to both the orientation and the performance of the casino's employees.  During the discussion I had an idea on maybe using psychometric ( big 5 ) testing for either helping in filtering out unfit candidates for certain positions or/and allocation of time or resources to certain to certain people or group's of people to help them in certain ways or identify problems as to improve the effectiveness of the staff.  My questions are;  1: Can it be used in this way, or what other ways can HR use it?  2: How to go about using it?  3: Will it be effective?  4: Does there exists other companies that use psychometric testing or big 5 for there employees? "
1537,Are cognitive flexibility and interference control the same thing?,Interference control requires  being able to inhibit irrelevant stimulI ie shift flexibily from something  you are doing and back into it in the presence of competing stimulus. Is it the same as Cognitive Flexibility? Or are they different?   
1538,EEG Equipment For High Schoolers?,"I am doing a research project for school, and I'm trying to investigate the effectiveness of inhaling lavender oil in reducing anxiety.  I plan to measure the strength of alpha wave activities, as it seems to be commonly accepted as an index for the level of relaxation/anxiety.  I may also measure the strength of gamma activity at the T3 location, for Oathes et al. have suggested that the increase in gamma power in that location is associated with worrying ([website](That being said, I know very little about EEG research and will ask about the details of conducting one in another post because this post is about the equipment)  We are in a high school, though a fairly well-resourced one, so our budget isn't too big.  Ideally, I would like to obtain a research-grade EEG headset plus the related equipment (e.g. A/D converter) under 1000 dollars, at most 2000 dollars.  So, what are some brands and models that might be suitable for my situation?  Thanks  Edit:  I think I might as well ask about the process of analyzing the raw signals here.  I've done some searching online, and many people recommended using EEGLAB, a toolbox for MATLAB.  So I plan to purchase a MATLAB student license and install the free toolbox.  Is that a good idea?  If so, do you have any recommendations for resources that I can use to learn about using this tool for data analysis? "
1539,Is there actually a correlation between emotional trauma and homosexuality,"One of the key talking points I hear to disparage homosexuality is that it stems from ""a lack of a strong male figure"" or some variation of that, putting aside the obvious irrelevancy of argument. I still am curious, is there any truth to the idea that trauma is correlated with homosexuality? And if so, can someone elaborate on it ie. is it equal across both genders? Does it result in Bisexuality or Gay more often? etc "
1540,Talking about emotional experience,"In a book 59 seconds (section ""Creating the perfect diary""), Richard Wiseman cited Zech &amp; Rimé (2005) - I had impression that he suggests that according to that study talking about traumatic experiences (""the most negative upsetting emotional event in their life, one they still thought about and still needed to talk about."") didn't have a better effect than talking about a typical day.  Am I right to assume he encourages to not talk about problems? Because here is my contradiction: I think talking about problems can be useful solely because someone else may see a solution you didn't and suggest it to you. Isn't it? So why recommend not talking about problems? Or am I misinterpreting the results of that study or what Wiseman said?  To be completely fair here is his last quote: ""So, if talking about negative experiences to a sympathetic but untrained individual is a waste of time, what can be done to help ease the pain of the past?"". So maybe he is suggesting that talking about problems is useful however with a trained individual? Still, untrained one could still see a solution to a problem you didn't.

1541,Name this phenomenon: You're shy of doing X because nobody else around you does it,"I'm looking for the name of the following phenomenon.  Image this situation:  A teenager is riding a bus. He's thirsty. He has a water bottle in his bag, but he doesn't feel comfortable bringing it out and drinking because ""I'll look dumb"". (Let's assume nobody else in the bus is drinking.)  (I'd also like to know: (1) Are teenagers more susceptible to this? (2) Does it have to do with self-esteem?) "
1542,Cognitive ability and possible careers,"I have a couple of times read articles saying something like ""If you have an IQ of 130 you can become a physician, high school math teacher or lawyer. If your IQ is 95 you can work at a kindergarten, as a waitress or taxi driver.""  Obviously, these are just rough estimates combined with examples of potential careers and should be taken with a grain of salt. With that reservation made, is there any scientific research on this subject? What conclusions did they arrive at?  I want better sources than popular science. "
1543,Why is the WCST a test of task switching rather than cognitive shifting?,"Why is the WCST a test of task switching rather than cognitive shifting?     Task switching allows a person to rapidly and efficiently adapt to   different situations. It is often studied by cognitive and   experimental psychologists, and can be tested experimentally using   tasks like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.   but     Cognitive shifting is the mental process of consciously redirecting   one's attention from one fixation to another. In contrast, if this   process happened unconsciously, then it is referred to as task   switching. Both are forms of cognitive flexibility.   What I'm not understanding is, given e.g. the following screen    the participant is not consciously redirecting themselves? It seems quite easy to fulfill the task consciously, but its meant to be a measure of unconscious flexibility.  To state the obvious, and how to do so deliberately: work out what properties the card has (colour, shape, number); then work out what these are (red, cross, two); then match these to the properties of another card (one red circle, four yellow crosses, two green stars) and try each of these until you get the right answer.  Surely it can be done consciously, then?    EDITED to add that I took this test on a site, and, with the test in front of me had to sit it twice before realizing there were three, not two, card properties. Incidentally, my score was horrific. Baffling! "
1544,What exactly are the X and the Y axis of a brainwave?,I can't seem to wrap my head around how a bunch of organic transistors (neurons) could possibly produce a wave? What exactly is a brain wave? If you graph a brain wave what exactly would your X and Y axis represent? For example a sound wave is graphed with X axis being time and Y axis being pressure. If someone told me to recreate a brain wave and for this purpose gave me a bunch of neurons with complete and exact control of which neuron fires when how would I possibly create said wave? 
1545,Is autism prevalence increasing?,"The CDC has been rapidly increasing its estimate of children with autism for years. It's tripled in the past 15 years.    This has lead to a lot of speculation, including dramatic claims like vaccines causing autism.   My physiology-major wife tells me that the enormous increase is likely simply increased awareness and alterations to its definition.  But I never hear anything definitive. Even with changes to awareness, definition, etc., given that autism is a common, incurable, lifelong condition, isn't this is really easy to answer?   Take a population sample. Test for autism using chosen, fixed criteria. Analyze how age correlates to the measured autism rate.   Okay, maybe not ""really easy"", but as easy as other physiological population studies.  Has anyone done this and found the answer? Is actual autism prevalence increasing? "
1546,How do we know human brain development stops around age 25?,"I've heard this stated as a fact more times than I can keep track of, but I haven't been able to find papers that actually demonstrate this. This seems to be the most cited paper on the topic, but it just claims that maturity of the brain by age 25 is widely established, and cites a CDC paper (reference 5) that does not appear relevant.  To be more specific, I want to know   What exactly do we mean when we say the brain is ""finished developing""? Is that when there are no more changes in volume of gray/white matter? Is it when synaptic pruning levels off? What is the evidence for this? What imaging modalities are used? What is the variance in the end-of-development timepoint?   I'm hoping to find a good paper that contains answers to these kinds of questions. My motivation for asking this is that I'm wondering whether this end of development is reflective of a deterministic biological process, or if it is a function of the environment (e.g. most people stop learning and meeting new people as much around 25). "
1547,Can extrinsic rewards successfully sustain habits in the long-term?,"With 2019 right around the corner, I've been reading about forming successful habits. Many non-academic sources (and Charles Duhigg's popular book The Power of Habit) have advocated for pairing a cue with operant conditioning's positive reinforcement routine-reward method. For example, your alarm clock goes off (cue), you go for a jog (routine), you drink a fruit smoothie right after (reward).  This seems to be a short-term and damaging solution because of the overjustification effect, where external rewards irreversibly decrease intrinsic motivation.  Is there any evidence suggesting that extrinsic rewards can successfully sustain habits in the long-term?  To be more specific, could extrinsic rewards be used for several years and still remain equally effective in supporting the desired habit, or would the extrinsic rewards eventually become less effective at reinforcing the desired habit, given how extrinsic rewards eventually decrease the potency of intrinsic motivation? "
1548,Why is the chicken crossing the road joke funny?,"According to modern psychology why is the answer to the joke ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" ""To get the the other side."" Funny?  According to the relief theory, what are we relieved about?  Could it be that the question invokes a feeling of stress when we don't know the answer? Do we fear that we shall have to expend a lot of energy in trying to work out the solution? Is it stressful having a question put to us which we can't answer? (Just like starting a new job where we don't know what we're doing?)  Or does the stress come from the fear that we will look stupid for being unknowledgeable about the answer to the question?  Why are we then relieved by the answer? Is it because we are relieved that we don't have to expend new energy storing new information because we the information is already so obvious? (But this might not make sense as we do tend store jokes.) But we do not have to alter any of our existing information.  Or does the relief come from finding out that the questioner does not have superior knowledege to ourselves. And we laugh at how idiotic this person is. Like shadenfrauder.   Or... is the laugh a submissive behaviour that we acknowledge that we have been fooled by a greater wit and intelligence?  What is the modern take on this? "
1549,"Are IQ tests ""beatable""?","I have been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson's videos on youtube recently. One of his themes is, that IQ is among the best studied metrics, with high predictability, validity and is generally believed to be a very real thing in psychology. He also mentions, that IQ can not be improved or trained.  My question is, whether I could improve my IQ (by that I mean the test score, not general intelligence), by simply studying for it, trying to learn about the different types of questions and how they are generally solved and by simply doing a bunch of tests and memorizing how to solve questions.  I have done a few IQ tests online and at the beginning, I was very confused about everything, like from which direction to read the boxes and stuff like that. After doing a couple and seeing how it is done and reading explanations about the different questions I feel, that I am doing a lot better now.  Similar to that, I was on a job interview once, where they asked riddles, presumably in order to assess IQ, without doing an IQ test.  I knew some of the riddles and simply answered some of them by sheer memory.  Isn't it possible to increase your test score of an IQ test by simply studying? And if you can, what makes the tests really valid? And finally, if IQ was such a high predictor of intelligence, wouldn't most job interviews be geared towards assessing your IQ in a legal manner? "
1550,Understanding the concept behind d-prime,"I know that sensitivity (d') is typically calculated as follows:  d' = z(Hit Rates) - z (False Alarm Rates)  I understand this as the idea is to standardize both distributions, and to then calculate the z-score, which allows to calculate a distance within the same scale so to say.  What is however very confusing to me is the visualization of the process. I am using the following plots from these slides:    My questions are as follows:  (1) As in the plot above, d' is always depicted as the difference of the means of the two distributions (of signal and noise, for instance). Say however that I find in my data that the Hit rate (or Hit probability) is 0.8 - I would think that now, I would need to find z(Hit = 0.8), would this not be to the right of the mean:    Is this correct?  (2) In addition, I am am uncertain about the arrows associated with Z(CR) and Z(H) on panel A above.   For one, in my opinion, CR includes the entire area before the criterion. The arrow, however, associates Z(CR) with only the distance mean-criterion - why?   Then, if Z(X) refers to the cumulative probability density of variable X, Z(X) should be the entire density up to X.  In the case of Z(CR) in panel A,however, it seems that it is only the part from the mean of the noise distribution to criterion. So what does then the Z(..) notation mean in this context? "
1551,Is there any significance to the way Trump spreads his hand from each other?,"Is there any significance on how President Trump constantly spreads apart from each other his hands while talking? I postulate that this falls under some sort of sub-conscious (or conscious) body language message. Though, I can’t put my finger on it, my speculation ranges from where it is at his disadvantage to those watching him.   Specifically, when I saw this video I was awakened to ask this question. The way he conducts himself there seems to be a hyper-version of whatever it normally means.   "
1552,Is there a specified way to shorten the number of questions in an instrument/questionnaire?,"If you have found a fitting instrument that measures your interest and has been validated but is a bit too long, what can you do to shorten it?  Edit:   How do you reduce the number of questions within a questionnaire/instrument not the variables? As in, are there any set procedures that one needs to follow. The questionnaire in queestion is the Academic Self-Regulated Learning Scale (Mango 2010). The aim is to reduce it 20 -25 questions.  "
1553,Does individual work performance follow a Paretian distribution?,"O'Boyle and Aguinis (2012) wrote a paper arguing that individual job performance follows a Paretian distribution  rather than a normal distribution (put simply, a very long tail to the right, rather than a bell-shape). The abstract was as follows:     We revisit a long-held assumption in human resource management,   organizational behavior, and industrial and organizational psychology   that individual performance follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution.   We conducted 5 studies involving 198 samples including 633,263 researchers, entertainers, politicians, and amateur and professional   athletes. Results are remarkably consistent across industries, types   of jobs, types of performance measures, and time frames and indicate   that individual performance is not normally distributed—instead, it   follows a Paretian (power law) distribution. Assuming normality of   individual performance can lead to misspecified theories and   misleading practices. Thus, our results have implications for all   theories and applications that directly or indirectly address the   performance of individual workers including performance measurement   and management, utility analysis in preemployment testing and training   and development, personnel selec- tion, leadership, and the prediction   of performance, among others.   Question   Are they correct in claiming that most researchers assume that individual job performance is normally distributed? Are they correct in claiming that the Paretian distribution provides a better fit to individual job performance than the normal distribution?   Reference   ERNEST O’BOYLE JR. HERMAN AGUINIS (2012).

1554,Effect of words highlighting on reading comprehension,"I'm interested if there are studies dealing with text understanding and POS (part of speech) coloring, or coloring syntactic/semantic information. The studies should solve the questions like:   Which combination of colors improve/deteriorate understanding and reading of texts? How many colors should be in the scheme for positive/negative effects on reading and understanding of text? Which POSs should be preferably colored? Are there types of people who are more efficient with/without coloring?   I believe that a few colors with good combination could be beneficial. Has somebody conducted research to test the effect of highlighting on reading comprehension?    An example:    On this text you can see that many colors that don't go together can make the reading process even worse and distracting. Can this be changed to improve the reading process, instead?  A few events inspired me in the following order:   I started learning Chinese and their characters seem to have positive effect on my comprehension. I've read a NL (natural language) article in English in a programming editor. I was used to colors for various programming languages. I searched the Internet and found the article A case against syntax highlighting but don't agree with all the author's arguments or opinions. When you have only a few carefully chosen colors it's beneficial for programming so maybe could be for NL comprehension as well. A few colors could underline the basic thought and help to draw attention of the reader. When I read a scientific text for which I have not passion I'm often bored because don't know where it directs and colors and images help me a lot to concentrate and skimming over the basic thoughts could help with decision if it has sense to read it at all. This does not hold for fiction and poetry where we read for pleasure rather than getting information.  "
1555,"What is the term for ""What has been seen cannot be unseen"" in cognitive sciences?","During a discussion with my officemate I told him that I read somewhere that the gas pillar in Carina nebula looks like a cat punching the dog; ever since then, every time my wallpaper slideshow switches to this wallpaper, ""cat vs dog"" is the first thing that comes to my mind. We were curious whether there is some dedicated terminology for this.   I learned via Google that this is a meme called ""What has been seen cannot be unseen"", I wonder what is the term for this phenomenon in cognitive science? Like a memory bias during the perception of something? Or it is that people tend to visualize some new concept/picture/term as something they are more familiar with subconsciously? "
1556,Method for evaluating how emotionally evocative a question is?,"I would like to measure the change in emotional state in response to a question. For example, asking the question, ""What is your favorite color?"" would be fairly benign; I would not expect any change in emotional state. However, I would expect a strong emotional response if I asked ""What type of person do you hate?"" or ""Have you ever smoked marijuana?""  Ideally, we would measure this immediately after asking the question. Does anybody have any suggestions on how this can be done, or how it has been done reliably in the past? I have access to surveys and special cameras (thermal, pupil analysis, etc) if it helps.  Edit: To clarify, I'm more interested in measuring the level of emotional arousal more than measuring what specific emotion somebody is feeling. For example, I don't care if somebody is frightened or angry, just the extent to which the emotion caused arousal. "
1557,Free software to run questionnaire based experiments,"I am looking for free software to build experiments that do not heavily rely on accurate timing (where I use PsychoPy and heard a lot of good things about OpenSesame) but more on an easy way to implement different types of items and response options.  That is, for example, an experiment which starts in presenting some texts to the participants, then some questions contingent on this text and on what participants entered before (potentially more than one question per page with different response options) followed by some standard questionnaires. How would you implement such a study?    Background and motivation  I used to do such things using MediaLab which unfortunately is proprietary software. However, implementing items and questionnaires was easy. You could program a simple html page (even using variables and placeholders) using html forms and MediaLab would present this page using ie engine in fullscreen and collect the responses. Those responses could then be used or handed over to DirectRT for response time experiments.  Currently I am using PsychoPy to control the screen and data collection and code all questionnaires and such stuff per hand using wxPython. It works, but designing questionnairs in wxPython is a lot less handy and more difficult than programming html pages with html forms and definitely nothing for people not too profficient in coding.   Any ideas or hints would be really appreciated.  Note that I read ""What's the best program for creating computer based psychology experiments under OS X?"", but my question concerns specific implementations. Furthermore, I work on Windows 7. "

1559,How much red/orange is needed to stimulate hunger?,"A common claim thrown around is that red and orange are great for restaurants because it stimulates hunger. However, I've heard time and time again that this does not work in web design because you need a whole room to be red/orange to stimulate hunger; one such claim is here but I can never find an academic source to back this up.  How much of a color is necessary to actually provoke this reaction? Is it feasible for on-screen design to actually evoke hunger or is that a misapplication of this finding? "

For example:   We learn to type and then after some time we begin to type by automatically knowing position of alphabet on the keyboard. We learn to ride a vehicle and then after some time we ride it without having to think.   Are these the examples of what we call our intuition? If not, how do they happen? "
1562,"Difference between ""Social Roles"" and ""Social Groups""","The two terms ""Social Roles"" and ""Social Groups"" sound similar and I don't know if these terms are often just used interchangeably.   Is there a specific difference between ""Social Roles"" and ""Social Groups""?  Social Groups have group norms. But Social Roles appear to have social norms too. But again, what's the difference between the norms that the two terms have, ""Group Norms"" and ""Social Norms""? "
1563,What is the best time-effective study technique?,"What is the most effective way to study? For instance, assume a student has the following 4 classes in parallel:  1- C++ &amp; Data-structure 2- Logic Design 3- Linear Algebra 4- Integration   Should the student study 1 course per day, or study all 4 courses every day to study efficiently? In other words, should a student learn big chunks of information on one course/topic, or study multiple courses/topics in parallel to learn the most in the least amount of time?  "
1564,How to cope with the problem of noise in fMRI?,"The sounds and noises that a typical MRI scanner produces are problematic for several reasons:   they give - annoying as they are - a strong feel of uncomfortableness to any subject or patient they are quite loud, dominant, and distracting and disturb any kind of processing a task, not only auditory related tasks (but obviously these) they especially strongly disturb the measurement of any subtle emotional response.   I have heard of several solutions to this problem (partly successful):   physical (hardware-based) attenuation and prevention  software-based attenuation or ""softening"" making the sounds and noises part of the experimental design, e.g. in this arcticle: The MR tomograph as a sound generator   Some overviews can be found here:   Methodological challenges and solutions in auditory functional magnetic resonance imaging Acoustic Noise and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Current Strategies and Future Prospects   My question is:     Are there other - maybe completely different - approaches to solve the problem of sounds and noises   of MRI scanners?   (I assume that not everyone would have immediately come up with the third approach!) "
1565,Analysis of psychology/sociology of fashion?,"I'm looking for some good place to start read about sociology of fashion. I guess there are some researches about why people ""invented"" fashion and is it some natural for human as a biological species or it is accidentally happened social phenomenon.   Is there some social functions of fashion? I suppose that from the anti-capitalism point of view fashion cult is a just a consequence of consumer society, but maybe there some scientific studies of psychology and sociology of fashion and it's social functions?  "
1566,Sleep vs. Trance,"I've been recently reading about hypnosis and I'm asking this question because I've had certain personal experiences that makes me confuse the term Trance with just simple sleep.   I'm not a fan of Heavy Metal music, but I sometimes listen to it because it somehow calms me down and I usually listen to music while wearing my big uncomfortable headphone, sitting in my chair which is also very uncomfortable and having my legs resting on my desk. When I listen to music, I almost always start to imagine things, for example I sometimes try to imagine a trip to a certain place, or I try to make up a music video for that tune in my mind. The reason why I mentioned Heavy Metal is that, when I listen to that kind of music in that uncomfortable position, I fell asleep in a way that I can still hear the music and this goes on until the whole album is finished and when I wake up I feel really really fresh like my brain has been fully reset. However, this feeling does not happen when I just go to bed or I just get some rest.   What I have read about hypnosis suggests a similar condition, which is when someone is between being conscious and unconscious (or I can't describe it well). However, the videos I have seen about it emphasis on comfort. Would this be (what's I'm experiencing) a kind of trance or hypnosis, or it is just a normal nap?   And would there be any reason why a music full of violence, yelling, and rough sounds would calm down the brain and put it into a semi-conscious state and then makes it very refreshed afterwards?  "
1567,How good (or bad) is everyday event memory?,Can anyone recommend studies about how good (or bad) everyday memory is for events? How much of what happens today will I be able to remember next week? In a month or a year?   This was deliberately framed in lay language but I am looking for proper cognitive studies of episodic memory but these are likely to be relatively naturalistic - the idea is to get a sense of how much of daily life can be recalled. 
1568,How can I test reaction time?,"How can I measure someone's ability for the speed to which they react to something? Is their a way to test something like a person's reaction timing that doesn't involve something as simple as the ruler test, but rather something a bit more complex.  Edited: The ruler test: [website]I have not yet done initial research on this topic because I want some good opinions on sources that I can use to better my understanding of this topic. I apologize if I was not clear at first. "
1569,Efficiency of multitasking depending on task difficulty,How does the efficiency of multi-tasking differ by task type? My understanding is that multitasking impairs efficiency for cognitively challenging tasks.  Does this apply to trivial tasks as well? 
1570,Link between visual-spatial + verbal working memory and intelligence/academic achievement?,"What is the link between someone's visual and spatial working memory, their verbal working memory, and different types of cognitive abilities or tasks? More specifically, intelligence tests (WAIS, Stanford Binet, etc.) and would this relate to educational outcomes in different fields (maybe SAT scores, graduation rates in different fields, and GPA, etc.)? Is there a relationship between these variables? Some cite working memory as the most important predictor of early academic success.   Somebody who has a strong verbal working memory may generally perform well on other types of verbal tasks included on intelligence tests: vocabulary, verbal reasoning, analogies, antynoms, etc. And be better suited to learn about fields such as literature, biology, foreign languages, etc. because there is a lot of linguistic mastery required in these disciplines.  Or on the other hand, if somebody has a strong visual-spatial working memory they may generally perform well on intelligence tests on other types of visual-spatial tasks that also recruit reasoning ability and long-term memory. And would be better suited to learning about fields such as physics, mathematics, art, architecture, etc. because there is more of a visual-spatial component in these disciplines.  Of course, there are many other factors that affect ability and learning. Working memory would be a small determinant but a determinant nonetheless. Furthermore, there is research which shows a link between spatial ability and achievement in STEM subjects up to graduate level studies for example.   Cognitive abilities from both of these broad areas (overall visual-spatial and verbal ability) certainly overlap highly — same with other types of reasoning abilities such as numerical and logical. However, I assume each area has a bias as to what types of cognitive abilities are used more.   There seems to be a very strong correlation between the two types of working memory or short-term memory. That's what I wanted to find out mainly: What is the relationship between the different types of working memory or short-term memory and other types of reasoning abilities (non-working memory reasoning tasks including verbal ability, numerical, spatial, etc.)? Are the different measures of short-term and working memory measuring approximately the same thing?   How common is the occurance of individuals that have poor verbal working memory and high verbal reasoning scores on intelligence tests for example? How about for visual-spatial working memory and non-working memory visual-spatial scores on intelligence tests?  I've read a few papers on this subject but am unsure of the answer.     Hopefully, someone can point me in the right direction. Thanks.  References:  Timothy F. Brady, Talia Konkle, George A.

1572,Testosterone in women vs. estrogen in men?,"It is known that women with higher estrogen are more likely to find men with higher testosterone as more attractive. Positive feedback is also known.  But are women with higher testosterone level are more likely to find men with higher estrogen level as more attractive? Are men with higher estrogen level are more likely to find women with high testosterone level as more attractive?  Note, that higher testosterone does not immediately mean lower estrogen (so, first paragraph does not answer negatively) or vice versa.

1573,Question concerning Jeff Hawkins' On Intelligence,"In 2004 Jeff Hawkins' book On Intelligence was widely praised. But Hawkins made some claims about artificial neural networks that seem (to me) untenable today, only 13 years later. He gives the impression that artificial neural networks are in principle not capable of what he calls invariant representations and hierarchical storage of patterns (p. 70 ff).  My questions are:   Did he just not (fore)see the development of deep learning which started off at the latest in 2005 (see History of deep learning) and which includes both invariant and hierarchical representations? Or are his retentions against artifical neural networks (including deep learning) justified, and the invariant and hierarchical representations of deep learning are uncompetitive to those of biological networks, i.e. the neocortex? In which respect, then?     About invariant and hierarchical representations (in my words and understanding):   An invariant representation - e.g. of a face - is one, that is independent of and thus invariant with respect to contingent aspects of the image of the face having to do with distance, viewing angle, lighting conditions and the like. It is the representation in the highest layer of a hierarchy of representations with local geometric features being represented in the lowest layer.   This describes superficially both deep learning and cortical architectures. But maybe there are details of implementation/realisation that make the one significantly and genuinely more efficient than the other, e.g. cortical columns which seem not to be present in deep learning architectures, do they? "
1574,Discovery Learning vs. Inductive Learning vs. Active Learning vs. Engaged Learning,"Discovery learning: Novak and Cañas (2008) define discovery learning as a type of learning in which the ""individual discerns patterns or regularities in events or objects and recognizes these as the same regularities labeled by older persons with words or symbols. So, the attributes of concepts are identified autonomously by the learner. This is a phenomenal ability that is part of the evolutionary heritage of all normal human beings"" (p. 3). They exemplify that the first concepts ""are acquired by children during the ages of birth to 3 years, when they recognize regularities in the world around them and begin to identify language labels or symbols for these regularities. ... This early learning of concepts is primarily a discovery learning process.""  On the other hand, Bruyckere, Kirschner, and Hulshof (2015) explain that ""discovery learning"", ""which is sometimes also referred to as self-discovery or active learning, was launched by Jerome Bruner in the 1960s. According to Bruner, education needs to be organized in such a way that the learner interacts with the material to be learned in an active and self-investigatory manner. It is intended that the child should learn to think and solve problems independently. This corresponds closely with the arguments of Piaget, who stated:     Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely (Piaget, p. 715)   ""  On the other hand, following the discussion I initiated a while ago about active learning vs. engaged learning, it seems that they are different names for the same concept.  Inductive Learning: Kornell and Bjork (2008) defines inductive learning as ""learning a new concept or category by observing exemplars—happens constantly, for example, when a baby learns a new word or a doctor classifies x-rays"" (p. 1).  Now the question is if there is any difference between these types of learning or they are just different names used in different contexts for the same concept?  References   Novak, J.

1575,Cockroach olfactory bulb response to novel stimuli,"I've heard anecdotally, that the cockroach olfactory bulb responds differently to novel stimuli vs. known stimuli. Specifically, it sends an oscillatory firing pattern for known stimuli and a constant firing pattern for novel stimuli. However, I'm having a hard time finding a reference for this? Does the olfactory bulb in insects (not just cockroaches) actually respond with different firing patterns? "
1576,Is it actually helpful to write todo lists?,"I've watched these two videos recently   How to Get things done which contains some tips from David Allen's book, ""Getting Things Done"", and the other video How to hack your todo list which also contains some parts from the above mentioned book.   What this author suggests is writing down your tasks instead of keeping it in your prefrontal cortex, therefore you'll be more free to think about task at hand. I think I've read the book long time ago and there is some research mentioned (as in most books alike).   Except for complex tasks that need to be broken down, I almost never had the benefit of writing task to a to do list. I actually found it terrible that my brain seemed to partially forget things while relying on the list [ which I didn't bring with me or I was in the hurry and forgot to look into my phone app]. I don't know if I was biased by the content of the book or if there is some science behind forgetting tasks that you jot down on the piece of paper.   I understand that some people have a more complex day than me and need todo list for not-so-related things, but I find it somewhat scary that so many people so easily rely on something else remembering things for them.  I tried using lists because I was afraid I'll forget what I need to do. When it started bothering me, I decided not to write anything but longer grocery lists. And it's interesting how my brain started remembering things and recalling them exactly when I need them. I didn't feel my brain was cluttered, because I remembered tasks at the right time and right place[ I never thought about grocery list during working hours and vice versa].  I don't know it there is any well known research behind this ""write things down to unclutter your brain""-thing, or it all boils down to poor memory or lack of commitment to remember something important ?  Side question, but related :  is it even possible to quickly forget the task and leave it written on the piece of paper ?   I just want to know if this thing really works or it just sells similar books for time management.  "
1577,How respected is Viktor Frankl's logotherapy among modern psychologists?,"Is Viktor Frankl's logotherapy still a live option in modern psychology, or is it considered outdated? I've heard it referred to as the ""third Viennese school of psychotherapy"", but my wife's introductory psychology textbook (Psychology, 10th ed., David Myers) does not mention Frankl at all.  Is this omission ""incidental,"" or does it accurately reflect a mainstream view that Frankl's work is no longer relevant? "
1578,How technical can cognitive science get during a Master's?,"Nice to find this resource on the internet, I’m in need of advice from knowledgeable people in the field regarding the choice of CogSci Master’s program.  My situation is that I have an undergraduate degree (like a B.A.) in psychology, a major which I never really enjoyed because:    Psychology as a ""survey science"" is not interesting to me. Theoretically, psychology is a mess, too much ""pop science"", not enough clarification of the issues.  I’m not enough adequate/motivated enough to perform in the kind of work psychologists do in clinical, educational or organizational settings.   Anyway, now that i'm done with undergrad, and I found out about CogSci as a parallel-associated-updated field which deals with psychology from a computational basis. I would like to get in a masters where the training in analytical methods, be it computational modeling, statistical analysis or other kinds, is good enough, to have new professional horizons closer to what a computer scientist does.  My current interests are cognitive robotics, behavioral operations management and cognitive economics through as I said mathematical and other analytical methods, which end up having to with Applied Cognitive Science  Given that during my BA I didn't train myself in mathematics enough, would CogSci help develop the relevant skills and change my career perspectives? What programs would you recommend which are strong in this sense? "
1579,What is the evidence for linguistic determinism?,"Lately, I have been pondering whether the idea of linguistic determinism has empirical support.   Background: I know a couple languages, and I am proficient in 2 of them. So sometimes if I need to think through a problem, I use one of them to do one thing and another to do another thing.    I personally feel like I can accomplish more by using these two different languages. So, can this be true, do we just think the same way in, no matter that the language. Does language actually play a part in thinking? Or is it just me.  Also, say I did not know any language, how would I think? This is a rather ambiguous question here, but would that person think through their own concepts and schemas that they developed, in their 'own language'? "
1580,What research has been done on brain-to-brain interfaces?,"Is there an existing research area focusing on brain to brain interfaces?  If so, what are some papers that have been published in this area? "
1581,What is the best way to learn in an environment that only has delayed feedback?,"There are some skills that take a lot of time to learn because feedback is delayed. Examples I have in mind are weightlifting, healthy eating, and mindfulness. The promised effects of practicing these skills are realized after only much time has been spent. This makes the efficiency of one's effort very difficult to see. It is difficult to learn what are the best ways to practice these skills to the best effect.   What general research is there on how to optimally learn in a delayed feedback environment?  More generally, I guess I am asking how people respond to Sorites paradox, also called the sand pile paradox, and how they might psychologically get past it. The sand pile paradox is occurs when you think about removing a grain of sand from a sand pile one at a time. If you have a pile of sand, removing a grain from it will not change it from being a pile a sand. Yet we know the number of grains of sand is finite so eventually all the grains will be removed. In other words, how to large changes from small changes over long periods of time?  I am looking for studies that speak to this. "
1582,How successful are modern (2015) sentiment analysis algorithms for identifying emotion?,"I see a number of questions about implementing  text sentiment analysis algorithms on StackOverflow, and am interested - how effective are sentiment analysis algorithms at identifying the mood/emotion/affect of the writer?   In particular, I'm interested in analysis of a diary entries, where an algorithm is required to identify the affect of the writer.  "
1583,Spontaneity as object of investigation in the cognitive sciences,"What are known studies, experiments, thoughts and literature on spontaneity? I am looking for anything relating to questions like ""What does it mean for someone to be spontaneous?"" or ""What factors are involved in being spontaneous?"" or anything else.  EDIT: aspects of creativity, improvisation in the arts are not meant, but spontaneity in the way of life or in daily behavior. Excuse being unprecise.  I appreciate any hints. "
1584,What is the phenomenon that one can recognize a movie after seeing a scene for a fraction of second called?,"I have experiences that while I was walking around the street, I saw a scene on a TV for a fraction of second, and I instantly recognized the correspondent movie. This is very interesting since at the time I didn't fully comprehend what I saw, but the name of movie came up anyway.   What is this very fast recollection phenomenon called? What is the type of memory involved? Where can I learn more about this cognitive function? "
1585,Is there a way to compare the subjective experiences of two different subjects upon an object?,"It is the major problem of all cognitive sciences to deal with subjectivity. On the other hand, in order to figure out what is cognition or psychology, one must ultimately deal with this problem. As a starter, I wonder if there is any study about identicalness of perceptions among subjects. Are the perceptions of two different subjects on an object identical? In other words, can the perceptions of two subjects about a tomato differ from each other? One may experience the redness of tomato as what the other call blue. "
1586,What is the difference between creators of derivative works of art and original creators?,"I like to write and am a frequent user on writers.stackexchange.com. Many questions there and in other writing or art related communities ask a variation of:     I want to use the setting / characters / names / story of this or that work of fiction to create my own. May I legally do so?   While books and movies inspire the want to be creative in me, I have never felt inclined to use the world or characters or plot of another for my own narratives or create fan fiction. When I read a question like the one quoted above, I always think: ""Why don't you just invent your own world, characters, and story? Don't you have a story inside you that needs to be told ?!?""  Reading those kind of questions makes me wonder what the difference is between creators of derivative works and creators of orginal art.  Sure, everyone is inspired by what they read in books or see in movies, and no one comes up with a tale to tell from a vacuum. Wanting to tell a story you have made up is not per se superior to wanting to tell a (variation of a) story you have read, and many derivative works are better written and more entertaining than their originals. Nevertheless I somehow feel that there is a difference – in motivation, goals, maybe personality.  You could, for example, conceive of creativity as a continuum from the purely derivative to the purely original, with different creators having more or less original ideas. This is a common concept, and we generally admire original creators more, because we feel they have more creative ""genius"".  Or you could take another common perspective and understand artists as being more or less mentally disordered, and originality being a result of the intensity of the artist's depression, schizophrenia or borderline personality, and art being an ""outlet"" or a method of self-reflection or some other way for them to deal with their dysfunction.  There are other ways to interpret the difference. Looking at myself, for example, no matter if my inspiration was life or art, what made me want to write (or make movies or draw) was always a feeling of lack: that something was missing from the story I read, that something about how the story was told left me unsatisfied, because, no matter how touching, that story was never truly about me, never completely told of what concerned me. I don't know how you would characterize this type of motivation to create. Maybe I'm so self-absorbed and egocentric that I cannot care about the creations of others, while those wanting to contribute to another's invention are more socially competent, more collaboratively inclined, even more warm and caring.  What is the difference – in ability or personality – between creators of derivative works and those inventing their own new worlds and characters and stories?  Is there anything in the research on creativity that could explain this difference? "
1587,What are the key dates for the development of operant conditioning?,"I am trying to build up a timeline of the development of operant conditioning. So far I have the following   [tex] - Thorndike performs experiments using his puzzle box of which Skinner based his work on. [tex] - Skinner invents a similiar box called the ""Skinner box"" while studying as a graduate student. [tex] - Skinner coins the term ""operant conditioning"". [tex] - Skinner performs experiments on pigeons. [tex] - Skinner performs experiments on rats.    However, this timeline leaves me skeptical for two reasons.   The first is that the timeline is very stretched out. Skinner invented the box and then it took him 17-18 years to publish his famous studies. What experiments was he performing with his box that weren't as groundbreaking in all those years when his groundbreaking results features a very basic setup?  The second is that Skinner apparently swapped from rats to pigeons in his experiments because they lived longer, learnt faster and were easier to handle yet the according to my timeline the rats experiment took place after the pigeon one (or perhaps not and he just published them in that order).  I suspect my timeline is not quite right (afterall my references are random internet links). My question is what are the (correct) key dates of the development of operant conditioning? Key dates being the events I have highlighted above and any others you think I have missed. I had more references but unfortunately I can only post 2 links due to my reputation. "
1588,Is it easy in languages other than English to read a paragraph where all but the first and last letters of every word have been rearranged?,"I was really surprised how fast I was able to read and comprehend following text:     I cnduo't bvleiee taht I culod aulaclty uesdtannrd waht I was rdnaieg.

Would trick works for languages with longer words, like German?  Does the same phenomenon exist for Asian, non-Latin alphabet based type languages like Mandarin?  UPDATE:   I have tried to scramble longer words as suggested in answer below and it becomes more difficult to read: ""Ceefrconne of iantrintaeonl enatldocatiiuss"" (Conference of international educationalists).   Moreover, if letters just pair-wise permuted - it easier to read than random permutation. My initial feeling is that it should be certain metric that define closeness(distance) of the words to its right spelling. Then ""easiness"" and speed of comprehension will be proportional to that distance. "
1589,Does working memory have a role in creativity?,"What role does working memory play in creativity?  Creativity in this context being easily measurable creativity, so performance on things like the uses task etc. Divergent thinking is the ability to consciously generate new ideas that branch out to many possible solutions for a given problem. It can be tested using the S-A creativity test (Society For Creative Minds, 1969).  My assumption is that creativity is a form of divergent thinking and working memory is required for divergent thinking.  I was wondering if anyone could expand on or dispel this? "
1590,Reading words without pronunciation,"I have been trying to practice speed reading, and found the removal of subvocalization technique, but it seems almost impossible to understand words without pronouncing them in my head.   I think our brain is wired in a way that words are first converted in speech, and then we really understand them. Is it possible to rewire the brain to skip the speech process and start understanding words without experiencing a voice in head?  So far, I have come across the following exercises:   Keep your speech centre busy while reading (e.g., keep repeating ""1,2,3,4"" or ""a,e,i,o,u"" in head while trying to understand what words mean). Think by visualizing words in your head without sound. Visualize the name of the object or action seen, without pronouncing it.   So far, I have made no progress, but this might be more difficult than learning a new language. Maybe I need to be patient and keep practicing these, but are there other better methods, exercises? "
1591,Is there a relationship between body composition and intelligence?,"Does being fat or thin have any significant effect on cognition? For example, I have observed some very fat people who are extremely intelligent and some very thin people that are not and vice versa. John von Neumann was fat and very smart. Are there any studies on this?  "
1592,Does knowing a word for an emotion cause a person to feel the emotion more frequently?,"I am aware of the Frequency Illusion which makes it more likely for us to notice a new word if we just heard about it recently, but I was wondering if this is true for emotions as well.  Logically, I assume it would be yes because you are more aware about your emotions and hence more likely to notice that you are experiencing the emotion. Have there been any conclusive studies done on this subject?  I don't know much about linguistics but if, say, a certain isolated tribe has not come up with a word for ""happiness"", would they ever feel happiness in the same way that we do, or feel it less frequently? "
1593,Are social intelligence and emotional intelligence the same thing?,Emotional intelligence and EQ are often used as phrases for social intelligence.   Are they really the same? Would social intelligence always imply emotional intelligence and vice versa? 
1594,What is the mental state called when I forget my thoughts?,"Suppose I am talking to someone and while talking more thoughts come to my mind that I wish to talk about. I postpone those thoughts, however, to tell everything synchronously, i.e., I wish to tell the old thoughts first and then the new thoughts in sequence. But by the time I finish telling previous thoughts and try to come to those new thoughts that I postponed to tell, some are vanished. This must be a very common phenomenon, as everyone has experienced the dreaded      What on earth was I about to say...?   What is the term for this mental state, or of the process mentioned? "
1595,How does the brain structure 3D visual data?,"Adobe Illustrator has taken over five minutes (and counting) to render a vector 2D image rotated 18° in 3D on my computer. And yet, I and nearly anyone else can easily visualize the subject rotated almost instantaneously, and with little effort rotate the object continuously in real time in the mind's eye.    I'm not asking how the brain stores representations of objects, as that's clearly up for debate. But how does the brain structure its internal representation of 3D visual data?  It's almost definitely not in some pixel-based format, as can be shown by simply visualizing an object of some sort, and then zooming in mentally on some detail and noticing the image retains its sharpness. It's probably not breaking down objects into geometric shapes either, because at least I personally don't visualize my friends as stick figures. It could be a vector format, but then it should be easier to visualize complex shapes that are mathematically simple, like this one:    So it would seem that the brain uses some other format. To the best knowledge of modern cognitive, how does this work? "
1596,Dreams and symbolism. Are dreams trully indicative of what is about to happen or do they merely serve as symbolic direction of what path to follow?,What does it mean for a man to keep dreaming of being pregnant??? Is it normal or does it have a special symbolism? Pls help if you have expertise in interpreting such things  
1597,How do neurons limit their input current?,"I know that many neurons have an input current-spiking frequency (I-F) relationships, e.g. as seen here.  However, all the I-F curves I've encountered show the input current in a fairly small range (few pA or nA), suggesting that there is no limit to this behavior.  However, if the current is increased indefinitely, there is a point where the membrane voltage does not recover to the resting, or smaller, potential. For example, here are voltage traces of a simulated mitral cell:  At 0.1nA:    0.5nA:    1nA:    10nA:    How do neurons limit the amount of current that enters the cell? If the cell is large, with many incoming synapses, it seems like there would be stimuli that could result in ""too many channels"" open at the same time. How do cells ensure the input current remains within the acceptable range?  "
1598,Severe depression/anxiety can't be treated with CBT,"Is there any evidence that supports the idea that a severe depression/anxiety can't be treated with CBT?   Since, it's in severe state, and one has to use anti-depressants to lower the level, and then obviously CBT can help reduce a moderate to low level depression. Is a severe depression/anxiety too strong to be healed by CBT, and it makes the usage of anti-depressants necessary? "

1600,"Does increased motor development always occur at the expense of speech development, or vice versa?","It is often said that infants / toddlers* develop in a focused manner. I am specifically interested in the notion  that a quick development of speech occurs at the expense of motor skill development and vice versa.   Is there scientific evidence that speech and motor control development are indeed competitive, in the sense that a quick development of motor control inhibits speech development, or vice versa?   Can they develop more or less in parallel as well?   *With infants / toddlers I mean normal, healthy kids between 0 and 24 months of age. "
1601,Does the meta-analytic literature overestimate the relationship between conscientiousness and job performance?,"There are quite a few meta-analyses of the relationship between personality and job performance (for a review, see Barrick &amp; Mount, 2012; and specific meta-analyses: Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991; Murray R Barrick, Michael K Mount, &amp; Timothy A Judge, 2001; Hurtz &amp; Donovan, 2000; J. Salgado, 1997; Tett, Jackson, &amp; Rothstein, 1991).   These often come up with raw meta-analytic mean correlations between conscientiousness and job performance of around r = .15.  However, there is a lot of discussion in general at the moment about replicability  and publication bias. In particular, if papers that showed a correlation between personality and job performance, were more likely to be published, then this would inflate the meta-analytic estimate.   Alternatively, there have been quite a few studies of personality and performance with huge sample sizes (10,000+) and these would quite likely be published regardless of the exact results, and they also would have sufficient statistical power to detect even small effects. And for most meta-analyses, large sample size studies get a greater weighting in the estimation process.  I seem to remember reading a paper a few months back that examined this question. If I recall, the authors concluded that the meta-analytic estimate of relationship between conscientiousness and performance might be inflated slightly. However,  I can't remember what was the reference.  Questions   What research has been conducted on publication bias or other factors that might influence the accuracy of the meta-analytic estimate of the relationship between personality (and conscientiousness specifically) and job performance? What is the evidence for and against this?  "
1602,Why are people insecure?,"Many people, especially teenagers, are insecure about some aspects. They may be insecure about their looks, their (odd) behavior, or may question whether they belong to a group (of friends, colleagues and what not). I quickly looked at some social psychological literature but I could only find that in some cultures people are more self-oriented and in others they are more group-oriented (see the abstract of this book, I was not able to read more).   I was wondering thus: why people are insecure?   If I would consider an evolutionary perspective, insecurity (1) should have some beneficial effects, (2) should disappear if harmful for people, or (3) is not harmful enough to disappear. It is not likely to be the second for it then should not exist, so hypothesis (1) and (3) remain. Is there some benefit to being insecure, or is their some other explanation for why it exists? "
1603,Do women have fetishes?,As in title; is it possible/common for women to have fetishes?  It always seemed to me that fetishes are related to men only. Is it true?  
1604,Other emotions relative to angry/happy base emotions,"In my layman's experience, I'm vaguely aware there are four base emotions: happy, sad, afraid/surprised, and angry/disgusted.1  Some background:  We're training an AI to learn the difference between happy voices and angry voices.  We've had some success, by showing it 200 angry audio clips, 200 happy audio clips, and 200 neutral.  It can now reasonably tell when we're talking pleasantly or confrontationally... but the accuracy could be better.  Our total training dataset is made up of these audio clips: Happy, angry, neutral, calm, sad, fearful, disgust, and surprised. I think we can be more accurate by including these emotions.    But this is the problem:  Happy/angry/neutral span opposite ends of a spectrum; like binary.  It's easy to say:  Happy     1 Neutral   0 Angry    -1   That's the shape of the data we need to train a neural network to recognize 'Happy'.   So the question would be, is there any 'right answer' on filling in these blanks?  I've given it my best guesses below, but I'm hoping for something more scientific....  Happy     1 Angry    -1 Neutral   0 Calm      X  (0.5?) Sad       X  (-1?) Fearful   X  (-0.5?) Disgust   X  (-0.75?) Surprised X  (0.75?)     1: [website]"
1605,Correlation between sex and achievement,"I heard an anecdotal opinion that according to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis, people who don't fulfill themselves sexually tend to be more diligent. I would like to know; was any research conducted to confirm that statement?  By ""don't fulfill themselves sexually"" I mean that they are abstinent or unfulfilled  By ""more diligent"" I mean that they work harder or are more determined to achieve their goals.  All I could find to reference my question is defence mechanism described by Freud, called sublimation. I would like to know if any group-experiment based research can support this.  There is very similar question already on cogsci here, which seems to provide conclusion that:     The question ""What is the effect of sexual abstinence on intellectual   and artistic achievment?"" has specifically been answered by studies on   celibacy, which show either no or a negative effect (Baumeister, Dale,   &amp; Sommer, 1998).

1607,"What is this method used in the ""it's not your fault"" segment of Good Will Hunting and why does it work?","I mean the ""it's not your fault"" part at the end of this movie segment. Could anybody explain this method and why it works?   What happens if the psychologist didn't get any reaction (like crying) from the case (Will), doesn't he look like a jerk repeating the same words 9 times? "
1608,Why do people often do unnecessary things while performing a main task?,"And this is not about procrastination (I'm almost certain).  I've been noticing it since childhood that people (me included) tend to do unnecessary side activity, especially if they're invested in the main activity.  Examples of main activity: having a thoughtful conversation, watching an interesting movie, crafting something manually.  Examples of side activities: doing tricks with a pen, playing with shirt buttons, doodling, tearing a piece of paper into smaller parts, attaching and detaching magnets, in other words almost anything slightly amusing/interesting/touch-pleasant.  The side activity tends to increase with the intensity of main activity, only ceasing at the point where the main activity takes all the concentration a person can manage to attain.  What causes this? Does it somehow help us perform the main activity? Then how exactly? Or is it a reaction to performing something effortsome? "
1609,Can a biological entity be thought as a simple algorithm? Case-study with the concept of randomness,"John Von Neuman believed that all organisms can be though of as information-processing systems. He built on the work of Alan Turing (algorithmic) to create simulations of biological entities. This philosophy lead to the use of cellular automaton. This kind of analysis allowed to gain many insights in biology.  Does it make sense to you to reduce the behavior of an organism to the output of an algorithm?   There are several things that are not feasible in algorithmic. Randomness is one of these. Does it seem fair to you to consider that we actually produce pseudorandomness, a function with a chaotic behavior that cycle and might end up repeating itself?  The questions in short:   Can an organism be reduced to as being an algorithm as found in computers? Can an organism produce randomness (random choice, random behavior) or only pseudo-randomness?  "

1613,Computational model of biological object recognition,"The human brain can achieve a remarkable ability to recognize visual patterns in an Invariant, selective and fast manner. The human visual system is quite powerful. It has an exquisite selectivity that allows us to distinguish among very similar objects. In addition, iy also allows Robustness (Invariance) to transformations.  In the model (Ventral stream pathway and architecture proposed by Poggio's group) shown in the image below, why the model is selective in S layers and invariant in C layers ? I didn't understand well why the S layer achieves selectivity and C layer achieves invariance. Please can someone explain to me in details why the model is selective in S and Invariance in C layers?  And who know the HMAX model, the model is called ""Hierarchical Model and X"". why X? what was meant by ""X"" ?   This figure is from Serre et al.'s A quantitative theory of immediate visual recognition. Prog Brain Res. 2007.  Any help will be very very appreciated. "
1614,How to create an effective and efficient team - with the same or different cognitive style?,"We've all participated in team building activities, where the goal is to get the team working better together in an environment very different from their usual occupation situation. As a team member you are supposed to build trust among other team players, and that they will trust you. This should have a positive impact on the teams effectiveness and efficiency.  I've been told that a diverse team is better than a team less diverse. Of course it depends on the project to be executed, but nevertheless this is what I hear and read about all the time. There are little opposition to this position, maybe because it's politically incorrect?!  However, on Wikipedias article Cognitive style one can read that:     ... team members with similar cognitive styles likely feel more positive about their participation with the team. While matching cognitive styles may make participants feel more comfortable when working with one another, this alone cannot guarantee the success of the outcome.   But if the team already find trust in each other based on their similar cognitive style, they would most probably start to be more effective than an unequal team. I'm not mixing cognitive style with diversity, but I feel there is more to it than just that. What would form the ultimate team? One with the same cognitive style, or one with different cognitive style?   How to create an effective and efficient team - with the same or different cognitive style? "
1615,How can machine possibly possess consciousness if computation is a human idea?,"Suppose a computer simulates a human brain so that it passes the Turing test. Suppose that this brain is given sensory stimuli that correspond to an experience of being in an Earth-like world.  From my understanding, proponents of computationalism suppose that this simulated brain would have qualia.  The neural network, its state, and the program code are stored on a computer, and can only be observed if someone knows how to use this computer. How a neural network is represented in memory and on disk, depends on data structures, computer architecture, endianness, et cetera.  Suppose then that the last human on Earth dies, but the simulation keeps running on the computer. If there is no one in the Universe who understands how this particular computer works, then no one would be able to observe this simulated brain.  In other words, this brain would be impossible to “decode”, and yet it would supposedly still experience qualia.  It follows that if this is the case, then nothing prevents other “invisible” brains from existing.  We know that a computer is a computational device, and it is running a complex neural network that corresponds to a human-like mind, but the Universe doesn't “know” it.  It is our interpretation of what is happening. I can't stray from the conclusion that if the premise is true, then there may be different processes that isomorphically correspond to computations, some of which may isomorphically correspond to minds, but we won't know it because we don't see this isomorphism.  Why couldn't processes inside the Sun correspond to some computation (albeit in a non-straightforward way) which corresponds to a mind? By that logic, there could be infinitely many minds, all experiencing some sorts of qualia, “encoded” in different ways in all processes in the world.  Conversely, what if we replace a computer with a man (with a large lifespan) meticulously following the algorithm on paper. Would his computations somehow give rise to consciousness within a brain simulated on paper?  This just doesn't make sense to me. Do computationalists believe this, or do they have a counter-argument? "
1616,Why does venlafaxine have lower incidence of sexual dysfunctions at higher doses?,"Venlafaxine at low dosages strongly inhibits serotonin, at moderate dosages also norepinephrine and only high dosages it also inhibits dopamine.  The ratio is the following.   serotonin : norepinephrine : dopamine 1 : 30 : 93   According to the FDA data these are the percentages for side effects.   Libido decreased Placebo 75mg 225mg 375mg 1.1% 2.2% 1.1% 5.7%   Here are the results for other sexual dysfunctions.   Abnormal ejaculation/orgasm Placebo 75mg 225mg 375mg 0.0% 4.5% 2.2% 12.5%   and   Impotence Placebo 75mg 225mg 375mg 0.0% 5.8% 2.1% 3.6%   How would you explain the sudden drop of sexual dysfunctions at 225mg?  Other questions to consider:   Would a lower dose (37.5mg or 25mg) have sexual side effects (SSE) similar to placebo? What dose has the lowest rate of SSE? What is the lowest effective dose with reasonably low SSE? How would adding of NDRI (bupropione) influence SSE given an increased dosage of venlafaxine? (i.e. Could one afford higher doses of venlafaxine with few SSE provided bupropion is taken concomittantly?)  "
1617,Is there any evidence for or against the existence of neurons that encode surface slant in vision?,In the way orientation columns display selectivity for various edge orientations projected on the retina which is then repeated at various angles in a localised region of the cortex. I am wondering whether in an analogous fashion if any similar neuronal circuitry has been shown to represent variations in the surface slant at the region being projected onto the retina.   By slant I mean a measure of the surfaces orientation away from co-planar with the visual focal plane.  Perhaps this information is extracted from binocular receptive fields?  If it hasn't been found then I guess I'm also wondering if anyone has ever looked? and or how the depth information from binocular receptive fields is encoded/represented for further processing?  
1618,Does CBT indirectly resolve core issues?,"(I don't expect that it would do so as successfully as interventions that aim to do so directly, but:)  From the outside, it seems CBT ignores the root causes of the issue, some may say building on sand (I'm pretty sure there's some such expression but I can't recall it)  My question is, does CBT actually help resolve core issues (any belief/emotional response a clinical psychologist might see as detrimental to the psychological and/or physical health of his patient and from which the problems the therapist wishes to resolve likely stem) indirectly? Do we affect our core issues in order to resolve the conflict one might cause by creating a new behavior that is incompatible with said issues? "
1619,Basic Question on Jungian Archetypes,"I am reading ""Psychology by Sandra E. Hockenbury, 7th ed."". The question asked What form might Jungian archetypes take in the brain? takes a deeper look at jungian archetypes but I am not able to understand the definition of the archetypes. The book defines the term as follow:     Contained in the collective unconscious are the archetypes, the mental images of universal human instincts, themes, and preoccupations.    I understood the term collective unconscious as the deepest part of psyche shared by all humans which contain our collective evolutionary history. The book goes on and give examples as:     Common archetypal themes that are expressed in virtually every culture are the hero, the powerful father, the nurturing mother, the witch, the wise old man, the innocent child, and death and rebirth. Two important archetypes that Jung (1951) described are the   anima and the animus—the representations of feminine and masculine qualities.   Let's take one example ""powerful father"" it says that it is the mental image of human instinct. But at the same time he mentions ""collective unconscious"" but not everyone share the same image of father. I know that he proposed this example around 80 years before but still not all the humans have the same instinct or do we? What I am missing? "
1620,How will anyone scientifically tell what is innate to humans?,"According to Freud humans are basically driven by sexual and aggressive instincts while famous humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers strongly disagreed with Freud and said the basic nature of human being is good, forward moving and sympathetic. Although, neither of them denied the opposite nature of human behaviour that they were claiming but they constantly focused on the word ""innate"".  For me the word innate itself seems so vague in terms of its scientific measurement. What is the current stand of modern psychologists on this question? How do they measure the innate nature of human? Or since, the question itself is so unclear that psychologists don't care anymore?  References:   Psychology by Sandra E. Hockenbury, 7th ed.  "
1621,Can a friend become a therapist?,"According to the article Can Clients and Therapists Be Friends?, a therapist shouldn't be a friend because dual relationship will interfere the efficiency of the therapy, and the imbalance power formed in therapy will never fully disappear. However, would it be true in the opposite direction? That a friend does therapy to a friend? This time, the friend relationship comes first, so there will be no worry about the imbalance power.   I think there are two scenarios:   The therapist-friend is just a friend with more knowledge, and the therapy is just a talk with more advice from one side The therapist-friend cannot become an authority that is necessary in certain cases (personality disorders, for example)    The person can also be a family member, a partner, a colleague, or even an acquaintance. The point is that the relationship is not formed in a professional therapeutic setting. "
1622,Can one reasonably guess the gender of a person from their writing/speech contents?,"Is it possible to reasonably guess the gender of a person from a random sample of their writing (text, not handwriting)?  How about from the contents of their speech (not including their voice, of course)? "
1623,What speaker is commonly used for low-latency audio stimulation,"We need to purchase a new speaker for audio ERP study, so the sound should be played in lowest possible latency with lowest possible jitter. I have seen quite a few suggestion on the OS/driver/sound card part, but it seems that there is less information about how to choose the proper speaker.   What is the common latency between the the time point when the sound card actually start sending out signal, and the time point when the speaker actually start vibrating? And are there any point that we should take care when choosing the speaker? "
1624,Do we think in language?,"Can we think i.e. process the input data without relying on linguistic structures?  All knowledge between human is either spoken or written. When we see something, it contributes towards the construction of properties of the object seen. For example, when I see an image of red apple, I register an object which is an apple with a property of redness.  Now suppose a person comes and cuts the apple into two halves; I am basically witnessing the event of cutting the apple. To make any sense out of the visual, it is necessary to think (or process the input visual) that the apple has been cut. As you can see, this processing required usage of linguistic structures : cut, person, half, etc; these linguistic structures have been employed so as to be able to make a minimally acceptable sense (it is not sufficient to sense that something happened).  What about intuition? When smart people get what they call as 'intuition', is it, in first place, constructed in their mind on linguistic platform? Or its source is something undefinable; only attempts are made to convey the phenomenon/intuition/idea using language?  An equivalent question can be framed as follows: Can every possible human thought be satisfactorily communicated using a given language i.e. a set of words? "
1625,Is there a basic mathematical relationship between IQ and learning speed?,"Is there a basic mathematical relationship between IQ and learning speed? ... such as linear, exponential, etc?  For example, if some number of people with an approximate IQ of 100 (95-105) take X minutes to complete a task (lets also say plus-minus 5%), is there an expected average Y time people with an average 120 would need?  Can you cite the research? "
1626,How to get rid of subvocalization?,"When I read a text written in latin alphabet and I want to understand what it means I usually   transform each word into spoken word (internal speech) and then I transform it into meaning.   I can't get rid of the first phase and reduce the reading process to the second phase only. In Wikipedia, this internal speech is described as subvocalization.  When I read in chinese I'm able to leave out subvocalization and go directly to the meaning. In many cases I learned only the meanings of symbols without knowing how to pronounce the symbol. I'm leaving out this mental burden and surf through the text without subvocalization. Reading is faster and my mind is in the relaxed state as if watching a movie without speech.  Are their some techniques I can learn to get rid of subvocalization when reading texts written in latin alphabet or cyrillic? Could you cite a few sources researching this skill? "
1627,Difference between Instinct and Intuition,"Sometimes I've heard people using the term gut feeling rather than their 'intuition or instinct' and I'm not sure which one do they mean. So, can both the terms be used interchangeably and simply referred to as a 'gut feeling'? Is there a real difference between Instinct and Intuition? "
1628,What is the field that studies community responses to incentives?,"Having recently read Freakonomics I was particularly interested by the idea of the responses of a community to incentives - as an example, the tale of a school which tried to introduce a financial penalty for picking up children late, which inadvertently had the opposite effect, as it nullified the previously existing (but largely invisible) social penalty.  Is there a general theory for this kind of interaction of incentives with community? If so, what is its name, and where could I read more about it? I'm interested in books and papers on a variety of levels, from popular accounts (à la Freakonomics) to textbooks to research papers. "
1629,Game-theory strategies to overcome holdout problem?,"The hold-out problem often occurs in debt-restructuring or in urban development.  The hold-out problem is defined where an agent, for example a land developer, must negotiate with many lot owners and each lot owner must provide their consent in order for a project to proceed. However, since the agents know that their consent is required they can extract a portion of the producer surplus in excess of their opportunity costs. The net effect is that such large-scale projects are underproduced.  There are legal remedies to address this underproduction. Eminent domain is a legal tool to overcome hold-out problems, however, it does not consider pareto-efficiency. It's not at all clear whether developers that exercise eminent domain are increasing social welfare or simply have better influence over a political process to transfer resources from one group to another.  Ideally, we would like a voluntary bargaining solution that all (or most) parties agree to that produces a socially efficient amount. A bargaining solution should always be arrived at when the social utility of the production exceeds the opportunity costs of each individual and the producer cost.  What bargaining ""game"" could be designed (and enforced or enabled by a legal process) so that such a procedure could be applied to hold-out problems? "
1630,Do safety features cause drivers to engage in more risky behavior than they otherwise would?,"It seems to be generally assumed that making cars safer for the occupants will reduce death, injury, and damage from traffic accidents.  What are some examples of significant empirical research on this topic? Specifically, do safety features cause drivers to engage in more risky behavior than they otherwise would? If so, what is the net effect of additional safety mechanisms?   "
1631,Can information be lost while traveling through neurotransmitters?,"Can information be lost while traveling through neurotransmitters, if so then why? If information can be lost while traveling then is it possible to retransmit them and put back in order? For example data can be lost while traveling through network therefore we need to use TCP (transmission control protocol).  If information can be lost while traveling through neurotransmitter. Then is it possible that, not being able to remember something you want or remembering something that are not in their orders? "
1632,"Are emotions a function of muscle contractions? If so, how does the map look like?","I hope this is the right (or rightest) place to ask this question, I wasn't sure whether this question is more appropriate for cogsci or biology. After all, it does concern the biology of emotions.  To my knowledge, it is established research that the brain 'knows' what emotions you are having by examining their manifestations in the body. This absurd rube-goldbergian wiring can for instance be used to force oneself to become happier (at least temporarily) by smiling for a few minutes.  This brings up the question, whether emotions have any identity separate from a cluster of bodily sensations (or even more specifically, muscle contractions) at all.  It is certainly true (by introspection for e.g.) that 'negative' emotions are accompanied by muscle contradictions. On the other hand, there are several different 'negative' emotions that can be easily distinguished by the person having the emotion (e.g. shame and fear). Unfortunately I am not able to simply recall the sensations I had when I was ashamed or fearful from memory and compare them, but I would assume you could even tell from the outside, simply by looking at the person afflicted, which of the two emotions they are going through.  So, what does the research say? Are emotions uniquely recognizable by facial expression/muscle contractions? Or do emotions have some kind of 'hidden variables' in the brain? "
1633,What electrical stimuli do brain implants use?,"I was reading about artificial eyes and came to think about how the brain works. More specifically, what ""signals"" it uses in the case of cortical visual prosthetics in blind people? Cortical prosthetics apply current stimulations through electrodes placed on the surface of the visual cortex.   Now suppose I would want to let a blind person wearing a cortical prosthesis to see the color red, what signal would I send through the electrodes? Would a sine wave of 200 Hz do the job?  "
1634,How to fix a cognitive distortion?,"Are there any methods for ""fixing"" cognitive distortions?   For example, I have prejudice against certain type of people just because of one negative experiences in my life. Although a lot of research by my own show that I'm completely wrong to think this way about all people of the certain type I just can't fix my attitude towards them. It's like I'm programmed to think this way.  So what should person do in order to edit his/her beliefs if all necessary information about the topic is already obtained?  All advises I see are to research the topic or write pros and cons of the attitude but this isn't helpful because of established cognitive patterns which are in place for years. "
1635,"A formal term for overcoming something, or getting over something","I am trying to find a correct psychological term for a specific type of behavior.  When a person is trying to distance themselves from past suffering by projecting an idea of ""I'm over it"" to others. Trying to convince others and maybe even themselves that they've overcome something.  For example, a person who has suffered depression is trying to project an idea of ""I'm over it and never going back"" to another person suffering from depression.  A similar example would be about two people dealing with divorce or breakup and one person tries to project that they are over it not wanting to feel the pain or suffering that the other person is experiencing.  Is it distancing? Is it disengagement? Since there are different types of distancing, some positive some negative, what type is this? Is it overcompensating? Or something else completely? "
1636,"Does mindful meditation inhibit diffuse thinking (aka default mode network), creativity and make studying less effective?","Barbara Oakley's ""Learning how to Learn"" and ""Mindshift"" courses claim that having some break time in which diffuse mode thinking (afaik it's the same as default mode network) is active between study sessions (at least if you acquire knowledge or practice intellectual skills) is important. She says that seemingly unrelated concepts get linked, and the brain figures out what to do with all this new information during diffuse mode. It also boosts creativity. From my own experience diffuse mode also helps me think of ways to use the new information, e.g. to achieve my goals or to study more effectively (maybe it's a part of the ""creativity"" thingy).  Mindful meditation seems to provide multiple benefits for mental health. I wonder if replacing many breaks (aka time when I don't do intellectual work) with meditation is bad because I will not have enough diffuse mode thinking and creativity time.  I've tried 2 types of mindfulness meditation: body scan, during which one sequentially goes over different body parts and listens to the senses in that body part and tries not to think or do anything else; and breathing meditation, during which one focuses on one's breathing and ignores everything else. Just from how I feel during that time, I would say that I am not in diffuse mode during meditation.  What diffuse mode is, citations from A Mind for Numbers:     Since the very beginning of the twenty-first century, neuroscientists have been making profound advances in understanding the two different types of networks that the brain switches between—highly attentive states and more relaxed resting state networks.1 We’ll call the thinking processes related to these two different types of networks the focused mode and diffuse mode      Edward de Bono is the grand master of creativity studies, and his vertical and lateral terminology is roughly analogous to my use of the terms focused and diffuse (de Bono 1970).      Astute readers will notice my mention that the diffuse mode seems to sometimes work in the background while the focused mode is active. However, research findings show that the default-mode network for example (which is just one of the many resting state networks), seems to go quiet when the focused mode is active. So which is it? My sense as an educator and a learner myself is that some nonfocused activities can continue in the background when focused work is taking place, as long as the focused attention is shifted away from the area of interest. In some sense, then, my use of the term diffuse mode might be thought of as “nonfocused mode activities directed toward learning” rather than simply “default-mode network.”   UPDATE: It turns out the the second week has a video on mindfulness and learning:     researchers can sometimes classify meditation techniques into two different types that seem to be fundamentally different. Focused attention and open monitoring.      Focus attention types of meditations such as mantra, sound or chakra meditation appear to help enhance focus mode type thinking, this kind of meditation sometimes seems to make people feel better.      In contrast, open monitoring types of meditation such as, vipassana and mindfulness, appear to improve diffuse imaginative thinking. With open monitoring, we don't just focus on one thing. Instead we keep our attention open to all aspects of experience without judging or becoming attached to our thoughts.      Part of the reason that building your focusing abilities may help make you feel happier. Is that it appears to suppress the diffuse mode, while it builds the focusing mode. So what does all this mean? It means that meditation can have surprisingly different effects, depending on the type. It's all very complex, and researchers are far from sorting everything out yet. In the end, practices that encourage focusing can be a great benefit for learning. But having some daily time where your mind relaxes and wanders freely is also very important, particularly if you want to encourage creativity. From a particular stand point then if you are a meditator you might try to avoid feeling you should always be stirring your thoughts back into focus, If you catch your mind wondering outside meditation sessions.   Turns out that some types of meditation happen in diffuse mode and others happen in focused mode. My guess would that guided body scan and breathing meditation are focused.   Also I am not sure what she means saying that diffuse mode meditations may improve diffuse imaginative thinking. Did she just randomly blurt it out meaning trying to say that those types of meditation happen in diffuse mode? Or did she say that meaning that if you practice entering diffuse mode by meditating then your diffuse mode becomes better or you will enter it more often?  Also I think that even during diffuse mode meditations, e.g. listening to body sensations that come to attention (I thnk it's diffuse mode, not 100% sure), you don't get creative and don't link concepts and process knowledge, because you're still thinking about body sensations and nothing else.

What is the thing we need to learn to ride a bicycle or is it just telling the brain that it is ok? And why do we not forget cycling? Thank You. 
1639,Are there any long term cognitive impairments from prolonged period reduced sleep?,"What are the consequences of chronic lack of sleep? For example, insomniacs are known to sleep less than normal sleeping individuals.   I am wondering if there are any long term cognitive impairments from reducing sleep time to, say 4h instead of the normally recommended 8 hours in the long run, say for a year or so? "
1640,Can One Have a Temporary Manifestation of Dyslexia?,"I have a friend who said he was taking a test in college that involved many calculations (similar to a math test). He inexplicable mixed up numbers, for example, he switched 16 to be 61. Although he did all of the steps correctly, he got the wrong answers due to this mixup. This did not just happen once on this test, but repeatedly. He says that he has not had any issues with dyslexia throughout his life. But his sister does have it.  What might be going on here? Is it possible that he has a very mild form of dyslexia that does not manifest itself except in certain circumstances (I don't know, but perhaps he was nervous/anxious when taking the test)? "
1641,Can similarity be confused with recency?,Does similarity of a cue modify it's perceived recency?  Consider this hypothetical experiment:   Given a set of visual cues presented sequentially to a subject Present a final visual probe. Ask the subject:  a. If the visual probe has been seen before  b. How long it has been since the visual probe has been seen   Would the similarity of the visual probe influence judgments of time difference? 
1642,Matching continous patterns in visual signals,"Similar to my question about auditory signals, how do people match visual signals from memory? For example, consider the simplest case where there is a single degree of movement freedom, such as a knob moving up and down in a slider. If the subject was previously presented a set of these visual knob signals and then has to identify if the presented signal was present in the set, what features do humans tend to focus on? Is amplitude, frequency or something else entirely? Alternatively, a reference to what this type of experiment is called would be appreciated. "

1644,Term for Plotting (as in behavior),"I watched a video (First Man) on the evolution of humans that suggested the birth of language was probably the key to ""plotting"" and politics.  I'd like to learn more about plotting, but it's a hard thing to search for online, because the word plot is so frequently used in the context of plotting a thing's position (on a graph, for example).  Conspire and conspiracy are also inconvenient search terms because there's so much propaganda to wade through.  Is there a technical term for plotting or conspiring? "
1645,"Does the digit span test draw on any executive functions besides working memory, if ""chunking"" is not used?","Does the digit span test draw on any executive functions besides working memory, if ""chunking"" is not used?  This answer neatly explains what chunking is     This [""chunking""] is much easier explained in the domain of letters/words, e.g.   we'd recognize USA as substring among random letters. Similarly most   would recognize the pattern 1945 (WWII end) by paired association, or   12321 algorithmically.   I'm not sure I believe that the digit span is a test of a single raw cognitive function.   e.g. surely we don't need to ""chunk"" for perceptual speed to play a role: would that be helped by other executive functions?

1646,"What does ""non-linear processing"" mean, exactly?","In the following sentence from ""How does the brain solve visual object recognition?"" by DiCarlo et al.:     In sum, our view is that the “output” of the ventral stream is   reflexively expressed in neuronal firing rates across a short interval   of time (~50 ms), is an “explicit” object representation (i.e., object   identity is easily decodable), and the rapid production of this   representation is consistent with a largely feedforward, non-linear   processing of the visual input.   I'm familiar with ""feed-forward"" but not with the meaning of ""non-linear processing"" in a neuroscience context. What does ""non-linear processing"" mean, exactly? "
1647,How to generate the reward signal in temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm?,"With reference to the TD learning algorithm proposed by Sutton and Barto which is given by the equations:  $$V_i(t+1) = V_i (t)+ \beta \bigg(\lambda(t+1)+\gamma \bigg[\sum_{j}V_j(t)X_j(t+1)\bigg]-\bigg[\sum_{j}V_j(t)X_j(t) \bigg]  \bigg)\alpha\bar{X}_i(t+1),\\  \bar{X}_i(t+1)=\bar{X}_i(t)+\delta\big(X_i(t)-\bar{X}_i(t)\big)$$ I have the following doubts:   If I want to simulate the algorithm in a standalone environment then how do I generate the reward signal [tex]?   How is [tex] related to the conditioning stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus?     For example, if I wanted to simulate the facilitation of a remote association by an intervening stimulus in the TD model as shown in the fig. below then will it suffice if I consider ""lambda"" to be a signal as represented by US ?    I have been able to design suitable CSA and CSB. However, when I use a [tex] as specified by US in the image, I don't get the result that is shown in the trials. What could possibly go wrong in the formulation of the reward?  The equations can be found in chapter 12 of the book by Sutton &amp; Barto, 1990.

1649,"Why is homosexuality considered ""natural""?","Ok, firstly I don't know if this is the right forum to ask this question.   Secondly and most importantly I am an ally and a supporter of the community, its rights and for their equality.  Recently, I met a guy who was a military veteran and did not support the LGBTQ community and we got into a healthy argument. I told him that homosexuality was found everywhere in nature (gave him examples of a lot of animals that reproduce by having sex with the same gender).  But his counter argument was that none of these organisms have sex for pleasure (like humans do)! He went on to say that it was a rudimentary component of sustained growth for an organism's culture to produce progeny and continue growing to avoid extinction and that's why it is is justified in those organisms and he asked me from a purely biological standpoint, if homosexuality in humans was essential to the survival of the species.   Interestingly, I found his argument valid and could not produce a counter argument to it. I said I'll ask people and get back to him on this. So, Is his argument right?  I mean, if nature thought it was natural for humans to mate with the same gender, then it would've facilitated reproduction to keep the species alive right?  So, here's the crux of my question, when psychology says ""homosexuality in humans is natural"", does it mean that some people are born with a natural attraction towards the same sex (""wired that way"" in layman's terms) or does it mean biologically?  I know this is the wrong community to ask about biology, but would be interesting to see how they'd argue to this question. Would they consider it ""natural"" as well? "
1650,Experiments showing adaptation to growing task complexity,"I'm looking for experiments measuring how people manage growing task complexity.  For example, consider a task, which on the surface resembles a Go No-go task, with the first instruction:        Given a sequence of circles of either red or green, when you see a green circle followed by a red circle, press the red button.      After some practice, a second instruction is added:     2a. Given a sequence of circles of either red, blue or green, when you see a blue circle followed by a red circle, press the blue button.   This instruction doesn't add much to the task complexity, but consider a more complex instruction such as:     2b. Given a sequence of circles of either red, blue or green, when you see a blue circle followed by a red circle, say the word ""blue"".   In this instruction, an output modality is added. However, one could imagine another instruction where an interfering pattern is added.     2c. Given a sequence of circles of either red, blue or green, when you see a blue circle followed by a red circle, press the yellow button.   Or an instruction where a cognitive component is added:     2d. Given a sequence of circle of either red or green, as well as the occasional digit, when you see a red circle followed by a digit, say the value of digit+1   Are the experiments/models that predict the performance on various tasks given increasing complexity? The best reviews I could find were:   ""An information-theoretic perspective on the costs of cognition"" by Zenon et al. ""An information theory account of cognitive control"" by Jin Fan   However, these didn't seem to include any tasks with gradually increasing complexity. Are there experiments or models that address this? I feel like this is related to ""cognitive load"", but I couldn't find any resources describing adaptation to ""cognitive load"" with practice. "
1651,What is the rationale for the normal distribution of intelligence?,"What is the rationale for the normal distribution of intelligence?     I'm asking what the rationale is for saying that 68% of variance within intelligence falls within 1 standard deviation either side of the mean, and 95% within 2, etc.. That's just what ""normal distribution"" means. Here is a picture:   Why not suppose that intelligence is e.g. a uniform distribution? You can see clearly, in the picture below, that if it's modeled in that way:   someone's deviation from the mean will be equal to the probability of their score.    "
1652,Does STDP make the Hebbian learning rule redundant?,"On Scholarpedia they introduce STDP (spike timing dependent plasticity) as a temporally asymmetric form of Hebbian learning, making it sound as if the original Hebbian rule still has relevance in neuroscience. On the wiki page on Hebbian theory, however, it seems SDTP and Hebbian theory are pretty much synonyms.   Do all cases of neuron types that were previously thought to follow the Hebbian learning rule (fire together, wire together) actually follow the STDP rule? If not, are there statistics about how often each learning rule occurs in the brain? "

1654,How are abstract relations represented neurally?,"It is known that concepts with similar attributes (color, shape... Etc.) are represented in a similar manner in the brain. However, is there any evidence of abstract relations, such as the as causal relation between two events are also represented in similar manners?  For a example, the relation between a switch and a light (wherein the tilting of the switch causes the light to turn on), should have the same representation as a knob and a light (wherein the turning of the knob causes the light to turn on).   What experimental setup could be used to test this with fMRI? "
1655,How do we hear our inner voice?,"How do we perceive inner speech? Does it follow the same neural pathways as normal acoustic speech? If yes, what is the extent of overlap between the two neural pathways? "
1656,How image orientation influences perception,"Im a painter for many years. When I paint, I usually walk around and look at my painting for many hours. When painting session is long, it harder and harder to maintain a ""fresh look"".  By fresh look; I mean state of mind (perception) when I am as objective about my work as possible. The longer the session continues and painting is changed; its harder for me to be objective about it.  To be objective and fresh, artists would take many 5-min breaks in one painting session. I used to do that too, until I learned a ""strange trick"" from my friend.  Whole trick is to take your painting and just rotate it about 90 or 180 degrees for a moment and look at it. Surprisingly, this gives a fresh (somehow new) perspective at painting.  I would like to ask; why is that?  It seems to me, that somehow brain filters out many informations about images that it knows. When I rotate my image; it is recognized as different (not ""known"").  Any research on described phenomenon? "
1657,Is there any evidence that language is the limit of the world?,"Philosopher Wittgenstein says that ""the limit of my language means the limit of my world"". One theory that supports this statement is that people couldn't see the blue colour until they have the word blue. However, it has been proven to be false in Skeptics: Could people perceive the color blue in ancient times?   So, is there any scientific evidence that prove (or at least agree with) this statement? "
1658,Does suppressing a desire make it more powerful?,"Based on my minimal knowledge of old Freudian Psychoanalysis, if our drives and urges are not met they become more powerful, even overwhelming, for the individual, perhaps causing them psychological difficulties or even causing them to then project the restriction on others. This sentiment has been echoed many times in different contexts since then and it seems to me that the modern generation operates under the assumption that trying too hard to suppress a desire is unhealthy (sexual liberation, free expression etc). It is often used, for example, as a criticism of religion that attempts to impose rules and boundaries which result in the suppression of urges and even further curiosity simply because it is forbidden. I also see many pop psychology articles about this idea.   My question is: what empirical evidence exists to support the notion that repressed desires will make them stronger? Other relevant question that may be of interest: Is it a result of human's natural curiosity? Is it intrinsic to human drive? Is it a form of obsessive-compulsive behavior? What criticism has been leveled against this theory in the Freudian version or any modern interpretations? "
1659,"Does ""hearing"" give off an electronic signal?","I'm thinking in terms of the middle ear and the very intricate and tiny bones that process a ""sound wave"" into ""what we hear."" Is there an output to the middle ear ossicle chain bones such that a signal is being sent from the ears to outside of our body too? If so what is that frequency? "
1660,Importance of interactivity in learning,"Not sure if this is the right place for this question that I find hard to formulate in the first place...  In a paper, I'd like to argue that interactivity helps to develop an understanding of a thing. This is in context is astronomy, scientists learning about the universe basically. I'd like to argue in favour of interactive data exploration. This is not going to be a psychology paper. To put it bluntly, I'd like to better understand this to write the motivational section, use the proper terms, and have a nice citation I can put at the end of it :)  Let me try to explain what I'm after.  Google Maps analogy:  Interative maps give an overview of the world and then allow the user to zoom in, pan around and look at streetview pics. If this information would be presented in a non-interative way, say a box you can put coordinates in and you get the streetview picture out a minute later, the user would not just be slower, but would not be able to explore and understand the world in the same way that interactive maps allow.  Slider analogy:  Say you have two parameters and an result value that results from it due to some hidden math. If I give you two sliders, you can play around with them and develop a sense for the correlation easily, a child would get an intuition for it. But if I give you a form where you have to type in two numbers and press a button to see the result, it be almost impossible to develop the same level of understanding.  I think that the instantaneous feedback and the ability to 'play' with it, really make it far easier for us to learn.  edit:  Has there been some study of this kind of learning? Does it have a name? Where would I start to research this? How do I go about arguing that interactivity offers a great benefit to explore, say, a dataset? That interactivity offers more than just the efficency gained from less waiting for results. "
1661,"Can human brain neural circuits understand the concept of ""other human beings"" and their motives?","I've read that one of the tests of animal intelligence is whether or not the animal recognizes itself in the mirror or can determine that other animals have motives other than it's own (ex: can deceive the animal).  At the same time I've recently heard the following idea from evolutionary psychology - a human female has ""neural circuits"" that can evaluate and signal the willingness of the male partner to commit long term to her and her offspring. It sounded like this process is entirely subconscious and results in a certain feeling which the woman can consciously act upon.   Additionally, it sounded like some of these circuits have evolved independently of each other, thus capable of leading to conflicting feelings when multiple circuits signal simultaneously.  This made me think - are ""neural circuits"" really capable of independently processing information in terms of other human being and his/her possible motives?   OR, do human neural circuits related to social cognition simply operate on concentrations of neuromodulators? In terms of the example above - maybe all these circuits are doing are detecting significant oxytocin spikes, keeping the guard up until these spikes are detected? "
1662,What leaps in technology would be needed to scan the total state of the human brain?,"What technological leaps would be necessary to capture the absolute state of the brain? This would need to include:   a representation of each neuron a representation of each neural connection the chemical balances of the dendral connections between each neuron   And maybe we would also need to capture:   the current synaptic activity of each neuron   I'm not sure if we need that, perhaps if you lose the flow of synapses, you break the mind, or perhaps the state of the neurons will continue to work properly the next time synaptic input is introduced and the mind will ""wake up"".  Either way, that's an incredible amount of detail, especially chemical information, that would have to be captured so we could convert it into a virtual simulation of the functional aspects of each neuron making up that brain.   What are the major technological gaps that we would need to overcome in order to scan the brain with that level of detail? I'm interested in the specific aspects of scanning technology that would have to be invented beyond our current brain scanning technology.  "
1663,"Why is IIT ""unmotivated""?","I'm trying to understand Searle's reply to Tononi and Koch's objections to Searle's characterization of their Intergrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness.

Specifically, what does Searle mean by IIT being ""unmotivated""?  "
1664,What is fiber bundle matching?,"In the introduction of this paper, the authors mention something called ""fiber bundle matching"". I'm having trouble understanding if this is an analysis performed on a single subject's data or across subjects. In other words, do you match fibers within one subject to compute a tractography for that subject or do you match fibers across subjects to come up with an ""average tractography""? If the former, what is one way to go about computing an average tractography? "
1665,Does thinking out loud negatively affect one's ability to think internally?,"I'm a professional programmer, and I also practice math. During both, I constantly talk out loud, even for simple problems. However, when I'm around other people I suppress the talking and I feel like I lose a significant amount of clarity.  My assumption is that speaking out loud provides additional clarity because:   You're actually speaking, so you have to utilize more parts of your brain, including to physically move your mouth, which would decrease distraction/increase focus You're hearing it, again utilizing more parts of your brain since you have to process external auditory signals   Whereas, the auditory simulation (essentially virtual stimulus) that the brain provides during silent thought is... not as intense as the real stimulus (speaking and hearing), thus utilizing less of the brain.  My question is not about whether thinking out loud helps you figure out a problem.   My question is can long-term frequent thinking out loud have negative effects over one's ability to think internally/silently?   And if there are negative long term effects can they be corrected in a short time by shifting your thinking back to a silent process? "
1666,Does a recent general review of recurrent neural networks exist?,"Does anyone know of a comparatively recent paper reviewing the literature on psychological applications of recurrent neural networks? I'm looking for a paper which provides a general overview of the use of this class of models (Elman networks, Hopfield networks, Boltzmann machines, localist attractor networks, etc.) in modelling psychological processes.  More practically, I have a line in a draft paper which currently says ""A full discussion of this class of models is beyond the scope of the current review (see XXXX), but [...]"" and I want to fill in the Xs.  I have Rogers and McClelland's (2004) Semantic Cognition, which is a nice review, but focuses on feed-forward models. Suggestions? "
1667,Would administering oxytocin in games of deception improve performance?,"As well as facilitating parturition, the hormone oxytocin is thought to mediate ""prosocial behaviour"" in mammals. It’s been a while since I have read the literature, but I am aware there is robust evidence that oxytocin mediates social bonding and pair bond formation. Acute administration of oxytocin can also increase social cognition such as facial recognition and trustfulness in games of cooperation between strangers  Games of deception could be an interesting paradigm under which to study the effects of oxytocin. in poker, one's ability to bluff is a core skill. I am always amused by the percentage of pro-poker players i see on late night TV wearing sunglasses-- either photophobia is greatly over-represented in this cohort, or more likely, facial expressions and in particular, the eyes, are important cues for the detection of deception.   This has got me wondering: Would acute administration of intranasal oxytocin have beneficial or deleterious effects upon performance in games of deception such as poker?  Moreover, might one expect differential effects of oxytocin among poker players with Asperger’s syndrome, such as the irreverent Tony G?   On one hand, oxytocin could improve one's ability to recognise facial expressions, particularly eye expressions indicative of deception. Conversely, oxytocin might evoke some sort of ""miscalibration of social meta-cognition"", leading a misplaced sense of trust in the intentions of opponents.  Alternatively, I think that oxytocin's role in social cognition is far more nuanced than how I understand it to be. actually, I have no doubt about that.   For instance, aside from inconsistencies in the literature, the papers I’ve read tend to highlight a ""pro-affiliative"" skew towards oxytocin maintaining cohesion amongst those with whom we're already familiar, the in-group. With regards to the out-group, I have this impression that it's geared towards ""not throwing the first punch.""   Any thoughts on the possible effect of oxytocin upon poker and other games of deception, or more broadly, how to more accurately frame my understanding of the social milieu within which oxytocin functions?

1668,How does the group that is not stressed and not reactivated act as a control for time in Schwabe & Wolf 2010?,"Schwabe and Wolf (2010)      Rodent studies suggest that memory reconsolidating is impaired by stress. Here we examined in healthy humans the effect of stress on the reconsolidation of autobiographical memories. Participants recalled positive, negative and neutral episodes from their recent past and afterward exposed to a stressor (socially evaluated cold pressor test) or a non-arousing control condition. Additional groups of participants were exposed to the stressor without prior memory reactivation or were neither stressed nor asked to recall episodes from their past. Stress after memory reactivation impaired the memory for the neutral episodes 1 week later....   How is the group that is not stressed and not reactivated (control) act as a control for time?  Or rather what does ""control for time"" mean?  The researchers wrote ""To control for the effect of time on memory, we had another control group that was not stressed and did not reactivate experiences from their past.""   I understand that the group makes a good baseline for comparing other results to, but where does time come into it?   References:   Schwabe, L., &amp; Wolf, O. T. (2010).

1669,Does knowledge of tests like Iowa Gambling and Wisconsin Card-Sorting task enable a person to fake the test?,"I am interested in tests like the Iowa gambling test and the Wisconsin card-sorting test. If a patient understands how such a test works and the goals of the test, does this bias the measure obtained? What test-taker can fake via higher cognitive function that might be intact, and what will be impossible to fake?  I imagine that the speed of taking a test might be a limiting factor. So  if the rate of card picking is high, a patient may perform in a default way and be unable to apply higher cognitive control. Or if the patient tries to beat the test using knowledge about it, this will be evident in that the patient will take more time. "
1670,How is the type of memory that is passed through generations called?,"It has a name. I thought it was called 'collective' memory. .. But I cant find any articles or information about it.. So I guess it has a different name.   There were a few cases where children were successful in recalling the memories of their past ancestors.  How is that type of memory called? and are there articles about it?  UPDATE  For the skeptics, watch the few first minutes of this doc..(or all of it)  [website]I did learn in my first psychology lessons about that memory. I cant remember wellthe case study that I studied.. but it involved a non-speaking German woman who after being hypnotized was able to talk German and recall her past life. "
1671,"Which personality traits cause ""non-cruelty""?","Human behavior towards other living beings can be classified into three categories:   altruistic: actively caring for the well-being of others cruel: deliberately inflicting pain and suffering neutral: not affecting the life and well-being of others   You cannot always care for the well-being of everyone around you. Therefore active altruism cannot be a general guiding principle of behavior. But you can always chose not to be actively cruel. Lacking a better name, I will call this type of behavior, which includes both altruistic and neutral behavor, ""non-cruel"", as suggested by Nick Stauner.  What I would like to know is if there are predictors that differentiate between habitually cruel persons and those that are usually either actively altruistic or at least show a passive lack of deliberate cruelty and knowing acquiescence of suffering?  Which personality traits are responsible for habitually non-cruel behavior?    Notes:  I am interested in traits in the traditional sense (patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion) as well as neural correlates of non-cruelty. "
1672,"Why does society interpret ""manliness"" differently?","If, by definition, manliness is ""the traditional male quality of being brave and strong,"" why does most of society perceive it differently? For example, a person who watches My Little Pony and is not afraid to admit it, thus being brave. However, society would think of this person as not manly because he is watching a show meant for little girls. Do our minds perceive being manliness based on what other people think of as manly? Is this why society thinks of manliness differently than what it really is? And, if so, why do we base our opinions on those of others? Also, is manliness what it is defined as or what we have made it to be through society? "

On the other hand, another mind can't even understand this theory, let alone ""create"" or come up with one.  Where does this initial intelligence and intuition (accurately proven) come from? Or what are the means by which modern humans achieve ""origins of"" intelligent intuition that adhere to science or nature? (Not talking about prophecy.)             "
1674,Does procrastination imply knowledge of what is being delayed?,"When someone says he is procrastinating, does that imply that he knows which exact action is better than the action that he is currently doing?   Is it called procrastination when you know that your current course of action is not optimal, but you don't know exactly what course of action would be better than your current course of action?  "
1675,"What causes a person to be curious, inquisitive and explorative?","Why do humans (primates) tend to be curious, inquisitive and explorative?  They want to know things that they do not. They explore stuff in an attempt to find something new which makes them adventurous and willing to accept challenges. They tend to be curious about what others are doing and going through, making them inquisitive.  What's the cause of this human (primate) behavior? "
1676,How far can we train mental calculation?,"   Mental calculators are people with a prodigious ability in some area of mental calculation, such as multiplying large numbers or factoring large numbers.   Unfortunately I forgot where I heard it, but I remember that it was said that they use parts of the brain that are responsible of motion. So factoring for them is like hitting the light switch or walking.  Assuming that this is correct, isn't it possible to train this ability by performing arithmetics while walking?  From a computer scientist's view, I think this is comparable to the use of the graphic card's CPU to speed up computation. Mental calculators just have the right software to run their GPU. Or do they have a different hardware, and is there no way for the rest of us to achieve this? "
1677,What's the percentage of people that are mental calculator prodigies?,I want to reply to this comment:  What's the percentage of people that are mental calculator prodigies? How do they spread over the different parts of the world? 
1678,How many calories do we burn when we try to understand mathematical proofs?,"While thinking we burn calories. For comparison: ""And if it’s the right wood and the right chess grand masters in the middle of a tournament, they are going through 6,000 to 7,000 calories a day thinking"" from here...  How many calories do we burn when we try to understand mathematical proofs? How does it depend on the representation of the proof? For example, there are plenty of proofs for the Pythagorean theorem, even some without words... "
1679,"Are representations of unattended objects ""bound""?","In our phenomenal experience, different features of an object, like shape and color, seem to be ""bound"" together into a single percept, even though those features are represented in different parts of the brain. Explaining this phenomenon is known as the ""binding problem.""   If I look at a red apple, the internal representations of its red-ness and its apple shape are bound together. But what if I am not looking at the red apple -- what if my visual attention is not on the red apple? In that case, are the object's ""redness"" and ""appleness"" still bound together? Or does binding require attentional focus? Does it require consciousness?  "
1680,Is the price of higher intelligence and more complex behaviours more mental illness?,"   ""Our work shows that the price of higher intelligence and more complex   behaviours is more mental illness.""     -Professor Seth Grant Professor of Molecular Neuroscience, University of Edinburgh  Is this finding from this professor's work agreed upon in the scientific community?  Are there more dynamics, contexts or other aspects to this conclusion...or is this just a 1-to-1 correlation?  Any other evidence about these types of studies published, and what are their conclusions?  Thank You.  [website]"
1681,Fear of things that look like or resemble humans,"I remember reading this a while back. To be clear, I'm not talking about a phobia such as Automatonophobia (Fear of inanimate objects that resemble humans, such as dolls) or Pediophobia (Fear of dolls).  Instead, what I read about seems to be something we are all programmed to feel. What I read was that people naturally fear things that look human, but at the same time, are not quite human. A good example I once read about is a game called LSD. Now if you guys Google this and take a look at the screenshots, the game doesn't look scary at all does it? How could it when it has such out dated and hilarious graphics. If you tried to play the game however, you'll soon find yourself becoming jumpy at every little thing in the game which sooner or later, you will start to see as really creepy.  I read that this seems to be a reason why some people find old horror games with old graphics much more frightening than newer games where character models look much more realistic and humanoid. This might also be unrelated, however looking at the horror genre overall, aren't we mainly scared of things that look human? Jason and Freddy are pretty deformed, however in essence human's in shape. Vampires look exactly like humans, but with paler skin and fangs. Zombies look just like humans, albeit with rotting flesh. etc  Is there a scientific name and reasoning behind all this? I mean if you think about it, the further you create something away from a humans shape, the less frightening it becomes (a blob monster for example). Slap on a pair of red eyes on a human however or fangs, and he instantly becomes pretty scary. "
1682,Is handwriting style heritable?,"My daughter (11), wife, and mother in-law all have extremely similar handwriting.  Why is this? Is handwriting a inheritable trait? "
1683,Mulitiple partners: macho man vs. easy woman?,"I sometimes hear from my friends that a man who has many female sexual partners is regarded as macho. But on the other hand, a woman with a lot of one-night stands is thought to be easy and desperate (without even mentioning harsher words).  So what's the reason for this? What are the psychological roots? I would say two most important factors are biological and social but how do they affect our opinions on this matter? "
1684,Is this some sort of soft-coded Grapheme-Color synethesia?,"I just found this remarkable optical illusion:    To do: Fixate your gaze on the center of one of the figures and stare at it for some time (20-30 seconds) while it cycles (without moving your eyes). After several iterations you’ll start noticing that the empty outlines fill in with ghostly redish or bluish colors! These illusory colors are called “afterimages”. Interestingly, the colors of the afterimages vary, which is puzzling because they come from the same original figure. Moreover, the shape of the outlines determines the filled-in color, which is complementary to the color of the same shape in the original figure.  My question:  Is this some sort of soft-coded Grapheme-Color synethesia?  Do people with Grapheme-Color synethesia have hard-coded afterimages in their brains? "
1685,What benefit is responsible for human preference of one food over another?,"I like kiwi. I don't like omelettes. I love berry pies, but I'm not a big fan of potato chips or pretzels.  Human taste preference is seemingly universal, with even young children able to identify foods that they like and dislike, and react appropriately, hungrily seeking the former and rejecting the latter.  But what evolutionary purpose does this serve? Is my dislike of potato chips and pretzels a sign that my body is somehow predisposed to excess sodium, and this distate for the food a compensation mechanism? Is my love of kiwi an indicator of some deficit, perhaps of vitamins C and K, or my more general preference for sour flavors (which tend to indicate acidity) a part of pH regulation?  At its heart, does biological need or deficiency for particular components of a food explain personal preference for that foodstuff, and if not, is there research showing what does? "
1686,How many moving objects can a person count (on average)?,"I wonder if experiments in perceptual or cognitive psychology have been performed following these considerations:  Standard experiment: Present small numbers of simple items to a test subject, for the sake of specifity and simplicity as equal dots distributed inside a box:     I guess experiments testing which number of dots test subjects are able to tell without consciously counting have been performed, and that the mean number is something like [tex] (the ""magic number""). (The maximal number any test person was able to tell without consciously counting would be very interesting, too.)  I also guess that the magic number depends on the degree of evenness of the distribution of the dots (per test subject and on average).  But the magic number will depend also on the speeds of the dots. (The cases above assumed resting dots.) Two cases are to be distinguished:   Not the dots, but their entirety rotates (around the center of the containing box) with angular velocity [tex]. Each dot moves independently and behaves like a billiard ball reflected at the borders of the box   with collision among dots  without collision among dots, in this case    all with the same speed [tex] with slightly different speeds  with very different speeds      All these cases give experimental setups and one might try to determine ""magic numbers"" depending e.g. on [tex] (in case 1) or [tex] (in case 2.2.1).  This is case 2.1:    But what interests me even more is the question up to which number people can actually count (not see at a glance) when asked to tell the number of some moving dots. This number will be greater than the magic numbers above - but how great? Check it out:     Can anyone give a link to results related to the experimental setups I tried to describe? (Please forgive me, I'm not a learned psychologist or cognitive scientist, so my talk about experiments and so on may sound amateurish.) "
1687,What kind of psychologists study 'genius'?,"Which sub-field of psychology deals with differences in human intelligence? As in, what makes someone an intellectual genius? Or, maybe a bit more humbly, why are some people more intelligent than others? It would help if you could also mention some leading thinkers in this field (or any good resources to read more about these topics)  Thanks! "
1688,Do neurons involved in reflex movements process information or they just transmit a signal?,"According to Reflex     A reflex, or reflex action, is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus. A reflex is made possible by neural pathways called reflex arcs which can act on an impulse before that impulse reaches the brain.   Is the magnitude, direction, etc. of this response evaluated somewhere in some type of neurons? Is there information processing in relation to, for this type of stimulus magnitude, it's evaluated which magnitude of response should be triggered by a neuron, or does the stimulus simple activate a neural pathway which activates a fixed response and the difference in the response is the result of how many neural pathways the stimulus activate?  To make an analogy, does reflexs work like turning several light switches for more or less light, or like inputing data into a program for different kind of responses? "
1689,What could explain the apparent association between high IAT bias scores and percentage of black americans per state?,"The implicit Association test (IAT) measures your subconcious preference for white over black or the other way around. It does so by letting you do a task where you have to categorize black and white faces as quickly as possible. At the same time you have to categorize words that have a positive valence or have a negative valence. The test measures your bias by looking at the differences in reactionspeed when sorting words and faces to the left or right side of the screen. If you are faster when black faces are coupled with bad words and/or when white faces are coupled with positive words then you have a negative bias towards black people or a positive bias towards white people. To see if you have any bias you can take the test yourself here:   According to the washington post almost all white americans have a slight to strong negative bias to black people. [website]A score of under 0.35 means you have a slight preference for whites over blacks, a score between 0.35 and 0.65 a moderate preference and over 0.65 a strong preference according to the article.   [website]   You can see that the states with the strongest bias are located in the southeast of America, but the scientists behind the project implicit website are not sure what is causing this effect. This made me wonder so i googled 'percentage of blacks per state' and this is the most relevant link:  [website]Look at the map of America, darkest blue means 35 to 40% identify themselves as African american while whitest blue means less then 2% does.     It appears that higher bias scores coincide with higher african american populations. In the north west where very few black americans live the bias score s among the lowest, whereas in the south east where black americans live the most the scores are very high.  What could be causing this? Personally i think it may have something to do with blacks being poorer on average then whites thus exposing them to more risk factors (dropping out of school, abusive parents etc) which along with poverty puts them at a greater risk of becoming a criminal then whites. Wanted criminals are occasionally featured on TV when the police asks the public for help. In areas with a high percentage of black criminals can thus be seen more often on TV. If white people keep getting exposed to the black face/criminal story combination on TV, then they eventually start to subconciously associate black people with criminal activity or some other negative Association. In the north west there are hardly any black people living so the chances of the white public seeing a criminal featured on local TV that happens to be black is very low. Thus people won't get 'trained' by local TV to associate dark skin color with criminals. But this is just my own theory. I just wanted to share what i found with you guys and i would love to get some answers on my question.  Thank you   "
1690,Can the brain be enhanced by adding more neurons?,"I was wondering of ways to enhance the brain. Couldn't we add a sort of substance to improve the brain? Will it somehow adapt? The brain should 'wire up' the new substance to the existing one.   As far as I know, the brain is just neural connections, so why just not add more connections? I mean, why not add more neurons, therefore enhancing the human mind, getting closer to answering questions like ""Does God exist?"".  Maybe modifying DNA to produce more neurons, making the brain bigger...? In my opinion the future lies in enhancing the mind, what ways are there to do that?  P.S - I'm only 16 y/o. "
1691,Bottom up thinking - what is it?,"Mlodinow has book Elastic thinking, which sounds interesting and where he mentions bottom up processes/thinking; which he equates with elastic thinking.  I have watched numerous videos about it, and even read some sample chapters of the book - but to my surprise, it is still unclear to me what exactly he means by bottom up thinking?  One unclear quote from the book is:     Elastic thought is where your new ideas come from. Imaginative, original, and non-linear, it is “bottom-up” thinking, in which insights percolate into the mind, seemingly from nowhere.   Another unclear quote:     Elastic thinking is about stretching your mind and using ‘bottom up’ processing in the brain rather than the top down executive functions that drive analytical thinking   Can someone please bring some simple and concrete examples from daily life, of what is bottom up thinking?  ps. His book is based on research and says it is known term in science community, this elastic thinking/bottom up thinking, and hence my hope people here may know what is it. "
1692,"What does ""The brain has its own language for testing the structure and consistency of the world."" refer to?","The late Dr. Carl Sagan is famous for many different contributions to both scientific research and science education.  One memorable line is discussed in Are we really star-stuff from the interior of collapsing stars?  In the video Carl Sagan - 'A Glorious Dawn' ft Stephen Hawking (Symphony of Science) at about 01:30 Dr. Sagan can be heard to say:     “But the brain does much more than just recollect it inter-compares, it synthesizes, it analyzes, it generates abstractions. The simplest thought like the concept of the number one has an elaborate logical underpinning. The brain has its own language for testing the structure and consistency of the world.”   This quote can also be found in goodreads and in the script of Season 1, Episode 11 of the TV show Cosmos circa 1980.  What might Dr. Sagan be referring to in the sentence ""The brain has its own language for testing the structure and consistency of the world.""?  Question: Is this hypothetical ""language"" a way that information is exchanged between different parts of the brain? Is this concept part of some well known theory of brain function at the time? How is this viewed now, nearly forty years later?    A longer quote (from the episode) for context:     The brain is a very big place in a very small space. Most of the books in the brain are up here in the cerebral cortex. Down there, in the basement of the brain are the functions that our ancestors mainly depended on for survival: Aggression, child rearing, sex the willingness to follow leaders blindly. Lots of things that we can still recognize in our lives today.      Of the higher brain functions some of them, like reading, writing, speaking seem to be located in particular places in the cerebral cortex.      On the other hand, each memory seems to be stored in many separate locales in the brain. Old memories are in lots of places. Here is one of my earliest memories.           (POURS LIQUID) MOTHER: That's a good boy.     Lunch is almost ready.     (CLICKS ON RADIO) (MUSIC PLAYS)          That was a long time ago. But its imprint has not faded in the library of this brain. But the brain does much more than just recollect. It inter-compares. It synthesizes. It analyzes. It generates abstractions. The simplest thought, like the concept of the number one has an elaborate, logical underpinning.      The brain has its own language for testing the world's structure and consistency. But we never see the machinery of logical analysis only the conclusions. There is so much more that we must figure out than the genes can know. That's why the brain library has 10,000 times more information in it than the gene library. Our passion for learning is the tool for our survival. And unlike the musty bindings of our gene library in which hardly a word changes in a century the brain library is made of loose-leaf books.      We're constantly adding new pages and new volumes. Emotions and ritual behavior patterns are built very deeply into us. They're part of our humanity. But they're not characteristically human.       Many other animals have feelings. What distinguishes our species is thought. The cerebral cortex is, in a way, a liberation. We need no longer be trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of lizards and baboons: Territoriality and aggression and dominance hierarchies. We are, each of us largely responsible for what gets put into our brains for what, as adults, we wind up caring for and knowing about.      No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain we can change ourselves.      Think of the possibilities.  "
1693,Stress vs. Testing,"I was reading somewhere and found that there are various levels of stress depending on time. It said that when under stress for 30 mins, memory is not as efficient. So I have two questions here. A- Is this true and by how much is it lowered? B- Would a better form of testing have a test split into 30 min parts so that it is most fair?  Source: [website]I would suggest reading Electrophysiology/neuronal activity on page 7 and looking at page 30. "
1694,Do women naturally form groups to defend themselves?,"What I'm describing is also further explained in this post, written by and for women apparently.  Can this behaviour be attributed to the whole gender? Is it a social construct or the outcome of biological differences? And can we generalise about men's behaviour towards criticism?  update:   this article is a great starting point  David P Schmitt:     A d value of +0.50 is considered ""moderate"" and indicates that 69 percent of men are higher than the average woman on a particular attribute. Sex differences in spatial rotation skills, certain mathematics abilities (3-dimensional geometry and calculus), and task-oriented leadership (focusing on accomplishing a group goal rather than maintaining harmony within the group) reside within this size range.    Due to the anthropological nature of this question, I also asked a related question in Biology. "
1695,Is there an upper limit to the number of channels in an EEG system that would provide additional useful data points?,"A quick scan of search results seems to indicate that the highest density EEG systems on the market are limited to 256 channels such as Neuvo, SynAmps, and others. Is this an arbitrary limit (either due to system design or practicality of sensor placement) or is it perhaps a case of diminishing returns with any decreased sensor spacing not providing much in the way of additional information in the data points?  If not 256 channels then what would be an upper limit? Am I correct in assuming that the summation of electrical activity that is expressed at the scalp would be spatially quantized due the raised gyri on the brain surface (with any activity in the intervening sulci being masked)? Then again if that were the case would there still be benefit in having the extra spatial resolution running atop the contours of the gyri?  I'm wondering if a system consisting of a full mesh of electrodes would have merit as a project? [this would be for those such as myself that due to either nature or grooming don't have to work around any hair on there scalp] "
1696,Is passive-aggressive behavior conscious or unconscious?,It is my experience that people who show passive aggressive behavior do not realize it or at least do not admit it.   Which leads me to the question whether passive-aggressive behavior can be controlled? Or is passive-aggressive behavior a symptome of something else and therefore somewhat unconscious? 
1697,Where can I find the text of past DSM versions to visualize revision history?,"I'm interested in building a data visualization to learn more about the history of the DSM. (I'm inspired by this visualization of the edit history of Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" by Ben Fry, as well as these journal articles about DSM history.)   Not being a psychologist or med student myself, is it a non-starter to try and obtain past texts in electronic form (i.e. as data)? Does anyone have suggestions of where to start looking/asking?  Thanks. "
1698,Visualizing words upon hearing or thinking them," In any culture with literacy rate near 100%, is it known what proportion of the population visualise words written in front of them every time they hear words being spoken (i.e. are unable to hear words without visualizing them)? What proportion of the population visualise words every time they 'hear' words in inner speech?   I also am interested in how the proportion of 'word visualisers' varies across special subpopulations. For example, is word visualizing more common in grapheme-colour synesthetes? Or less common in dyslexics? "
1699,How quick a flash of light is invisible,"I know this overlaps a lot of previously asked questions but:  I understand that 'A photon hits a photosensitive molecule in a photoreceptor in the retina, which causes a chemical change. [...] Vision is slow: the cascade in response to a single photon takes on the order of 100s of milliseconds.' (for a persistent perceptual experience, why is video able to have a lower frame rate than audio?)  1) What is the longest amount of time a bright light can shine without it being visible to the human eye? (assume it goes from dark to bright to dark)  2) Would it make a difference if, at other times before and after the bright light, the light was on but dim?  My guess:  It would depend on the brightness of the light, and that even then it's almost impossible, as it would be to do with the number of photons hitting receptors, rather than how brief a period it happened. (I tried flashing a screen for 1/60th of a second and I could still see it).  I would also guess that the opposite - how long would a period of darkness or dim light have to last in between bright light in order for the brain to not register the darkness - would be much less time, certainly no more than 1/60th of a second. (I tried a 120Hz '3d' screen with glasses producing a 60Hz image). "
1700,What's the difference between the neuroendocrine system vs endocrine system?,"No one in the Biology site seems to be answering this, so I thought I'd post it here as a last resort. I would really appreciate if you guys can take a look at it.  This is what I have understood so far:  Neuroendocrine system involves neuroendocrine cells (also known as neurosecretory cells) that receive nerve impulses by a sensory neuron to release neurohormones into the blood stream. Meanwhile, the endocrine system endocrine cells that release your 'classic' hormones into the blood stream when a receptor protein senses a stimulus.  Here are my questions. You don't have to answer them in order, you can just provide an summary explanation:   When it comes to the brain, are the neurosecretory cells located in the hypothalamus or the posterior pituitary gland or both? Is the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary gland classified as     neuroendocrine glands and is the anterior pituitary classified as an     endocrine gland? If the posterior pituitary gland is indeed a neuroendocrine gland,     is ADH and Oxytocin, which are both released by the posterior     pituitary gland, classified as ""neurohormones"", not just the classic     hormones?  "
1701,Which are the arguments for asserting mental life/consciouness happen only in the cerebral cortex?,"I've read many articles / researchs and they are hard to follow. Several times concepts are hard to understand, it would seem certain concepts such as ""cognition"" are fuzzy terms and they become part of fuzzy explanations.   For example, if I understood correctly, it's asserted that ""mental life"" and ""consciouness"" happen in the cerebral cortex. The argument for it, it would seem to be different experiments show the region which activates when someone (awake I suppose) it's making a ""consciouss"" movement it's the cerebral cortex.  Then, when a patient is in coma and makes a movement, it isnt a ""consciouss"" movement because the cerebral cortex in him isnt working. Isnt this a circular argument? Couldnt someone conclude just the opposite, conclude that movement was conscious and that's evidence not all the mental life/ consciouness happen in the cerebral cortex?   Also, according to some definitions of ""cognitive functions"",      It encompasses many aspects of intellectual functions and processes   such as attention, the formation of knowledge, memory and working   memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and ""computation"", problem   solving and decision making, comprehension and production of language.   Cognition     Cognitive functions are those mental processes that lead to the   acquisition of knowledge and allow us to carry out our daily tasks.   They allow the subject to have an active role in the processes of   receiving, choosing, transforming, storing, processing and retrieval   of information, allowing the subject to navigate the world around him.   ..     Auditory gnosis: ability to recognize and differentiate between   various sounds.   Cognitive functions  And then you have researchs like this one,     Seeing speech affects acoustic information processing in the human   brainstem      Afferent auditory processing in the human brainstem is generally   assumed to be determined by acoustic stimulus features and immune to   stimulation by other senses or cognitive factors.   Seeing speech affects acoustic information processing in the human brainstem  Isnt this research showing there is ""information processing"" in the brain stem, which would qualify as a ""cognitive function"", which it would be a ""mental process""? Isnt this research saying there are mental processes ""mental life"" outside of the cerebral cortex?  Then my question is, which are the arguments for asserting mental life/consciouness happen only in the cerebral cortex? "
1702,Is 'your mom will be sad' actually a good argument to pose to someone thinking of committing suicide?,"I often come across people pointing out that the close relatives of someone who is thinking about committing suicide will grieve, as an argument against doing it.  However, I've noticed that it is often these precise close relatives that have a lot to do with someone experiencing stress, anxiety and all the related consequences (in trying to meet their expectations; assuming their fears, etc). So, although accepting such an argument as a valid reson against committing suicide at present, couldn't it actually make it worse for them in trying to cope with the underlying problems in the long run?   I'm aware that each case is different and I'm just sharing my thoughts as a layman, but I'd like to know what a professional would make out of this? "
1703,Does the Rubik's Cube increase mental ability?,Does becoming efficient in the cube help build your brain to be able to do other tasks better? What tasks and how? 
1704,Does mindfulness meditation work for highly inattentive individuals?,"Mindfulness practice requires extensive concentration for a prolonged period of time (e.g., attending to breath/body sensation for above 5 minutes).  It is reasonable to assume that it might be challenging for people who are highly inattentive. However, mindfulness has been used as a health intervention for individuals with ADHD (with inattention as a symptom).  One recent review with 9 studies (Lee et al., 2017) found that mindfulness is effective for adults with ADHD, yet it is     unclear whether mindfulness-based intervention is effective for children and adolescence with ADHD due to limited studies available and the limitations of the study design in the reviewed studies.   What are the recent mindfulness studies involving children with ADHD? And is there any research on people with inattention only?  References  Lee, C. S., Ma, M. T., Ho, H. Y., Tsang, K. K., Zheng, Y.

1705,Homoparental Adoption Studies,"Such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which involves a relative large group of professional for concluding about Transgender protocols and studies, and somehow unrelated but such as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, is there some neutral organization involving Systematic Reviews of studies concluding about the effects -rather positive and|or negative- about Homoparental Adoption?  The most comprehensive reference I have found is a paper from Schofield 2016 which summarizes 81 studies. But this paper is still a single person document, which perfectly could be subject to an author bias.   Thanks in advance. "
1706,Assessments of depression: Does the rate of false positives vary between the qualification of those testing?,"A friend recently asked me an interesting question to which I couldn't find the answer. Does the accuracy of depression assessments vary by the profession i.e. Nurse, GP Vs Clinical Psychologist, Psychiatrist etc, of those conducting the assessment? What is the difference in false positives or misdiagnosis between these professions.   I am aware the forms used are mostly the same but does the diagnosis accuracy vary?   "
1707,Are there any methodological challenges to study real-time social interactions?,"  If the emotion of fear (for example) has evolved so that humans can react in an adapted way to danger, why would we be afraid in a laboratory setting, and would this fear be similar to that we experience when confronted with real danger?   Moreover they state that make-believe emotions are qualitatively different from real emotions  Thus, how can we be in contact (in laboratory settings) with real emotions?

1708,"What, if any, objective tests were designed for the assessment of altruism?","In an article by Santacreu et al. (2006) there is a mention of altruism assessment within the framework of the Character Education Inquiry (CEI):     If we return to the first half of the last century, we can find   important precedents of objective assessment of Personality that were   embodied in solid and coherent research programs carried out by   important authors in this field. Amongst these, works by Hartshorne   and May (1928, Hartshorne, May &amp; Maller, 1929, Hartshorne, May &amp;   Shuttleworth 1930) must be mentioned. These authors developed a set of   tests included in their Character Education Inquiry (CEI) oriented,   amongst other things, to measure honesty or altruism.   At the present moment I do not have access to the report of the CEI to verify how Hugh Hartshorne and his colleagues were assessing ""honesty or altruism"". However, Robert W. Friedrichs (1960) cites the report of the CEI (along with a couple of other investigations) and claims that these studies did not have as their objective the assessment of altruism. These, so he implies, are the only studies undertaken in the field of psychology which may attract attention of those interested in the study of altruism. I tried to find attempts at objective assessment of altruism in the work published since 1960, but without success. So I'm here looking for assistance.  I admit that I may use the term 'objective test' incorrectly. In order to exclude any misunderstanding I would like to add that I conceive of objective test designed to assess altruism as simulated conditions in which an individual (or a group of them) is put at a moral choice being unable to uncover the simulated nature of the proceedings or to identify the qualities under scrutiny. I will be very grateful to all who help me to find reports of applications of such methods to the assessment of altruism.   Santacreu, J., Rubio, V. J., &amp; Hernández, J. M. (2006).

1709,Does Machiavellianism concept attempt to combine different personalty types?,"Wikipedia states that:     Machiavellianism has been found to be negatively correlated with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness   Next, agreeableness article has following words:     The lower-level traits, or facets, grouped under agreeableness are: trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, and tender-mindedness.   And article on Machiavellianism in some way is contradictory:     It was found that in a trust game, those with high MACH-IV scores tended to follow homo economicus' equilibrium strategies while those with low MACH-IV scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium   In simple words that means that high machs are closer to optimal strategy in trust games than low machs. If they are mistrustful, why are they better in trust games?  That's not the only contradiction. Let's look at conscientiousness article:     People who score low on conscientiousness tend to be laid back, less goal-oriented, and less driven by success   And now again Machiavellianism article:     High Machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated achievement and winning at any cost.   But enough Wikipedia, there is more ambiguousity in this research article (that references a bunch of other articles):     There are at least two main paradigms of partner selection and both can be evidenced with previous research to be relevant to the partner selection of Machiavellians. On the one hand, similarity in level of affiliation, intimacy needs and personality traits has particular importance in ideal standards and mate choice. Previous studies provided countless evidence supporting the similarity hypothesis      ...      Accordingly, it is also possible that a dominant high-Mach who demands attention can form the most stable – though dysfunctional and asymmetric – relationship with a submissive and permissive low-Mach partner who he or she can manipulate and exploit   Again ambiguousity. The only explanation I can propose is that there is no such thing as Machiavellianism. There are [at least] two types of personality which Machiavellianism tries to describe. Is there any concept that tried to resolve these issues? Obviuosly, Mach-IV can't separate these two types of personalities. So, are there any tests that can do it?  P.S. I expect that those ""machiavellianists"" who are good in trust games usually tend to choose similar [to themselves] partners for relationships and possibly, they are more goal-oriented (and should they really be a part of dark triad?). Also I won't be surprised if these two types of ""machiavellianists"" will differ greatly in emotional intelligence and mind theory. "
1710,How to prime gammatone filters?,"A set of gammatone band-pass filters are often used to model the filtering performed by the human inner ear. For example, ""BatSLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Using Biomimetic Sonar"" Jan Steckel and Herbert Peremans, as well as ""Biologically inspired methods in speech recognition and synthesis: closing the loop"" by Trevor Bekolay both use them. However, like all filters, if you start the input signal with silence, the gammatone filter responds differently than if you started the input signal with some sort of noise. Similarly, mammals are very rarely submerged in absolute silence. The environment and internal organs generate what I would imagine to be some sort of low frequency noise. Maybe it's a low-pass filtered white-noise?  If you are trying to use gammatone filter in a model, what do you prepend the start of your signal with? In other words, how are gammatone filters typically ""primed""? "
1711,"(Ekmans' Atlas of Emotions) What meaning (if any) can be deduced from the geometry of the ""mountain"" depicting a given emotion?","I have recently discovered that the Atlas of Emotions may be a useful tool in a research project I am working on. While lovely to look at, the Atlas seems to lack any description of the data encoded by the shapes of the ""mountains"" on each emotional continent. By looking, for example, at the enjoyment page, one can see that the width of an emotion's mountain corresponds to the intensity interval of that emotion. But what do other features of, say, the amusement mountain encode? I am interested in a general answer to that question but also in the following specifics:   (Peaks) Each mountain has a peak. How is the horizontal position of the peak inside of the emotion's interval determined? How is the peak's height determined? (Symmetry) Some mountains exhibit left-right symmetry, while others do not. Are the mountains designed to maximize such symmetry under the constraint that each peak be visible? Or does this symmetry (when present) encode something about the emotion? (Volume) Does the overall volume of a particular mountain encode useful data?   I have sent an information request directly to Paul Ekman but thought some of you fine folks might have some insight. "
1712,Understanding Precision Psychiatry,"I can't seem to correctly understand what exactly is precision psychiatry? I can't find good sources on the internet about it, other than ""The new field of ‘precision psychiatry’"" by Fernandes et al. (2017), maybe because this is a new field. Is this different from precision medicine? If so, how? How does it relate to the definition  of the word precision (Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other)?  Specifically, I can't understand how to apply precision psychiatry in order to diagnose or predict a mental disorder, for eg. PTSD. Do I have to decide and make a checklist of parameters of the subject by which I can decide if that person has that disease, and how will someone go on about diagnosing the disorder after that. Can you explain it with respect to an example like PTSD or some other disorder?   Fernandes, B. S., Williams, L. M., Steiner, J., Leboyer, M., Carvalho, A. F., &amp; Berk, M. (2017).

1713,Who first filmed and researched unconscious synchronized movement?,"I think it was in my high school sociology class, around 1980, that I learned of an anthropologist who spent three months analysing a 90 second film of a mother, father and child in a kitchen, conducting their every day affairs. And the anthropologist, playing the film in slow motion, ultimately realized that the family was dancing, unknowingly, in a coordinated way. When one person's hand reached for the cupboard, another's head might tilt just slightly. Their bodies were incessantly, unconsciously, gracefully responding to each other.  Please, can anybody provide a reference for this research? Do you know of any similar research? What would be key terms for me to search on? I haven't been able to find anything.  I observe this type of coordination in every day life, especially as an artist. From my limited experience with autistic people, I imagine that this is precisely the faculty that they lack, as if they were totally blind or partially blind, depending on where they are in the spectrum. Autistic people have to compensate, if they can at all, by consciously learning what other people are doing unconsciously. I am currently studying the origin of language and this faculty may well ground Tomasello's notion of joint intentionality. When I look at photos and videos of other great apes, they don't seem to position themselves in the way humans do, and perhaps they simply position themselves with regard to particular individuals. And this faculty is, I think, highly relevant to perceiving the sense of wholeness which architect Christopher Alexander investigates. "
1714,Advancement to Likert Scale,"Likert Scale has been widely in use for more than 80 years (it was published in 1932). However, the limitations of it are well-known:   The space between each choice is possibly not equidistant.  People keep endorsing the mid-point of the scale and avoid choosing the “extremes"" options on the scale, even if an extreme choice would be the most accurate. Attitudes of the population for one particular item in reality exist on a vast, multi-dimensional continuum. However, the Likert Scale is uni-dimensional and only gives 5-7 options of choice Peoples’ answers will be influenced by previous questions   What is the latest development in Psychometrics? Is there any budding and promising replacement or advancement for Likert Scale? "
1715,Is there any evidence that environmental enrichment enchances executive functioning in humans?,"By environmental enrichment, I mean a cognitively, socially and environmentally stimulating environment.  Most of the studies I discovered were tested on animals, in which the answer is a resounding yes.  But is there anything that suggests this enhances executive functioning in humans?  To clarify, there is probably evidence that a deprived environment, such as isolation and poorly constructed childhood homes (Romanian orphanages comes to mind), aren't particularly good for executive functioning.  I'm more looking for evidence that enriched environments improves cognition.  For example, would traveling overseas, or learning a new skill, increase brainpower?   "
1716,Name for problems with a short-term pay off but small long term cost?,"Is there a name for the types of human behavioural problems where making a particular choice isn't a problem, but making the same choice over and over again leads to a bad outcome? Where there is an immediate short-term pay-off for making the choice one way, but a small long-term cost to doing it?  Some examples of these types of problems are:    weight gain   personal debt litter   I think it's a really interesting type of problem because you have to override the short term motivation many, many times to get the long term pay off. "
1717,Why our brain can't fool itself to constantly produce dopamine?,"There are experiments [1] showing that our brain tries to maximize amount of dopamine. At the same time it is the brain who controls the dopamine level, because the reward system is located in the brain and if we'll stimulate specific brain areas, our body will produce dopamine.  My question is: why can't our brain learn to constantly stimulate this ""reward system"" area? Why it learns such complex things like doing math, playing chess, helping other people, etc., which in the far end increase dopamine level (by feeling ""evrika"" moment, winning a competition, seeing other people grateful) when it can just fool its reward system and manually send electrical signals into it? It is a much more easier and    lucrative task.  P.S. I am not a biologist at all and will be very thankful if you formulate your answers easier than wikipedia articles which are a big struggle for me to comprehend.  P.P.S. I'd like to conduct some research in machine learning (neural networks, to be precise) and was thinking about how our brain prevents such devastating overfitting because underlying concepts can be very useful.

1718,Homosexuality independent researches,"There are problems in contemporary science, that some researches are influenced by researchers opinion.  (One problem is, that Even in the physics, there is very known problem, that prejudice affects the result of an experiment!  Another problem: it was discussed e.g. in conjunction with economic science, which is in the USA/World scale under reign of only one body of economic opinion and leaving other economic streams being suppressed. It is believed, that this was one of the cause of the world financial crises of 2008.  Still another problem is big pressure to meet political correctness...)  About homosexuality, absolute majority of opinions are polarized..  So please, do you know any researche(s) of homosexuality, what are well balanced or realy independent?  Especially, I would like to learn, what types of homosexuality are there (is some type of homosexuality changeable? some type, what is possible to ""heal""? how about combination with heterosexuality? exists some known causes for homosexuality? gene? how about those, who claim, that were ""healed from homosexuality?)  If there are more types of homosexuality, what is their prevalence?  Thank you. "
1719,How does Cannabis cause psychosis?,"Whenever I research cannabis induced psychosis, I mostly get two types of results:  1) Cannabis causes psychosis directly and a bunch of other issues (mostly misleading propaganda)  2) There is no evidence that cannabis actually causes psychosis directly, rather it seems to be a correlation issue. (also misleading propaganda)  However, my two best friends experienced permanent psychosis immediately after a heavy cannabis use episode (on separate occasions).  I am convinced that cannabis is perfectly capable of causing or ""unlocking"" psychosis. I don't think that there is any question to this.  But how does it actually work?  In one of the cases, my friend had some very strong cannabis to smoke, after which he started to hear voices, and this never ended, even months after stopping smoking. Only after anti psychotic medication (Seroquel) did the symptoms stop, and they seem to be permanent, stopping the medication causes the symptoms to come back.  From what I understand, Seroquel suppresses dopamine, while cannabis has nothing to do with dopamine.  So how does cannabis induce a dopamine related disorder? "
1720,Omitting word(s) when typing,"[Reraising a recently asked question that was closed here, but in more cogsci fashion, I hope.]  Some people are more inclined than others to omit a word when typing, but still be unaware of its unintended absence on a (first) proofreading. In human-computer interaction (HCI) this is called a ""misperception error"". (according to Jan Noyes, Designing for Humans, p. 147, Psychology Press 2002... but that's about all the book says on the topic).  So what else is known?   First of all, is it also called something else, perhaps more specific, because ""misperception error"" is very general, so it's hard to turn up any research on this particular error using these terms in pubmed. What is the prevalence among general population? It can't be something that hard to study, say among students, the low-hanging fruit of psychology and HCI studies, so I suspect some study on prevalence exists. What are some abnormal psychology correlates? I would venture a guess dyslexia and ADHD, but how much more common is it in such sub-populations than in neurotypicals?   I would gladly break this into separate questions if deemed necessary, but I suspect all of the above can probably be answered from one or two papers specifically on this topic.    I found a paper on a similar auditory phenomenon, which has some generally applicable ideas:     the application of signal detection theory (SDT) allows   perceptual performance to be understood in terms of both sensitivity (the ability of a system to distinguish signal from noise) and response bias (the system’s bias, independent of sensitivity, for responding either positively or negatively)   So obviously there is a stronger response bias in proofreading your own typing than another's... which probably means that general statistics for ""filling in"" missing words in a sentence need to upward adjusted for proofreading your own typing.  Even more interesting, and perhaps a little worrisome for those exhibiting this,      This theory is supported by behavioural evidence showing that the   influence expectation exerts over auditory perception is stronger in those who   hallucinate [...] This theory   is also supported by evidence that the prediction error signal, which communicates the   discrepancy between expectation and actual sensation [...] is reduced in those who suffer from   schizophrenia [...].   It remains to be seen if misperception of non-existent words due to semantic expectation correlates to some kind of predisposition for visual or other kind of hallucination. It seems a bit more far fetched.    Perhaps it's also worth noting here that simply proofreading familiar text, which the subject has read before in the correct version, but which is then modified by the injection of spelling errors, actually improves the detection rate of spelling errors. So not all kinds of familiarity with the text predispose to proofreading errors, at least not to proofreading spelling errors (missing or extra words were not tested in that study). "
1721,Region of Interest Proposal in Vision,"In machine learning, Region of Interest (ROI) proposal is a method for subsampling an image to identify ""interesting"" subregions. A canonical example is from Region Convolutional Neural Networks, where the task is to identify objects in a scene:    The point of the above ROI proposal is that it makes subsequent multiple object detection more efficient since the entire image no longer needs to be processed and because most objects will fall within the detected subregions. To be clear, ROI proposal is usually done using lower-level methods like looking at color gradations and estimating region boundaries. Nowedays, ROI proposal is done with convolutional layers, but even these use fairly low-level kernels to quickly propose regions. I'm specifically interested in the convolutional approaches, as they seem most relevant to the brain.  I'm wondering if there is any evidence of such ROI proposal in animal vision? Specifically what is our current state-of-the-art understanding of how the brain identifies multiple objects in a complex scene? Do we have reason to believe that it's not just a left-right and top-down scan of the image, but something more efficient where lower-level neurons propose subregions to explore?  It's been difficult to search for this topic online because it mainly links to ROI proposal for brain scans.  "
1722,Is there a correlation between schemas and social constructs?,"While studying Piaget's stages of cognitive development in Educational Psychology, the textbook talks about Piaget using the idea of ""schemas"" which are mental representations or ideas about what things are and how we deal with them.  I also stumbled upon the theory of social constructionism.  While learning psychology, should I look at these as a correlation or two separate entities?  Also in the field of psychology, does one theory have precedence over another? "
1723,Can the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron incorporate desensitization?,"I'm studying a neuron in an organism that has the following properties:   The neuron's output voltage is dependent on the strength of the stimulus, if that stimulus is applied and removed without any further stimuli. If there is another stimulus that follows the first, then the magnitude of the voltage is reduced by a factor dependent on the time between the two stimuli, even if the strength of the two stimuli is the same.   I know approximately the function that governs this reduction in magnitude as a function of time between stimuli.    Is the Hodgkin-Huxley model sufficient to model the behaviour of this neuron?  Is there another model that is more appropriate? "
1724,Why didn't the Left Twix/Right Twix ad campaign take off?,"This is intended to be a psychology question about human decision making and behavior as concerns advertising. As this is only my second ever question on Cognitive Sciences SE, please advise as to any reasonable improvements to the question, and now for the fun part!  A few years ago, Mars the candy company decided they weren't selling enough Twix candy bars, and launched an ad campaign centered on the idea of the left and right sides of the candy bar being a point of controversy, based on the idea that one is better than the other. Now, three years later, they are even selling packages carrying ""only left Twix"" or ""only right Twix"". Now obviously, this entire ad campaign is preposterous. There's no difference between the left side of a Twix bar and the right side of a Twix bar.  And yet the idea of stoking controversy over meaningless polarization of the public has been a very successful strategy for viral marketing in the past. Remember that yellow and gold dress? It seems to be fact at this point that pointless controversy creating conflict between two polar-opposite groups of people is an immensely successful means of propagating the story. In my limited marketing expertise, I'd say Mars did everything right with their Twix campaign.  So why does no one care? People as a matter of fact think it ridiculous. Why isn't it working? "
1725,Benefits of Preserving Dopamine,"I recently came across a short piece on Twitter advocating for the preservation of dopamine release. The writer stated that a list of things should be avoided to preserve dopamine.     Preserve your dopamine:         Turn off all social media notifications   Get to a commercial free place on TV and Internet   Zero real porn and limit controllable passive porn   Build in reflective time (I use a devotional)   Limit addictive substances (especially passive ones)      When I asked why, he stated that preserving dopamine by avoiding these activities would mean I'd have more dopamine for other activities:     No, the more places you spend dopamine, the less you have for the   things you need and the less you get from the things that are good for   you.      Ex. Watching hardcore porn decreases your pleasure from healthy sex   Is there truth to that statement? Is dopamine a truly finite resource that I won't produce more of each day if I spend it on these activities? Thus making me less motivated for important work.   I'm looking for information on dopamine production and benefits of preservation in the answer.  "
1726,How to estimate IQ for public figures?,"Background: I read a question on Quora that asked how intelligent is Barack Obama. A wide range of arguments were presented. The tone of the answers was not neutral because of the political context of the question. Furthermore, over the while I've read estimates of intelligence of various famous people from history (e.g., scientists, presidents, etc.). Issues were also raised about how intelligence is defined (e.g., cognitive, social, emotional or physical; achievement versus latent ability, etc.) Despite these issues, I find the topic interesting.   Questions:   If you cannot administer a standardised intelligence test to someone, to what extent can you obtain a good estimate of their IQ from the kinds of information available about public figures? What is considered scientific best-practice in this regard? How accurate is best practice? Do any studies provide validity estimates (e.g., correlating estimates with actual IQ test scores)?    In relation to public figures, a wide range of information is often available: e.g., demographics, educational attainments, career achievement, writing samples, personal achievements, samples of public speaking, and so on. Sometimes, information such as school and university grades will be available. Of course, a lot of this information will be non-standardised. I wonder what would be a good way to collect and synthesise this information to generate a prediction. "
1727,Introductory resources on developmental psychology/neuroscience,"I'd like to be able to answer questions such as:   What neuro/psychological functions underly competences such as empathy (or others - see background below)?  What neurotransmitters are of particular importance in those functions?  What genes are known to be associated with those neurotransmitters?   Any suggestions on textbooks or review papers that would be a good starting point?    Background  I'm an M.Sc. student in epidemiology (with a psychology undergrad) and my thesis is on ""gene x environment"" interactions (GxE). The outcome I'm interested in is child competence (construct which can be subdivided in subcomponents such as compliance, attention &amp; empathy) at 18 months. The main environmental predictor is mother sensitivity.  I now need to focus on some specific genes and would like to be able to choose those with a clear rationale (rather than, say, search through the literature to find the most commonly studied genes); However, at this point I lack the knowledge required to do so.  "
1728,What is the state of the art in computerised coding of Thematic Apperception Tests (TATs)?,"Thematic Apperception Tests (TATs) involve showing test takers pictures and getting them to write stories based on the pictures. Coding such stories for themes and traits can be complex, time-consuming, and potentially suffer from issues of unreliability. Thus, it would be interesting to see whether automated computerised coding could make the process of scoring TATs more efficient, reliable, and valid.   What is the current state of computerised coding of TATs? How does the reliability and validity of computerised coding compare to human coding?  "
1729,"Is there any evidence to support a correlation between how much bodily energy you are using, and how quickly time appears to pass?","It seems to me that time passes more slowly when I am drinking coffee, but when I stop, or I am tired it seems that time passes a lot faster.  Could this have something to do with the sampling rate at which the life-loop in my brain can perceive things?  Since a higher sampling rate in this life-loop would cause more time to be perceived? "
1730,Does the ability to manipulate your environment affect the type of intelligence?,"There are several animals on earth that show certain kinds of intelligence. Some animals have extensions to manipulate their environment and some do not. Think of humans and squids (hand/extension side) versus whales and dolphins on the other (the no hand side). Learning how to use their hands also gives babies a boost in their development.  My question is: Does the ability to manipulate your environment affect the type of intelligence?  I'm pretty sure that it affects the, let's call it generalized intelligence, but does it also change the type from more or less aggressive? "
1731,What is the standard way to analyze EEG data in a mismatch negativity paradigm?,"I'm running an EEG experiment using a modified auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) design, and I'm wondering if anyone can tell me the best method for data analysis (and recommend any stats programs/packages for this purpose as well).    The experiment will only have a few (6-8) subjects with a high number of trials per subject (~700).  The matched condition makes up 75% of the trials.  The stimuli are selected from a closed set of 10 items, with an equal frequency of items in the matched/mismatched conditions.  One of the differences between this study and normal auditory MMN tasks is that the expected/unexpected stimuli vary between trials with the expectation set up on a trial-by-trial basis.  Therefore, it's possible that the difference in event-related potentials (ERPs) to expected/unexpected stimuli will be averaged out due to small variations in response to these changing stimuli.    Does someone out there know the best EEG data processing and analysis techniques to detect the small ERP in response to auditory MMN stimuli?  Can anyone recommend techniques to avoid averaging out small ERPs whose latencies might vary? "
1732,What types of sounds do young infants prefer?,"I've learned through course lectures that infants can recognize faces shortly after birth (Slater &amp; Quinn, 2001), and have a visual preference for human features as young as 1-month-old (Sanefuji et al., 2011)[pdf]. Infants are also known to prefer hearing their mother's voices (DeCasper &amp; Fifer, 1980) and motherese (Fernald,1984). Prefences for higher-pitched singing also suggests that babies may in general prefer higher pitches (Trainor &amp; Zacharias, 1997).   In general I would like to know more comprehensively what types of sound preferences do young infants have? And when is the youngest age for which these preferences are observed? "
1733,Can you catch up on sleep over the weekend?,"The lack of sleep has many negative effects associated with it. Maintained sleep deprivation results in a degraded performance over time (in this case reaction time).  Assuming one needs 8 hours of sleep each night, but during the weekdays he only sleeps 6, is it possible to catch up on those lost hours of sleep during the weekend?  There is evidence that 'recovery sleep' is different from ordinary sleep. Carskadon and Dement (2005) measured a sleep pattern that favors Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) after 38 hours without sleep. Personally I also experience it takes me longer to wake up after being sleep deprived, which makes me believe at least your body is trying to make up for something.  A study by Gumenyuk et. al (2011) concludes:     Reduced time in bed is associated with deficiency of the neuronal   process associated with change detection, which may recover after one   week of sleep extension, whereas attention-dependent neural processes   do not normalize after this period of time in habitually short   sleeping individuals and may require longer recovery periods.   It gives an indication recovery of some symptoms is possible, but recovery time is not equal for all symptoms. However, the participants in this study seem to be habitual short sleepers.  A more recent study (2015) by Brice Faraut concludes ""[...] data suggests a 30-minute nap can reverse the hormonal impact of a night of poor sleep, [...]"".  I am wondering whether it is possible to recover from the lost hours over the week during the weekend entirely. E.g. if you lost 8 hours, by sleeping 8 hours more during the weekend. The notion of sleep dept still seems to be up for debate, but perhaps there is more certainty on short term (1 week) effects?   Carskadon, M. A. and Dement, W. C. (2005).

1734,Do fetuses exhibit pattern recognition in utero?,"I've heard that fetuses exhibit ""likes"", such as preferring sweeter amniotic fluid or the sound of their mother's voice. To show preference for specific voices as opposed to inborn stimuli like sweet, some form of pattern recognition would have to be involved.  By pattern recognition I simply mean exhibiting any sort of indication that by repeated exposure to a stimulus the fetus' response changes, showing that it in some way has identified the stimulus as being previously experienced.  I know of some research that indicates newborns recognize and prefer their own mother's voice but I'm not aware of specific research on children in utero.  Does any research indicate that fetuses show pattern recognition in utero, such as voice recognition? Is there an approximate time this ability presents itself? "

I have been doing my best to find studies on this topic but every website and article seems to only reference the study by Amodio et al (2007).

1736,Do ability tests predict maximal more than typical job performance?,"I have often read that ability tests are indicative of what people ""can do"", but that job performance also depends on what people ""will do"".  For example, Ackerman and Beier (2012) wrote that:     There is a fundamental mismatch between what is measured by extant   intelligence tests and the criteria one is most interested in, when   predicting job-related performance measures, that is, the mismatch   between typical and maximal behaviors. ... Although assessments of   what someone can do will serve as an assessment of the upper bound of   a person’s performance on the day that the applicant is assessed, I–O   psychologists and managers are most interested in what the applicant   will do on a day-to-day basis on the job—that is, the individual’s   typical performance.   Thus, my questions are:   What is the  correlation between maximal job performance and typical job performance? To what extent do ability tests predict maximal performance more than typical performance?   I'm interested in learning about empirical studies that have tested these ideas. I also imagine that findings will vary based on factors related to the work setting, and so forth (e.g., some work environments permit greater variability in discretionary effort). Also, presumably the degree to which ability-performance correlations differ between typical and maximal will be greater where the correlation between typical and maximal is lower. I'm also interested in understanding more about the methodological challenges associated with operationalising typical and maximal performance.  References   Ackerman, P. L., Beier, M.

1737,Do high heels increase female attractiveness in men only through indirect means?,"It seems widely accepted that, overall, men tend to find women in high heels more attractive.  (There will, of course, be many exceptions to this rule.)     ""High heels may well be the most potent aphrodisiac ever concocted."" -- Rossi 1981   However, the increase in attraction seems to be only indirectly ascribed with wearing high heels.  Typically this is described along the lines: high heels cause a change in the posture of the female, which the male finds (sexually) attractive.     Question: How can we exclude the possibility that the high heels themselves are not the main cause of the increase in attractiveness?   That is, how can we exclude the possibility that men, overall, primarily just like the sight of women in high heels, for some reason or another?  My thoughts:   If the increase in attractiveness were primarily due to these indirect factors, then we should see a comparable increase in attractiveness e.g. if a woman were merely to stand on a slope.  (Although, this would not account for the addition factors, such as gait, and the sound made when walking in high heels.) There are things that women do, such as fingernail painting, which increases attractiveness, but (arguably) not sexual attractiveness.  It seems plausible that the ""femininity"" associated with wearing high heels (as with fingernail painting) could be a large factor in the increase in attractiveness.   References Rossi WA. (1981) High heels: the agony and the extasy. Journal of the American Podiatry Association 71(12), 698-699. "
1738,What is the relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder and fugue states?,"The introduction of the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (""DSM-5"") is on the horizon.  With it are coming some new, evidence-based diagnoses for dissociative disorders [1], which include conditions such as dissociative fugue (which will now be classified as dissociative amnesia) and dissociative identity disorder.  Fugue states have always been fascinating to me, Wikipedia states that they are     a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality and other identifying characteristics of individuality...Fugues are usually precipitated by a stressful episode, and upon recovery there may be amnesia for the original stressor.   Post-traumatic stress disorder is also precipitated by a stressful (and potentially life threatening) episode, and causes anxiety and autonomic hyperexcitablity.  I've never seen anything written about the level of stressor that can induce a fugue state, but based on their common etiology, I would assume that PTSD and fugue states are related psychologically and neurologically.  To what extent is this true, are these two seemingly different end products of the same initial event?  Is there an anatomical substrate that is common to both?  Does changing the status of ""dissociative fugue"" -> ""dissociative amnesia"" mean they should be considered in isolation?     [1] Spiegel, D., Loewenstein, R. J., et al.

1739,Sensory Immersion Research?,"Sensory deprivation is a relatively common technique for medititation and general consciousness-exploration.  However, I'm more interested in sensory immersion.  That is, deliberate overstimulation as a meditative exercise.    For example, listening to two different audio streams, one in each ear (this is the original motivator for this question, as I recently found that I concentrate better when two different audio streams are being played into my ears).  I suspect a relation to attentional drift and a state of relaxed/detached attention, but I don't want to jump to conclusions either.  Has there been research (by whom? available online?) on this subject?    EDIT: example of commercial service offering Sensory Immersion (www.mind-spas.com) "
1740,Spurious attractors in Hopfield networks,"A classic ""Hopfield network"" is a type of artificial neural network in which the units are bi-stable and fully interconnected by symmetrically weighted connections. In 1982, Hopfield showed that such networks are characterized by an ""energy function"", under which stored memories correspond to local energy minima [1].  In a 1983 paper [2], Hopfield et al further showed that ""spurious memories"" (local energy minima that are created during training, in addition to the intended target patterns) can be suppressed by an ""unlearning procedure"", during which the network is repeatedly allowed to relax from random states, and the resulting states then ""unlearned"" by anti-Hebbian weight adjustments. The procedure affects spurious memories more than the desirable ""learned memories"", thus improving recall performance. However, the paper offers no explanation for why this should be so.  A 2004 paper by Robins and McCallum [3] demonstrates that spurious memories can be distinguished from learned ones because their ""energy profiles"" are different. Specifically, the ratio of lowest to highest energy contributions from individual units is significantly smaller in states corresponding to spurious memories than in states corresponding to learned memories. Again, the effect is not accounted for (except for a tentative partial explanation).  My questions are:   Is there a relationship between these two findings, i.e. does the lower ""energy ratio"" of spurious states explain their greater susceptibility to unlearning? Have any explanations for either or both of these phenomena been put forward since the publication of the papers? Are there other ways to suppress or detect spurious memories in the Hopfield family of neural networks?   [1] Hopfield, J. J. (1982).

1741,Perceptual flicker when rotating my face,"Informal Experiment:   I look up at a wooden beam on the ceiling, or I look at the office door; both the door and the ceiling are about 2 meters from my face. I rotate my face 90 degrees left or right at a rate of about 90 degrees per second. (You may have to adjust this rate to experience the flicker. Too fast or too slow, and you won't experience the flicker.)   Results:   My visual perception (of the edge of the door or ceiling) flickers rather than being smooth and continuous. I typically perceive 4 (but sometimes 5 or 6) images during the rotation, which translates to 1/3 second between images or one image per 30 degrees of rotation.   Notes:   Ensure that ambient illumination doesn't flicker. Sunlight is suitable. Most electrical light that runs on AC is not. I understand that not everyone who tries this experiment will experience this phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs when viewing a sheet of paper held at arm's length and pressed against a contrasting wall (e.g., white paper on brown wall). Rotating the paper instead of your face does not generate the phenomenon. The intention of the linked YouTube video is only to show which plane to rotate. I recorded a video of my face during the experiment. Reviewing the video, I see no eye movement.   Question:  Is there any research on this phenomenon? (I have been unable to find anything on it, perhaps because I don't know the proper terminology.) "
1742,"Do only humans spend a lot of time daydreaming (or having ""stimulus-independent thoughts"")?","A paper  Killingsworth et al., A Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind, Science 12 November 2010: 932 (or a free pdf) starts with the following statement:     Unlike other animals, human beings spend   a lot  of  time  thinking about  what  is  not   going on around them, contemplating   events that happened in the past, might happen   in the future, or will never happen at all. Indeed,   “stimulus-independent thought” or “mind wandering” appears to be the brain’s default  mode   of operation (1-3).   While the claim is supported for humans by the cited papers and their finding:     Mind wandering   occurred in 46.9% of the samples and in at least   30% of the samples taken during every activity   except making love.   I couldn't find a strong evidence that for all other animals it is not true. Even if it, arguably, may sound plausible for domestic animals, it seems less convincing for primates, elephants or dolphins (without a proper experimental support).  Are there any research on ""wandering mind"" for other animals? If so, do they support or refute the ""unlike other animals"" line? "
1743,Whether to ask satisfaction and importance questions for each item in a survey?,"Job satisfaction and opinion surveys ask respondents to provide ratings on a set of items. One response scale might be a five point rating scale measuring satisfaction (e.g., 5-point strongly dissatisfied to strongly satisfied) with the item content (e.g., ""Opportunities for promotion""). Some tests also gather for each item ""importance"" ratings.   What are the psychometric properties of importance versus satisfaction scales? To what extent is the incremental information provided by importance ratings justified?  "
1744,What is the correlation between objective indexes and aggregated self-report measures of life satisfaction?,"The Better Life Index and other indices seek to overcome the limitations of GDP in assessing social progress. They provide a composite score with which to rank nations on a range of indicators such as safety, environment, health, employment, economic activity, and so on.  Other researchers obtain self-report measures of happiness of life satisfaction (e.g., Diener's popluar Satisfaction with Life Scale). With care these scales can be aggregated over individuals to form a group-level measurement. For example, with careful sampling, a nation level estimate can be obtained.  I'm curious about these things:   What is the correlation between aggregated self-report measures and objective indexes of life satisfaction? What explanation is provided for the size of the correlation in terms of how they are similar or different in what they measure?  "
1745,Does completing a thesis make you a better practicing psychologist?,"I am a strong believer in the importance of the scientist-practitioner model for psychology. I think that training in the scientific method is a major component of what makes a person trained in psychology more employable.  In many jurisdictions, a student wanting to be registered as a psychologists is required to complete one more research theses. For example, in Australia, a student will typically complete an undergraduate fourth year thesis and a thesis as part of a larger masters or doctoral program. While it is obvious that training in research will make a student a better researcher, I have heard some people question whether completing a research thesis will make the student a better practising psychologist.  Thus, my questions are:   What empirical research exists that has tested whether completing a research thesis in psychology makes you a better practising psychologist? What theoretical frameworks justify or challenge the value of completing a research thesis in terms of improving practical skills required by a psychologist?  "
1746,When is it best to use PsycINFO versus Google Scholar?,PsycINFO is a abstracting service provided by the APA dedicated to research in the behavioural sciences to which many universities subscribe.

Under what conditions should someone use one or the other service?  
1747,Were the subjects in the Stanford prison experiment randomly assigned to the study?,"The Stanford prison experiment tested what would happen when a group of subjects was pushed in the role of prisoner, while a second group was assigned the role of guards. Within merely a day or so, the guards started to harass the prisoners, humiliate them and made the prisoners physically and mentally suffer, forcing them to cleaning out toilet bowls with their bare hands, do push-ups, jumping jacks and what not.   Now I am wondering - how can normal people turn so evil? Were the assigned guards tested for any existing psychological problems prior to the experiment, or were they randomly chosen? In general, how did the researchers choose the subjects? "
1748,Can the big five personality dimensions be trained/enhanced?,"Are there established methods to, say, enhance someone's conscientiousness or agreeableness?

1750,Can drastic changes in stress levels impact long-term memory?,"Can going from a highly intensive and stressful environment to one which is calm and relaxed impact long-term memory or, specifically, one's ability to easily recall information?   For example, I have spent the past year in a very intense and stressful academic environment where I would often go for days without sleep. During this time, I was able to quickly recall information and do very well. However, now that I am on ""summer break"" I am noticing that my memory is not as sharp. Specifically, I am having difficulty recalling names and specific pieces of information that I should know. This occurs on only on occasion and only happens with things that are more obscure or non-essential (i.e. couldn't come up with the name to a song I know all of the lyrics to. I knew the title immediately once I saw it).   This has happened to me once before while on break and shortly after returning to work I noticed that my memory had returned to normal. This only happens with names and it almost feels as though there is a mental block preventing me from remembering.  Is there an explanation as to why this is occurring?  As a note: I am still a teenager so age is hopefully not a factor. "
1751,Are there any papers showing that too much learning matters is bad for memory?,"Does anyone know papers indicating that too much information is bad for the memory or even more precise - that too much learning matter is bad for the success of a student?

What is the process in the mind that causes it to be slow, almost as if I were to be speaking the thoughts aloud? Is our thought process just wildly inefficient?  "
1756,Isolating stable EEG data across all channels in EEGLAB,"I'm working on some EEG data we collected using the Emotiv Epoc headset using 14 channel sensors.   I need to isolate chunks of data where all 14 channels are stable (non-noisy) for a given length of time (e.g. 5 seconds). I've written a MATLAB script for this, such that I calculate the standard deviation of each channel and pass an analysis window over the data, comparing the difference between maximum and minimum values in the window to this standard deviation (i.e. where maximum - minimum is less than the standard deviation [or 3-5 standard deviations], I treat that window as stable).  Based on this criteria, I am having some success in finding 5 second long segments but am worried this data may not be reliable (or not as stable/artefact free as desired).  Are there any better ways of performing this analysis? Even better, are there any functions built into EEGLAB for this very purpose?  Further info:  I've selected only the relevant channels and can now look through my EEG data files.  I am no neuroscience expert, actually I'm rather new to this sort of analysis, so apologies if this question is overly basic or off-point.  EDIT  We collected our data in a museum environment (very noisy in many ways), with participants sitting as still as possible for 2-minute sessions at a go. For this reason, there is a high likelihood of artefacts being found in the data due to movement, the environment and possibly even inaccuracies from the device itself (since we went through a rather large number of participants, cleaning and charging the headsets in between trials).   From what I've discussed with the team, I've been told that removing artefacts wouldn't solve the issue (though admittedly I'm no expert as to why this would be).   For clarity, the data we've collected looks similar to the plot below.     And we're looking for a minimum of 5 seconds of stable data, closer to the plot below.    Also, I know this data selection can be done manually using pop_eegplot, however since we have close to 300 data files I'm looking to automate this (and hopefully get more reliable selections). "

1759,Is there a cognitive bias which describes expert communities' overestimation of their potential impact?,"I was recently trying to argue that the Democratic National Committee's efforts to undermine the Bernie Sanders campaign were probably ineffective, and that those who attempted to do so probably suffered from a specific cognitive bias. Namely, due to their presence in the ""political operative"" nexus, they tended to overestimate, in general, the impact that political operations have on elections, swaying public opinion, etc.   I wonder whether social scientists have observed that, in general, experts overestimate their ability to make an impact, because they put the system they belong to on a pedestal. Has such a cognitive bias ever been discussed in the literature? Is there a name for it? "

1761,Significance of 4 stimulus cards in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test?,"I've reviewed the papers by Grant, D. A., &amp; Berg, E. (1948) and Fey, E. T. (1951).  These papers from what I was able to find, lay out the basis of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). There are three possible rules for sorting the cards; color, shape, or count. I am curious why the WCST places 4 stimulus cards in front of the patient when 3 carefully chosen cards would be sufficient. With 4 cards it seems that unless the examiner makes special preparations, there might be occasions when there is more than 1 correct stimulus card to choose, or during a transition from certain rule to the next the patient may make an incorrect guess and won't be able to tell which rule to eliminate.  Can anyone explain why there has to be 4 stimulus cards? Could I run an equally effective WCST with 3 stimulus cards?   Grant, D. A., &amp; Berg, E. (1948).

1763,What's the difference between computational neuroscience and systems neuroscience?,"I'm an engineer, interested in mental machinery, to imitate cognitive capabilities of the human mind into primitive artificial models. In this case, cognitive neuroscience (CogN) is something, apparently, relevant and important field.  But I have no clear idea about the differences between computational neuroscience (CompN) and systems neuroscience (SysN) and their relevance to my target. In my view, these two topics are very similar (if not the same!), because one need to analyze the brain and its systematic functionality by computational approaches. Furthermore, it is inevitable to consider system-driven perspective to be able to present computational interpretation for neural systems.   So, what is the subtle difference between SysN and CompN? Which one should be taken into account within (in coordination with CogN) to studying of the mental functionality of the brain?   Thanks  EDIT: Someone else's answer to the first question, does which sound like a seminal viewpoint:     I feel the question is ill-posed. Don’t pick a “field” to study. Pick   a problem to study. Based on the problem selected one or another field   may be more relevant for your work, but it is unlikely that any   interesting question about cognition will fall wholly within the   domain of any one classically defined area of neuroscience.  "
1764,Does an action potential abolish an excitatory postsynaptic potential?,"From some sources, I've read that excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) decay over time, which would imply that they aren't abolished by action potentials. However, other sources seem to indicate the opposite (although I may be misunderstanding them). Plus, the classical leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron model implies that EPSPs are abolished by action potentials (although this could well be a simplification). Does the refractory period of an action potential affect its originating EPSP? Or is it a separate phenomenon? "
1765,Is consciousness a sub product of the brain or is there a duality?,"I am trying to understand what consciousness is, based on my basic knowledge of our senses, artificial intelligence (computer vision, specifically) and some philosophy. Here's my reasoning:  As far as I understand it from my Neural Network class, each eye captures the light and transmits it through electric signals to the brain. Each action potential can be seen as a binary 1, no activity as a 0.  This stimulates some of the neurons in the visual cortex, which allows our brain to interpret and understand what the eyes have captured.  In computer vision, this is where ""sight"" ends: the computer detects what's in the image, based on its knowledge base - its training set - and that's it.  So why does the human brain take the extra steps of combining both signals into an image - i.e translating the different waves of the electromagnetic spectrum into shapes, colors, etc -, turning it upright and displaying it to ourselves?  The same could be said, as far as I know it, about the other senses: hearing would be detecting vibrations in the air, but the brain also translate these into sounds.  Does this hint that Descartes' dualistic definition could be true, that our consciousness is separate from the brain? Or could consciousness be a sub product of the brain, a consolidation of what each one of its areas are processing, in order to better understand the world (as in Stanislas Dehaene's workspace neurons cognitive model)?    edit: I've been thinking a bit more about the subject. If there are workspace neurons responsible for consciousness, then there should be a region of the brain that is constantly active, at all times.  After a bit of - online - research, I've stumbled upon the Default mode network (DMN), which is anti-correlated to the Task-positive network (TPN). Interestingly, the DMN is active when the individual is not focused on an activity - at rest. Furthermore, there is a possible increase in connectivity between DMN's nodes during REM sleep - when we dream. On the other hand, TPM is most active during attention-demanding tasks. It has therefore been theorized that both are elements of a single default network with anti-correlated components (in an scientific paper behind a pay-wall, so I'm quoting Wikipedia).  Plus, both networks involve the fronto-parietal attention network, where it is believed the workspace neurons are located.  I couldn't help correlating the DMN and TPN to Carl Jung's theories of the Conscious and the Unconscious - which I am particularly fond about. If these wild conjectures I am forming are correct, then we could have the following (oversimplified) neural correlate of consciousness:    In this idea, exchanges between TPM and DMN occur through neurotransmitters, while exchanges between the conscious and unconscious happen using psychic energy (as in the energy from the psyche, not supernatural powers). Furthermore, the collective unconscious would then be inherited from human to human - embedded in our DNA. If true, then there would be discernible patterns in a newborn's brain...  So, going back to A.I, a conscious agent would not, theoretically, be a single agent, but instead a multi-agent collaborative system...  Now, I have very basic knowledge and lack scientific research on these topics, but I am interested in learning a LOT more. Is this theory absurd and blatantly wrong, or is it worth pursuing as a hypothesis? "
1766,Neurobiology of addiction recovery,"While addiction is one of the most studied topics in neurobiology, I don't see very much info on recovery.  The information I have found is confusing.     This one says striatal DAT bindings return to normal within 4-weeks of alcohol abstinence. This one says DAT density is around 20% lower in meth abstainers than the control. This one suggests that for meth users, the DA changes are permanent and recovered performance is a result of a compensating thalamus. This one says prolonged abstinence from meth users leads to an increase of 16% and 19%  This one is the only report I could find on straital changes from overeating. But nothing on recovery. Just an interesting note that A1 Allele carriers have 30-40% lower DAT density (which sounds hugely unfair).   Is anyone familiar with this topic?  Why are the effects of ethanol so easily reversed (apparently) but not meth, if they both have an effect on DAT/R?    Where are all the other studies, especially for eating, or the internet?  Is their neurological evidence that a glutton can enjoy plain foods, that someone can lose their ""sweet tooth,"" that the D2 receptors come back after prolonged internet use (or that they're reduced at all)?  Seems like a big topic with so little information. Perhaps I'm not looking correctly. "
1767,Why might mindfulness and meditation lead to anger and anxiety?,"Background: I have been trying mindfulness/meditation but I don't understand how to do it. For example, I tried sitting thinking and focusing on my breath, but thoughts kept intruding, so I just observed them, without trying to suppress them. Soon, one thought led to another, I felt myself getting angrier and more depressed. By the end of my meditating session, i felt terrible, anxious and agitated.   General Question:   Does meditation and mindfulness cause many people to get anxious and angry? Why might meditation and mindfulness lead to anxiety and anger? Is a positive response to meditation related more to the method or the person?  "
1768,Is it possible to erase problematic memories?,"This question is inspired by a question I answered on Health.      Can we erase problematic memories to aid recovery from depression?   A depressed person asked how to erase specific unpleasant memories in order to manage his depression. My answer was basically ""that's impossible, here is how you deal with these memories instead"". And then somebody asked in the comments why it is impossible.   I thought of tackling this question and realized I can't do it well. My best attempt was something like, ""First, you have to find out which millions of neurons (out of the billions the person has) light up together to represent 'a memory', and we don't have a method for brain imaging with that resolution. Second, you have to stop them from activating in exactly that combination, while preserving their ability to activate in any other combination, and we have no idea how to achieve that"". But this level of explanation does not satisfy me. It is very vague, and I'm not even certain it's correct.   To our best knowledge, what would we have to do if we wanted to erase a specific memory of an event happening to a person? And how far is our technology from achieving each of the steps needed?  "
1769,Do readers consider the passive voice as more authoritative?,"In the middle of the last century (roughly from the 20s-70s) the passive voice dominated scientific writing; or should it be said that scientific writing was dominated by the passive voice?   Nowadays, there is pushback against the passive voice with (noted scientists like) Robert May saying that ""these days, use of the passive voice in a research paper is, more often than not, the hallmark of second rate work."" Moore (2000) even argues (from anecdotal evidence) that your scientific work might have less impact if you rely on the passive voice (among other factors of poor rhetoric).  However, the passive voice is still preferred (or at least used) by many scientists. This is occasionally explained by the assertion that the passive voice is more objective or seems more authoritative. Is there any empirical literature on this?  Does a text appear more objective or authoritative if it is written in the passive voice? Does it appear more 'scientific'? Does it affect the impact of the work (or proxies like citation count)? Is this effect context (say, science vs. law vs. politics, etc) dependent? "

Now the same scenario, but group B, if everyone agrees that John is NOT showing attraction to Julie, Jim [Contrarian] will disagree and will say something else.

1772,(Co)Registration in the preprocessing pipeline,"I have a general question about registration and coregistration in the preprocessing pipeline of fMRI images.

Is this correct?   What is the difference between registration and coregistration and normalization? "
1773,Why do difficult-to-learn subjects seem easier in retrospect?,"Background: I have recently noticed that in class, that after I finished a unit, it seems less difficult than I expected it to be. It has happened in math, physics and electronics.  Is it possible that maybe those units were not even difficult in the first place? That it was just  a matter of perception and first judgement, where you think to yourself ""Oh lord, this unit is gonna be hell,"" and the mind plays along with that all through?  Why do difficult-to-learn subjects seem easier in retrospect? "
1774,What are your thoughts on Accelerated Resolution Therapy?,"Recently I came into contact with my aunt, and it seems she has been doing very well. She has been developing a therapy technique that, she claims, helps resolves psychological problems from trauma, child abuse, domestic abuse, et cetera. She calls it Accelerated Resolution Therapy.  The essential thesis of her technique is that the problems caused trauma are being dealt with incorrectly. Therapists often try to help a patient deal with the facts of the situation. They help them understand what happened, why it happened, and why what happened should not impair their life. Unfortunately, therapy can often be slow in progress and some people never fully recover from a traumatic event. My aunt's therapy technique essentially discards the old method of dealing with facts and, instead, deals with memories and pictures. Coming to terms with facts, from a rational and conscious perspective, is usually achievable. But, for my aunt, the problem aren't the facts but the images revolving around those facts. Even when a person comes to understand their trauma, they still will suffer from depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems.  What she essentially does is encourage the patient to change the images to more positive, or, at the very least, into neutral memories. She does encourage them to change their knowledge on the matter; but, rather, she simply changes the physical memory into something less traumatic. The patient will still understand that they were wronged and hurt, but the image of the pain will be removed.  Usually I'm very skeptical with new therapy techniques and any practice that claims to solve problems within 2 or 3 sessions, but it honestly makes a lot of sense. It reminds me of ghost limbs and mirror therapy, and how placing a mirror next to a limb, in tact, will help a patient be relieved of his pain. He understands, clear as day, that he is missing a limb, but the physical image of having two limbs and seeing the limbs move removes many of the psychological problems associated with ghost limbs.  She has had peer reviewed studies and is encouraging training. So, what do you all think? Does it sound like it has potential, or is it just snakeskin oil?   Here is one study showing that patients experience relief from their symptoms within 1-5 sessions.  And another study. Another study. And another. "
1775,What is the subjective wellbeing instrument that is used by Science of Happiness for check-ins?,"I am doing some work with students on happiness and thought it would be useful for us to have a look at their subjective well-being.  The EdX Science of Happiness course made use of weekly checkins like this one: [website]The test is 6 questions, each one you are shown a drawing of a face with an emotion (3 positive, 3 negative) and you are asked to rate ""To what extent does the character above match how you've been feeling lately?""  I'd like to learn more about this instrument. Like what research has been done to determine the validity of the measure, the origins of it, considerations when applying it.  I can't find any information on it, there doesn't seem to be a reference on the course page as to where it came from.  Does anyone have any ideas? "
1776,Is there evidence for cross-cultural differences in problem solving skills?,"Does the thought process in our mind for solving a problem or bringing out a solution to a problem depend on culture or language?  If so, how can these skills be represented and addressed? "
1777,Does a short nap improve learning efficiency?,"When one attempts to learn a new skill (e.g., play a guitar), it is often heard that the first hour of practice is more effective than the second. I have heard some people say that even 10 minutes of practice may be effective when you do so everyday.  On many (non-scientific) websites I have read that taking a little nap of 15-30 minutes during prolonged practice is enough to maintain effective learning. Is this true, or is more sleep required? Or is sleep irrelevant altogether?  "
1778,What is the lifetime of the synapse in the mature brain?,"I know there is synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. There is a great number of plasticity mechanisms like LTD and LTP, acting on different time scales. Apart from the synaptic weight change, there is constant rewiring. New spines are being born, those who  find a synaptic bouton can even expel the previously connected spine to that bouton.  What I don't know is the specific time constant associated with the rewiring. I also don't know the net effect of this plasticity. What is the average lifetime of the synapse?  What percent of the synapses are rewired, say, in a day? The motivation behind my question is to understand, how volatile is the brain and how fast does it change. For example, are my distant memories of childhood written in the synapses that never changed since their creation or have they been already rewritten several times?  I understand that the answer depends on the species, brain area and type of activity. Ideally it would be , say, human broca's area in normal lifestyle. But I'll be happy to know answers for other circumstances as well. "
1779,Name needed for psychological practice which uses objects that represent humans [dolls/pictures/etc.] during patient treatment,"What is the name of practice/method (if such exists) where psychologist uses a doll (or any other form of human-being representation) for patient to talk to?  I believe I have seen it in a movie or had read in a book (not exactly sure)  My guess would be that it could be used for patients that feel more comfortable talking to not alive objects that have human form or that portrait a human-being but that cannot respond (subconscious security for a patient that an object will not be judgmental towards patients issues or something like that..)  P.S. If such practice/method exists, which implications it has for the patient?  Example:     [website]     Movie: What about Bob?      forward to 1:40   EDIT:  What I found:      ""Puppets allow a child to displace feelings from the significant   persons with whom they were originally connected. In doing so, puppets   offer physical and psychological safety that, in turn, invites greater   self expression.""

1780,Can creativity be taught?,"I have heard of classes that teach 'creativity'. To me, the whole concept is absurd. I approached a student of the aforementioned class and asked him why he chose to learn creativity. He stated that creativity is a process in which you learn the basics and the rules and then extrapolate it. I argued that real creativity is innate, and it depends on the surroundings of which you are a part.   And then a thought struck me: What if no one is 'naturally' creative? After birth, a baby knows only what he sees. Whatever a person knows has been absorbed from the surroundings in the form of opinions and experiences. On these lines, anybody can be creative, provided he is exposed to the 'correct' stimulus. Ideas and philosophies are personal interpretations of experiences and opinions. It wasn't our creativity as a race that has made us who we are today, but it was actually necessity that propelled our species forward. What else would possibly stimulate our creativity as a race other than our necessity as a species to survive?  In short, after an hour or so of arguments to and fro, my question: Can creativity be taught? I don't mean by giving a kid a crayon and telling him how to draw an apple. I mean creativity at its most absolute form. Can creativity be inherited? "
1781,How does syntax highlighting affect the learning of a new programming language?,"What impact does syntax highlighting have on students' progress in learning a new programming language?  I'm looking for studies along the lines of the following hypothetical experiment, which involves two groups of students: one group would code in an editor performing poor to no syntax highlighting of the language in question...    ...while the other group would code in an editor performing comparatively richer syntax highlighting.    Do you know of any such studies? Do you have otherwise relevant references? A quick Google search hasn't returned much...  "
1782,Does writing something on computer help memorize it?,"There is an interesting question on this site:  Does writing something down help memorize it?  Now my question is, does writing something on computer (i.e. using Word, Notepad, ...) help memorize it?  I usually learn by rewriting texts I read on computer. I never use copy-paste and always rewrite text myself and change it a little (acording to my needs, also I often translate it).     I use computer mainly because:   I can write faster on computer than on paper I am often lazy to find paper and I don't want to waste paper when I will probably throw it away 2 days later anyway (consider environment, please don't consider as a ""throw away exam"") It easier to edit text written on computer, can search within it, ...   So does the writing text on computer have the same advantages as writing down on paper?  Sub question: Does formatting of text have any influence on this? "
1783,Definitions of consciousness,"It seems to me that many people know for themselves some extraordinary things about consciousness but rare are the people that can provide a definition of it. I have never met two people providing the same definition of consciousness (I never talked with specialist of the field though but only to general and evolutionary biologists).  Is there any, globally accepting definition of consciousness in cognitive science? What is it? If not, can you please provide a little review of the definitions that are most often used in scientific research. Critics for each definitions are welcome. "
1784,"Why do humans/primates laugh/smile when they are happy, and not cry?",This might sound funny. But I have been wondering why do humans/primates laugh or smile when they are happy or find something funny?  Why don't they cry when they are happy and laugh/*smile* when they are sad? 
1785,Licensing when using the NEO-FFI instrument,"I would like to use the NEO-FFI instrument to measure the Big 5 psychological traits.  Is a license needed?   Are there any open, free, or public domain Big 5 tests that can be used for no (or minimal) cost? "
1786,What percentage of systematic data starts to be considered random,"There is a set of 100 different objects in a box. I pull out 99 of them randomly and place them on a table and ask a person to take a look, then I put all objects back into the box. After a short (5 minutes) interval I pull out another 99 random objects from the same box. The person is asked to say whenever an object is the same as it was before. If the missing object did not stand out from all others on the first go, then the person will answer that the objects are all the same.  How many objects should there be in the box and how many should be placed on a table, assuming there is an equal chance for every object to be pulled out, in order to trick the average person into thinking that all or almost all of the objects are different? What if the process is repeated 6 times, every 5 minutes, would it have any noticeable effect on the results? "
1787,Does law of attraction have psychological basis?,"A common claim in business and self-help seminars is that optimists are luckier.   Is it true that optimism leads to greater success in life? If so, what part of the brain support this so called ""higher self""? Basal ganglia?  "
1788,Split Brain Experiments on Animals,"I was wondering what would happen if you took a split brain person and stimulated the pleasure center of one hemisphere and the pain center of the other hemisphere in conjunction with an external stimulus... basically Pavlov's Dog but applied differently to the two halves of the brain of the same person.  Of course, such an experiment is highly cruel and unethical, so it's safe to assume it was never done on a human.  So, that got me wondering... we often experiment on animals when a procedure is too cruel to perform on humans (for better or worse, I'm not here to debate the ethics of animal experimentation).  Are there any split brain experiments that we've done on animals that we haven't tried on humans?  What have we learned from these experiments? "
1789,At what point in our life do we know what is real?,"Is ""real"" or reality defined during childhood, or as adults? Is this caused by age, or an event? "
1790,is it possible to think without language?,"I'm trying to fathom what it might be like for a person with aphasia and for one with agnosia. For a person with a visual agnosia I wonder this: if two unrecognizable objects are shown to them, and one is entirely within the background of the other, (say a fork on a cutting board) do these two objects mold into a single unrecognizable object or do they remain distinct unrecognizable objects? Or have I got it all wrong and they don't even ""see"" any object to speak of (regardless of how many or how they are positioned)? "
1791,Which ready-made programs can I use for running a preference-rating experiment?,"I'd like to run an experiment in which 64 images are presented (1 at a time) and participants rate their preference for the image on a slider scale, and I'm wondering what the best and cheapest way to do this is? Are there some good, free software programs that I can use? I've looked at things like SurveyMonkey and Question Pro but have not found something that seems to work. I don't have any coding knowledge so I'd prefer not to build it from scratch. "
1792,How do psychologists measure malicious behaviour?,"How do psychologists measure malicious behaviour in humans? Is there a definitive definition of what constitutes malicious behaviour? Are there varying scales of malicious behaviour? Is it possible do conduct experiments where malicious behaviour can be reliably observed? E.g. is cheating in a competition against other humans considered malicious? If malicious behaviour is much further along the spectrum than this example, then how can you conduct such an experiment that remains ethical? "
1793,Is practice more effective if spaced over time?,"Example: Say Alice and Bob want to learn to pride a bike. Alice practices for an hour every day. Bob practices for 7 hours each saturday. They are both getting the same amount of practice. Which of them learns faster?  This question is about spaced vs mass learning with respect, specifically, to procedural memory. I have been able to find some research on spaced repetition of flash card memorisation, but that is declarative memory, which might be different.  Have any studies been done on this, to determine the optimal duration/spacing of practice sessions for procedural learning? "
1794,How can someone asleep recognize a very brief sound?,"I have a snoring girlfriend. To interrupt her snoring, I make a sound similar to the very brief sound gas makes when opening a soda can or bottle (had a snoring brother, I know this technique works very well):  Here is a recording of the slound: [website]Sometimes her snoring wakes me up in the middle of the night (eg 3AM), so I make that sound, and she immediately wakes up and asks me from a very clear and aware voice: ""why did you just pshiiished me?"".  The sound I make is around 150 ms long, so I don't understand how someone who is being awakened and transitioning from sleep into consciousness would have the ability to distinctively recognize it.  Sometimes she'll even complain that I interrupted a nice dream she was in, which leads me to believe her sleep level was quite deep.  Can someone explain how a snoring/dreaming person can be awakened by a very brief sound (~ 150 ms long) and be able to distinctively recognize that sound as she transitions from sleep into consciousness? "
1795,How does a person know if he should seek treatment for depression since feeling moody is unavoidable?,"Life is not a bed of roses. All of us feel moody sometimes due to failures in life. This is perfectly normal. However, depression is abnormal.  How does a person know if he needs to seek treatment for depression, given that it is hard for him to distinguish whether the moody emotions are normal or abnormal? What are some symptoms to look out for? "
1796,What is the term for mimicking other behaviors?,"Say you see an actor playing someone insane, for the next few hours you feel kind of crazy too, especially if you are tired. You may feel annoyed and overwhelmed and mad for no reason, and kind of skwirmy for lack of better words.   Is this a recognized phenomenon? If so, what’s it called? "
1797,Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder and Oppositional Defiance Disorder,"In my answer to the question How does a person know if he should seek treatment for depression since feeling moody is unavoidable?, I have pointed out that DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) talks about a depressive disorder which is specific to 7-18 year olds only, with onset before 10 years old, and that is Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) (pp. 156-160).  I am not sure what I think about this, as it could be seen to be     oh, it’s just childhood/teenage tantrums which they will grow out of.   The other side to this being in the DSM is that it says in the note under criteria J on page 156, that DMDD cannot coexist with Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD) and individuals whose symptoms meet the criteria for both Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder and ODD should only be given the diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, however, doing this will indicate that the ODD aspects are a result of depression.  Page 159, under the heading of Oppositional defiant disorder, says that ""while symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typically do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,"" the mood symptoms of DMDD are relatively rare in children with ODD, and     while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is not the case.   Again, page 159 agrees with page 156 which says DMDD cannot coexist with ODD, and says:     Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only diagnosis of disruptive dysregulation disorder should be made.    Why can children not suffer from ODD and have depression because they feel there are oppression attempts against them?  References  American Psychiatric Association (2013).

1798,"In the dual process theory, how are the two systems interact with each other?","From my understanding about cognitive psychology and social psychology, the whole route from when people meet new unknown thing to when they making judgement about it is like this:   First people perceive information about the subject Then they memorize it When they meet new information, they recall the old one to organize, categorize or re-categorize existing knowledge, using logic This may create cognitive dissonance, and after a while they will solve this problem After that, the decision is formed, and their attitudes toward the subject is changed or strengthened   But each topics are fragmented and studied by their owns (perception &amp; attention, memory, knowledge representation, problem solving, attitude), not unifying in a single topic. For example, I notice a recurring theme in those topics, which I term as ""clearness"" and ""fadedness"":    I'm aware of the dual process theory and I think this is it. However I prefer the ""clearness – fadedness"" naming because it is more visual to me than ""system 1 – system 2"". Anyway, the problem is that in that page I don't see how the interactions between two systems are discussed in its own term. All I see is that it describes which specific process belong to which system, but when it needs to describe how the two systems interact with each other, specific models are used.   Here we see the convenience of the ""clearness – fadedness"" naming: we can say that a clearness fades away to become a fadedness, or a fadedness is unfaded and become a clearness. With ""system 1 – system 2"" we don't have the verbs and adjectives to describe it visually. Or perhaps because in our language there is no suitable word to describe the transformation of the systems, we don't have a model to describe its interactions?  Q: What are the interactions between each system, described in its own term? "
1799,Can anyone help me in choosing the suitable statistical analysis for my research?,"I have conducted an experimental research last week. The research topic is about Influence of Voice Assistants on Satisfaction, Attitude and Purchase Behaviour.  I had 46 participation in total and 23 participant for each control and experiment group. I add my conceptual framework in attachment. Each Factors has 4 items in the questionnaire. Questions were designed with 7 Point-Likert scale from 1 to 7 (ordinal).  Therefore which tests do i need to run to get best results? What is the best test for comparing control and experiment groups? T-Test? KS-Test? Or what is the best test to understand the correlations between variables? Factor Analysis? Regression Analysis?  Which steps do i need to follow first?   I'm a bit confused and I don't know where to start and which steps to follow? I'd appreciate your helps. Thanks.   "
1800,In which way does what you do right after class affect knowledge retention?,For example going for a walk in the woods right after the class sounds like a much better idea than to binge watch 5 Rick &amp; Morty episodes... but why?

Misophonia condition appears to have the following in common with PTSD; Anger , muscle tension, feeling of stress, loss of concentration in reaction to specific sounds   If a parent has misophonia does that increase the risk for the child to develop the condition as well?   Are there any known cases that both parent and child have misophonia ?  I can't find research on whether it has been confirmed if misophonia is a stream of PTSD.

1802,Is the Thatcher Face Illusion only limited to face recognition?,The so called Thatcher-Illusion has been documented not  only on humans but also in some monkeys.  However I can't find literature clearing out if this effect only applies to face-recognition.  What about familiar but non-face visual objects?  Perhaps in other cases the illusion has a different name?  It also seems related to the so called Picasso Problem.  Boutsen et al. (2006) seem to dig deeper but the paper has restricted access.  A proper answer should probably take into account the Fusiform face area

1804,What time range between 2 measures for test-retest reliability?,"How much time between 2 measurements is needed (at least / at most) to be called test-retest reliability?  Concrete casus: I am planning a meta-analysis on reliability of various loneliness scales. We want to determine beforehand what time frame between measures we will consider.  For instance, if the time between 2 measures is 2 years (such as in some longitudinal papers), we would consider this to be an indication of rank-order stability rather than test-retest reliability. This is a clear case, but what about 3 months? Or 1 month? Where should be the limit?  We are looking for good resources to base our decision on, and would be glad with any advise. "

1806,Are the raw scores of the NEO-PI-R normally distributed?,"Scoring the NEO-PI-R test results, as done for example in this document, involves converting an absolute score to a t-score. However, the conversion from absolute score to t-score (as can be seen in the document above and many others) seems to be always linear, i.e. [tex] for some values of [tex].   Since the t-scores are normally distributed, such a linear conversion only makes sense if the raw scores are also normally distributed (and not e.g. skew in either direction). In a limited sample that I took, I noticed that some of the facets are not normally distributed, in the sense that they have a significant amount of skewness.   Is this not a flaw in the scoring system? Or is there a (psychological) reason why we should not worry about this?  "
1807,Can autistic savants beat computers in known computationally hard problems?,"I'm always amazed when the exceptional mathematical skills of some autistic-savant people hit the news. My question is: can they outperform a computer in problems which we believe too hard for even a computer to solve?  Of course I haven't heard that any of them could. But I'm not sure if that's because they fundamentally can't or just no one bothered to ask them right questions.  For example if I ask:     Sir, can you tell me which two integer numbers I need to multiply to   get this huge number?      30885595542097078048530024995687899997024041750973847393477559897447391573878575270082706367139186728487020986897882643061865394945737579541836152606087611656762824124167456134969494253726435638776260179938318355412387553479545957502637298284851360234398784003069626709425392069487597686079260312041858526437519290451126677173785415389420329825181564012716675865830263098249948022195474980538298331998208615558178711421936619071576025836780179671597012185469978359221693046590783292027645460672357953215860301121762021294392026714148819989367905598842533973708083447918228276991009085148912935055442293643589623179239   Any chance they can ever come up with a correct answer?

1810,Has the perception of time changed over the last century? (e.g. 1960's vs. now),How does one measure perception of time? And has it changed over the last century? My gut feeling says that people in the 50s &amp; 60s found time to be passing slower compared to people in the present generation.  Time perception also changes as we grow older. For older people it seems to pass more quickly than for the young. 
1811,Does blood pressure increase during deliberate period of focus?,"Does blood pressure increase during a deliberate period of focus?  My reason for formulating this hypothesis is personal experience.  A simple example is when I work, sitting, at the PC. Let's say I work 25-45 minutes. When I am working my breathing becomes more shallow and it's always through my nose. Then, when I've completed the work I usually, automatically, take a deep breath ... as I physically feel relieved it's over even if it's work I enjoy. Then I notice I am a tiny bit lightheaded and, as I feel relieved, and I don't particularly want to get up, I usually have a desire to surf the web.  So, I'm wondering if concentration causes blood pressure to increase, which then quickly reduces when I'm done with my task, which is causing this feeling I am describing as lightheadedness. Alternatively is the blood pressure change related to the reduced breathing as I focus? ... is there such a thing? "

1813,Was one my subtest score on a test battery invalid?,"I realise this may be an unusual case, but long story short I managed to get hold of an intelligence testing software often used for job screening etc. Its called the MAB-II its modelled after the WAIS. Anyway on one of the subtests, which is like a mix between digit symbol coding and symbol search where you are given symbols and have to match a group of symbols with a group of numbers (multiple choice group of 5 numbers). However, when doing the test I did not realise that the multiple choice group of numbers had to be in order, thus getting most of them wrong. I noticed this when there were about 3 min left in the test and decided to abort that subtest. Presumably this invalidates my subtest score? Would the best option be to retest and include that in the fsiq calculation?  "
1814,What happened to self-administered aversion therapy (with a rubber band in particular)?,"In the 1970s a great new use for the rubber band was discovered: self-administered aversion therapy. It didn't go so well in some cases, like for ""obsessoinal thinking"", the outcome being the opposite of the one intended.  The first paper discusses two cases: one of hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and one of... homosexual ideation. Initial success but relapse and discontinued treatment are reported in the first case (hair pulling), but claimed ""cure"" in the second case. The second paper (with two negative results) discusses a case of paranoid schizophrenia and one of sexual fantasies including cheating on spouse and homosexual acts. I think most mental health professionals today would see these cases (except the hair pulling case perhaps) as inappropriate for aversion therapy, and some for any therapy (homosexual fantasies in particular).  Did self-administered aversion therapy (with rubber band or otherwise) prove ineffective in general? Or did it find some niche where it is considered successful nowadays? "
1815,What is the consequences to be a person who works in theory of science?,"this question rises into my head this day. First I read the comment by @mikeazo he says     Do you learn best by reading or doing? That will make a difference.   Also, today I had a class in cryptanalysis so we were doing a lot of computation in class during two hours (solving equations in order to find key of a cipher given ciphertext and plaintext). In the class I noticed that there are two types of students: faster and slower. I noticed that slower-people related to theory-people and faster-people to ""non-theory people"".   to define difference between theory and non-theory. Usually in science we have two types of people: theoretical people and experimental people. For example: in physics you can work in theory without doing experimental things or you can work in experimental without doing theory. Usually theory related to mathematics; since the language of science is mathematics. Now, in mathematics we have people who do ""computation faster"" like they solve puzzles quickly or they are very smart at games or multiply tens of digits without calculator, etc. While the other part, the theory-people, they analyze physical things to have a mathematical model and expect future results based on these models so if models doesn't work (such as no solution for the model under some conditions) then we say this result cannot happen in future under some conditions, etc.   From this point-of-view, I'm really interested to see whether is there any survey or research paper about ""what is the consequences to be a theory-people or non-theory-people?"" For example: I remember Michael Sipser says in his book of ""Introduction to Theory of Computation"", ""theory is good because it expands your minds"". Now, if someone is doing theory, then he expands his imagination and the way of thinking to things, but how about consequences? it seems to me for the example I had today in class that ""theory people are slower to do normal jobs, even though they understand it"". Is there any research papers about this issue! I would be happy to hear from this site anything related to this topic.    "
1816,Does a comparable metaphor exist for cognition that exists for slow & fast twitch muscle fibers?,"Skeletal muscles have slow and fast twitch fibers that differ in their rate of fatigue. Is there an analogue in the subject of cognition?  For example I might be very quick at doing coding but very slow at arithmetic. Also I might be fast at a mental task but tire quickly. What is the study of this phenomenon called?  Edit  It was suggested to me in a comment that the phenomenon of facilitation shows similar behavior.   Also mentioned in the comments is      system 1 ""intuition"" vs system 2 ""calculation""   I would select it as an answer if it wasn't a comment. "
1817,"Can drugs cause a psychosis, or only unlock it?","There have been many reports, that recreational drug use can cause psychosis. Some cannabis users report experiencing psychosis (sometimes permanent) immediately after use. Some methamphetamine users also report psychosis symptoms, like hearing voices, which are also sometimes permanent.  A lot of people, who like to defend cannabis (or even methamphetamine) like to argue that cannabis is unable to cause psychosis, it can only trigger or unlock it.  Presumably, there already was something wrong with this person and cannabis only unlocked the problem, but it was going to be unlocked eventually by something anyway.  Is there any difference between ""unlocking"" and ""causing"" a psychosis?  Is it true, that you can have a ""sleeping psychosis"", which is just waiting for a disturbance to present itself?  Is it simply a case of genetic predisposition, which people wrongly equate with having ""sleeping psychosis""?  I am aware about the controversy regarding schizophrenia and cannabis, I am mainly talking about psychosis.   "
1818,How to analyze reaction choice experiments?,"What are the state-of-the-art approaches to analyze reaction choice experiments?  Example of a reaction choice trial:   Fixation cross (randomized length between 500 and 1500ms) Choice stimulus: Indicates to press left or right button (200ms) Response: Which and if one of the two buttons is pressed (max 1000ms after stimulus onset)   This procedure produces the following types of data:   Response times, of   correct responses incorrect responses both   Correctness of responses Omitted responses   What are valid ways to analyze these interdependent yet disjunct types of results? Ideally including references to examples. "
1819,Proportion of covert narcissists (and their structure),"Another fairly frequent sub-topic in the popsci press (besides correlation with sadism) in relation to narcissism is covert narcissism. To some extent that article confuses the covert aspect/presentation with the better studied ""vulnerable"" narcissism, but this can probably be forgiven because the DSM-IV itself wasn't terribly clear on this, although the DSM-5 makes more of an effort to distinguish between the two dimensions. (And of course calling it ""covert"" makes it sound much more ominous, so it makes better click-bait, even if you're mostly talking about ""vulnerable"" narcissism.)  Of course, any studies of anything covert are probably going to underestimate it if the subjects are really good at covering it, but nonetheless, just what percentage of narcissists are generally known to be of this kind? Furthermore, is there a different mixture of vulnerable/grandiose in the covert group vs the overt one? I'm hoping some empirical studies exist on this. "
1820,Does wealth cause (or correlates with) narcissism?,"In the mental health field, narcissism is viewed as personality trait/disorder, which suggests little changes during the life of the subject.  Nevertheless, one mass media article (based on a book) is titled The age of entitlement: how wealth breeds narcissism, and claims that rich people are more inclined than the poor to engage in quite a number of anti-social behaviors from violating traffic rules to plain stealing. (At least as far traffic violations are concerned, the rich can usually afford the fines more easily, and even if they have their license suspended, can better afford to pay someone else to drive them.) Another indicator was that the rich tended to draw themselves as bigger circles in relation to the world. (But if you think of yourself mainly in terms of net worth, then perhaps that's not surprising or unjustified.)  Most of this was was based on the research of Paul Piff by the way. And at least one of his studies really does suggest causality, it's not a matter of him being misinterpreted by the press:    Is there a categorical confusion here in lumping these behaviors with narcissism? Or is it really the case that the richer do these because they are more narcissistic? Or perhaps the rich narcissists are more overt and the poorer narcissists more covert? Are there experimental studies that try to separate these concerns? "
1821,Representations of negated propositions,"The following question is quite hypothetical, and just to get an idea.  Assume any model of how positive propositions [tex] are actively (opposed to synaptically) represented in a neural network, e.g. ""the cat sat on the mat"". Presumably, this will be by some kind of firing of some neurons or neuron assemblies.  I wonder how the corresponding negative proposition [tex] might be represented, e.g. ""the cat sat not on the mat"". Will there be an extra NOT-neuron firing? Will the same neurons fire in NOT-mode? Will the cat sit on a NON-mat? Or completely different. Or are such propositions not represented at all, i.e. we can only ""think positively"", and only report verbally, that we do or did not think that [tex] (which would be some kind of a meta-report)?  Which proposals are around for the representation of negated propositions? "
1822,Causality studies between porn use and masturbation frequency?,"Research into purported porn addiction (which goes by many names, PPU = problematic porn use being one) identified strong correlation between porn use and frequency of masturbation. For instance:    Is there any research exploring causality between these two? In other words, do people who watch more porn do so because they want to mastubate more often, or is it the other way around, i.e. watching more porn turns people on so they masturabate more often? (Or in more proposed-pathological terms, is porn addiction just a banal version of hypersexuality or is it an addiction on its own causing hypersexuality?) "
1823,Predator/prey-like simulations for dark tetrad traits?,"Is there research attempting to model &amp; simulate the spread of ""negative genes"" (and by this I mean just the phenotypic effect thereof) like the dark tetrad traits in a human population? For background, Lotka–Volterra equations have been widely used for predator-prey simulations and so forth. However, in a human population, you'd probably need something more sophisticated.  Off the top of my head, narcissism and psychopathy are high-risk-high-reward evolutionary strategies: maybe you end up king (getting elected president being too recent evolution-wise), or maybe you end up a serial killer (and eventually caught/killed) or just shunned/banished as a mere egotist. Risk sensitivity alone has been studied in this respect:     We observe that risk aversion only evolves when the gamble is a rare event that has a large impact on the individual's fitness. As such, we suggest that rare, high-risk, high-payoff events such as mating and mate competition could have driven the evolution of risk averse behavior in humans living in small groups.   However, a pauper seldom ended up king. Also, it is known that the mostly human ability to hoard resources/prey can have a dramatic impact on predator-prey simulations, making resource/prey extinction possible for instance. (I guess something might need to be said about scatter hoarding in animals; the substantial difference is that inherited socio-economics status [SES] has no known animal equivalent, methinks.)  So, if something more specific wasn't studied, did someone study risk aversion in conjunction with inheritable SES in an evolutionary game/simulation? "
1824,Are inhibitory synapses governed by different chemicals than excitatory synapses?,"If a neuron has both excitatory and inhibitory chemical synapses providing it with input, is it true in all organisms that the chemicals that cause the inhibition are distinct from those that cause the excitation?  Related question: What is &quot;synaptic polarity&quot; in a chemical synapse? "
1825,What did Freud intend as the referent of 'Das Es' (Latin: 'id')? Why didn't he name with the referent?,"Wikipedia states:     The terms ""id"", ""ego"", and ""super-ego"" are not Freud's own. They are latinisations by his translator James Strachey. Freud himself wrote of ""das Es"",[5] ""das Ich"",[19] and ""das Über-Ich""[28]—respectively, ""the It"", ""the I"", and ""the Over-I"" (or ""I above""); thus to the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. [...]    What's the referent of the German pronoun 'Es'?  Why didn't Freud name (the concept known as ⟨Es⟩) with the referent itself instead? I.e., wouldn't naming ⟨Es⟩ as 'Instinkt' to mean 'instinctual drive' make the term easier to understand and more self-explanatory?   "
1826,Academic performance,"Is there any literature suggesting a relationship between academic performance and cognitive function?  I'm trying to find something that suggests which cognitive functions/domains are typically utilized when taking school exams. Obviously this will depend heavily on the nature of the exam, but are there any studies that have looked at this generally?  For example, do people that perform better on exams also perform better on computer based tasks assessing working memory, or ignoring visual distractors etc? Hence allowing you to narrow down the specific set of cognitive functions associated with taking an exam?  EDIT: by cognitive function, I'm referring to things like working memory, sustained attention, executive function, spatial processing. Not so much IQ or any measures of intelligence "
1827,"How might the ""Imposter Syndrome"" typology be reconciled with the robustness of the ""self-serving bias""?","TL;DR What on Earth is going on in someone's head to invert a cognitive bias that is robustly observed in people who are psychologically healthy (Cohen's d = 1.28) and still present in depression (Cohen's d = 0.21)? I am looking to reconcile the self-serving bias with either the Imposter Syndrome or mental illness.   ""Some people"", as the familiar trope notes, “are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple.” While we are all familiar with individuals who are thoroughly unable to accurately attribute the true cause of their achievements, rarely do we ever consider the possibility that we too are guilty of the self-serving bias.  The self-serving bias appears to be both universal and robust. Moreover, an attenuated bias is associated with mental illness:    Mezulis, A. H., Abramson, L. Y., Hyde, J. S., &amp; Hankin, B. L. (2004). Is  There a Universal Positivity Bias in Attributions? A Meta-Analytic    Review of Individual, Developmental, and Cultural Differences in the  Self-Serving Attributional Bias. Psychological Bulletin, 130(5), 711–747.  [website]Others, on the other hand, seem to be afflicted with an attribution bias antipodal to the self-serving bias. These people seem to completely unable  to internalise their achievements as truly their own, and appear to dismissively attribute their successes to external factors most people do for everyone but themselves -- the Imposter Syndrome.   Clance and Imes (1978) first characterised the Imposter Syndrome typology among their high-achieving female patients:    Clance, P. R., &amp; Imes, S. A. (1978). The imposter phenomenon in high  achieving women: Dynamics and therapeutic intervention. Psychotherapy:  Theory, Research &amp; Practice, 15(3), 241–247. [website]So, how can we reconcile what seem to be two antipodal phenomena?  From a very cursory consideration of things, it seems that for individuals with the Imposter Syndrome, the self-serving bias is either greatly attenuated, or dare I say, inverted. For that to occur, we might presume two things:   They have crushingly low self-efficacy and/or;  They are processing information in an aberrant manner.    So, how does social, cognitive, or abnormal psychology reconcile the self-serving bias with the Imposter Syndrome? Is the Imposter Syndrome even a thing or simply a cognitive style that occurs among people with depression? If so, what are their similarities, and what are their departures? In other words, is the phenomenology of someone with severe depression effectively the same as someone with the Imposter Syndrome?  Where possible, please include references. "
1828,How likely is it that rate-of-test-taking impacts on WM tests?,"Rate-of-test-taking (also known as r9) is one of the main subsets of processing speed, so is tested via e.g. the symbol digit coding task. I believe it is affected by e.g. depression.  How likely is it that rate-of-test-taking impacts on WM tests, the digit span test etc,?  It was pointed out in this answer that tests of WM should create a ""bottleneck"" so that other cognitive processes are implicated less. What about r9? "
1829,By which neuronal mechanisms does music make us happy or sad?,"There are brain regions (X) that show stronger activation for joyful music, regions (Y) that show stronger activation for sad music, and regions (Z) that show similar activation for both.  Assuming that joyful or sad music activates similar brain regions as other tasks designed to induce a joyful or sad mood, we know more specifically:   Both joyful and sad music produce similar activation of the amygdala-hippocampal area, with activation extending into the parahippocampal gyrus, as well as activation of the prefrontal, temporal, and anterior cingulate cortices and the precuneus (regions Z). Joyful music produces stronger activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulate gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus, the cerebellum, and in the vicinity of the ventral medial frontal cortex (regions X).   On the other side, it has repeatedly been found that happy music is characterized by fast tempo and major mode, whereas sad music is typically played in slow tempo and minor mode.   Bringing these findings together the question arises     By which specific neuronal mechanisms does fast tempo and major mode   music activate more strongly brain regions X than regions Y? And vice   versa.   Is it by some kind of fine-tuned resonance (involving feedback) between the sensory input from the ears and the brain regions involved?   Are there specific theoretical (computational) models, and have they been tested?  How can - by these mechanisms - the subtle difference between a major and a minor third become so significant, both neuronally and emotionally?

1830,Desigining an online survey with two levels of randomisation,"I'm trying to create an online survey where the participant hears a series of randomly determined sound files and rates each of them on a likert scale.  We will have around 1000 participants, each hearing 10 randomly determined sounds, with the following condition:  The sound files each depend on two variables and there is one file for each combination: e.g. If the two variable can take the values [A, B, C] and [1, 2, 3] respectively then there would be 9 possible sound files: A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3.  I want each participant to hear an example of each variable exactly once. e.g. A2, C3, B1 and B2, A1, C3 are both valid series of sounds (no letters or numbers are repeated) but C1, C2, A3 and A3, C1, B3 are not valid series (a letter or number has been repeated).  [In my case I have 10 values of each random variable, 100 sound files].  I've tried Qualtrics and REDCap but cannot see how to do this sort of randomization. Is there an online survey creation tool that supports this functionality? or failing that, can anyone explain how to to this in Qualtics/REDCap?  [I originally asked this question I academia and was advised this was a more appropriate place to ask.] "
1831,Innateness of perceiving music as happy or sad,"From John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, book 2, chapter 9:     I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious   promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molyneux,   which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it   is this:—""Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his   touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal,   and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and   the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube   and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see:   quaere, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now   distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?""   Only recently a definite experimental answer has been given to this question (which is known as Molyneux's problem): ""No"" (Sinha et al, 2011).   My question goes into the same direction as Molyneux's but concerns audition and emotion, not vision. An answer to this question might give a hint to an answer to the question how it comes that we perceive music as happy or sad.     Suppose a man born deaf, and now adult, and taught to distinguish between happiness and sadness, so as to tell, when he felt one and   the other, which is happiness and which is sadness. Suppose then some happy and some sad music is played, and the deaf man be made to hear:   quaere, whether by his hearing, he could now   distinguish and tell which is the happy music, which the sad one?   I assume this question only makes sense when there is music that is somehow ""objectively"" perceived as happy or sad by healthy people (being cross-cultural universals). But this seems to be the case: In many cultures (including Asian and African) fast tempo and major mode music tends to be perceived as happy, and slow tempo and minor mode music tends to be perceived as sad (see Kleinen, 1994,  Fritz et al, 2009). So the above experiment is to be performed with prototypically happy (fast, major) and prototypically sad (slow, minor) music.  My question:      Have experiments &ndash; like Sinha's for vision &ndash; been performed for audition and emotion (with musical stimuli)? What was the result?

1832,Why are EEG markers usually sent over the parallel port?,"Usually, a study participant is viewing stimuli on a computer screen while their EEG is recorded through the hardware provided by a manufacturer. To later synchronize the EEG data to stimuli, an experimenter will send so-called 'markers' from the stimulation computer to the EEG hardware so that the markers are encoded in realtime together with the EEG data.  Why do most manufacturers use the old-fashioned parallel port for that?  I know, that the parallel port allows for a parallel transmission of up to 8 bits (i.e., 255 possible marker values and one '0' marker to indicate 'no marker') ... however, while that is a clear advantage, it comes at the cost of using a legacy port that is not available on modern computers.  Couldn't we just use a USB port to send data serially (in smaller bit packages) ... and then join these bits to a byte (8bits) to get the same number of possible markers? USB would in theory be fast enough to even compensate for the extra time needed to 'buffer' single bits and then encoding them as a byte.  Am I getting something wrong?  Why is the parallel port still so prevalent for this specific application (EEG)? "
1833,Do the feelings related to Transference always originate from parents?,"As I understand,      Transference is a phenomenon which is related to human behavior where humans unconsciously redirect/transfer their feelings about a subject in the past to apply it to a subject in the present.   Is this definition correct?  Does the subject in the past always have to be Parents? What did Freud say about this? "
1834,Long term effects of a high self monitor who voluntarily chooses a contradictory self-presentation,"Are there any cases or studies of a high self monitor who intuitively chooses to act ""by impulse"" in order to reform said impulse?   In other words when the HSM behaves as a low self monitor they selectively and willingly embrace a low self presentation in order to challenge (or embrace flaws) within their own pride, ego, or some other aspect of psychology.  Additional questions   What else can be said of this situation?  What other questions, or background is necessary to analyze this occurrence?  Is this behavior indicative of other problems worth investigating? (e.g. morally flawed premise for taking such action) What negative effects could there be on the ego and super-ego by behaving this way over long periods of time?    Edit  At a young age, this HSM may have discovered that behaving as a low-self-presentation allowed them to abdicate responsibility.  This was later corrected in adulthood when the subject decided to actively pursue accountability on past and present behavior... thus leading to overall character improvement.  "
1835,Do central pattern generators control musical performance?,"Are the sometimes very fast and complicated rhythmic movements and often long lasting patterns a musician performs while playing a piece of music generated by central pattern generators (in the sense of Wikipedia)?  I ask because I am astonished that intricate and fast rhythmic patterns are not mentioned in the article, but only basal and rather slow motions like locomotion, respiration, swallowing. Is it because other systems are responsible for the fast and complicated patterns observed in musical high-performance than central pattern generators? If so: which ones?  (Note, that heart beat isn't mentioned, neither. What does this mean?) "
1836,How much tablet time is bad for kids?,"In a Psychology Today blog we read:     When very small children get hooked on tablets and smartphones, says Dr. Aric Sigman, an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society and a Fellow of Britain’s Royal Society of Medicine, they can unintentionally cause permanent damage to their still-developing brains. Too much screen time too soon, he says, “is the very thing impeding the development of the abilities that parents are so eager to foster through the tablets. The ability to focus, to concentrate, to lend attention, to sense other people’s attitudes and communicate with them, to build a large vocabulary—all those abilities are harmed.”   Mkay, there's little doubt that if kids play some phone/tablet-based video game all day long, they'll miss on other activities (an obvious opportunity cost), but how much is too much? Are there studies quantifying this effect? And is there something specific about phone/tablet-based ""screen time"" that's particularly damaging? I mean besides the availability/portability factor, which is obvious.    A theory as to how an interactive time-waster is worse than a passive one has been proposed     many apps are designed to be stimulus-driven, with exciting audiovisual rewards for completing tasks. Experts call this the “I did it!” response, which triggers the reward pathway in the brain. Because of this, tablets and smartphones make for excellent pacifiers, particularly on long plane journeys and in restaurants. But while this can be helpful in the short term, it’s important for young children to be able to develop internal mechanisms of self-regulation, whether that’s learning without constant rewards or being able to sit patiently without constant digital stimulation.    But is there evidence that is actually more damaging to development than a more passive time-waster? Ok, maybe that makes it more potentially addictive... so there's potential to wasting more time like that. But if we controlled for time spent, is there any other difference?  And the end of the latter article seems to indicate that interactivity can cut both ways:     BedTime Math is one [opposite] example. The app delivers engaging maths story problems for parents and their children. It is one of the few tools that have been shown to make kids smarter; children who used the app even just once a week for a year improved their maths by more than a control group did. The impact was particularly strong for children whose parents were anxious about maths.   "
1837,Does dreaming cuts our sleeping hours?,"If I am dreaming a lot at night, how many effective hours am I sleeping at night? After dreaming heavily at night, when I wake up in the morning I feel sluggish as if I haven't slept properly.   Does dreaming cuts our sleeping hours? "
1838,How do I determine whether my EEG signal needs denoising?,"I recently start to work on sleep study. For my research i download sleep EEG data from physionet. The EEG data has 100 HZ sampling rate and was recorded from 2 bipolar EEG site.    When i start the preprocessing stage, i encounter a simple problem, how should i know if my signal has an artifact or noise?   It should be noted, based on nyquist theorem and my signal's sampling rate, the maximum frequency of my signal is 50 HZ, so i did not filter unnecessary EEG frequency. In general i only used a simple notch filter at 50 HZ, and used simple threshold method in order to remove the epochs that were grossly contaminated by muscle and/or eye movement artifacts.   Back to the main question, how should i know if i need to uses more complicated method for removing EMG or EOG artifact from my signal?   "
1839,Visual search: complexity of positive vs negative search tasks,"Thinking about experiments where participants perform visual search tasks, I remember hearing in a Cog Psych lecture that if the instructions of the task were of the form ""find the element that has property X"", the participants would accomplish the task faster and with greater ease than when the instructions were of the form ""find the element that does not have property Y"".   It was then discussed that this exemplifies one of the themes in cognitive psych: The cognitive processes handle positive information better than negative information. Is this positivity effect?  I wonder if there is something about the second task that is algorithmically more complex than the first. Would a computer show the same slow-down for these tasks? Anyone know of any research exploring this? "
1840,What factors improve mood and increase cognitive functioning when people wake up?,"I'm a software engineer doing some research in order to figure out if developing some applications are worth the effort. This work is applied to computational devices including mobile devices and even smart houses.  I would like to know when people wake up from sleep:   What environmental factors influence us the most? What factors, including sites and sounds, improve our mood? What factors stimulate cognitive activity?  Do such factors vary between people?  "
1841,Bayesian models of faking in selection and recruitment settings,"I'm doing some research looking at applying Bayesian models to faking personality tests in selection and recruitment.  I'm interested to know:   What existing work has applied Bayesian models to faking in selection and recruitment?  What studies have been done? What have they found? and what did a Bayesian perspective add to the analysis?   I'm interested in any application including   different selection instruments: i.e., not just personality tests (e.g., intelligence tests, interviews, etc.) different approaches: modelling the decision to fake, modelling datasets that have examined faking, implementing faking detection algorithms, etc.  "
1842,Does the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis apply to artificial (specifically programming) languages?,"As a computer programmer, I have an intuition that the idea ""language influences thought"" is very relevant to programmers and programming languages.    Is there any research that examines whether artificial languages influence thought? How can such a theory be expressed as a testable hypothesis?  "
1843,What is the term for judging based on a simulation of the same parameters on oneself,"Allow me to outline the observed process and three hypothetical examples below. For the sake of keeping the samples simple, I will ignore prior moral or religious convictions that a regular person would hold.  A person is confronted with an issue or approach to be judged. The person places themselves in the hypothetical situation and evaluates the implications for themselves according to their beliefs and convictions. The outcome of the evaluation determine the person's stance on the issue.  What is the term for this decision mechanism?  I figured ""empathy"" at first but that would require emotional transference with a real or hypothetical individual which is not given in this case. ""Reverse Projection"" came to mind as well, but it is a very loose fit and projection usually implies the unawareness of the person projecting while the process above is not influenced by the person's awareness.    Examples of mechanism in use:  Issue: Is killing good or bad?  Person:   If someone were to kill me, it would end my life which is bad. --> Killing is bad.  Issue: Should a government provide free healthcare financed by taxation to everyone without restriction?  Person A (history of health issues, low income job, insecure):   If I become sick again, I may not be able to afford the treatment myself. The added taxation will not concern my income bracket. The added security net thus increases chances of my survival at no or little expense to me. --> Yes, a government should provide free healthcare financed by taxation to everyone without restriction.  Person B (health freak, high income job, arrogant):   I take care of my health which is why I am not sick. The added taxation would take away from the money I make while providing no additional benefit to me. --> No, a government should not provide free healthcare financed by taxation to everyone without restriction.

1844,"What type of behaviour is showing, but withholding, a reward?","A specific example of what I mean is: when you go shopping at a supermarket with a loyalty card system, and you do not participate, the receipt say something along the lines of      If you had a loyalty card you would have earned 20 points.   My first impression was that this is some sort of punishment, i.e. because of your behaviour (not having a loyalty card) we're throwing these points that you earned away.  This is based on definition 1, for punishment, from the Penguin dictionary of psychology (2nd ed.):     The administration of some aversive stimulus contingent upon a particular behaviour.   Then I wondered if it was just negative reinforcement, because the message would go away if I signed up for the card.  This is based on definition 2, for negative reinforcement, from the same book:     Any event, stimulus or behaviour which, when its removal is made contingent upon a response, will increase the frequency or likelihood of that response.   Do either of these fit the bill? Compare that message with telling someone ""You could had have this cake, if only you had been a few minutes earlier. Now I will throw the cake in the bin.""  Is it possible to categorise this type of behaviour in behaviourism? "
1845,Are there emotions that only some people can feel?,"Presumably, there are emotions that almost any person can feel, such as happiness, sadness, guilt, and embarrassment.   But are there emotions that only a small fraction of the population can feel?  How might it be established that an uncommon emotion existed?  "
1846,What do within-subjects studies of job applicant personality test faking say about the covariance between developmental and job applicant scores?,"Some studies of faking personality tests in selection and recruitment have used a within-subject design. These studies involve administering a personality test in two conditions. One condition is assumed to measure honest responses (e.g., under honest instructions in the lab or for professional development purposes in an applied setting). A second condition is designed to elicit an authentic job applicant responses (e.g., role play instructions in the lab or a real-world job application in applied settings).   What has such research found regarding the structure of the covariance between scores in developmental and applicant conditions? I.e., what is the size of the correlation and what is the shape of the bivariate distribution (I think that bivariate normal is unlikely)? What is known about the distribution of difference scores (i.e., applicant minus developmental)?   I'd also be interested in learning how findings vary based on features of the test,  context,  design, and so on.  "

Is it possible to measure this moment and was it done already?  "
1848,Are there any applications of choice modelling to romantic relationships?,"Background: I was at a talk today where the presenter discussed a study that involved a administering a couple of questions asking participants which of two people they would prefer as a relationship partner. To simplify things a little bit, in one example participants were asked whether they would prefer a rich ugly partner or a poor attractive partner.  This got me interested in whether anyone had extended this idea to a comprehensive choice modelling study. I.e., get a large number of participants to compare pairs of possible partners with different characteristics and estimate the utility of different characteristics.  Question:   What if any journal articles have examined relationship partner preference using a choice modelling methodology? What were the main findings?  "
1849,Is this optical illusion the visual equivalent of binaural beats?,"The optical motional illusion shown below, makes your brain see some motion, where there is none.    In my opinion it's fascinating, although after a while you get a headache. It reminds me of binaural beats, where the brain simulates the difference tone, which is obviously not there. The way that these illusions work is obviously quite different than how binaural beats work, as stated in the comments.  Despite that, it's said that the beats stimulate your brain, so my questions are   What is the name of this optical illusion?     Akiyoshi Kitaoka studied these kind of optimized Fraser-Wilcox illusions.   Does it affect the brain in a similar way to binaural beats? I mean the overall effect, not the specific way how Fraser-Wilcox illusions or binaural beats enter your mind.   For those who liked the previous picture, here it is:   "
1850,Applications of computational learning theory in the cognitive sciences,"Computational learning theory (CoLT) is a branch of theoretical computer science associated with the mathematical analysis of machine learning. A lot of the early ideas of the field take inspiration from human learning. The field has developed into a very rigorous, mathematical, and precise science, but I have not seen it used much in the cognitive sciences directly. There is some indirect use through CoLT's interaction with statistics and machine learning algorithms (say, analyzing neural networks through VC-dimension).  Are there examples of rigorous uses/applications of CoLT to build theories in psychology, neuroscience, and/or cognitive science?    Notes:  The only two examples I am familiar with are:   Gold's theorem on the unlearnability in the limit of certain sets of languages, among them context-free ones. Ronald de Wolf's master's thesis on the impossibility to PAC-learn context-free languages.   The first made quiet a stir in the poverty-of-the-stimulus debate, and the second has been unnoticed by cognitive science.  I am interested in approaches of this flavor. I am relatively comfortable with CoLT as it is studied in mathematics, and am only interested (for this question) in approaches that have direct bearing on theories of human/animal cognition/learning, and not classic machine learning results. I am looking for general mathematical and asymptotic approaches, not the running of specific types of algorithms (be it neural-nets, bayesian, or otherwise) to simulate human performance as is typical in computational modeling in cogsci (which I am relatively familiar with).  I am not interested in arguments that try to trivially undercut the whole approach, even if they have empirical validity. For instance, the whole approach can be derailed by asserting that human brains are finite and thus asymptotic arguments are useless. This is the same as arguing that all of computational complexity theory is pointless because computers (and the whole universe, for that matter) are finite. It is a valid empirical argument, but boring from the point of view of theory building.  Related questions:   General mathematical frameworks of language acquisition since Gold on ling.SE What is the complexity class most closely associated with what the human mind can accomplish quickly? on cstheory.SE  "
1851,"Models of barriers to ""Flow"" (being in ""the zone"")","This Wikipedia article is an excellent overview to the concept of Flow.   The problem is, from personal experience, in one specific area, I think it's incomplete. To quote:     Schaffer (2013) proposed 7 flow conditions:         Knowing what to do   Knowing how to do it   Knowing how well you are doing   Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved)   High perceived challenges   High perceived skills   Freedom from distractions[22]      And there are times when I can check the above off but still be feeling unable to get in the zone. My best guess is the weak point is either:   distractions - it's a broad term, and feeling under pressure, even if completely self imposed, comes under that category.  Knowing how to do it. If there are several options, and you know how you might do each, but can't decide which might be best, it becomes an issue, even if there is no obvious difference.   Are there any alternative models which explore possible barriers in more detail? Or any concepts such supplement flow theory to give further preconditions for flow? Stating the obvious perhaps, nearly any aspect of a person's general state of mind can be a barrier. Stress, even on unrelated tasks, is an obvious one. Is that already coversed in the above model? It would hamper decision making (knowing how you're going to do it), even though you do know how to do it. Perhaps it also counts as a distraction?  One last thought: perhaps, checking off the above, but feeling unable to achieve flow is itself a sign of incorrect cognition, since one or more points have been incorrectly assessed. (Assuming the model is correct and complete). "
1852,What is the limit of human memory?,"I am currently a high school student and have grown curious at what the limitation of memory storage in the brain might be in humans.   Information is coded genetically and stored in the brain, but is there a limit to how much information a person can retain without forgetting?  In high school I have taken a broad courses in biology, chemistry, physics, calculus and more. I wonder if my desire to learn and keep moving forward will be hindered mentally by the intrinsic aspects of memory (if they do exist)? "
1853,What techniques are being used here to influence the subject to pick a certain outcome?,"The question is about this video.   Summary of the Video: (can skip if you watched it)  The only audio is ""elevator music."" There is a man who communicates only with written orange signs. He asks the viewers to quickly perform some easy arithmetic calculations, and he shows the answer to each one after a few seconds:  [tex]  [tex]  [tex]  Then, he asks the viewer to quickly pick a number between [tex] and [tex]. At this point, I suddenly felt a sense of urgency, and rapidly picked [tex]; it was the only number I could think of in that second. Of course at the end of the video, the man guessed that the subject picked [tex].   Question:  How does this video influence the viewer to pick [tex]? More generally, what techniques do these types of videos employ to try to manipulate the subject into chosing a certain outcome?    I tried to look for certain patterns in the calculations and I found a diagonal symmetry, but I'm not sure if it's relevant:   [tex]  [tex]  [tex]  I've also noticed that the average of the [tex] results is [tex] "
1854,Reading and understanding difficult material,"I am not an university graduate but I have a passion for learning. I want to learn computer science and I keep on searching some good reference material. Recently I found some lecture notes on TOC of a well known teacher although he has explained things in detail but I am having hard time to grasp the material. One of the reason being is that they assume that you have a good mathematical foundation and other is you have the TA and professor to help when needed.  Now, for the first reason I have a good mathematical background but sometimes it may not suffice to the expectation. Second, I am a self learner hence I don't have the luxury to clear my doubts and ask questions.  What I am doing is try to study the material normally 2-3 pages and re-read it until it makes sense or I get frustrated, next day I try to feel positive and try again, I am making progress but it feels slow.  The questions are:   I will be able to change my brain's wiring by such constant effort? How to judge that I know the material? by doing exercises? but I don't have solution? How to be motivated in such situations?  "
1855,Verbal reasoning development,How would one go about improving their verbal reasoning ability? Are there any specific exercises a person can practise to develop their verbal reasoning skillset? 
1856,Can PTSD be mild? Do the traumas have to be of a certain kind?,"As far as I know, PTSD was first used as a broader label for symptoms associated with so-called shell-shock, and has been diagnosed for symptoms of a milder nature.  But is there a lower limit to the point at which PTSD can be diagnosed? For example, is it possible to have such a mild form of PTSD that it does not interfere with normal functioning, but exhibits the same features?  The reason I ask, is I live in the UK where the National Health System (NHS) is increasingly struggling with funding. Their website on PTSD seems to only state the most extreme of traumatic events as possible causes. In short, I think it is to get out of giving help to all but the absolute worst cases. Hospitals and many mental health services have large burdens and turn many seeking help away.  If someone where to suggest they have PTSD, I feel that with literature such as the above, it belittles anyone experiencing ""mild"" events such as domestic abuse, which barely fits into their categories. Not only might they not get treated, but experience or perceive scorn.  If one were to seek help for PTSD and have to justify the help needed, regardless of the cause, how might it be done? Could the symptoms be misdiagnosed as, for example, regular stress, or anxiety, and would treatment for those be different to that required to help with PTSD? "
1857,When does Just World Theory apply?,"Can someone explain how Just World Theory applies in real life? I have learned about it from textbooks but have trouble believing parts of it. Does it always apply? For example does it apply to individual situations like if you see someone get hit by a car you don’t normally think “that person must have deserved it” but is it more for an overall lifestyle for example if someone works a minimum wage job it would be “this person has a lazy personality”. I’m basically asking does Just World Theory have any qualifications for when it applies?  I guess psychology isn't like this, but does the Just World Theory apply to everyone in every situation all the time, or what? "
1858,How does people's sense of right and wrong affect their behavior?,"In general, people tend to simply max out their profit.  In the process to max out their profit, humans have this peculiar cognitive function, called sense of morality.  We have no idea how it evolve but it seems to have some function and affect their behaviors. Somehow.  I want to know how this strange cognitive function affect humans behavior?  For example, most of us don't just grab fried chicken and run away. We sense that it's politically incorrect and not profitable. However, some may think it's just wrong and don't do it anyway without thinking if it's profitable or not. Or do they?  It seems that people are more willing to negotiate if they think those who pressure them have earned their profit ""rightfully"". People are more likely to condemn if they think what others do is wrong.  But that seems to be a very amateur observation.  When we see someone put gun on someone's head, we are more likely to think, we should punish this robber rather than thinking what does he want. On the other hand, people are more willing to pay tax that goes to welfare recipients. That's probably because we think that robbing is wrong, while voting for welfare is right.  In general, how does our sense of right and wrong affect our behavior and how does that lead to our individual profit or our selfish genes?  The 2 things I have in mind is   People tend to do what's right In conflict, people tend to side with those they think is right. For example, if a thief is beaten up to death, conservatives would side with those who protect their properties while liberals would side with the thieves.  "
1859,Do we have technology to ethically measure the changes of interstitial space in sleeping humans?,"Lulu Xie et al write in their paper Sleep Drives Metabolite Clearance from the Adult Brain:     Using real-time assessments of tetramethylammonium diffusion and two-photon imaging in live mice, we show that natural sleep or anesthesia are associated with a 60% increase in the interstitial space   Do we have technology to do the similar measurements in humans and not only in mice? Have those measurements been done? "
1860,Post-coital effects on human cognition,I often see couples fight after sex. Why is this? Is there an actual biological effects (release of endorphins or other hormones) post-coitus (or post-orgasm) that would increase irritability in an individual?  I am trying to understand how it works and what neurons / recipes are involved in such experiences. 
1861,Myer Brigg type for Ni > Ti > Fi > Se,"I'm reading about Myer Briggs personality types and Jung cognitive functions for the first time.   Based on my understanding, it seems like each of the 16 MB personality profiles attempt to map to some combination of the 8 Jung cognitive functions.  But I can't seem to find an MB profile that maps to the following Jung cognitive function combination   Primary function - Introverted Intuition Auxillary function - Introverted Thinking Tertiary function - Introverted Feeling Inferior function - Extroverted Sensing   Is it because the Jung cognitive function combination I stated is a theoretically and/or practically impossible?  If so, why is that the case? "
1862,What does the visual feed from the retina look like before it is processed by the visual cortex?,"I was recently at the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception, where I saw a keynote on visual attention. The speaker (Laurent Itti) showed an animation that blew my mind. It showed a video of fish swimming in the ocean, and next to it, the same video as ""seen"" by the retina. The latter was upside down and distorted beyond recognition except at the fovea, which darted around to salient locations in the video. I had heard it explained before that ""your eye doesn't 'see' images, your brain reconstructs them,"" but I had never before seen it illustrated so well.  I want to find a similar animation to show friends and students, but I'm having trouble finding anything. Searches yield mostly diagrams of light passing through the eye or something similar. The only thing I've found that shows what an image actually looks like when it reaches the retina is this picture.  It's a nice start, but I'd really like an animation, like a video or GIF, to show how the brain stitches together the retinal images at each fixation into what seems like a coherent image/video.  Can you help me find such an animation? Something that shows what a raw visual feed actually looks like? "
1863,Effects of aerobic vs. resistance training on cognition,"The beneficial effects of exercise are well documented on cognitive ability (1, 2) and reducing cognitive decline (1). However, has the type of exercise ever been analysed?  In healthy adults, is there a difference on the effects of aerobic (running) and resistance training (lifting weights) on cognitive ability? "
1864,Thinking with organs/systems other than the brain,"Neurohormones are produced in many different bodily systems other than the brain--skin, intestines, stomach, etc. Has there been any research suggesting whether or not some people might actually perform cognitive functions normally associated only with the brain (like processing sensory input to make complex decisions) with parts of their body other than their brain?   For example, crows have demonstrated they are capable of complex problem solving, even though they do not have a cerebral cortex. Scientists now believe crows use their telencephalon to perform complex reasoning tasks.  Thus, crows use a part of their physiology not previously associated with complex reasoning for complex reasoning.  So, to extend the idea even further, could humans also be using organs or systems to handle processes usually presumed to be handled only by the brain?   Since so many bodily systems produce neurohormones, they seem like likely possible candidates.  Has any research been done to test this proposition? "
1865,"Scientific way to prove you are ambidextrous, right handed or left handed?","I grew up in a country where my grandmother's generation used to believe that left handed were related with the Devil, so I know many friends that have been ""corrected"" when kids and now they are right handed.  Is there a scientific way to find out if you are in truth right handed or if you were corrected?   Assuming you were originally left handed but you were grown as right handed, does that makes you a non-natural ambidextrous?  "
1866,Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity interpretation,"A paper I'm looking at titled ""Synaptic Modifications in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons: Dependence on Spike Timing, Synaptic Strength, and Postsynaptic Cell Type"" (can be found here) showed a relationship between spike timing and LTP/LTD. However, I'm having a bit of difficulty understanding what Figure 7 shows:    Since this photo I've seen published in multiple textbooks and reviews, it seems like a very important figure to understand what is going on. According to what they wrote in the introduction:  ""Our results showed that postsynaptic spiking that peaked within a time window of 20 msec after synaptic activation resulted in LTP, whereas spiking within a window of 20 msec before synaptic activation led to LTD""  My understanding is that you have two neurons, a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic neuron and then based on their relative firing timings, that tells you whether or not there is an increase or decrease in the synaptic weight provided that the timings are close enough together. What confuses me as a non-biologist is how a postsynaptic spike could occur before the presynaptic spike does? I would think the only way a postsynaptic spike occurs is when the presynaptic neuron fires into the postsynaptic one. And then this time interval... is it from when the timing of the last presynaptic spike to the first spike of the postsynaptic one? Or from the first presynaptic spike since you would need multiple of them to induce a spike from the postsynaptic one? I'd mainly like to ask for more clarity over how to interpret what is happening. "
1867,Does sensory deprivation affect cognitive abilities?,"I am wondering if the loss of vision or hearing early in life (say, before the age of 14 years) affects cognitive abilities later in life? I would imagine that as a group, early-blind or early-deaf people may tend to receive less education than the average healthy individual with normal sight and hearing skills? Given that most IQ tests rely on education-related subjects, would it be fair to conclude that sensory-deprived people, on average, may have lesser IQ, not because of their cognitive abilities per se, but because they tend to receive less education?    "
1868,Is there a way to have strangers tag my images?,"I would have liked to know what thoughts people get from various images, so that I could trigger targeted thought patterns with images.    An easy way to do this would be if I could find an online service that lets strangers ""tag"" my images with their own keywords. Especially if I could somehow count votes for each keyword/tag.  Does there exist any kind of service like this? Or does anyone know of a similar approach I could use? "
1869,Can a depressed person experience the sense of happiness?,"Has anyone every truly lost their sense of happiness or maybe love? I realize a negative condition like depression can make it seem like it is only possible for one to be sad.  Is it possible for depressed people to evoke the emotion of happiness within themselves?   For example, can depressed people recall the feeling of happiness by remembering a time when they were happy or thinking of something they enjoy?  My understanding is that if happiness can be evoked even once then they haven't lost the sense of it and maybe they can be trained to evoke it whenever by focusing on what is positive instead of what is negative. Much harder than it sounds I realize, you have to first believe you CAN be happy but I guess I am just asking if anyone lost happiness permanently, maybe through brain damage, or was born without it. "
1870,What is the opposite of an insult for the purposes of triggering lasting positive affect?,"Over the centuries, western cultures have developed dozens of swear words, insults and curse words that are intended to trigger acute negative affect in the recipient. If one particular word does not work, the insulter would typically cycle through the words until he/she finds the one that ""strikes a chord"" and causes the intended level of emotional distress.  What interests me is that the right insult quickly triggers emotional pain. Unless a person knows how to mitigate the effect, the negative emotion is likely to stay with the person for minutes to hours.  This makes me ask - What are there opposite of insults for the purposes of triggering positive emotion that lingers on afterwards?   Is there some kind of word or action that instantly triggers positive emotions of equal magnitude? Terms like praise come to mind, but I'm not sure praise is as powerful as insults. "
1871,Why is chess considered special for educating a mindful person?,"I can find countless quotes like this     In many countries chess is incorporated into the scholastic   curriculum. Countless researchers and studies have shown over the   years that chess does indeed strengthen a child's mental clarity,   fortitude, stability, and overall health. In this technologically   driven world, chess helps aid in the synthesis and growth of certain   areas in the brain and mind where many children can benefit as they   grow older from the game. ""It's all condensed in a playful manner in a   game format and it's extremely fascinating because first of all I'm in   control of my own destiny, I'm in charge. You have to be responsible   for your actions, you make a move, you had better think ahead about   what's going to happen, not after it happens, because then it's too   late. Chess teaches discipline from a very early age. It teaches you   to have a plan and to plan ahead. If you do that, you'll be rewarded   These beilefs are so strong that even got a recognition in Wikipedia.  Here is another quote to highlight the gist of my question     Chess has a unique and strong brand attribute, in that it is generally   perceived that playing chess and being smart are connected.   I do not ask if chess really improve the mental performance. I am asking Why are they considered unique/unmatched in this respect? Almost any game demands strengthening your intellect for careful planning of your moves. Why other games are less useful? "
1872,Are there psychiatric medications that have an anti-tolerance effect?,Patients usually develop tolerance to their psychiatric medications when used over a long period of time. This is because of how the brain gets used to the dosage in order to reach equilibrium again. Are there any that have an anti-tolerance effect? Which means over time you would need less and less of the medication to get the same effect? 
1873,How to recognize people with high need for cognition?,"In my own little study I am trying to describe the personalities of different persons I know personally, by adding traits to them.   Among other traits, I am looking for those who have a high need for cognition ([website]My challenge is: Those 3 people that I know have high NFC are all introverts, who don't tell others much of their thoughts. This means you need to know them very well or for a long time in order to recognize their NFC. This again implies that I don't really know for sure if anyone else I know have high NFC....  This makes me question 2 things:   Is there any correlation between NFC and extraversion? Is there any way to recognize or measure people on NFC, without asking them questions? Maybe some kind of typical behavior or attitude for these people?  "
1874,"fMRI images: In-plane resolution, slice thickness","I have a set of fMRI images (.nii.gz). Now I want to infer the in-plane resolution and the slice thickness. Can this information and perhaps additional information be retrieved with FSL or Matlab? And yes, how?  Or can I calculate it somehow? "
1875,Classical conditioning paradigm for hippocampal learning,"I wanted to know what a suitable classical conditioning experiment would be to analyze learning and memory capabilities in rodent models with respect to hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP).  For example, I want to subject the animal to conditioning and test the behavioral readout at a certain time point after conditioning. Many , like fear conditioning experiments, are mostly attributed to amygdala processes.  I wish to know some classical conditioning task where I can understand primarily hippocampal processes.  Also is there a way to monitor hippocampal CA1-CA3 firing pattern after the training period or during the training ?  That is, I want to check if LTP will sustain after the training period or is there is any increased sustenance of LTP post training.  But if I am to do this electrophysiological experiment in hippocampal brain slices, how will I incorporate the conditioned and unconditioned aspect to this ? "
1876,Does Big 5 measure preferences for physical activity?,"While working on my amateur studies on personality differences, I use both Big 5 and MBTI to map traits. Using the MBTI theories I can fairly easy recognize the ""Sensing"" personalities, those who prefer experience and physical activities above philosophy and creativity.   Trying to map MBTI to Big 5 I suddenly realised I have no idea how the Sensing trait correlates with Big 5 traits. So my question is: Do these preferences show in Big 5? If so, where?  For a quick description on Sensing personalities, see [website]"
1877,Are brain sub-divisions based off embryonic development used when describing mature brains?,"Are the terms for brain divisions based off of embryonic development (e.g. prosencephalon, diencephalon) used for mature brain divisions? (e.g. forebrain, interbrain). For example, would it be wrong to say that the cortex of an adult human a part of their ""prosencephalon""/""telencephalon""? I've seen texts refer to the ""telencephalon"" of an adult brain, though it has mostly been in a developmental context--and from my experience I haven't seen it explicitly stated when to use either term so I'm not fully sure if they're synonymous.  "
1878,Does being read to improve reading speed?,"So my girlfriend is not what you would call a fast reader. She understands completely what she reads, but she reads rather slowly. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and help her out with this, but the only two things I can think of that would help are getting her to read a lot and maybe being read to. I know in my personal experience that being read to helped to improve my reading speed but I may just be an outlier. I guess what I'm trying to say is this: ""is being read to actually something that improves reading speed?"" and ""other than the aforementioned methods, are there other ways to improve reading speed?"" "
1879,What benefit is there to playing highly repetitive games?,"I quite enjoy playing games which requires many repetitions of the level in order to get right. These games are often constant-speed scrolling obstacle-course type games where the player must navigate obstacles correctly to finish the level. Often many of repetitions of the level are necessary. For example, geometry dash (not affiliated with them at all, I promise!).  I often wonder if there are any benefits to playing these games. I know that the repetitive nature creates neural pathways in the brain, but I don't think this newly developed ability is going to be used outside of one game in particular.   A friend of mine mentioned that perhaps these games would improve neuroplasticity, and some research indicates that certain types of games do have cognitive health benefits, (for example, in older adults). However, I haven't been able to find any information about this type of game in particular.  Do these types of repetitive games have any neurological benefit outside of an improved ability to play a particular game? "
1880,Why do we lose control momentarily?,"We may be able to control our temper most of the times, but there are times when on the spur of the moment we react the way we don't want to. Yet we do so. Why are we not able to carry our conditioned behavior to the situations where we get pushed too far? Is it possible to have 100% control? "
1881,Why is an image of a face without features disturbing?,"Below is a snapshot of an article linked from LinkedIn today.  What I find more disturbing than the topic at hand is the featured image used to head up the article.  Clearly it's important to provide suitable images to match content.  But why is a face with no features so disturbing?   Is facial recognition so deeply embedded into our subconscious that the inability to distinguish any features alerts us in some way?   Is it the deepest ravine of the uncanny valley?      Or is it just me? I mean it's not me obviously, in the image... is it just me that finds it disturbing? "
1882,Is homosexuality a psychological illness or a natural disposition of a person's sexual orientation?,"Homosexuals are oft criticized for their sexuality to which they would say they are just not attracted to the member of the opposite sex and that it's the other way round.  So, is this attraction to member's of the same-sex a (by-birth) psychological illness (that could be treated), a natural disposition, or just voluntary choice?   Or maybe something else? "
1883,"Why does the the sight of gore causes nausea, vomiting and/or fainting?","Why is it that upon seeing anything the involves gore, e.g.:   surgical cutting excessive blood blood and pain   causes nausea, vomiting or fainting?  And why does watching it repeatedly take away that feeling (desensitization)?  If the above is being watched in the form of a video/picture and the viewer is told that what is being shown is not real, but rather a video compositing technique, then the aforementioned feelings usually goes away. Why is that so?  Watching someone vomit can cause the viewer to follow suit; is the cause of this related to the one of the above? "
1884,How does the brain learn abstract maths?,"I have found quite a bit of information of how, on a neurological level, we learn the most basic forms of maths. We seem to be hardwired from the get go, to deal with manageable quantities, can intuitively decide whether something is more or less and even add or subtract small integers together. There have even been tests that six-month-old children already have an intuitive sense of small numbers. Basically, this covers basic arithmetic on natural numbers.  However, I had a hard time finding anything about how we learn to deal with more abstract, higher level maths. What happens in our brain when we deal with functions and variables? Will they still be processed in the same region that is used for counting? - Especially when it comes to functions that do not even take numbers as inputs or outputs.  Edit:  I am asking about math that can not be solved with simple arithmetic, and I wonder how an intuition of a generic mathematical concept would be represented in our brains. Has any research on this already been done? - Like something which isn't a numeric algorithm but rather symbolic manipulation. "
1885,Can the daily use of two or more languages impact cognitive capacity?,"I've read the following threads:   Is it possible to think in a second language? Does language and/or culture affect an individual&#39;s cognitive capacity? is it possible to think without language?   Language is clearly a very good tool for structuring ideas and communicating. I want to know if there is a correlation between cognitive capacity (in the same way CheeseConQueso expressed it) and using two or more languages fluently.  The following questions might help define what I'm wondering:   Is it possible for someone who uses two or more languages daily to switch between ""thought languages""?   If so, would it help broadening one's conceptual skills and adaptability?  What language combinations would then be better mixed together?  "
1886,What personality traits does sexy and revealing clothing correlate with?,"Is there some unifying characteristic that distinguishes women who wear form-fitting, lowcut, see-through and other kinds of revealing outfits?  Are they more extroverted, do they rate higher in (sexual) sensation seeking, do they have high or low confidence etc.?  Is there any research on this? "
1887,Why do we dream of unattainable wishes being satisfied in dreams?,"We want many things that we might never achieve or attain in real life. Often we dream, that we have these things.  What is the psychological function of this type of dream? How does the satisfaction inside a dream relate to the dissatisfaction in reality? "
1888,Is there another example of a strongly emergent phenomenon besides the mind?,"If you agree that the mind arises from the brain and is an emergent property of it, then the mind has to be strongly emergent, rather than weakly emergent.  Is there any other example in reality of a strongly emergent property or phenomenon?  If not, doesn't this mean the mind has no basis in nature and is not natural?  "
1889,At what age are women perceived to be most attractive?,"Someone once quoted a research at me:  Men were shown photographs of female body parts and asked to judge the attractiveness. The result was that men (of all ages) found 14 year old females the most (sexually) attractive.  I have tried to locate this or similar research, but to no avail.  Do you know of experiments researching at what age (men or) women are perceived to be most attractive (by male or female judges)?  Are there any moderators of this judgement (like age or gender of judge)? "
1890,"How to achieve homeostasis and cognitive closure, while living with more infinite unanswered questions and concrete explanations?","In this question we learn, curiosity (and scientific research in general) is a cycle that arises when one connects dots when analyzing new answers, which most of the time leads to more unanswered questions and the more unanswered questions, the more cognitive dissonance.   We also learn that the way to end the loop and dissonance is with no desire to continue ""the infinite quest"".  However, is it possible to reach homeostasis and/or cognitive closure while still living with more infinite unanswered questions an or concrete explanations?   If so, what methods have been found to harmonize this cause and effect?  (I would imagine some sort of elite Military training would touch on this to some degree?) "

1892,What is depersonalization and derealization disorder from a neurological point of view?,"Lately, there is a lot of information on the psychological, experiential and behavioral aspects of DP/DR.   (I find it most interesting as many have described it as having one foot in the spiritual realm and the other in this.)  When is it defined as an experience and what is the criteria that makes it a disorder?  As a disorder how is DP/DR described from a scientific neurological point of view?  Is some part of the brain damaged?  How is it physically similar to other disorders or issues (stroke, epilepsy)?  What methods directly or indirectly reverse the changes caused by it?  Why is this considered a relatively ""new disorder"" as I am sure it has been experienced in past decades?  Is it possible many have it and don't know it, as it appears there is a lot of subjectivity in defining it?  Any information is greatly appreciated. "
1893,"Does perception have a ""frame rate""?","Are the objects of visual perception processes divisible into individual, still frames, like video is?

Is the perception of motion based on pattern recognition between the stills?  "
1894,How are the questions in IQ tests formulated?,I would like to know how psychologists come up with the questions they include in an IQ test and how they know that those questions will accurately measure intelligence? How has it been proved that IQ tests do indeed work?

1898,What is a principle that describes competitive advantage in this case,"I gave up long ago on formulating what seems like a new concept as I came to peace with the fact that billions of people alive and dead means there's very little room for new concepts. (just an anecdote, not the focus of my question)  So I want to know what theory or concept describes the idea in which constantly comparing two things (or more?) in a ""yin and yang"" like opposition would associate rivalry between the two things even if non existed before the intentional creation of this comparison.  This idea came to me through observation of how politics and media works, whether scientifically intended or just mere learned through experience, in instigating seemingly unrelated concepts in a comparison situation, and enforcing that comparison on the masses to create such rivalry between the two concepts; then have the ability to influence external factors to skew the mass opinion one way or the other. It works because they're using it then with the oldest trick in the books: divide and conquer. So they get those two things, put them in such a rivalry comparison where if one existed the other can not exist at the same time, creating division and ""teams"" of sort, then appealing to each team in some way or the other to win its loyalty.    So the question is:  What theory or concept describes the creation of rivalry between two ideas to instigate division?    One idea I had was really just describing it as ""competition"". But this doesn't work; In competition, there's variable degrees of existence of each competing idea. However in the case of my question, where one idea exists in some context, the other idea can't. "
1899,How neural mechanisms lead to the creation of habits or destructive behaviours?,"You get horny, and you don't prevent yourself. You just go after satisfying your need. Another time you do this. Again another time, and more and more.  A time comes when you feel like you can't control yourself, even if you want to. In the beginning you could if you wanted to, but now things seem to be out of your control.  Personally I've experienced this pattern about food, lust, and responsibility. Empirically I think there should be a pattern that our decisions today will effect our decisions tomorrow. That is, with each decision, mind changes to make that decision easier next time.  Does this truly exist? Do we have a theory or a research behind this pattern?  I think each decision effects mind in a way that we might say that special connections are made between neurons and those special connections will impact next decisions of the same kind. I searched and couldn't find anything. "
1900,Why we are more optimistic about ourselves and our peers and pessimistic about others?,"I watched a ted talk which is about optimism bias by Tali Sharot. It stated that we are more optimistic about ourselves and our peers and we are more passimistic about others.But, I can't find an apt explanation for it.I observed this behaviour in all humans at some extent.  What makes the difference? Is there any scientific explanation? "
1901,How does one add a commutator to the UCLA miniscope cable?,"The UCLA miniscope is an open source alternative to the Inscopix system for calcium imaging in freely behaving animals.  One of the benefits of their system that they tout is the ability to have a commutator on the data cable. A commutator allows for a cable to rotate without twisting, a major problem when trying to record from freely moving animals. Other methods that I have heard of to allow rotation include a MMCX connector on the cable.  I haven't seen any specific recipes for solving this problem; the miniscope website has no instructions on including a commutator in the cable, only vague references to the possiblity.  Any solutions out there? "
1902,Method/Unit for measuring activity in specific frequency band for EEG,"This may be more of a signal processing question but I'm looking to measure and compare activity in different frequency bands for each sensor. Unfortunately, all papers I've looked at simply refer to ""alpha activity"" without specifying how this was calculated.   Is there any standard method or ""best practice"" to measure the level of activity? Is it simply the average energy in the band (sum of the square of the absolute of the signal?)   Any help with this would be appreciated. "
1903,Does Contextual switching Boost Motivation?,"Does contextual switching (or its derivatives thereof such as multitasking) increase one's motivation to further continue with the original activity?   An example: I see people at the gym who listen to music while on the treadmill, or even in the library while solving math problems. They claim that it motivates them. Are they correct? "

1905,Model for the Un/Conscious Mind,"As far as modern psychology is concerned, is there currently a standard scientific model for the conscious and unconscious mind, as well as conscious experience/perception? If so, are there any recommended resources (scientific books/articles) that detail this model?   I am currently reading The Mind Illuminated by John Yates, and while the book itself is tremendously helpful in the study and practice of mindfulness, I wanted to do some fact checking and research on the information presented in the book.   In the book John Yates describes all conscious perception, that is,  visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, olfactory, and mind sense (thoughts, memories, emotions) as taking on one of two qualities:  Attention: The cognitive ability to select and analyze specific information (sensory input, thoughts, memories, emotions, etc.) and ignore other information arising from a vast field of internal and external stimuli  Awareness: A general cognizance of sensory information; mental objects like thoughts, memories, and feelings; and the overall state and activity of the mind. Unlike attention which isolates and analyzes specific objects, peripheral awareness is inclusive holistic, and only minimally conceptual.  For example, in vision, objects of attention result in focused and sharper visual perception, whereas object of awareness form our periphery and are more blurry.   In the Mind-System model, Yates describes the mind as having a structure depicted in this image    Where the mind is divided into Unconscious and Conscious, and the Unconscious Mind is composed of the Sensory and Discriminating Mind.   My question to academics: does this information sound consistent with what is presented in modern day psychology &amp; cognitive science? And where may find more academic explanation of these types of models.  "
1906,Why is solitary confinement used so widely?,"Prison isolation is likely so hard for inmates because people are sociable creatures. Yet, isolation is still used in prisons ('supermax prisons'), in mental hospitals, but also as a strategy to educate children, given that some parents lock their kids in their room.    Why are those isolations in use? Do they have beneficial effects on prisoners or psychiatric patients? Does it treat their symptoms or criminal traits? "
1907,Oedipus/Electra complex and in laws,"Does the oedipus and electra complex, which are often regarded as the reason why daughters are attched to their fathers more and the sons to the mothers, also explain why sons in law are not liked by the fathers and duaghters in law are not liked by the mothers?  Is it becuse the sons and duaghters in law are regarded as an challenge/barrier to thier relationship with their sons and daughters? "
1908,"How is ""one-shot learning"" implemented in the NEF/SPA?","In various cognitive modelling publications, ""One-Shot Learning"", which is just learning given very few examples, is praised as being an essential part of human cognition. For example, in ""One-Shot Learning with a Hierarchical Nonparametric Bayesian Model"" a statistical model is used to quickly develop categories given a few examples of digits from the MNIST database.  Are models built using the NEF/SPA capable of ""One-Shot Learning""? Are there any examples of this being performed in a task? "

1910,What is the effect of motherese on development?,"Most cultures (Falk, 2009) have a special type of language that is used to talk to children: infant-directed-speech (IDL; or informally, motherese, baby talk). For instance, Fernald (1992) argues that motherese is an evolved phenomena that was selected for. This suggests that it has a benefit to child development, hence my questions:   What benefit does IDL provide children? How do the features of IDL benefit the cognitive development of children? Are there benefits beyound effects on language-acquisition?   Notes   The only benefit I am familiar with (shameless self plug) is in helping avoid reversal-errors in pronoun acquisition but Kaznatcheev (2010) is only a theoretical prediction based on a particular computational model of questionable (1, 2) empirical validity. I am interested in the developmental benefit of the very specific language used in IDL, not about the benefit of maternal care in general.   References  Fernald, A. (1992).

1911,Fitting a psychometric function when data does not lend itself to a sigmoidal fit,"I'm fitting a psychometric function to a range of data. The majority of this data lends itself to a sigmoidal fit (i.e. participants can do the task), but some individuals are absolutely unable to do the task. I'm planning to compare the slopes obtained from different conditions, but I've hit a wall with the unable-to-do-the-task data.    Fitting a function to this data, the slope should be nearly flat, right? However, the data is really noisy and some weird fitting is occurring - I end up getting erroneously high slopes. I'm using pypsignifit, the parameters I'm using can be seen below.

1912,Face-Blindness: Have I seen you before?,"Sometimes when I meet new people, I feel like I have seen them before. Their faces might look similar to people's faces, I have really have met before.   The wiki article on Difficulties with Facial Recognition states that:     Prosopagnosia is an inability to identify faces and face-like objects. This represents a failure to encode incoming visual information. Neurological studies indicate that prosopagnosia is associated with bilateral lesions of the central visual system, primarily located in the mesial occipitotemporal region.    I don't have problems with identifying faces, I just group them too often.   Questions   Why do novel faces sometimes look familiar? Is this related to a kind of face-blindness? What is the neural basis for this phenomena?   Related questions   Does the fusiform face area in patients with Prosopagnosia (face blindness) show lower activity under an fMRI?  "
1913,What are the minimal requirements for successful gamification?,"I am very interested in the concept of Gamification, the idea (used here on Stack Exchange) that by making mundane tasks into a game, you can elicit desired behavior from users of software. (For example, by giving people arbitrary reputation points, you encourage them to help the best answers rise to the top...)  Wikipedia says that some of the techniques used for gamification include:        achievement ""badges""   achievement levels   ""leader boards""   a progress bar or other visual meter to indicate how close people are to completing a task a company is trying to encourage, such as completing a social networking profile or earning a frequent shopper loyalty award.[7]   virtual currency   systems for awarding, redeeming, trading, gifting, and otherwise exchanging points   challenges between users   embedding small casual games within other activities.[2]      I'd like to see what studies actually say about gamification. If I wanted to start a new website which used gamificiation to entice users to participate, which techniques are the most efficient? Do some techniques work better than others? Do you need multiple rewards (E.G. reputation and badges)?  What do studies show are the minimum requirements for successful gamification? "

Is this person less prone to cognitive biases involving memory skills such as availability heuristic bias than a normal person due to his exceptional memory skills?

Also, does lack of information be perceived as a cognitive bias? "
1915,Using natural language processing for traffic monitoring from video,"I am stuck trying to learn how to use video processing as explained in the linked papers in the area of human behavior detection or traffic surveillance (any kind of monitoring activity). In particular, I do not know how to formulate the problem using any available models.  I have found two papers (Haag &amp; Nagel (2000; Paper 1) and Arens, Gerber, &amp; Nagel (2008; Paper 2)) which illustrate, with an example, using natural language for traffic monitoring by using image sequences of videos. My question are   Under what assumptions are the actions generated?What is the advantage of nlp here or in any application apart from the fact that it gives a hierarchical representation of information/knowledge? How are the actions and graphs (labelled as Situation Graph Trees by the author) generated (under what assumptions) in Fig2 of Paper 1 and Fig1 of Paper 2?

1916,The feeling a person gets when they finish a series,"Take for example, a person reading a good book series that they enjoy. While they are reading it, they typically look forward to finishing each volume, as well as the whole series. However, when they actually finish the series, they may feel disappointed that there are no more books in the series that they can read. I have observed the same pattern with movie and game series as well.  Is there a name for this feeling of disappointment that comes at the completion of  a long task? What might a psychologist tell a patient to do if suffering from such symtoms? Can they look at the situation from a different perspective, for example, that would allow them to feel differently about their completion? "
1917,Bias towards purchasing tangible vs virtual goods,"People may have very little hesitation in spending $3 on a coffee once a week, but when it comes to buying things online, such as virtual goods or services, they are often much more reluctant.    Is there a block when it comes to buying things online? If so, why? Is there a name for this phenomenon? Is so, how can someone selling something online (e.g. an online service provider or a software company) get around this and make customers less hesitant when shopping online?  "
1918,What is the term for human beings' tendency to obey without thinking?,"I'm wanting to read more about a certain human behavior, but I am not sure what the proper term for it is, so some of the things I am finding aren't what I am looking for. I'm interested in how Humans will often ""follow the leader"" and act as sheep, believing what they're told without applying much critical thinking. I thought this was called Herd Mentality, but Wikipedia describes that as:     Herd mentality implies a fear-based reaction to peer pressure which makes individuals act in order to avoid feeling ""left behind"" from the group   That is close to what I am thinking about. However Wikipedia relates Herd Mentality to Group intelligence and Wisdom of the crowd... which is ironic as those are the exact opposite of what I am looking for.  Examples of the behavior I am thinking of:   Sometimes high-rep users on Stack Exchange sites post poor questions or answers. Often these get upvotes even though they're incorrect, because people ""follow the leader"" and don't think about the actual answer. Religious leaders often influence their congregations on how to vote, and many members will vote that way even though what they're voting for may not really be what they believe it because they don't think about what they're voting for so they don't realize it. As an extreme example: Many good, moral people somehow shut off their ability to think logically and supported Hitler and the Holocaust.   What is the name for Human's tendency to follow a leader blindly, without thinking? Is this an actual psychological phenomenon and if so, what papers could I read to learn more about it? "
1919,Does pain reduce cognitive abilities?,"Does subjecting a person to pain reduce his cognitive abilities?  If so, what is the process that reduces the ability?

1920,How do responses to Likert type response scales vary across countries and cultures?,"I gave an answer here on stats.stackexchange.com about how to analyse ordinal items, such as those on Likert type response scales (e.g., Strongly disagree to Strongly agree). Someone asked whether there were differences between countries and cultures in how respondents use such scales. I remember reading research about this many years ago. I can remember something about certain countries preferring extreme responses. Such differences naturally have implications for cross-cultural comparisons of levels of like life satisfaction, personality, and presumably any self-report measure that uses such response scales.   Questions   How does use of Likert type response scales vary across countries and cultures? What explains any such differences? How are differences in response style differentiated from differences in levels of the underlying construct?  "
1921,Do people like those who are similar to them and why?,Questions   Is it true that people 'like' those who are similar to them? Why is it so? Is there an evolutionary explanation?  
1922,Why is it easier to remember the correct response for problems with many options rather than just two?,"Sometimes it seems easier, at least for me, to remember an answer, when there are more than 2 options to choose from.  For example, I easily remember my pin (14 bit), but hardly the lighter switch (up or down- 1 bit) for ""on"".  Why is that? Or is it just a wrong impression? "
1923,Evolutionary game theory in the cognitive sciences,"Game theory models something very relevant to psychologists (in particular social psychologists): conflict and cooperation between decision-makers. Unfortunately, classical game theory demands that these decision makers are rational (in a mathematically precise sense). This definition of rationality is challenged empirically (by work like Tversky &amp; Shafir) and on a theoretical level (by complexity results on finding or approximating Nash equilibria: a PPAD-complete problem).  Economists and mathematicians (and others) have taken two approaches to overcome this problem. The first is top-down approach of limiting the agent's abilities from an all-powerful rational agent down; this is the bounded rationality approach. The other is the bottom-up approach of evolutionary game theory: start with the simplest agents (that can't even make decisions) and have natural selection, imitation, or another simple dynamic process evolve the population over time. This seems to dove-tail nicely with the biogenic approach to cognition.  Are there examples of the tools of evolutionary game theory being used in social psychology or other sub-disciplines of the cognitive sciences? Is there a survey (or book) on EGT's impact on the cognitive sciences?    Related question  What are good examples of applying dynamical systems in cognitive science? "
1924,"What salient features of a {conditioned stimulus,unconditioned stimulus} pair are represented in the lateral amygdala?","In classical conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (CS, e.g., a tone) is presented just before an unconditioned stimulus (UCS, e.g., a mild toe pinch) in repeated trials, such that the CS will eventually evoke the unconditioned response (e.g., withdrawal reflex) on its own.  Such memories of fear and discomfort are said to be held in the lateral amygdala, with a representation of the CS and its UCS (Díaz-Mataix et al, 2011).  Certain areas of the brain have particular representations of stimuli, e.g., a tone of a given frequency, as the primary auditory cortices have ""tonotopic"" zones in which different areas have a differential response to separate frequencies.  Since the CS/UCS pairing is more abstract than a single tone, I'm curious as to what type of representation of the CS/UCS is actually encoded within the local subnetworks  amygdala.  I can't imagine that, for the above example, a particular area holds a representative frequency of a tone used as a CS in tight collaboration with a ""pain"" signal.  It might be realistic, but anatomically, that whole area would also have to reflect an exhaustive set of all of the other possible ""life events"" that the animal has experienced.    So, is this representation in the lateral amygdala just a placeholder to retrieve other pertinent memories stored elsewhere in cortex -- is the hippocampus a major player in keeping this sorted?  If, in fact, all these pairings are just weak bindings of diverse stimuli, why is it so difficult to untangle and extinguish more complex types of fears in human patients?

1925,EEG segmentation and denoising which one should done first?,"Because of EEG nature, in EEG analysis often researcher use Windowing/segmentation method.      As i currently work on sleep study, and in my study i need to analysis EEG data, i came to a problem.    My problem: should i filter and Denise my EEG signal and then segment it or no i should firstly segment my EEG and then filter and denoise each epoch separately?      And as extra question, is there any difference between these two in signal processing view? "
1926,Theorem of uncertainty in cognitive science,"Recently, reading one book I have come across such paragraph:  ""[...] The operation would require de facto to create a complete record of the mind and build the brain again - an impossible thing for absolutely fundamental reasons. Cognitive science has its own theorem on uncertainty, the law proving the impossibility of reducing the mental structure to numerical data.""  I am guessing, that the author was referring to the Heisenberg's uncertainty theorem, but that is the only thing that came to my mind (my knowledge about cognitive sciences is very limited). Do you know, what the author might have meant? Or maybe it was just fiction? "
1927,"Knowability of ""repressed"" in Freud's theory","Both Popper and Grünbaum took issue with Freud's theory, but they critiqued it for different reasons, in which the main difference seems (to me) to come down to this:   Popper interprets Freud as saying that something (say homosexuality) being repressed by the subject means it's a completely hidden state, so we can never know the truth value of statements like ""subject X is repressing his homosexuality"". So Popper argued that psychoanalysis is untestable because testing inferences like ""if P then Q"" (e.g. repressed homosexuality can lead to psychosis) is impossible for we can never know the truth value of the antecedent (P).  On the other hand, Grünbaum considered that statements like ""repressed homosexuality can lead to psychosis"" propose testable etiologies. And it's not hard to conceive that (say) using a penile plethysmograph one can test for homosexual preference. Once we agree we can test for the latter (even if not with perfect accuracy), we can also test for (statistical) associations etc. Kihlstrom pretty much takes this view in listing most Freudian common ""knowledge""/lore as false rather than unfalsifiable.   Of course, Freud's theory is screwed in either case (for this example, and probably for most other). Whether it's screwed as non-falsifiable from the get go, or as falsifiable but almost certainly false ... is not incredibly interesting to most people.  But for the sake of curiosity, did Freud make explicit what he considered to be knowability of ""repressed""? I.e., did he assert about any repressed condition (as he conceived them) that we cannot really know whether it's really there? Is something called repressed by Freud if and only if it is a true hidden state? So, as an example ""truly repressed"" homosexulity could never show up on any plethysmograph, by this (Poppler-ian) definition of repressed. But did Freud explicitly define ""repressed"" in this absolute way? "
1928,Negative thoughts as cause or consequence of depression,"Simplypsychology.org page on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy mentions that      Lewinsohn (1981) studied a group of participants before any of them became depressed, and found that those who later became depressed were no more likely to have negative thoughts than those who did not develop depression. This suggests that hopeless and negative thinking may be the result of depression, rather than the cause of it.  [...]         Lewinsohn, P. M., Steinmetz, J. L., Larson, D. W., &amp; Franklin, J. (1981). Depression-related cognitions: antecedent or consequence?. Journal of abnormal psychology, 90(3), 213.      Has there been more research into the cause/effect relationship of negative thoughts and depression since then? If so, is there some kind of consensus on this cause-effect relationship? Or has the inquiry been judged not terribly interesting or (non-)productive? "
1929,Does MEG measure the sum of neural activity or the maximum?,"According to Wikipedia, neurons give a response that generates a readable MEG signal when they are firing in a relatively synchronized manner and their current carrying dendrites/axons are all aligned. This occurs most often in pyramidal neurons, due to their perpendicular alignment with the scalp. Consequently, this seems to imply MEG can be imagined as the sum of all pyramidal neuron activity.  However, consider the case where a group of pyramidal neurons are projecting in different directions. The magnetic fields would then cancel each-other out. Would MEG then be considered to take the maximum of the neural responses? I've added top-view illustrations below to help describe the different cases.  ""Sum"" case where neuron are all projecting in same direction during task:    ""Max"" case where neurons are projecting in many different directions during task:    Are there studies that support either case/interpretation?

1931,Is there a known mechanism by which people fall asleep less easy after watching TV?,"It's my experience that people (I am one of them) tend to fall asleep while watching television. Afterwards, when lying in bed, sleep doesn't come as easy as when they were watching television.   Is this because only the ""small"" part of the brain that is involved in watching television (and when you experience that what you're watching ain't worth looking at, so you fall asleep before you can switch the canal) and the other parts ""wake up"" when you're lying in bed, which makes it harder for you to fall asleep? Or is it just linked to being tired (in which case you would expect to fall asleep easy in bed)?  You can examine this by letting a group of people (or men or women, not both) of about the same age, physical health, etc. letting perform the same things (like eating, waking up at the same time, doing the same physical tasks), and before going to sleep letting them watch the same movie on TV. I think doing this a month suffices. After a month of collecting data (from questions asked and physical examinations), you're maybe able to say something useful. "
1932,Can non-spiking neurons have a sustained synaptic output current?,"I'm trying to better understand neural models, specifically non-spiking neurons in invertebrate motor control circuits.  I know that a spiking neuron produces spikes in membrane potential that rapidly go away and exhibit an all-or-none response.  I've also been reading that non-spiking neurons generally exhibit a graded potential.  What I don't know is if that graded potential is sustained, or if it rapidly goes away like in a spiking neuron.  In other words, if the membrane potential rises, is it possible for that membrane potential to stay elevated for long periods of time?  If so, what types of mechanisms might cause that? "
1933,What is the name of the effect whereby learning past a level increases mastery of that level?,"A post in Professor Doom's blog contains the following exchange:     Pitchman: “What we know for sure is, the students who score high   enough for College Algebra usually took courses past College Algebra   in high school. The students who don’t quite make it into College   Algebra took it in high school, and so on down the line.”      Faculty: “Wait a minute. You mean there’s hard evidence for what we   know to be true: that to achieve a goal in learning, you must push   past that goal to succeed? Why haven’t these results been published?”   The general idea seems to me to be that if one wants to increase one's comfort with problems at a particular difficulty level, then one should do problems beyond that difficulty level.   Is there a name for this effect? And if so, what are the key findings?  "
1934,Cortisol in Generalized Anxiety Disorder: is there a consensus?,"I've seen some recent papers that find elevated cortisol in GAD patients, particularly in older ones, and that SSRI medication lowers cortisol in such GAD patients. However I also found an older study that didn't find any difference in cortisol between GAD and controls.  So is there some consensus on the correlation between cortisol and GAD? Is age the primary moderating factor in this correlation? "
1935,Why do people like to listen to sad songs?,"Why do people like to listen to sad songs?  Sadness is not a positive feeling, so people should avoid it, right? Listening to sad songs is like inflicting some pain to yourself just for pleasure.  Did someone studied this? Why do people like sad songs? Is it similar mechanism to masochism? What is evolutionary role of feeling sad on purpose? What is neurological background of this phenomenon? "
1936,What causes muscle stiffness contraction and tension during stress,"What causes muscle contraction in times of stress? People say it's caused because of fight or flight response is activated, but this not exact. I am looking to find the direct cause, i.e is it a direct effect of adrenaline or maybe a direct effect of cortisol? Maybe is because glucose levels rise and it's the way of our body to use that extra energy? I don't really know and searching doesn't help. "
1937,Is there any evidence that the Dunning-Kruger Effect applies to self-appraisals of soundness or reasonableness of judgement?,"The Dunning-Kruger Effect is the peculiar phenomenon wherein those with the lowest ability also have impaired metacognition, resulting in a peculiar overestimation of their ability e.g. stupid person who thinks they're a genius. This is known as miscalibration.  The figure below characterises the matter perfectly:       Kruger, J., &amp; Dunning, D. (1999). Unskilled and unaware of it: How difficulties in recognizing one’s own incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77, 1121–1134. [website]Now, to my understanding the Dunning-Kruger Effect tracks onto a wide variety of domains, not just intelligence. For example, the above paper looked at humour, grammar and reasoning ability.  Question: Is there any literature relating to the Dunning-Kruger Effect and reasonableness or soundness of judgement?  In other words, I want to know if the most unreasonable people will also believe that they are actually very reasonable? I note that this has nothing to do with reasoning ability, but I am sure that there is an element to it as well. It does not need to be the Dunning-Kruger Effect, but something similar. "
1938,free will studies in long term decisoin making,this wikidepia article has a list of experiments and discussion around free will in neuroscience. One thing it notes is that there aren't studies focused on long term decision making in relation to free will.  Is that so? Are there any bodies of studies related to free will when it comes to longer time frames? 
1939,Why does THC or CBD give me a mental boost?,"Studies have shown significant reduction in seizures in babies to adults when taking marijuana. I would call that amazing but what does it do in improving cognitive abilities in normal people?  I smoke weed but just a little, but when I do my creative writing and imagination takes off. Why is that? Is it the Cannabidiol (CBD) a phytocannabinoid (bought over the counter where I live) or the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) a cannabinoid (which is still a misdemeanor) that contributes to creativity?  How can I do a controlled experiment or test to determine which chemical is giving me a mental advantage in creative thinking? "
1940,Definition of dominance (self-assessment manikin),"I'm using the self-assessment manikin to measure valence, arousal and dominance. Valence and arousal is clear to all participants but with the concept of dominance a lot of participants are struggling.  I'm explaining dominance in term of degree of control, i.e. on one side of the scale the participant is feeling completely controlled and influenced and on the other side  completely controlling and dominant.  The participants have to chat with a chat application on a smartphone. Can somebody imagine a chat conversation where the participant is feeling dominant and one where the participant is not feeling dominant at all? I would like to give two such examples to the participants.  Moreover, is the term dominance in relation to an emotion or to an object? For example, during chatting is dominance always in relation to the person the participant is chatting with, i.e. how dominant the participant is feeling in relation to this person? "
1941,How to prepare when entering the field of Psychology from a professional UX background?,"I come from a Computer Science and professional User Experience (UX) Design background and I'll soon be starting an MSc conversion course in Psychology. My interest is to understand human behaviour and principles of psychological research so that I can apply them in the context of UX, particularly when it comes to people with disabilities and accessibility in general.  What definitive resources on this topic and more specifically on dementia and memory loss in adults through childhood trauma should I be aware of? And why those ones? "

1943,Concept of Free Will,"I was not really sure which stack exchange to post this question, however, this one suits well I am guessing.  So assuming that the brain is just a carbon-based input/output calculator, and assuming most of the signals and connections between the nerves are deterministic.  Every outgoing action(output) of someone is determined via the ingoing actions (inputs) with some kind of connection/calculation done by the brain. So if this hypothesis is true, How can someone prove or argue of the existence of the free will?  Isn't it possible if we determine every aspect of the input signal, and if we know what the brain does with this input (via some computer model, or something with same manner), can't we foresee what that person is about to do or act versus the input action?  If the statement above is true and is proved, can't we say the concept of free will is dead? and can't we read minds?  I am looking for any kind (technical or hypothetical) of an answer to disprove the idea written above. Ty "
1944,How can a human carry out a mass shooting whilst remaining calm?,"In the wake of the horrific terrorist attack in Christchurch New Zealand, it became known that the shooter had live streamed 17 minutes of his rampage to Facebook. In the video, of which I have only watched about 15 seconds from the point of the first shot being fired, the shooter can be seen extremely calmly carrying out his attack.  My question to the people here is, what is the root cause of a human being such as the shooter, being able to carry out such inhumane, disgusting, horrifying and downright evil acts whilst remaining so chillingly calm?  As someone with very little to no knowledge or experience with the relevant psychological literature, I have to ask, is this shooter a straight up psychopath? Surely the people who carry out such attacks have had some prior brain damage or genetic mental condition? "
1945,Why does campfire lighting look creepy?,"Various photography lighting guides state that when light is positioned above a face it looks natural, but when positioned below a person it looks unnatural or even ""creepy"".    This is sometimes used deliberately in movies to evoke fear.    The universal principles of design say that this is because we evolved on planet earth with a single sun, which is always above us.   But there are plenty of natural situations where light could come from under us. Such as being reflected off the ground, snow, or water, or just sitting around a warm campfire.    I'm just curious if there are any known psychological reasons why lighting under a face might look unnatural or ""creepy""? Or could it be that it's such a staple of horror movies that we're primed to perceive it that way? "
1946,What constitutes an emotional disorder?,"Watson, et al. (2008) states that a superclass of mood and anxiety disorders should be given a nonspecific label, such as ‘emotional disorders’.  They stated that this superclass     can be decomposed into three subclasses: the distress disorders (major depression, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder), the fear disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia), and the bipolar disorders (bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymia).   There have been different remits put forward in Neurophysiology, Psychology and Psychopathology journals to define what constitutes an emotional disorder.  Goldberg, et al. (2009) says they include:     generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), unipolar depression, panic disorder, phobic disorders, obsessional states, dysthymic disorders, post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and somatoform disorders. We have also included neurasthaenia, as this diagnosis is commonly made in many parts of the world, and is in the ICD‐10. We have preferred the term ‘emotional’ because we include somatoform disorders in the group.   yet, Baek (2014) says:     Typical emotional disorders are anxiety disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder   Sung, et al. (2016) pointed out that     The term ‘emotional disorders’ is not a clearly defined medical term, but is commonly used to refer to psychological disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorders and major depressive disorders) that appear to affect the emotions. ‘Emotional disorders’ in this study refers to the symptoms of anxiety and depression   Where there are moves to improve the diagnostic procedures for mental disorders through systems such as HiTOP (Stony Brook Medicine, 2017; Kotov, et al., 2017) — see also my answer to How does a person know if he should seek treatment for depression since feeling moody is unavoidable? — has there been any attempt since 2016 to put together definitive criteria to determine what constitutes an emotional disorder?

1947,What kind of political views are sociopaths more likely to espouse?,"I know of the pretty controversial links between personality and political orientation, in general terms, e.g.     Although most research examining whether openness and conscientiousness influence political ideology has appeared only within the last decade, support for the expected openness-liberalism and conscientiousness-conservatism links already is voluminous.   I'm curious if studies have looked at the finer correlations of abnormal psychology and political orientation. Do the extremes of personality lead people to more extreme political orientation of some sort? For instance, does sociopathy predispose to extreme left- or right-wing movements? "
1948,What are the neuroscience research findings on the importance of breaks in cognitive function and specifically learning?,"When I say breaks I mean breaks between periods of the same course, breaks between two distinct courses, single days of, weekends, couple days of, few days of, longer periods of holidays of duration more than a week and the longest of them summer.  How long can we keep thinking and learning, such that we maximise our thinking and learning? 90 minutes?  What short breaks do we need? 15 minutes?  How many times in a day can we have a 90 minutes period?  How many times per week can we have such a day?  How many times per year can we have such weeks?  Different years have different amounts of studying time in the same school, same year(1st, 2nd, 3rd), and same generation(the different years are close to each other) is this not a problem?  I am a cancer patient since 16, a medical student aiming for radiation oncology and subsidiary MSc&amp;Phd in radiophysics. I am actually autistic but with no mental retardation. So the questions are absolutely necessary as subsidiaries to help me explain myself, why some events seem paradoxical and exactly what information I need. I extensively and thoroughly read ncbi, pubmed and textbooks concerned with my question in hand. A single link I can provide is [website]"
1949,Would a diagnosis from a layman be legitimate if it follows the definition of the disorder?,"Assuming a layman with no formal training (person A) says ""person B has disorder X"". A should not make such diagnosis because they don't have the training. But if A does that because it fits the definition, then wouldn't their conclusion be correct? For example, I know that for a person to have borderline personality disorder they need to have at least 5 of 9 criteria. So if B does have that, then would A be fine to conclude that B has that disorder, in spite of the fact that A isn't trained?  "
1950,How do we know what colors animals perceive?,"Humans have three kinds of photoreceptors corresponding to different wavelength-spectra:    If say photons with wavelengths of around 530 nanometers hit the human retina, this would lead to the perception of the color conventionally called ""green"". The color ""green"", however, is subjective in the sense that it is bound to a certain cortical physiology.   So my question is: Given that we don't have access to how animals perceive color, as we can't infer such qualitative properties purely from physical stimulus properties, how can we conclude that some animals are, say, perceiving ultra-violet colors given certain items or wavelengths? What if they would perceive entirely different colors than known to us? "
1951,How does flow differ from or relates to attention?,"Csikszentmihalyi introduced the notion of flow, which is almost certainly his best known work/concept.  Despite the fact that Wikipedia has a very long article on flow, I can't find a simple explanation in there how flow relates to attention, other than it might be just ""effortless attention"".  Is this all there is to it? Are there any more in-depth explanations how the two concepts relate or interact?    After paying slightly more attention to the wiki page, the ""effortless"" bit actually involves a whole motivational loop, so that there's an appearance of lack of effort. So, no deep motivation, no flow. But still I'd like to know if Csikszentmihalyi's flow, which is very highly cited (his books are that is) has been related to other more common concepts... "
1952,Thinking Fast and Slow: Similarity of Linda problem and Dinnerware case,"While reading Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" I've been stuck on the claim that Linda case and Dinnerware case have the same structure.  Linda problem:     Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She   majored  in  philosophy.  As  a  student,  she  was  deeply concerned   with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also   participated in antinuclear demonstrations.""      ""Which alternative is more probable?         Linda is a bank teller.   Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.      It is well-known that the majority of respondents chooses the second options (as most plausible, though the original question is about probability).  The Dinnerware case:     Being presented two sets of dinnerware:      Set A: 40 pieces / Set B: 24 pieces      Dinner plates: 8, all in good condition / 8, all in good condition    Soup/salad bowls: 8, all in good condition / 8, all in good   condition  Dessert plates: 8, all in good condition / 8, all in   good condition  Cups: 8, 2 of them broken / NONE  Saucers:   8, 7 of them broken / NONE   It is known that respondents tend to select Set B, though it is more beneficial to select set A.  Here is the question:   The dinnerware case is explained via the notion of 'averaging'. That is, person's System 1 (Kahneman's terminology) performs some kind of averaging and goes to conclusion, that as Set B items are not broken and in average cost more, then the whole Set B shall be preferred.     From the perspective of economic theory, this result is troubling: the   economic value of a dinnerware set [...] is a sum-like variable."" I.e.   pure summation shall be performed where averaging and subsequent   assessment is carried out.   Then,     The Linda problem and the dinnerware problem have exactly the same   structure (??).  Probability,  like  economic  value,  is  a    sum-like  variable,  as illustrated by this example: probability   (Linda is a teller) = probability (Linda is feminist teller)   + probability (Linda is non-feminist teller)"" ""System 1 averages instead of adding, so when the non-feminist bank tellers are removed   from the set, subjective  probability  increases.   Here is my difficulty: I do not see how the 'averaging' notion applies to the Linda problem. When I myself think about Linda question, I do not realize that try to average something, I just want to construct something that fits my stereotypes. Otherwise, when I think about dinnerware, I agree that subconsciously try to maximize the average price of item. "
1953,What are the conditions of deliberate practice?,"TL;DR: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for deliberate practice?  Longer version: I've read a number of books/articles on deliberate practice and its role in acquiring expertise.  The texts make a compelling case for the argument that a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate practice is required to develop expertise in a particular field.  The implication of the research is undoubtedly optimistic (as it largely dispels the notion of being born talented - with certain semi-exceptions, notably, athletes).  However, I struggle when it comes to translating the research into practical takeaways for myself.  As someone who'd like to apply the concept of deliberate practice to his profession/hobbies, it would be useful to have a rigorous/comprehensive definition of deliberate practice that I could effectively use as a check-list.  But in the material I've read, it seems that ""deliberate practice"" is effectively defined as (and I'm paraphrasing): ""the type of practice of which 10,000 hours are needed in order to develop expertise"".  So, to put it differently (from the TL;DR above): How do I know if I'm practicing effectively?  (Aside from practicing a certain way for 10,000 hours and seeing if I become an expert)  Disclaimers:    It's probably evident from my post that I'm not a professional researcher / academic.  My exposure to the topic is largely from pop science books that cater to the mass-market (i.e., I'm trusting the authors re: the quality of underlying research).    Also, the answer to my question may well be addressed in formal research papers found on PUBMED/etc., but I unfortunately don't have access to that.  "
1954,Can a person be brilliant even though slow at resolving problems?,"Can a person be very intelligent, able to solve difficult problems if given enough time, yet really a slow thinker? Especially if nervous. Could such a slow thinking brilliant person get all the questions on an IQ test correct even though they were 20 minutes beyond the required end of the test?  Another way of putting this question is regarding the validity of time limits on IQ tests.  How have these been arrived at?  Have other (extended) time limits been tested?  Have such time limits yielded different (higher) scores? "
1955,What does the death of a fictional character mean?,"   Aristotle approached the question of story and meaning in this way: Why is it, he asked, when we see a dead body in the street we have one reaction, but when we read of death in Homer, or see it in the theatre, we have another? ~ Robert McKee, Story   When a fictional character is killed, no one dies – and the readers and viewers know this, no matter how much they identify with the story. So what does this narrative device actually mean? Aristotle thought that the death of a character evokes emotions in the viewers that then allow the author to convince them of his narrative argument. He calls this ""pathos"". Following Aristoteles, the death of a character ""means"" that the audience becomes more susceptible to what the author wants them to believe (the moral of the story). But that is the author's perspective on what he can do with the death of a character, and does not explain how the audience experience and understand it.  To answer this question, we may have to first understand how the audience perceives the character.     A character is no more a human being than the Venus of Milo is a real woman. A character is ... a metaphor for human nature. ~ Robert McKee, Story   A character is a symbol that stands in for something that affects the reader or viewer: their deams and aspirations; or their fears. And thus the death of a symbol may symbolize that a dream will remain unfulfilled or a fear is overcome. Death in the media, I believe, is not final but transformative, and not real but symbolic, and this becomes most apparent in the journey to the underworld (read ""death"") of many mystical heroes. But that is only my opinion.  Is there research that tries to answer this question from the perspective of psychology?  Or, in the absence of such research, how would you study it?    In his comment, Steven Jeuris remarks, that a fictional character's death means that he dies in the fictional world. Let me elaborate on that.  Readers of fiction don't read like news readers. A newspaper reader reads to learn what has happened in the world he lives in, and (maybe) to understand why. Because these events (and their reasons) affect his own life and the decisions he has to make.  Readers of fiction, on the other hand, do not read to be informed. They read to experience emotions, to escape their own lives, to be inspired, and so on. The facts of the fictional world are irrelevant to their own lives, but the emotions they elicit, the ideas they generate, and the time spent away from the demands of their own lives are important to them.  If a neighbor, politician or artist dies in the real world, and I read about it, this affects my own life. My life has been changed (because a person is missing from it) or it will be changed (because politics will change). If a fictional character dies, nothing changes in my life.  What is changed, is the story.  And story logic is not like the chains of cause and effect (or chance) that govern the events in real life. In the real world, many (if not most) people die through forces that lie outside of their influence. They die of old age or are run over by drunk drivers. In the fictional world, everything happens by design, and that design is based on the story's premise and the characters actions. In a fictional world, no one dies by chance, and even old age has a meaning.  Very simplified, in a (classic type of) story a character achieves his goals, if he overcomes his deficits. If he refuses to grow, he fails. Death is the reward for moral failure. Think of the hero killing his antagonist or the first two knights being eaten by the dragon: these characters don't just die and then they are dead, but their death means that their way of life was wrong.  But of course stories are usually more complicated than that today. Characters aren't simply good or bad, they are ""realistic"", like real people. And the world they inhabit isn't as simply structured as that of a fairy tale, it is ""realistic"", like the real world. In Game of Thrones, characters die apparently like in the real world: despite being the good guys.  But still, it is not the real world. If the good guy dies in Game of Thrones, it is not because Game of Thrones is realistic and characters in its world die just like people in real life, but because it is not what we are used to from narrative conventions and it surprises us. The death of the good guy in Game of Thrones means that we cannot trust what we have learned about how stories work. It does not mean that someone died. It is sad and frustrating, because we wanted Ned Stark to succeed, but at the same time it is thrilling and satisfying, because it is novel.  These are just examples, and there will be disagreement over the interpretation of these stories, but I hope they serve to illustrate that the death of a fictional character does not mean (to the reader !) that this ""person"" has died in the fictional world. It means something different or on top of that to the reader (who knows, which is important, that no one has died !).  Of course, every death in fiction might be interpreted differently – depending on the specific story. But I think that it must be possible to generalize and find an underlying similarity or several ""types of fictional deaths"".  Finally, I think that this question does not belong on another site, because the study of the psychology of reading books or viewing movies (that is, the psychology of the audience) is the task of the psychologist just like advertising psychology (which also deals with how stories work on their audience).  So if you want, think of my question of belonging in advertising psychology: Does the clean shirt the housewife pulls from the washing mashine mean that the shirt has been cleaned? No. It means that the washing powder is better than other washing powders (or, if you are a cynic, that that is what the advertiser wants us to believe). The meaning of the clean shirt depends on the intent of the narrator and the circumstances of the narration (in an ad).  Similarly, the meaning of a fictional death will depend on the (reader perceived) intent of the narrator (who, by the way, is not the author) and the circumstances of the narration (a book, a tv show). But I don't want to do a (subjective) literary interpretation (like I did here), but learn how this has been studied or, if no such studies have been undertaken, study it with psychological methodology.  Hope this now makes a bit more sense. "
1956,What is the correct scientific term of having a short-term or long-term mindset (in the field of health and healthy lifestyle)?,"For research on changing lifestyle behaviours to prevent future disease, I am looking for literature on what the influence is of having a short-term versus a long-term oriented mindset. However, I cannot come up with the correct term for this and therefore do not manage to find useful scientific literature.  Any suggestions? Perhaps even recommendations of literature? "
1957,Do repeated measures designs in cognitive research permit causal inference?,"Can someone please explain this to me because it's driving me bonkers. In cognitive research when one group of participants are exposed to a number of crossed factors manipulated by the researcher, is it a quasi-experimental design or a true experiment?  All the sources I read always mention random assignment and random sampling when talking about true experiments. So do cognitive science experiments such as the repeated measures factorial design a lot of studies use have the right to claim that they establish causal links between the outcome and the manipulations? "
1958,Is our attention attracted by bright lights?,"Bright lights are often used to attract human attention. For example, brightly lit signs, despite often being too bright to look at directly are often used for information and/or advertisement.  Why does this attraction to light occur? I don't see a good reason like how our eyes are attracted to movement, so what's the benefit of it? "
1959,Why do I see those static pictures as they are moving,"Have a look at the following static pictures:      There are more of them here. On the same website this PDF describes findings.However I could not find any explanation why this phenomenon happening.   Is it caused by eye structure itself?   Can phenomenon be explained, for example, by combination of uneven density of visual receptors from center to peripherals of the eye together with saccadic eye movement and slight delays in visual nerve signal propagation?  Or it is creation of visual cortex due to some processes in image interpretation?  I will appreciate any references to the research papers.   "
1960,Why does marijuana cause anxiety?,"Marijuana is getting increasingly used in medical settings. However, one of its disadvantages is anxiety. Does anyone know the reason behind the anxiety?

1961,How does the physical brain know about qualia?,"Qualia are phenomenological (the subjective experience of the physical activity of the brain).  But how does phenomenology feed back into the activity of the brain?  That is, how can the physical brain detect that qualia are occurring inside of it and be able to report on it?  To clear up confusion:   Suppose that all things are physical and all behaviors can be explained physically through neurons. Suppose that qualia exist and are phenomenological.   The question is, how do physical neurons ""know"" about qualia. This is similar to a mind-affecting-brain question, but subtly different:   There is no assumption about a ""mind"" existing The causal relationship between qualia and physical brain is restricted to the physical brain's detection of qualia.

1962,Applications and Limitations of EEG Electrode Pooling - Averaging across time series,"Is there any literature that has addressed electrode pooling?

EDIT: By ""pooling"" I am refering to the procedure in which new channels are created based on pooling the raw data from the original data electrodes. This is a preprocessing step not to be confused with variance pooling for statistical testing. "

1964,Hebbian Learning - Understanding Simultaneous Firing,"I'm beginning to write a neural network simulator in Java and thinking of Hebbian Learning but I'm stuck at one thing:  What causes two neurons to fire at the same interval while only one of them is input and the other is not? Does it fire itself?   Hebbian Learning rule says ""those fire together will wire together"" but since I'm activating only input neuron, what makes the other interior neuron fire? Do I need to make them fire randomly at times instead of just using weights matrix [tex]?  I'm a fan of unsupervised learning and need to start with a simple case such as I give one of 3-5 neurons a ""1"" and expect from another one a ""0"" as a ""NOT"" operator. "

Is attention localized to some specific brain area or neurotransmitter system (ex: reward seeking is mediated by the limbic system)? "
1966,Brain-computer interface with EEG: how to name imaginary movement of a non-self object?,"I am working on Brain-Computer interfaces. In my project we try to control the movement of a robot in three directions, namely forward, right and left.  We have done an EEG experiment where we have asked subjects to imagine the movement of this robot to the wanted direction. For example, if the subject wanted to move the robot forward, he needed to imagine the robot was moving forward.  Is this type a motor imagery experiment? If not, what would the scientific word be that describes this type of experiment? "
1967,Does motivation and interest correlate highly with IQ and can someone be smart but perform poorly in a particular field?,"Suppose a person is considered intelligent based on his IQ score. For example, suppose Bob has a high IQ score and is very interested in pure mathematics. He would most probably excel in this field. Now suppose Bob hated biology. He can't bring himself to learn anything about this field. Does this mean that Bob is ""not intelligent"" in the field of biology and only intelligent in the field of pure mathematics?  In other words, does motivation and interest correlate highly with IQ? Somebody can be ""smart"" but still perform poorly in various fields? "
1968,How are Bayesian models implemented in the NEF?,"One of the much documented problems of Bayesian approaches to cognitive modeling is that there isn't much of a neural grounding. The NEF can be used to compute probabilistic computations with ease (see Chapter 9 of Neural Engineering), however have this been used in a published model before? Are there drawbacks that make merging the NEF with Bayesian modelling methods unfeasible in terms of resources required? "
1969,Combining unbiased hit rates,"I am analysing data on an emotion perception task, where participants must decide if a given face is happy, sad, angry or fearful (essentially a forced choice between 4 options).  I am confident that I want to calculate an unbiased hit rate for each emotion (as in Wagner 1993). This takes a confusion matrix (toy example below):          Happy    Sad    Angry   Fearful Happy     4       1       0        1 Sad       0       3       2        1  Angry     0       0       6        0 Fearful   2       0       0        4   And the unbiased hit rate is then the correct answers squared, divided by the number of times that answer is used multiplied by the number of trials where that answer was correct. So in the above example:  Hu(Happy) = 4^2 / ((4+0+0+2)*6) = 16/36 = 0.444 Hu(Sad) = 9/24 = 0.375 Hu(Angry) = 36/48 = 0.75 Hu(Fearful) = 16/36 = 0.444   These are then converted with an arcsine tranformation on the square root for use as the dependent variable in regression.  However, I want to use this data to assess general ability at emotion recognition in faces - what is the correct way to combine the unbiased hit rates? That is, can I generate a single value that accounts for all off these, or should I run four separate analyses and examine the overlap in the results?  Reference  Wagner, H. L. (1993). On measuring performance in category judgment studies of nonverbal behavior. Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 17(1), 3-28. "
1970,Do people perceive opacity of a color linearly?,"I am trying to create a visualization for some numbers, each ranging from 0 to 1. I was thinking of representing each number by a color (say red) of a certain opacity corresponding to its value. For example, [tex] would be red with an opacity of 30%, [tex] would be red with an opacity of 60%, etc.  My question is: Is this linear mapping the most accurate in terms of how people sense opacity? That is, does [tex] look like its ""half"" as much as [tex]? Or do people perceive opacity like they perceive sound -- I know that sound is perceived logarithmically (see the decibel scale). "
1971,How do afternoon naps fit in with segmented sleep?,"Both segmented sleep and afternoon naps are recommended over a monophasic eight-hour block of sleep, but I don't see how they fit in with each other. Segmented sleep is the theory/hypothesis that people naturally sleep for four hours, stay awake for two, and then sleep for another four hours. There are references to ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" in many pieces of literature. But articles about segmented sleep don't really mention afternoon naps, even though they're supposed to be natural too. People feel more tired in the afternoon regardless of when they had lunch.  Are segmented sleep and afternoon naps mutually exclusive (e.g., if you sleep in segments you don't feel like taking an afternoon nap, and vice versa)? Is there evidence that people took siestas historically (before street lighting)? "
1972,How to compare cumulative sleep debts?,"Let's say that after a period of sleeping perfectly, I sleep for the following amount of hours on some consecutive days. (Let's say the optimal hours I sleep is 8 hours. For the sake of simplicity, all the hours of sleep have equal quality.)  How tired would I be at the end compared to the other option? How much sleep deprivation would I need to get in one night to get a similar level of sleep deprivation as the several consecutive nights?   6 hours one night, and 6 hours the next  versus 7, 7, 7, 7  6, 7  versus 7, 6  9, 7  versus 8, 8    I'm fairly sure it's not just a simple sum of debt. There was an experiment that showed that two weeks of sleeping six hours a night was equivalent to staying up all night. Is there some formula or some general principles to go by then? "
1973,Generate 2D grid with alternation probability,"I want to generate a 2D grid environment with rewards distributed (1s are rewards, 0s are no rewards) based on an alternation probability as defined in this paper by Falk and Konald ([website]"
1974,"Does the scarcity of female programmers, suggest that men are more intelligent than women?","   Developing software is simultaneously artistic and scientific, which accounts for its appeal for some of the smartest and intuitive people on the planet   There is a generally observable and most likely a statistically provable scarcity of women in the programmer community.  Would it be right to conclude from this that men are generally more intelligent than women? If so, what's the cause of this? And if not, why? "
1975,Is it normal for men in long term relationships to want to have sexual relationships with other women?,"If a man who is married or in a long term relationship wants to have sexual relationships with other women, is this pathological, deviant, maybe even a disorder? Or is it part of normal and healthy male sexuality? "
1976,How to ethically research the effect of expert lies on lay people,"I'm conducting a study about the effects of a verbally administered placebo.  The actual setting and intervention are different from the example I give here, but similar enough that the example may serve as a basis for discussion.  In the study, a team of psychologists running a local practice offers a new experimental service. The psychologists have developed a diagnostic tool that allows them to predict with surprising accuracy if a single person will fall in love within the upcoming four weeks. To further test and refine this diagnostic tool they now offer a public service after having tested it on a small sample of students. So they invite local residents to their practice to be tested through an advertisement and offer them a free diagnosis, whether or not they will fall in love within the next two weeks. The participants are told that the diagnostic tool for this prognosis is being evaluated in its predictive power and that they should report back after four weeks and tell the researchers if they had fallen in love or not.  Of course there is no diagnostic tool. The psychologists believe that they are being perceived as experts by the laypeople, and that if they make such a prediction after some impressive psychological examination, this prediction will cause people to fall in love, if without this intervention they would not have, or remain ""out of love"", if they had fallen in love.  Obviously, the researchers do not want to give negative (not fall in love) prognoses, because they do not want anyone to refuse and miss out on an ""offer"" they would have been happy about. (They do not believe that they will cause people to fall in love with unsuitable suitors and cause grief, only that participants with a will-fall-in-love prognosis will react more benevolently and accepting to offers they receive.) And, in the absence of negative prognoses, the researchers will need a control group that receives no prediction, but still reports back after two weeks.  The psychologists do not know how to set up this experiment so that they can give positive (fall in love) diagnoses or no diagnosis to random participants, without raising suspicion. Some of the patients will obviously know each other and talk about this experimental ""service"", and they will notice that they know no one with a negative diagnosis. That would seem odd to them. Also the reason to not give a diagnosis to many participants must be valid without raising doubt regarding the validity of the prognoses that were given.  What would you tell your participants to allay their doubts over the absence of negative prognoses? And how would you explain that often you do not give a prognosis, without invalidating the prognoses you give?    Note  Since the ethic concerns are being pushed to the forefront of the discussion, I have edited my question to include an example that more closely resembles the real research. Yet, I want to repeat that this is an example only, so please don't get hung up on the specifics of falling in love. The real study includes psychologists and a behavior prediction, but not about falling in love. Similar research has been done in a laboratory setting, the difference is I want to do it out ""in the field"".  If you are worried about psychologists lying to their participants, you need to understand that cover stories are a common method in psychological research. They are in fact so very common, that it is easier to list instances where cover stories are not used: only if the knowledge of the purpose of the study cannot falsify the results are participants told in advance what is being studied and how. In all other cases the researchers lie to the participants and debrief them after the experient.  Of course, if there is any danger that this lie would have lasting or strong negative effects, such research will not be conducted.  You can safely assume that   participants will be informed that they are taking part in an experiment and asked to give their consent (this is easily part of the cover story, as it allows to not give a prognosis to some of the participants) participants will be debriefed by a trained psychologist participants will be given contact information and told to contact a team member when they observe any kind of effect at all, positive or negative (since we want to measure these effects, this is easily part of the cover story) an ethics commitee of our university will evaluate the study design   Since similar ""lies"" have been told to participants of other experiments before, I am quite confident that this study will be approved by our ethics committee also. Here is an example of a study where the researchers lied to the participants about their sleep quality: [website]There are also many examples of research, where researchers actually induce negative (i.e. unwanted by the participants) effects in their participants. A recent example is experimentally lowering self-esteem: [website]"
1977,Do our brains have difficulties detecting no?,"In most business seminars, or in movie the secret, for example, it is said that if we want to be rich we need to believe we want to be rich.  We got to want peace, not anti war. We got to be pro wealth, not anti poverty.  It is said that our subconscious mind can't process not.  So, anti war means want war. Anti poverty means pro poverty.  Is this true?  Which part of our brain subconciously guide us to the outcome we imagine? Is there such thing? Is it true that it cannot process no? "
1978,Are there samples of false but beneficial beliefs?,"Many people have false beliefs.  The fact that they have those shows that those beliefs may carry some evolutionary advantage.  If so, how?  How can false beliefs be profitable? "
1979,Brainwave audio recordings and beta waves: how do they affect positivity?,"I know a little bit about negative and positive energies of human bodies and how it all works. Recently, on Facebook, I saw an ad promoting some sort of audio recording and that it has something to do with the beta waves.  They claimed,      Listen to the 15-minute demo once per day, every day, for at least the next seven days. You'll soon start noticing the subtle, positive differences, if you haven't already.   So I downloaded that audio clip (15 minutes long), expecting it to be something relaxing.  As it turned out, it was the sounds of waterfalls, leaves and trees for the whole 15 minutes.  Even though I like this 15 minute sound clip, I wonder how this could help in improving positivity if we listen to it regularly?  This is the whole text that I received as e-mail after signing up for the AD,     Some people report feeling much more relaxed. Others feel that time speeds up -- or slows down. Almost everyone reports that it's an enjoyable experience! And what about the sounds of rustling leaves and trickling waterfalls? We travelled to Derbyshire, in the heart of rural England, and spent a month capturing the natural sounds used in the BrainEv program. But what you might not realize is...There's actually much, much more going on in the background! You see, the sounds of the streams and trees are really just a rich ""sound mask"" for the powerful brainwave recordings that are playing in the background. Let me explain a little more...Your brain cells all talk to each other using tiny little electrical signals. With billions of these brain cells talking at once, that's a pretty significant amount of electrical activity -- and can be detected with an EEG machine. This electrical activity is what we call a brainwave. And the brainwave frequencies change, depending on what state you're in. When you're happy, when you're focused, when you're asleep -- your brainwaves all have very specific frequencies. And here's the exciting part. Using a science known as 'brainwave entrainment', we can now create special brainwave audio recordings, which play specific frequencies to the brain. The brain copies these frequencies, and effectively RECREATES the original brainwave pattern. That means we can recreate brainwave patterns that help you relax and release stress... that activate your intelligence... that improve your mood... that help you feel more focused during the day. Not only that, but by accessing these peak performance states on a daily basis (as with the BrainEv program), they'll start becoming second nature -- and available to you literally on-demand.  "
1980,What makes some things more fun than others universally?,"Recently I have been presented with the question, ""What makes something addictive, and why are some activities more addicting than others?"" This question intrigues me, as logically, the answer would be along the lines of, ""The mind has a constant desire / falsified need to go through the experience of the activity."" And if you think about it, that's just a definition of what causes addiction.  My question is: what makes some fun things addictive and some things not, and overall, ""What is fun?"" For example, your average adolescent would find playing video games, watching television and communicating through social media ""fun"", while also finding recreational activities like drawing, playing sports, and, say, board games ""fun"". Why then is the former list addicting and the latter non-addictive?  If any activity the mind desires, once achieved, can be described as ""fun"", then why aren't some things addictive? And since some people find, say, studying or even work ""fun"", then if some routine is made out of it, isn't it possible to become addicted to these activities?  Is it possible to channel our desires, define what we find fun, and choose our addictions? "
1981,"Regarding ""a human brain can hold enough information to fill 10 libraries"", can we quantify the memory required for a given task?","It is not the exact phrase, but I have heard variations of this claim. I am wondering whether such claim is supported by a study or experiment. I am also curious if there is a way to sort of vaguely quantify memory. In other words, is there a way to know how much memory/resources a type of task occupies? For example, is it possible to know experimentally whether the muscle memory required to play a piano needs more memory/resources than the memory needed to read a piano sheet?  "
1982,How and why can movies take us out of our everyday physical reality and into a fantasy world?,"Have you ever experienced that feeling after watching a really great movie (somewhat like a dramatic one) that after watching the movie, you got carried away? Even though the movie ended well in a happy ending, there is that feeling inside you that remained. The feeling can't be explained, but the sad part of the movie remained somewhat. What do you call that feeling, and is there any explanation for this?  How and why can movies take us out of our everyday physical reality and into a fantasy world, so that when the movie ends, we are left feeling dissociated from our own lives, feeling feelings that don't belong to us, but to the fictional characters from the movie?

1983,Do different methods of testing memory for character sequences result in different brain activation?,"Assume a certain sequence of N characters, displayed on a screen one by one, that should be memorized. The speed of the display is such that it doesn't produce much extra stress. You may assume that the test person might vary display speed within a reasonable range.   There are several ways to test memory:   A multiple choice format that presents several control sequences. A control sequence where you should point out differences from a given sequence. A control sequence, displayed character by character, and the opportunity to push a button as soon as you spot a difference. Write down what you've memorized.   Do these different ways of testing activate different parts of the brain? If so, where in the brain do these differences occur? "
1984,Is there any plausible answer for naturally explaining veridical perception in near death experiences?,"Is there any way to explain veridical perception in near death experiences and out of body experiences, naturally? Or is it strong evidence that the mind is a soul? "
1985,Is there any evidence to suggest telling puns to a child makes them enjoy it when they are older?,"My own experience was that my father and grandfather retold many puns as I was in my childhood and teens; at the time, I thought it was abysmal.   Now I think they're the funniest things ever.   Is there any evidence to suggest that telling puns to children makes them enjoy those puns when they are older? I.e., are puns 'conditioned'? "
1986,How does our brain consider something to be funny?,"What makes something that we watch (a clown's antics, hidden camera pranks, etc.), hear (jokes), read (satire), or do (pranks) be perceived as funny?  Even babies find certain actions and sounds funny, and they will laugh.  Is there a common attribute in all of the above which triggers a canonical funny trigger? If so, what is it? "
1987,Is there evidence to suggest that music can trigger release of a particular kind of neurotransmitter?,"I've recently listened to a podcast, ""The music in your brain"", in which Dr. Daniel Levitin suggests that:   Soothing music can trigger release of oxytocin Sad music triggers release of prolactin  An unknown kind of music triggers release of dopamine.   This may be related to my previous question about ""psychoactive music""  Is there evidence to support the claim that music can trigger the release of specific neurotransmitters in the brain? "
1988,"Can reduced cognitive load lead to some kind of mental or physical ""atrophy""?","Muscles, if you don't use them, degenerate. Everyone who has had a broken leg in a cast for a few weeks and then seen the thin stick that reemerged once the cast was removed, can attest to that fact.  But does the same happen to the brain? Does mental ability or brain matter atrophy, if life is to easy for us because all the products we use are so highly usable that we don't have to think anymore? "
1989,What are shortcomings of query bases tools for measuring Situation Awareness?,"A review compared many different ways for assessing Situation Awareness (SA), such as query based tools, external observers and self-report tools.  The paper argues that query based tools, such as the SAGAT (Endsley, 1988) and the (SPAM; Durso et al., 2004), are the most reliable way of assessing SA, compared to the other methods. What are the shortcomings of these query based methods, however?    References  Durso, F. T., Dattel, A. R., Banbury, S., &amp; Tremblay, S. (2004). SPAM: The real-time assessment of SA.

1990,Jung - Anima and Animus,"In the book Man and His Symbols Jung discusses the Anima and Animus extensively.  As I understand it they are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the collective unconscious.  The Anima is expressed as the inner feminine personality in the unconscious of man; the Animus as the inner masculine personality of the unconscious of female  I found it strange that Jung only talks about the Anima in terms of the male psyche, and the Animus in term of the female psyche.  My question is why isn't there an Animus concept in the male psyche or an Anima concept in the female psyche?  Where is the archetype of the male part of the male unconscious and the female part of the female unconscious? Is that just another piece of the psyche the Jung defines as part of the Self?  Where does the Animus live in the male total psyche?  "
1991,Chess to enhance human cognitive abilities?,"There are texts that advise chess playing with children and mature people. Should I take them seriously? Why should chess improve your intellect. For instance, I would like to be able to read and understand technical texts quickly. Should I learn playing chess for that? In this text for instance, they hype all kinds of advantages that is given to you by chess, but, they raise right questions in the end: is Grand Master anyhow better in solving non-chess problems? and Are then a Grand Master because they have high IQ inherited from the nature? and, in the course of trolling, conclude that ""you must go and buy a chess board"". This leaves me puzzled if the effect that they hyped exists indeed.  "
1992,Cognitive models for transfer of skills,"Recently a question was asked about the benefit of playing chess on cognitive abilities. More specifically, how chess would improve understanding technical texts. Many other questions are also focused on learning and skim the topic of transfer of learning (e.g. Does learning one discipline improve performance in another discipline?, Why is training better when following an easy-to-difficult schedule?, How does task difficulty schedule affect the rate and efficiency of perceptual learning? ). However, it is not entirely clear to me how transfer can be explained, independent of the type of tasks.   What does recent scientific research say about transfer of skill, or are there cognitive models that help explain it? "
1993,Is there a reasonably easy way to get emotions from EEG?,"I am building a project to visualise brain data from EEG, specifically emotions. I have found a significant numbers of papers that describe methods that include pre-processing, feature extraction and classification to get a 2 dimensional affect-valence measure.  However the methods in the papers are too complex for a programmer who doesn't specialise in EEG and they don't describe the details of the process.  Is there a way that one can turn either raw data or frequency band data into an emotional readout? I have access to the Emotiv Insight (5 channel) and the Muse (4 channel). It's not for a scientific purpose, so it doesn't need to be too exact. A crude guess would do.  I have found this paper from 2001 which describes a method using the frontal lobes which I might be able to reproduce. However the reason it is easy to implement is because it lacks the machine learning and processing that more contemporary papers have to classify EEG data into emotion.

1994,Why do we need to break down long sentences to understand them?,"Why do we need to break down long sentences that won't immediately scan? Is it an attention thing? Working memory, executive function?  For example:     Studies show that if there are many stimuli present (especially if they are task-related)..."".     is a straightforward sentence. The only ambiguous term is ""they"". Does it mean ""studies"" or ""stimuli""? In this case it is, obviously, stimuli, but the issue seems to be that i need to read the ""they"" slower, and am not primed to. What part of cognition is being tested? "
1995,Why do children tend to choose the last option in a two-alternative forced choice task?,"If I ask my toddler if she wants bananas or apples, she will consistently choose apples. The same goes for colors, other related objects, or even seemingly unrelated items - She always chooses last.  Why is she biased to choose the last option? Is this bias specific to children, or is it a common phenomenon in adults too?  Is it related to Modality effect? "
1996,How do people navigate the social world and find people who are similar?,"I have taken enough psychology courses to know that people are attracted to those similar to them in personality, attitudes, and important values but no one explains how they accurately judge such characteristics (i.e. the process through which this occurs).  How do people find those who are similar in friendship and in particular potential romantic partners when they have very limited information? Is it really solely due to proximity? Are those near us more likely to be similar to us?  But I am especially curious about more superficial initial attractions such as physical appearance. How on earth do people manage to judge similarity from physical features?  "
1997,Does not consistently providing a reward strengthen operant conditioning?,"When learning about Operant Conditioning, I remember being taught that not consistently rewarding the desired behavior could (seemingly counterintuitively) actually increase the strength of learning the conditioned behavior. Is this correct?  If this is correct, is it more effective to begin providing a reward at or near 100% of the time the conditioned behavior is performed, and then slowly reduce the amount to a lower percentage? Or is it more effective to simply start with a lower percentage? "
1998,What term describes the discrepancy in reported intention to vote and actual voting behaviour?,"I am interested in prediction markets, where traders have a monetary incentive to bet on who they think would win in an election. I think that the financial incentive in prediction markets makes them a better predictor of future election outcomes than polls.  I think that when people are asked how they would vote on the presidency if tomorrow were the election day, they tend to give you an answer which they would like to see happen rather than how they would actually vote.  This discrepancy reduces the predictive value of polls.  Alternatively, I think that if the incentives are set correctly the same people tell you more of the truth instead of their wishful thinking. I would call this phenomena ""polls bias"".  Questions:   What is a scientific term for this problem? Where can I read further about the phenomena?  "
1999,"Can one ""understand"" emotions, yet not ""feel"" them?","Prometheus Viral Clip #3 - David is a good clip of a fictional character in a science-fiction movie that helps frame my question; but I am interested in the general question, not the specifics of this movie.  An robot named David claims to ""understand human emotions, although [he] does not feel them [himself].""  I personally feel as though his claim is false - I would argue that to be able to state an understanding of human emotions, one must [have the capacity to?] feel them oneself. Is there existing knowledge or papers on this matter?  When asked what makes David sad, he responds with things like war and poverty. When asked if David would like to supply any additional statements before ending the feed, he expresses ""gratitude"" explicitly. If one ""is"" sad, isn't one by definition, ""feeling"" sadness?     Related questions  Are there emotions that only some people can feel? "
2000,What form might Jungian archetypes take in the brain?,"Modern psychology and psychiatry are very well grounded in scientific principles.  Both, however, have a history in various analytical philosophies.  Jung had the notion of an archetype, a universally known symbol.  While these are perhaps fanciful concepts, I think that it can be interesting to try to reconcile them in terms of current knowledge.    A modern author (Knox 2001) makes the following assessment:     I suggest that although, like Freud, Jung contradicted himself at times, there is a lot of evidence that he viewed archetypes as innate predispositions with an organizing function.  I think it is one of the possible models for archetypes that we need to research extensively by investigating the ways in which an understanding of 'frames' and image schemas may advance our concept.  We need to gain a clearer understanding of the extent to which archetypes are 'hard-wired', genetically inherited structures or, on the other hand, self-organizing patterns that emerge as a central part of the development of meaning by the human brain as...recently proposed.   I think the arguments about genetically driven versus self-organizing patterns are fascinating, but in this question, I'd like to presuppose the latter.    If these patterns were to exist, what sensory modalities would be stored in combination?  Are they exclusively visual, or is there a tight binding between the visual and auditory components of these memories?  Could different memories be combinations of modular archetypal ""bases"" or would each be unique?     Knox, J.M. (2001).

2001,Is there a region of cortex which over a period of development becomes the seat of self?,"Background  Mountcastle's hypothesis, which is based on the observation of uniform cortical anatomy, suggests that the there might be a uniform cortical ""algorithm"". The only reason that some cortical regions seem to be specialized for particular functions, like vision, hearing, etc. is that they happen to be connected to corresponding sensory input. The ferret sensory input rewiring experiments confirms this hypothesis (rewiring auditory cortex in ferrets to receive visual input, lets them see just as good).   Regions of the cortex which are not connected directly to any sensory input listen in on the broadcasts that are sent by neighboring regions, either directly or through the thalamus (which is currently thought to be some sort of relaying mechanism) and do further transformations and refinements at a more abstract level. For example in the case of vision, it is known that the primary visual cortex, V1, consists of a sheet of cells/columns that are sensitive to edges oriented and/or moving in particular directions. The ""higher"" regions of visual cortex, take the output of V1 and further process it. Neurons in V4, for example, are known to be sensitive to objects like a chair or a dog or your grandmother. Much of this is discussed in detail by Jeff Hawkins in On Intelligence where he speculates that cortical regions are connected up in a hierarchy something like:    Hawkins, however, does not talk much about that top level region, and only makes a passing speculation that it might be the hippocampus. But, it seems to be screaming at you, that whatever it is, it must be the seat of the self.   Googling on these ideas led me to Cartesian Theater, a term that philosopher, Daniel Dennett derisively uses to refer to the idea that there is a central place in the brain, where everything comes together. For example, in the Multiple drafts model Dennett says:     ""The multiple drafts model of consciousness was developed as an   alternative to the perennially attractive, but incoherent, model of   conscious experience called Cartesian materialism, the idea that after   early unconscious processing occurs in various relatively peripheral   brain structures ""everything comes together"" in some privileged   central place in the brain, which one might call the Cartesian Theater   -- for ""presentation"" to the inner self or homunculus. There is no such place in the brain, but many theories seem to presuppose that   there must be something like it.""   However, I didn't find his arguments very compelling.  Question  Given that there are regions of cortex that are dedicated to vision, sound, touch processing, etc., is there a region of cortex, that listens to only the final assembled portions from several ""lower"" regions of cortex, which then over a period of development (by age 1.5?) becomes the seat of self?   If this is the case, Dennett's criticism of the Cartesian Theater and a 'homunculus' observing it is outdated.  Update  I believe the source of all the homunculus confusion to be the little green homunculus in Men In Black I, and Daniel Dennett's use of this imagery to caricature any argument for a region in the brain where everything comes together and therefore being the seat of the self.   In essence what I'm saying is that only a small subset of the brain is the seat of consciousness, the reason being that large portions of the cortex seem to essentially be doing pre-processing steps. For example, V1 the largest area of the cortex seems to be assembling the visual field from the split up portions coming from the eye via the LGN in the thalamus.   This by itself does not lead to an infinite regress, as the problem (of making sense of the world) is simplified a lot after all the pre-processing steps.   Another way of putting my point is via the following simple analogies:  | body        | brain                         | Self      | |-------------+-------------------------------+-----------| | corporation | executive staff               | CEO       | | army        | officer corps                 | General   | | nation      | congress/senate/supreme court | President |   Some more clarification on the homunculus fallacy confusion:  Almost everyone agrees that no fallacy whatsoever is being made by saying that the brain is the seat of consciousness (SoC). Similarly, no fallacy is made merely by claiming that a subset of the brain is the SoC. A homunculus fallacy is made if it is further claimed that by identifying the SoC, an explanation of consciousness has been given. As Dennett rightly says, an explanation of consciousness should not contain components that are themselves fully conscious. Doing so only postpones the problem and leads to infinite regress. In my question's background, I'm not trying to imply that I have explained consciousness, all I'm saying is that there is evidence that only a subset of the brain is the SoC, and this SoC could be regarded as being at the center of a Cartesian theater. And of course, instead of light and sound being projected/played in this theater, there are only streams of neural spikes, representing light, sound, etc. in transduced form.   "
2002,"Why do participants prefer to give input values that are ""round numbers""?","Background  I have just been analysing some data where participants attempt to control a dynamic system with integer numeric inputs between 0 and 100. I've noticed that there is a general tendency for participants to give responses that are divisible by 10 (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 30, etc.). After that participants' second favourite input values are those divisible by 5 but not by 10 ( e.g., 5, 15, 25, 35, etc.). After that excluding some general patterns in the data, all the other input numbers appear about equally common (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, etc.).  Perhaps in a related way, I can also remember from market research that when you ask people how often they do certain things, as the number gets larger, they will often show a similar tendency to approximate and use numbers divisible by 10 or 100 and so on.  I also seem to remember reading research where people report number of sexual partners, where a similar tendency was observed.  Thus, this tendency is consistent with a preference for what are informally referred to as ""round numbers"", where as in Wikipedia it is argued that ""a number ending in 5 might be considered in a way more ""round"" than one ending in neither 0 nor 5. ""  Question   What explains people's general tendency to prefer certain input values when trying to control a system (e.g., numbers divisible by 10 or 5)? Is there any specific research that has quantified this effect in another system control task? Does a similar mechanism underlie the popularity of such numbers in a system control task as does in a frequency estimation task?  "
2003,Where does the distinction between motives and goals lie in activity theory?,"Activity has an hierarchical structure, and can be analyzed at different levels: activities, actions and operations. (Leontiev 1974)   (source: interaction-design.org)  The top level is activity itself, oriented towards its motive. At a lower level lie conscious goal-directed actions that must be undertaken to fulfill the object. Goals can be decomposed into sub-goals, and so forth, meaning actions can have a hierarchical structure of their own. At the lowest level lie automatic processes which happen subconsciously, called operations. This is how actions are eventually carried out.  I'm not entirely sure where the distinction lies between motives and goals. A motive is an object that meets a certain need of the subject, while actions are goal-directed processes that must be undertaken to fulfill the object. (Kaptelinin 2009)  It seems like as long as a certain action has some underlying higher motive it is only part of an activity, while as no higher motive can be identified it should be considered an activity instead.   Do you arbitrarily decide on what to define the activity, and what to define as the underlying actions? How does e.g. a potential underlying motive for all actions as 'survival' fit into this picture?    Leontiev, Aleksei N. (1974). The Problem of Activity in Psychology. Soviet Psychology, 13, 4-33.

2004,How can I use gamification to encourage people to complete workplace training?,"I am looking for ways to improve the likelihood people will perform mundane but required workplace training. I am looking into gamification techniques.   My organisation requires that employees complete short online learning courses (think Health and Safety, Security Awareness, Risk Management, Company culture). We often find it a struggle to ensure everyone completes the required courses on schedule.  Admittedly the courses themselves can be a little dry. I can't change that yet. However I want to find some ways to improve the rate at which people complete the tasks.  I am familiar with gamification techniques and concepts.    What specific techniques and concepts of gamification might work in increasing training compliance?  what do I need to keep in mind when implementing them?  "
2005,What is the correlation between feeling superior and well-being?,"I have noticed in myself and others, when people perceive themselves as ""better off"" than the majority of others (e.g., smarter, better looking, higher social status, better brain function, more insight, more capable, etc.) they tend to feel greater  well-being, peace, and self-assurance.   Are there any studies on this?  Is it just primal parts of the brain being activated?  If so, how can we activate that without the external circumstance?   EDIT For example, just found this one: [website]"
2006,How long does it take to read a sentence with X number of characters?,"How does the time needed to read a sentence scale with the number of characters? Or does this time scaling depend on something more than just character count?  For example, let [tex] be the number of characters and [tex] the seconds to read an entire sentence of [tex] characters long. There are 3 options:   Linear [tex]:  Is the relationship linear? That is, if it takes 0.5 seconds to read ""hello"", it would take 1.0 second to read ""hello world"": [tex] Sublinear [tex]: Or does it decay? That is, as people read a long sentence, their reading speed increases (crazy example [tex]) Super-linear [tex]: Or is it like quadratic? That is, each additional character ads more time than the previous word? (example: [tex])   Which of the above 3 options best describes reading speed based on length of text? Is the specific functional form of this relationship known?    Motivation  I am creating an iPhone app where I need to show transient confirmation messages. For example, when a user submits a comment, I pop up a message saying ""thanks for submitting your comment"". Shortly after, the message will fade away. There exist many such transient messages all over my iPhone app.   What I would like to do is to calculate the optimal time to show each message based off of the number of characters in that message. I want users to have enough time to comfortably read the message, but not so long that the message annoys them. The purely UX version of this question is here:  How long does it take to read X number of characters? "
2007,Do we recognize ourselves better when we see our mirror image?,"A friend of mine recently noticed that we both have a birthmark on the face.

2008,Medium-term effects of polyphasic sleep on performance,"Typical sleep patterns of one big block of 6 to 9 hours with no naps is usually referred to as monophasic sleep. A second natural sleep pattern is biphasic sleep which breaks up your sleep into two chunks (Wehr, 1992; Ekirch, 2001). My question concerns polyphasic sleep which partitions your sleep in 3 or more periods during the day.  From personal experience (and anecdotal evidence; this is a popular blogging topic), I know that the first one to two weeks of trying to keep a difficult polyphasic sleep schedule (say uberman that divides your day into 6 evenly spaced half-hour naps) produces very low performance. At first you are unable to fall asleep and you need your alarm clock to wake up and you feel groggy, agitated and slow. However, after the first week, a lot of these negative effects seem to disappear as you grow accustomed to the schedule. You start to get very vivid dreams during your naps (and I started to wake without the need for alarm clock) suggesting REM sleep. However, I have never subjected myself to proper performance tests while attempting polyphasic sleep.  What are the medium term (more than 2 weeks, less than a year) effects of polyphasic sleep on performance of tasks like working memory, reading speed and comprehension, and IQ tests?  Unfortunately, most sleep studies are less than two weeks in duration and report the obvious negative effects; except on working-memory which benefits from naps. Alternatively, they are military studies that only track vigilance (not having micro-sleeps)(Porcu et al., 1998; Rhodes &amp; Gil, 2003) , or have physical measures of no interest to me (Stampi, 1989).

2009,Is there a foveal explanation for the duck-rabbit illusion?,"Myself when I look at the duck-rabbit image, I see a duck if focus on the left (i.e. the beak) or a rabbit if I focus on the right (the nose).    Is this how it works for most people, i.e. is the foveal shift what drives the change in interpretation? (I obviously meant to ask if there's an empirical study on this.) If so, is the duck-rabbit a part of a wider class of illusions that rely on smaller or larger changes in what's foveated? "
2010,How do you predict a cognitive bias theoretically using dual process theory?,"Disclaimer: I am a complete layman in psychology, with no education in the field whatsoever. This question was prompted by my reading Kahneman's ""Thinking Fast and Slow"", in which he discusses the model of System 1 and System 2 extensively.   I thought many of the cognitive biases and other psychological effects were fascinating to read about, and I really enjoyed it. But every time he brought the ""two systems"" into the discussion of a particular cognitive bias (such as the affect heuristic or hindsight bias), it felt like he was using it as a post hoc explanation of how the effect could be described by certain characteristics of the two systems. It was never clear to me how you can show that the dual process implies the existence of the discussed effect.  I think he did a far better job showing how certain psychological effects result from prospect theory. It's easy to show, for example, how prospect theory implies the endowment effect, as shown in the given link. Even though knowledge of the endowment effect existed before prospect theory, it's easy to see how the endowment effect could have been predicted by prospect theory. You can even prove that it would exist, given the utility function of prospect theory and the right axioms.  But I'm confused about how you can do the same with dual process theory, and the cognitive biases that it supposedly explains. How can you use dual process theory to predict the existence of a cognitive bias? Are there examples of cognitive biases that were, or can be explicitly predicted using DPT?   If this is just a poorly framed question--if predicting cognitive biases is not one of the purposes of the theory--then what is the purpose of dual process theory?    EDIT: I want to make a few clarifications here. My concern is neither with the predictive success of DPT - or other theories to which I compare it - nor is it with whether the things that DPT can predict have already been discovered before DPT. The example I used - prospect theory, and its ""prediction"" of the endowment effect - is both retroactive (the effect was known before the theory), and according to the answer by Fizz, has questionable predictive verification. However, the manner by which you can use the theory to make the prediction is quite clear. If we assume the value curve given by prospect theory, and the claim of prospect theory that a person's perceived value of a gain or loss is relative to their current position rather than absolutely dependent on the final state, then it follows logically that an individual's perceived gain in value for acquiring something is lower than their perceived loss in value for losing the same thing. This can be answered in theory, on pen and paper, given the framing of the scenario and the axioms of prospect theory.  With dual process theory I want to understand:   what kind of predictions it can make about human behavior how to make those predictions using the theory   Since this is seemingly a very celebrated modern theory of human behavior, I just want to know how it's used. I don't mind if every known consequence of dual process theory was discovered before the theory, nor do I mind if the method is not as rigorous as that of a physics theory. "
2011,Psychological effects of statutory rape - differences by gender?,"Occasionally, criminal cases where female teachers have sex with male students make the news. I have the impression that many people are much less critical of that than when the victim is female, and some say they'd have been thrilled at the prospect of that happening to them when they were teenage boys.  I don't see the same happening when girls get raped by their teachers; I don't see similar jealousy from women. That makes me wonder: is there a significant difference in the psychological effects of statutory rape on teens, assuming the teens saw the rape as consensual from their perspective? Are there insights by gender on how many teens that were victims of statutory rape considered the events consensual (ignoring whether we would classify their ""consent"" as such in a cognitive-development sense), and how that affected the effects of the rape on their psyche?    Googling these issues brings up a large body of heavily political opinion with very scattered actual references and data that I could look into, and none of the material I could find addressed the questions I'm curious about scientifically. Even an article on psychologytoday.com that seemed relevant doesn't have any actual references to data or studies. An article on psychiatrictimes.com focused on female offenders and said nothing substantial about the effects on male victims, or how the effects compare to those experienced by female victims. I couldn't find any science-journalistic articles (or books) that would offer any insight better than those two.  scholar.google.com had a lot of material, most of it was focused on the experiences of females, and I couldn't find any that compared the effects on males and females, or that made any evaluation that took the willingness of the victims into account.  Basically, there's a lot of politicized material that's largely useless as a source of knowledge about the subject, and a decent amount of scientific material that I don't have the necessary skills and knowledge to evaluate or navigate.

2012,Dissecting human reaction time,"It's claimed that the average human reaction time in response to a visual stimulus is 0.25 seconds ([website]  Traditional  laboratory  estimates  suggest  that  it  takes  from  200-300  ms  to  pick  up  visual  information  about  an  uncertain  event  in  the  outside  world  and  to  use  this to  initiate  an appropriate  action   Do we know/have any way of knowing what percentage of this time is taken up by any given part of the reaction process? aka how much time is the eye converting what it sees, how much is the nerve signals doing their job and reporting to or from the brain, how much time does the brain spend processing, how much is the time the muscles take to contract, etc.?  I've been recently studying reaction times, so would be really interested in the breakdown of this total given time between the various processes involved. Can anyone help me out with this?

2015,In what contexts is loss aversion least controversial?,"Loss aversion (and related phenomena like the endowment effect) are somewhat controversial, it seems; from Wikipedia:     Recently, studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. In several studies examining the effect of losses in decision making under risk and uncertainty no loss aversion was found.[6] There are several explanations for these findings: one, is that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes; the other, is that the generality of the loss aversion pattern is lower than that thought previously. Finally, losses may have an effect on attention but not on the weighting of outcomes; as suggested, for instance, by the fact that losses lead to more autonomic arousal than gains even in the absence of loss aversion.[7] This latter effect is sometimes known as Loss Attention.[8] Even in a non-risky domain, prospective affective judgments about gains and losses show that loss aversion is magnitude dependent such that for low magnitudes there is no loss aversion [9]      Loss aversion may be more salient when people compete. Gill and Prowse (2012) provide experimental evidence that people are loss averse around reference points given by their expectations in a competitive environment with real effort.[10]      David Gal (2006) argued that many of the phenomena commonly attributed to loss aversion, including the status quo bias, the endowment effect, and the preference for safe over risky options, are more parsimoniously explained by inertia than by a loss/gain asymmetry. Gal and Rucker (2018) made similar arguments.[11][12]    So, are there some areas/contexts in which loss aversion isn't controversial? Large payoffs for instance? And are there enough studies to reliably conclude anything, e.g. via meta-analyses (say with moderator analysis)? "
2016,Is there some cognitive test besides (visual) working memory in which some animals are superior to humans?,"Assuming the research of Matsuzawa et al. (2007) (see also BBC video (2013)) isn't misleading, are there any other cognitive areas where chimpanzees (or other primates) have been observed to surpass humans?  For more context: trained chimpanzees seem to be able to memorize the random position on a screen of numbers from 1-9 in a very short amount of time, beating humans in the same test. There is one report from US researchers which could not replicate this though.  Based on those observations Matsuzawa has advanced the cognitive-tradeoff (evolutionary) hypothesis (there's a longer Vsauce video on that): essentially the idea is that humans ""gave up"" a good working visual memory for  improvements in other kinds of cognitive abilities (This formulation is a little improper since chimpanzees evolved separately from our common ancestor with them, hence the scare quotes.)   Anyway, I want to know if this is the only known cognitive phenomenon in which (some) animals beat humans. Since training does play a significant role in the research mentioned above (and this seems to be crux of the controversy surrounding), I'm lowering the bar to asking if trained animals can beat untrained humans on some other cognitive task. I still think this question is informative (e.g. with respect to the power of learning), even with a stacked deck training-wise. "
2017,Is there any research of spelling errors from a dual-process theory perspective?,"Checking the rather comprehensive but somewhat dated 2008 review of  Evans on dual-process theories, I didn't see anything about [mis]spelling.   But it seems to me an obvious thing to investigate from a dual-process perspective, because (in theory) the more elaborate rules you have to apply the more mistakes you're likely to make under time pressure.  So has anything like this been attempted?  Note that this is a little more sophisticated than simply asking if writing (never mind typing) faster results in more errors. You'd have to discern what's the likely cause of the errors, i.e. under time pressure, do you make more errors of the kind that require more complex ""graphotactic"" rules? "
2018,What causes us to perceive a person's gaze as meaningful?,"I have seen time and time again, both in literature and in conversations with people I know, people describing someone's eyes. What I mean is that I have come across phrases like ""Focused gaze"", ""Vacant gaze"", ""Fearful eyes"", ""Eyes lighting up"", ""Eyes glazed over"",etc. What exactly is it that causes one to perceive another's gaze as focused, vacant, etc? Is it how often and how much the pupils contract? Is it the frequency of saccades? Is it something else? What is it about the eyes that causes us to perceive a person's gaze as having a certain meaning? "
2019,Ethics of observing someone doing something with substantial risk,"This question about someone who wants to be put into an isolation chamber got me thinking about the ethics involved in observing someone doing something risky. If a participant approaches you about doing something dangerous, possibly with a high likelihood of death or permanent injury, and wants you to document it as an N-of-1 case study, are you ethically allowed to? For example, a terminally ill patient wants to expose themselves to high doses of a drug that may cure them, but will likely severely impair their cognitive function, lead and wants you to document their cognitive decline. How does one describe this to an IRB? Is it the same as studies of actively using addicts? "

2023,"Is the visual cortex of a newborn baby immediately capable of object detection or is this skill learned over time, and if so, how?","Is the visual cortex of newborn babies right off the bat capable of making sense of raw visual data, for instance, converting the constant stream of raw RGB images perceived by the eyes into a meaningful higher-level representation of objects in motion in a 3D world? Yes? No? If not, then does it mean this skill has to be developed over time by means of some learning mechanism?  If the visual cortex needs time to learn advanced visual skills, how does the actual learning mechanism work? Does the visual cortex have to optimize the connections between neurons, in a way analogous to how artificial neural networks optimize their parameters through backpropagation algorithm (machine learning)? If this is the case, then where does the visual cortex get its error signals from? To make the last question clear, in machine learning the typical approach is to compute the gradient of a loss function which compares the model's prediction with the ground truth, and the model's parameters are updated by moving the parameters in the direction of the gradient. If the visual cortex is learning advanced visual skills by virtue of a similar learning mechanism, then what kind of loss function is the visual cortex optimizing? "
2024,Why is median motor nerve conduction velocity about 50 m/s?,"I recently started reading Fitzgerald's clinical neuroanatomy and neuroscience (Mtui, et al. 2015) and reached chapter 12, electrodiagnostic examination, yesterday. The chapter deals, i.a., with nerve conduction studies and how to determine motor/sensory nerve conduction velocity (MNCV/SNCV). MNCV is about 50 m/s in a young, healthy adult as presented in the book. In a previous chapter, however, the reader is told that A[tex] axons have conduction velocities ranging from 80 - 120 m/s which I also verified.   Isn't this contradictory? How can median nerve MNCV be less than the previously mentioned velocity? I know there are several fibers of a different type in the median nerve but shouldn't much rather scattering occur?

2027,Relation of serotonin level and mood/depression,"Not a biologist. Not even related to science, however I read a lot of popular psychology stuff, plus read some info about antidepressants and a question tortures me :)  Antidepressants arise amount of serotonin in blood in short period of time. However, you should take antidepressants for quite a long period of time so that it took effect. Up to 1-4 months.  As I heard there is no explanation about this fact. On the one hand we know that serotonin affects our mood, on the other hand for some reason we cannot fix our mood by just increasing its level straight away.  So the question is: is there any explanation of this, and what I (as a non-scientist) am wondering more about is that why then we feel better after consuming such things as chocolate, sugar etc, which indirectly might increase serotonin level?   Plus, why we cannot consume large amounts of L-tryptophan for example? If I overdose tryptophan nothing scary happens, while if I overdose prozak or zoloft, I can end up with coma probably.  There are a lot of pop psychology articles talking about hormones, however I suspect that trying to change the level of hormones by some actions (which are advised by the articles, I don't know, starting from eating sweeties and ending with doing sports) won't change it much. I know that there should be some ""normal"" values of serotonin in blood (ng/mL). But I don't believe that if I go to sauna and eat snickers it will increase this level drastically :) Nevertheless I'll feel better. While if I take antidepressants and they will indeed increase the level, I won't feel happy right away. Why so? "

2030,Lowering people's serotonin levels does not change their mood?,"I'm starting to pick off sub-topics from this omnibus question, which I think it's too broad to answer properly/directly in the SE format.  So, let's start with one of the claims there:     Lowering people's serotonin levels does not change their mood.   What do we know, experimentally, about the effect(s) on mood of lowering serotonin in humans? And (yeah) although asking too many questions in one is a bad idea, in this case we would have to consider at least three scenarios to get a decent picture (because depression, for instance, is known to have a genetic/heritable vulnerability/component):   lowering serotonin in otherwise healthy volunteers, with no history of depression lowering serotonin in subjects with a history of depression lowering serotonin in SSRI (or similarly) medicated patients   Potentially, we could try to matrix the type of subjects with the type of intervention, although at the moment I can recall only one intervention that could (ethically) be used: depletion of tryptophan (which is serotonin precursor) via competition from other amino acids. (Selective) neurotoxins, which are used in some animal studies, being a rather obvious no-no in live human subjects.  And to the extent that one can address this concisely (if not perhaps suggest/ask a different question), what are the methodological limitations of such experiments? One that I can think of is that since antidepressants need a bit of time to build up their effects to clinically detectable mood changes, perhaps the same time-related issue holds in the opposite direction, i.e. how long serotonin depletion lasts potentially could matter for the mood outcome of such experiments.

But it's not too clear from that article how many people experience euphoria from oxygen deprivation. I'm pretty sure the loss of cognitive function is 100%, eventually, even though the dose/concentration might vary with the subject. But does everyone experience euphoria before that happens or does it happen just to some individuals with a certain vulnerability? This video suggests not everyone experiences euphoria, and if that's so what's the prevalence?  Optionally (i.e. if it's easy to answer based on the same source(s) for my main question), are there any proposed/studied pathways by which this euphoric consequence of oxygen deprivation might come about? And is it relevant to anything else, say to the ""choking game"" that some children (unfortunately) practice, or to asphyxiophilia/hypoxyphilia? "
2033,What is the term covering psychology disorders and language acquiring?,"I have a research article aimed for popular audience, whose bibliography contains:   3 works on borderline personality disorder 1 works on language (Hirsh, David, and Paul Nation. “What Vocabulary Size Is Needed to Read Unsimplified Texts for Pleasure?” Reading in a Foreign Language 8, no. 2 (1992): 689–96.) 1 vignette and poem book relating to the above topics   What is the correct umbrella term covers those topics, so that I can tag them in my BibTeX file?

2034,How are people working in psychophysics trained?,"It is unclear to me how people in psychophysics are trained. Are they psychologists, or physicists, or physicians, or biologists, or physiologists? Or can they be any of those?  What if someone doing psychophysics (according to his own accord) is making statements about biological pathology?  Is Psychophysics currently a credible scientific field? "
2035,Baby Names and the Hive Mind,"A couple of months ago my wife and I found out we were having a little girl and needed to start thinking seriously about picking some names. After going through a dictionary of names we narrowed it down a (long) shortlist. Interestingly almost every single name on one of the various 'Top Baby Names UK 2017' lists happened to appear on our shortlist. 8 out of the top 10 names below appeared on our list.  I'm assuming that this isn't coincidence and it's probably very common, hence the popularity of the names. What I struggle to understand is where the influence comes from.   I don't read celebrity magazines. I don't have lots of friends with children. None of these names are family tradition. I've never even met people with some of these names and some I've only met who are 80+ years old. Ava being a good example of that, it turns out for the last ten years, completely unbeknownst to me, every woman and her dog have been named Ava.  What is influencing our preferences and why does this convergence happen? "
2036,How does on one create a circumplex model (multiple answers)?,"Given a list of points with arousal and valence rankings, what is the best way of showing them on a circumplex model, given that they are already tagged with 1 out of 7 selected emotions, are they best plotted as a scatter plot with colors (should they also have lines connecting them to the ""idea"" locus) how should any groupings and variances be interpreted (knowing nothing about the data ahead of time) and what tools exist to do this already that do not need to be created from near scratch (there is no circumplex plot built into matlab)? Also, are there known absolute coordinates for any existing model as to where the labels go? "
2037,Does the brain's architecture change while growing up?,"If we are somehow able to record and store all the neural connection in the brain of a child and also the brain of the same individual when he is old will there be difference between the two ?  Is the brain capable to destroy and create neural networks (neurons) on its own, namely to store, process and retrieve memories? Or does it uses a fixed network instead, i.e., the network which each individual is born with )?  If the brain does create new networks, can you please provide a link to the resource where I can read this from ? "
2038,Procedures behind establishing the IQ scale,"There are some good answers about testing individual's intelligence, and about mathematics side of the IQ scale, e.g:     When current IQ tests are developed, the median raw score of the norming sample is defined as IQ 100 and scores each standard deviation (SD) up or down are defined as 15 IQ points greater or less,[2] although this was not always so historically. By this definition, approximately two-thirds of the population scores between IQ 85 and IQ 115, and about 5 percent of the population scores above 125.[3][4]   What I wanted to ask though, is the organizational/""political"" side of establishing the parameters of the test, the ""calibration"" procedure.    Who (organization/person/entity) establishes or updates the coefficients which make the average test score for given age to correspond to IQ of 100, and the standard deviation increments of 15? Who is the test group: how is the tested population providing the raw data for establishing the above selected? (in particular, how to avoid selection bias: people wanting to take IQ tests, because they are (rightly) expecting getting good result and thus bragging rights of high IQ; people of low IQ avoiding the expected effort, frustration and shame). How does that look on the international landscape; are the coefficients established ""per nation"" and computed by national organizations, or are they global, or some other form yet?  "
2039,What are the main theories that account for why some people like X and others not?,"For example, how does psychology account for why some people like peanuts and others hate them? This is a serious question, although perhaps naive.  Sure, there can be some physiological explanations relating to tastebud distribution, etc. There are also some more cognitive ones relating to memory, cultural values, etc. Nonetheless, the ""input"" (here: peanut) is the same, right?  So any theory that accounts for this must take into consideration physical and psychological parameters. "
2040,What is the neurophysiological mechanism behind double hearing?,"A patient with sensorineural hearing loss can have the symptom of hearing ""double"" in the damaged ear. Not having a time-delayed echo, but hearing as if he (or other people) speak with ""two voices"" at once.   Is there a theory about the mechanism behind this? Does it happen on the level of the malfunctioning hair cells, or because the brain has trouble remapping an incomplete input of frequencies, or something else?  "
2041,Result of local stimulation in brain,"What happens when we stimulate a brain in local regions? Some possibilities:    We may trigger an action without the subject's awareness of the action; We can trigger an action in a subject, but we cannot trigger a subject's will to perform this action; We can't trigger an action without awareness of subject; We cannot trigger an action without awareness of subject to his own action;   What are the results??  What I felt is 2, 4 are correct options because when some BMI devices are used subject is forcefully made to make a move. Here we are not changing his will to move but he is aware that he is moving. "
2042,Qualitative scoring for responses to design fluency task,"Before I can ask my questions, I have to give a little background information.  I'm involved in a study using a measure of design fluency.  Subjects are shown a page full of squares, like the one shown below.  Each square contains 5 dots.  Subjects are given 60 seconds to generate as many different designs as fast as they can by connecting dots in each square.  The criteria for correct designs are that the designs must contain 4 lines and that all the lines in the design must be continuous.  There are 2 trials in the test: one with 5 black dots and one with 5 black dots and 5 white dots.  In the second trial, the extra dots are included as form of interference.     Here are examples of correct designs produced in the first trial of the design fluency task.  Similar designs would be likely produced under the second trial.    The way this measure is usually quantified is by counting the number of correct designs produced.  However, I'm interested in looking at this task a little differently.  I want to know if members of a clinical group, say Alzheimer's disease (AD), will produce a quality of designs that is different than normal controls.  One way I thought about doing this was by looking at the frequency of designs produced.  This has been observed for tasks of verbal fluency, with patients with AD producing words of a greater frequency than controls.  The problem is that while counts of word frequency are readily available, there is no equivalent source for production on the design fluency task that I know of.  Here's how I thought about approaching this.  I'd start by taking the responses produced by a large number of controls and coming up with a way of classifying them, say 4 or 5 types of designs.  Then I'd count the number of times each of these design types occurred in the control sample and apply a weight to them so that design types with lesser frequency would have a greater weight (think inverse document frequency).  I'd then look at a smaller AD sample and a equivalent control sample matched on demographic variables.  I'd count the number of each design types produced by each subject in both groups, and multiply the number of each design type by the weight assigned to it.  The average frequency would be calculated for each subject for each trial type (the 5 dot trial and the 10 dot interference trial).  Group performance would then be compared in a repeated measures ANOVA.  There are the two questions that I have. The control sample that I have to determine the frequency of the design types is small: less than 70 subjects.  Is this too small for determining the frequency and weights of the design types?  Secondly, when comparing the clinical sample to a control sample, would it be possible to draw the small control sample from this larger control sample used to derive the frequency and the weights, or is there some reason that I should not do this?  Thanks in advance for your attention and response.  Any input would be greatly  appreciated.  I realize this question may be off topic for this site.  If you feel that's the case, would you mind suggesting a more appropriate forum.  I've previously posted this question on Cross Validated, with no replies, so I'm hopeful for better reception here. "
2043,Are adult negativity or resentment related to an infant crying for attention?,"I've recently came across an idea, expressed by a spiritual author Ekhart Tolle, that for adults, the internal experience of negativity or resistance to life situations can be far more harmful than the situation itself. Typically a person cannot take immediate action to resolve such situation.  For example, a loud car alarm outside interrupts some activity. A person may become focused on how inconvenient it is to hear this alarm, and start thinking negative thoughts, like ""I can't believe that jerk has such a loud alarm on that a piece of junk car. Who would steal such a thing? I wish someone would put a brick though his windshield"".  This got me thinking - What is the process by which negativity or resentment to situations arise in a person? The scenario of a crying infant came to mind - a baby cries to express some discomfort and frustration at a situation that the baby cannot fix himself. Are adult resentment and infant crying using the same pathways in the brain? "
2044,Is modality-specific working memory capacity correlated within individuals?,"The multi-component model of working memory posits different processes for phonological and visual working memory storage.   Working memory capacity can be measured in a variety of ways (see: How to reliably measure working memory capacity?), and we know that there is reliable individual variation on working memory capacity.   Is there a strong correlation of working memory capacity in different modalities within an individual? Put another way: If I have measured working memory capacity for an individual using a visual working memory task (like a Matrix span task), how reliably can I predict performance on a verbal working memory task for that individual? "
2045,Is it possible to master two different typing keyboard layouts?,"I am a good typist with qwerty keyboard, I came across other keyboard layouts (eg: Dvorak keyboard). I believe I will never be able to master these two typing layouts simultaneously.  Am I right? or is it possible to learn both and become a good typist (i.e type with decent speed without looking the keyboard).  The example in itself is trivial to me (I am happy with qwerty keyboards) but I wanted to understand what will happen when there is a serious overlap and contradiction with two methods and can human mind handle it or is it once set it's really set in situations like this?  If my mind can learn only one method when two contradicting and interfering methods are present, then I believe it's implications are very interesting.  There are real life examples which are similar to the keyboard example. They all have the following attributes. a) Two are more conflicting solutions for same problem b) Decisions must be automatic or made under tight time constraint (no time to think). "
2046,Optimal way to choose a number to be close to a randomly generated number,"The basis game: A number between 1 and 100 (presumably an integer) is randomly generated. You, along with other people, choose a number between 1 and 100, without knowledge of the other numbers chosen. The person who chose the number closest to the randomly generated number wins.  Assume for the questions that the other people are humans and not perfectly playing machines.   Q1.: What is the optimal number to choose?   Q2.: What is the optimal number to choose if we are also fine with getting second place ?  Part 2: We iterate this 5 times, without any knowledge of prior rounds (as in, we don't know who won in the prior rounds, and we don't know what others have chosen in the prior rounds. We can consider these rounds to be done simultaneously).  Q3: What is the optimal number to choose if we want to maximize our chances of winning at least one round?  Q4: What is the optimal number to choose if want to maximize our chance of either getting first or getting second in at least one round? "
2047,Hearing Loss and Potentially hearing more,"I've been diagnosed since I was younger (2nd grade) with a hearing impairment. Basically the nerve hairs on my cochlea are burned and I don't pick up 70% of the frequencies around me in my right ear.  My question is whether people can be born with a higher level of hearing? Or does it stop at 100% hearing, like 20/20 vision? "
2048,Can a person remember so much details as the guy in the Camus' Stranger?,"In the book, while in prison, he lives his days by his memories, thinking of his room, his furniture, the beach, each time recalling more details, imagining walking past it and this recalling took a big enough part of the day to keep him busy.     ""And the more I thought about it, the more I dug out my memory things   I had overlooked or forgotten. I realized then that a man who had   lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He   would have enough memories to keep him from being bored.""   I also read something saying that a person in a state of sensory deprivation, for example locked in dark, quite room, can remember a lot of things.  So how much truth is in the Camus's description and how much detail can a person generally remember about something he has seen a couple of times not really paying attention? If Camus was correct, if you do remember more than you can usually recall, then how do I recall at least half as much without being put in prison?  "
2049,What exactly is an astroglial calcium wave?,"There are quite a few conflicting reports as to what stimulates them, how they propagate, whether they communicate intercellularly, and what they look like.   The only consistent information I can find on them is that they propagate through the astrocyte at about 20 microns/sec.  Are they solitons? do they propagate intercellularly? Are they independent of neuronal input? Can the astroglial mesh be viewed as an astroglial field (obviously more speculative)?  "
2050,"Has the inverted spectrum thought experiment ever been conducted (and if not, why)?","The inverted spectrum thought experiment posits that you (the subject) wake up one morning to find that your colour spectrum (or some part of it anyway) has inverted.  This experiment has important implications for the idea of ""qualia"".  While we may not have a way to manipulate qualia directly, this experiment still seems like it would be valuable to conduct.  In Daniel Dennett's version of the experiment - ""alternative neurosurgery"" - he points out that you wouldn't know if your optic nerve was messed with, or your memories, and I would extend this to any apparatus that inverts spectrum at any point along the sensory pathway.  I imagine that the technology to develop goggles (similar to the prism glasses, colour filters, distortion lenses, etc, used in perceptual adaptation experiments) that invert colour is available.  However, I have not seen any reference to such an experiment being conducted.  Has it?  And if not, why not?  Are there practical limitations?  It seems to me that the construct of qualia hinges on there being some property of experience that is independent of behaviour/function/physical state, and the subjective experience of colour is often touted as a perfect example of this, via the inverted spectrum experiment.  So then the practicality of this experiment - whether or not an inversion of some kind is possible without a functional impact - is crucial.  If the experiment cannot be conducted because no inversion exists that can be done without functional impact, then it would constitute a severe blow to qualia as independent of function, and conversely, if it can be done, and the effect shown to be independent of behaviour, then it would surely be a problem for functionalism...  So why not try it? "
2051,Can having multiple personalities help productivity and decision making under pressure?,"I understand having Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is not good thing but what about a mild dosage of DID under control, can it help? I am not referring to different roles that same person can play, am talking about different personalities with different emotional temperaments in same person.  Some examples:  Developing boss and worker personalities within a person, can it help overcoming chronic procrastination ?  Having a written contract with one self as if the person is two different person help recovering alcoholics?  There are lots of well known cognitive biases in decision making such as loss avoidance, endowment effect etc., greed &amp; fear interfering with objective decision making. Instead of training hard to discipline oneself to think objectively can we simply pretend we are detached third party and make those emotionally demanding decisions objectively?  Imagine a fearful situation, instead of trying to solve the phobia how about just inventing a macho personality and switching to it !? Is the solution lot simpler and require less emotional effort when dealing with phobia? How about solving the fear of public speaking by switching to Mr. Friendly and cool.. will these kind of inner segregation work?  One more example from poker, when the situation becomes emotionally demanding, is it possible to simply switch to third person whose monthly rent money is not at risk and escape all those sweating and heart pounding and make objective decisions!?  Sure all the problems I mentioned procrastination, phobias, addiction, blinding emotions, fear of public speaking all are complex issues requiring more work but I wanted to know how much 'creating and personality switching' can help! "
2052,Spontaneous muscle twitching?,"I am trying to understand the role of whisker twitches during sleep in the development of the mouse brain, and in general the role of spontaneous muscle activity in brain development. Thing is, I am not sure how the muscle activity is initiated. Does the muscle twitch on its own without an electrical input (is this possible?), or does it receive an impulse from the brain to cause it to twitch? I think I read somewhere that the spontaneous activity is generated in the  brainstem, but I seem to be getting mixed messages... "
2053,Does synesthesia lack symmetry?,"Some synesthetes report seeing bright flashes when hearing a loud noise.  However, in the same person, bright flashes of light are not reported as being loud.  I've read of other examples like this; for instance, the number 1 may always be yellow, but yellow is not the number 1.  Has there been any research as to the neurological reasons why synesthesia is asymmetric?  Alternately, is my anecdotal assumption that it is asymmetric incorrect and there are actually frequent symmetric presentations of the condition? "
2054,Does self-compassion have negative consequences?,"Self-compassion is often compared with self-esteem and it seems that self-compassion is more effective and positive than self-esteem. A lot of studies have shown that excessive levels of self-esteem might lead to narcissism or to believe that we are above average. However, I haven't heard negative aspects about self-compassion? Self-compassion is related to happiness, satisfaction and motivation but does it have any negative consequence? Thank you. "
2055,Is there some hierarchy of the human senses?,"What I mean by this is to ask if each of the sensory inputs can be quantified by the amount of information the brain is receiving: For example,  Brain says: currently receiving 10 packets of visual information, 3 packets of auditory info, 20 packets of somatosensory input etc...  Or maybe to put it in different terms, to measure the rate at which these sensory inputs are being recorded. For example:  Brain says: currently capturing visual info at 120 frames per second, hearing 20k cycles per second, somatosensory input at ...!?  And thereafter calculate the information content coming from each (per unit of time?) and thereby list them in some order.  Ultimately what I'm trying to understand/see is: if you had such a list (say, 1. visual, 2. touch, 3. hearing,....etc) and you began to remove modes of input from largest to smallest, would/might we begin to see weaker sensory inputs begin to enter the picture (sensory inputs that were being drowned out by the other senses)? "
2056,Learning vocabulary: Is it better to learn the word through translations?,"Suppose that you have a student that is bilingual. Take for example that the student speaks Chinese and English. Suppose that said student is very fluent in Chinese, but not so fluent in English. He/she can hold everyday conversations in English but he/she has a really hard time reading an English newspaper or magazine (i.e. Wall Street Journal and Times). Suppose that you are trying to teach English vocabulary to said student. Would you teach said student:   New English vocabulary using English words that he already knows, or New English vocabulary by using translated Chinese?   Is there some research that is related to such scenario? "
2057,What is mindful focused self-awareness from a cognitive science perspective?,"Focused mindful self-awareness (Google talk Jon Kabat-Zinn) are common activities, used to help patients of a variety of mental illness of different degrees - with some evidence of healing (Dr. Jeffery Schwartz).  From a cognitive science perspective, what is this focused mindful self-awareness? "
2058,432 Hz vs. 440 Hz frequencies: health and psychological effects?,"Search for “432 Hz” in YouTube and you’ll find plenty of examples where people have applied a pitch shifter to alter music ranging from a Mozart Requiem to Oasis’ Wonderwall.  But some claim that there is more to this than just preference. There are several blogs that claim that using a normal concert tuning of 440 Hz is bad for our health, but then what do you expect from something first promoted by the Nazis?     The recent rediscoveries of the vibratory / oscillatory nature of the universe indicate that this contemporary international concert pitch standard may generate an unhealthy effect or anti-social behavior in the consciousness of human beings … There is a theory that the change from 432 Hz to 440 Hz was dictated by Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. [Source: Zen Gardner.]   Also,  432 Hz is said to be mathematically consistent with the patterns of the universe. Studies reveal that 432hz tuning vibrates with the universe’s golden mean PHI and unifies the properties of light, time, space, matter, gravity and magnetism with biology, the DNA code and consciousness. When our atoms and DNA start to resonate in harmony with the spiraling pattern of nature, our sense of connection to nature is said to be magnified. The number 432 is also reflected in ratios of the Sun, Earth, and the moon as well as the precession of the equinoxes, the Great Pyramid of Egypt, Stonehenge, the Sri Yantra among many other sacred sites.      “From my own observations, some of the harmonic overtone partials of   A=432hz 12T5 appear to line up to natural patterns and also the   resonance of solitons. Solitons need a specific range to form into the   realm of density and span from the micro to the macro cosmos. Solitons   are not only found in water mechanics, but also in the ion-acoustic   breath between electrons and protons.”   – Brian T. Collins   Another blog wrote that,     The noticeable difference music lovers and musicians have noticed with   music tuned in A=432 Hz is that it is not only more beautiful and   harmonious to the ears, but it also induces a more inward experience   that is felt inside the body at the spine and heart. Music tuned in   A=440 Hz was felt as a more outward and mental experience, and was   felt at the side of the head which projected outwards. Audiophiles   have also stated that A=432hz music seems to be non-local and can fill   an entire room, whereas A=440hz can be perceived as directional or   linear in sound propagation.   Also, there is a group on SoundCloud where people everyday shares different sound tracks based on 432 Hz frequencies.   It is still kind of ambiguous and unclear to me. Does it really work to tune your music to 432 Hz, or it is just a hoax? Does it really effect your sub-conscious state and your health? "
2059,"Is there a precise definition of ""attitude""?","After going through some literature on values, beliefs and attitudes, I am confused. Values and beliefs are somewhat more clear, but what exactly is an attitude? What does it contain?   Is ""I like X"" already an attitude towards X? Is anything beyond ""like"" also an attitude, such as ""I find X boring""? If yes, then where is the border to related concepts (and which concepts are related - is an emotion towards an object an attitude)? If an attitude is only restricted to being a positive or negative disposition towards an object, how does it differ from a preference?   Update Nick Stauner's answer includes a citation claiming that an attitude is not affect. But the same citation insists that an attitude is about favorability, and if we reduce attitudes to ""I like X"", how is ""like"" not considered affect?  "

2063,Why is Mr. Monk unsure?,"One of the funniest and most psychologically intriguing characters on TV (in my opinion) is Adrian Monk. If you don't know who he is, I highly recommend watching the TV show. It's called ""Monk"" (naturally).  In the show, Monk is a character with pretty much every phobia imaginable. He has all the quirks and OCD stereotype characteristics. One of the challenges Monk faces often is inhibition when trying to make up his mind. Watch this clip for an example of what I mean:  Monk - Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever  I know that Monk is a fictional character, but the symptoms he has are very real and suffered from by many people daily (although seldom all at once, as is Monk's case). What I want to know is:    What specifically is the trait that Monk exhibits in the clip?  Does he have a phobia of being wrong, or is he just incapable of being sure of himself?  Is it as simple as him just being very indecisive?   Edit: Thanks Nick Stauner for pointing this out. I will clarify: This question is based on the premise that Monk (or any other person) exhibiting this behavior does this frequently; not just a one time occurrence. "
2064,Is it good practice to try to recall things when we are tired?,"Background. It happens often that, at the end of the day when I return to home, I try to recall past events that took place that day or the day before (memory rehearsal), but surprisingly I find that I have lost almost all details about some of them: while some  details are kept ""in good state"", other are altered (false memory: wrong order of events, memory gaps, inconsistent and incoherent memories), and the rest are forgotten! Boundaries between details are blurred! Such things happen when I'm tired.   On the one hand, if I don't try to recall events, e.g. when I postpone such practice to a later moment (after resting), I will forget some details as I have wasted time.  On the other hand, when I try to rehearse some memories that happened the same day, it seems that the biological state of tiredness affects the ability to recall in such a manner that details become altered and false memories are produced (again a loss of information)! Both cases are bad, but which one is the worse?  The point of this question is to know whether the biological state of tiredness can definitely alter some critical events when we try to recall.  Should we avoid trying to recall events when we are tired? "
2065,How to structure affective picture stimuli for an EEG study?,"I want to design an EEG paradigm for passive affective picture viewing.

2066,How much alcohol is negative for brain function?,"How much alcohol can you consume before it starts to kill a single neuron or interfere with proper brain functioning? Does it happen:   If you take just a few drops of alcohol?  If you drink a rum and coke cocktail?  If you get so drunk that you cannot remember what you have done?   I like drinking a bit when I go out to pubs or the like, as I didn't consider that taking a pair of cups approximately once per month could do anything to my brain, but I've reconsidered it, so I'd like to know how much is needed to produce negative effects on the brain. Hope you can guide me with this. "
2067,Is there an easy way to tell whether I woke up during REM or non-REM sleep?,"I wake up during the night. Is there an easy way to tell whether I've woken up during REM or non-REM sleep?  One way could be to look up the time, calculate how long I've slept and then take into account that, ""An adult reaches REM approximately every 90 minutes""...  Are there other ways? "
2068,When was it recognized that thinking occurs in the brain and not in the heart?,"Historically speaking, this misconception used to exist, right? Somewhat like Copernican heliocentrism, no? When (and, if you wish, how) did this folk concept regarding the biological basis of cognition come to be revised?  When was it recognized that thinking occurs in the brain and not in the heart? "
2069,"Innate personality tests: do they exist? If not, why?","A personality is developed by innate factors and by the things that happen in your life, but how would your personality be if you either had received the same amount of positive and negative stimuli from those, or if your stimuli from those influences had always been neutral? How would you be?  I'd like to know if tests of innate personality exist, and if not, why not. I think this could be helpful in some psychological treatments. If a person has depression, I think that the treatment should be different if that person has an innate tendency to be depressive, as opposed to if he or she is depressive because a lot of things have made him or her depressive. I think these types of tests would be worth trying to develop, though they might be difficult to do. Thanks for your time. "

2071,"Are ""dumb product warning labels"" an indicator of change of intelligence of general public?","I've recently heard a podcast by mr Flynn, the discover of the Flynn effect. According to him, populations worldwide are gaining about 3 points of IQ with each generation, but the kind of their intelligence is changing from more ""down to earth"" to more abstract. For example, he mentions how in 1920s, people in Siberia could not or would not answer the question like ""What color are bears on the North Pole?"", because they have never seen one and all the bears next to them were brown. Flynn suggests that their thinking was much more down to earth and practical.

2072,Neuroscience student,"I'm thinking about studying neuroscience, but the only interests I have in the general area are:   Where thought or consciousness come from and how it all works How memory works and why it can't be accessed at all times  Can it be increased, and does it have a limit? How a smell can bring back a memory? Why, if I remember a scene or a moment, can I not relive an entire day or month? Will this be possible in the future?    Also, I love biology and am doing a course in chemistry and lab work at the moment, but I'm afraid I'll be disappointed if I study neuroscience for these reasons. Are these questions more theoretical and philosophical than what a neuroscience student would actually study? "
2073,Can placebo effect be increased by modifying the perception about prescription/intake setting?,"I've noticed the following pattern within my own thinking - multiple unrelated events ""combine"" to produce a certain action, particularly creativity and innovation. I'm trying to understand if this phenomenon is true or common among people. As a way to learn more about this, I thought that placebo effect would be a good place to start.  To clarify my question: imagine you are going to get a drug prescription. It will be a placebo, but you don't know that. Would combining factors like below increase the effectiveness of placebo?   clean doctors office a traditional white coat doctor like on stock photos treating you positive demeanor of staff perception of privacy thinking you are being prescribed a drug you have researched well and feel safe about seeing a presentation about the advances of modern medicine within a week before    Contrast this with the following:   a dark, cramped waiting room long wait and short consultation a physician assistant or a nurse practitioner seeing you instead of MD unknown drug you have never heard of perceiving some negative news within last week   I'm trying to understand if a combination of unrelated events indeed does combine to affect the effectiveness of placebo? If so, is there the primary cause of change (like PA-C prescribing vs MD)?  I found the following on Wikipedia which makes me even more curious:     The expectancy effect[of placebo] can be enhanced through factors such as the   enthusiasm of the doctor, differences in size and color of placebo   pills, or the use of other interventions such as injections. In one   study, the response to a placebo increased from 44% to 62% when the   doctor treated them with ""warmth, attention, and confidence.""[47]   Here is what I think the traditional expectation of a doctor is:   "
2074,What is the basis behind the idea of Dom-Tert loops in Jung Function Theory?,"I have come across a theory relating to Jung Function Theory normally addressed as 'Dom-Tert' loops. I will briefly explain:  In Jung Function Theory, everyone has 4 of 16 functions. They split into Introverted/Extroverted, Sensing/Intuiting, and Thinking/Feeling. These, in broad strokes, aim to explain how people function in both Information Gathering (S/N) as well as Information Processing (T/F) and whether that has a subjective base, or an objective base (I/E).  This theory lays out that the first (or dominant) function and the third (or tertiary) function form a feedback loop, and the second function becomes underdeveloped. Below is an excerpt that hopefully gives an example of this at work (Myers Briggs notation is used as shorthand here):     ENTP/ESFJ: Ne/Fe or Fe/Ne--Narcissistic Personality Disorder. This type often behaves impulsively and manipulatively, needing constant approval and admiration from others, running around investing in new thing after new thing, but never developing the self-confidence of a strong, subjective perspective. Fe used negatively may use its awareness of the cultural standards of others to intentionally offend or upset them, in order to service Ne's curiosity about the patterns in their responses. If Ti/Si were working properly, it would give the user a balancing sense of personal, subjective importance and free him of his dependence upon the adulation and unconditional acceptance of others. (Horrible example: Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.)   The crux being that everyone must use a balance of subjective and objective reasoning and perception to function correctly.  Now I realise that Jung Function theory is a favourite with armchair psychologists, and it's validity has been questioned, but I wanted to know if this theory is either a) expressed formally in any kind of Jung Function theory study, or b) if something like this imbalance leading to personality disorders exists in other psychological theories?   Where does this idea come from? The writer of the above forum post doesn't seem to take credit for the idea or even lead us to what inspired them. "
2075,What is the psychological function of nostalgically reenacting activities from before we were born?,"I'm asking specifically about nostalgia for a time before you were born, e.g. the Blitz parties / 40s tea dances that have big in the UK for the past decade, or the popularity of Speakeasy-themed bars in the US. I'm thinking of nights that require you to dress in theme specifically and celebrate that time.  I was discussing it with a friend today, and I said it seems like it's a way to participate in something your grandparents did that strengthens your bonds to your own family, but she (rightly) replied that her own grandma had never been to a dance – she'd been too poor. It seems to me like when we're at the tea dance or in the speakeasy or whatever, we're doing something more than faithfully reenacting the things our forebears did, but I'm not sure what that is or why. Are we celebrating the best bits and leaving the rest behind? Are we thoughtlessly celebrating a time of awful gender and racial inequality? Does anyone have any insight into this kind of nostalgia, the nostalgia for things you've never experienced yourself, and the act of participating in themed events, and what functions that has socially/psychologically?

2077,Is there a developmental purpose to adolescent transgressions?,"Many adolescents transgress rules and break laws, not out of criminal intent or because they have some disorder, but ""for fun"", as an adventure, for the experience.  How is this explained from the perspective of psychology and cognitive sciences? Does this behavior serve a developmental purpose, or is it merely a dangerous side effect that is best suppressed and controlled by parents and authorities?    The following functions have been suggested1 for adolescent risk-taking behavior, such as psychoactive substance use, risky driving, or antisocial behavior:   self-affirmation and experimentation / exploration identification and social acceptance ritual and emulation social visibility and desirability self-exoneration escape through action and excitement   But the term ""risk"" implies that these behaviors are not necessarily functional in the sense that they help the individual develop healthily. Smoking may lead to peer acceptance, but it is certainly not healthy.  Yet, the ubiquity of these behaviors suggests that they must serve some functional purpose.

2078,What is the difference between noise reduction and noise cancellation?,"I had a question about sirens in another section which led to a question in physics section...and I was told my question is more suitable for cognitive science.  So here it goes:  There are many kinds of noises: from a heavy truck going by to the wailing of sirens from an ambulance. Then there is someone next to you snoring. Although they are all bothersome, they can't be the exact same thing?  I've heard people use the term ""white noise"" to cancel out or reduce other noise. Granted I have used various earplugs (which reduce only reduce certain kinds of noise and not that well either), but looking at white noise, I realized there is so much about noise and sounds that I don't know about. For instance there is also brown noise and pink noise. There is a sound's loudness, pitch, timber, direction, frequency, etc.  How do I go about finding the right kind of sound masking for different kinds of sounds like snoring and wailing ambulances? "
2079,How do clinicians control for their own mental disorders?,"Has any research been done on how clinicians' (either internists or psychiatrists) known psychological conditions influence the diagnoses, misdiagnoses, and prognoses they make?  And, related to that, has there been any concerted conscious effort made to control for the above?  (I'm also curious how medical, non-psychological conditions affect the above, but that wouldn't strictly-speaking be on topic so I'm limiting this to psychological problems for now.)  the kind of studies I mean  What I'm envisaging is a study akin to the following, and am curious about what similar studies have found:   two pools of practicing clinicians are chosen (with random partitioning between the two), everyone in pool A is screened for current psychological disorders by a subset (say, three) of multiple, randomly chosen individuals from pool B, the professional (diagnostic) history of every clinician in pool A is reviewed, and the experimenter looks for patterns of correlation between mental disorders in the clinicians themselves, and the disorders that those individuals tend to diagnose / misdiagnose (sensitivity v. specificity).    the kind of (statistically significant) results I'm curious about  So, for example, do clinicians who have (to choose two disorders randomly) NPD tend to diagnose depression more often than those without NPD? And, when they do diagnose depression, do they tend to have more favorable or less favorable prognoses for their patients? What are their recommendations? And how often do their recommendations work out well v. badly? What mental characteristics are adaptive v. maladaptive within this extremely specific context?  More to the point, does it ""take one to know one"", or does a lack of personal experience with something provide better objectivity?  And are some disorders (maladaptive within larger society) unambiguously good across-the-board in a clinical setting, are they all harmful, or should people with disorder X specialize in disorder Y, and avoid treating patients with disorder Z?  Obviously, pool A doesn't actually need to be psych clinicians. It could be applied to GPs, oncologists, surgeons, etc. "
2080,Method Acting Used For Cognitive Behavioral Modification,"I was always fascinated by the stark contrast between the character played by Brad Pitt in True Romance (small role) and the character Rusty in Ocean's Eleven. Same person, completely different persona. Gary Oldman is another one that is so chamaeleon like, it is often difficult to recognize him in character (nevermind the makeup and costume).  I am curious to know if the techniques associated with method acting, attempting to live in the shoes of a desired character, have any basis for helping a normal person become the type of person they desire to be (behavior and persoanlity). I am not sure if method actors ever actually 'become' the character they are portraying, but from outward appearances it would be difficult to tell. They may very well easily discard their character once finished. However, I have heard that DiCaprio suffered from some residual effects of portraying Howard Hughes in The Aviator. This type of behavioral modification is similar to ""fake it until you make it"", or simply performing a repetitive action until it becomes natural. Nothing new. But I am wondering if method acting (and its associated techniques) could contribute something new to this process affecting our natural selves. Does this take advantage of our neural plasticity?  If the answer is yes, how long would one have to perform these techniques before any noticeable chamge would occur? This, I supose, would help to compare its efficacy against other techniques.  *Also, I'm not sure if this would be any easier or more productive than other CBT techniques, since if anyone could portray personas well, everyone would work in Hollywood.

2081,Cognitive bias of comparing numbers on a relative scale,"Is there a name for the bias of comparing numbers on a relative scale?  Here are a few examples.  The car salesman sells you a \[tex]30,000 car.  It doesn't seem like that much because it 900 is a relatively small percentage of 30000.  And let's say a top quality system installed, away from the dealership is \[tex]200.    What causes us to think \$200 isn't that much?  But if shopping in a store where the top priced GPS was \[tex]500, now \$200 seems too much.  Or how about a homeowner trying to sell a house for \[tex]185,000 because of water damage in one room.  The seller accepts even though the cost to repair the damage might be only \[tex]5000 doesn't seem like that big of a loss for the hassle of having to do the repair, but in a lot of other circumstances (like selling a car) it's a deal breaker.  Another.  Take a trip to a neighboring town and you might go a mile or two out of your way to see an attraction you just discovered.  Take a trip across the country and you might visit a whole other state, hundreds of miles out of your way.  I know that anchoring bias can cause you to, for instance, perceive a price as being lower because of false higher price.  But is it the same as this relative scaling bias?  Or is this called something else altogether? "

2084,Typical rates for 'trivial' errors?,"By 'trivial' error I mean one that's local and easy to confirm and easy to understand. Something that makes you look silly. For example:   Sign errors in mathematics. Forgetting to do a unit conversion in physics. Skipping over a number in accounting. Off by one errors in programming. Fencepost errors in programming. Out of bounds errors in programming. Null value errors in programming. Rear-ending someone at a stoplight when driving.   Some historical examples:   heartbleed goto fail Mars Climate Orbiter Ariane 5   Some anti-examples:   the Therac-25 bug the database concurrency bugs found by Jepsen   Anyways... I'm looking for studies that investigated how often these mistakes happen, and how much the rates vary from person to person. Do some people make lots of them? Do some people make almost none? How much does practice affect the error rate? Are there disorders that affect the rate? "

2087,Does the lexical hypothesis have any role in 'creativity'?,"The lexical hypothesis was used to I think create the 5 factor model of personality.  Has anything similar been done in the science of 'creativity'?  While, clearly, ""creativity"" is a component of intelligence, even if it is also one in personality.    What got me thinking about this, is the measurement of 'creativity', which is I think notoriously difficult, even more so that aptitude in general. Specifically, I was thinking about how it seems that 'fluency' seems lexically close to some terms close to creativity.  How would general cognitive fluency, as it is measured by cognitive test, correlate with creativity?    fluency, noun   the ability to express oneself easily and articulately.   fantasy, noun   a fanciful mental image, typically one on which a person often dwells and which reflects their conscious or unconscious wishes   imagination, noun   the faculty or action of forming new ideas, or images or concepts of  external objects not present to the senses.   etc. "
2088,When many laws are too many laws?,"Let's consider an experiment:     Take a baby and have it raise in a very law-strict environment (his   parents are very strict and follow any rules, be it legal, be it   religious, be it moral) but with some freedom (he could start learning   the violin if he was interested into). Now, imagine you have the same    child raised by a family very tolerant, so tolerant that he could do   anything he wants (be it legal, be it illegal).   So here is the question:  Which scenario can he have a deeper sense of himself, the world and anything else? and is it philosophically right if he finds a fortune (becomes rich, athletic, many friends ...) by mean of scenario #1?  My point is that when you are in a very strict law environment, you tend to be channeled in only few possible directions, so your feelings, impulses and so on are extremely lowered in potential: you may become a billionaire by limiting yourself, but it would be not the real you. On the other side, by living with no limits (legal, religious ...), you can discover the real you because you are not affected by society and its laws, but you can hurt yourself and others around you (you may do something dangerous by exposing yourself to human limits).  I know there are important factors compromising the result of the experiment, the psychology of the child (this experiment may lead to different results based upon your psychology and how you react to external stimuli), but all I would like are some insights, some tips to go deeper in this argument. "
2089,Does self-directed speech help or hurt a blind subject's auditory recognition?,"Recently, it was found that self-directed speech was helpful to sighted subjects engaging in a visual search task:     Participants searched for common objects, while being sometimes [sic] asked to speak the target’s name aloud. Speaking facilitated search, particularly when there was a strong association between the name and the visual target. As the discrepancy between the name and the target increased, speaking began to impair performance. Together, these results speak to the power of words to modulate ongoing visual processing.   So, if the subject were to be looking for a chair in a picture, saying the word ""chair"" aloud would lead to a more effective search.  Since the two modalities (vision and hearing) are separate, one set of information can compliment the other set and ""constructively interferes,"" if you will, in the scenario above.    In trying to establish whether a similar ""constructive interference"" would occur in the auditory domain, so I'm wondering whether an experiment wherein a subject who is blind (since birth) repeating a word to themselves would show an difference in that subject's ability to discriminate muffled or otherwise disguised words that they were asked to listen to and identify as part of a task.    Would the degree to which repeating a word was helpful or harmful still depend on the similarity between the word spoken out loud and the word to be discriminated?  Or would there be a ""destructive interference"" effect under any circumstances, due to the same modality of hearing being used for the both discrimination of the information and the perception of the self-directed speech?

2090,How to computationally model the Wisconsin Card Sorting task?,"The Wisconsin Card Sorting task is rather famous but appears to be quite difficult to model computationally.  I work in RL and I am interested in how people learn the optimal strategy. I'm interested in the task because it would allow a number of experimental manipulations. I want to capture the role of memory in the optimal strategy. People can keep track of some, but not very much, history of trials when doing the task. (I.e the mathematically optimal strategy seems too computationally heavy.)   How could I approach modelling the Wisconsin Card Sorting task? What other research has modelled the task?  "
2091,What cognitive strategies diminish bias in decision-making beyond those outlined by Larrick?,"Larrick (2004; pdf) offers a small number of suggestions for strategies to diminish bias in decision making, which he breaks down into four categories.    ""Consider the opposite"". Tell decision-makers to ask themselves ""What are some reasons my initial judgment might be wrong?"" Training in rules. Teach statistical and logical principles to decision-makers, e.g. give them lessons on the law of large numbers and regression toward the mean. Training in representations. Teach decision-makers to represent problems in ways that are likely to ameliorate biases.  For instance, encourage decision-makers to represent problems in terms of frequencies rather than probabilities, since evidence suggests people reason more accurately when thinking about the former than about the latter. Training in biases. Larrick suggests that this boils down to seeing if teaching decision-makers behavioral decision theory has positive effects. Larrick implies that so far there is little evidence to suggest this method would work.    Question:   What other plausible categories of cognitive strategies exist?  What other strategies exist within the categories Larrick has defined?   References   Larrick, R.P. (2004). Debiasing. Blackwell handbook of judgment and decision making, , 316-338. PDF  "
2092,What articles use structural equation modelling in a meta-analytic context to model mediation?,"I'm interested in structural equation modelling (SEM) meta-analysis and its application to modelling mediation relationships.  Mike W.-L. Cheung has written a few articles on the topic of SEM Meta-Analysis (e.g., Cheung, 2009). He's also written the metaSEM package in R.  One basic approach to SEM meta-analysis is a simple fixed-effect two-step approach. First, you extract a weighted average correlation matrix from the component studies. Second, you analyse that correlation matrix using standard SEM approaches.   However, in reality, things are more complicated.    Correlations often vary between studies by more than just sampling error, suggesting that a fixed-effect approach may be invalid. If a random-effects model is adopted, this raises issues of whether to categorise the correlation matrices into groups of fixed-effects matrices or whether to somehow incorporate the random-effects into the overall SEM. Some studies may not have all the variables of interest, which introduces a  form of missing data, which in turn raises issues of how to define sample size and the standard error.   So in general, I'm interested in reading examples of SEM meta-analyses applied in psychology to get a sense of how others have dealt with the various issues. In particular, I'm interested in meta-analysis SEM that incorporates the modelling of indirect effects (i.e., mediation).  Questions   What studies have applied meta-analysis SEM in psychology to model indirect effects? How have they dealt with issues such as (a) fixed versus random effects and (b) missing data?

2093,Neurotransmitter based imaging techniques,"All the brain imaging techniques I know fall into two categories:   Tracking blood   Either by looking at the magnetic (fMRI), or near-infared absorption (diffuse optical imaging, NIRS) properties of hemoglobin, or Injecting tracers into the blood stream (PET, SPECT)  Tracking electric and magnetic fields in neurons (EEG, MEG).   The problem with the first approach is that it is fundamentally secondary in nature: it tracks the response of the vascular system to brain activity. Although the BOLD signal correlates well with neural activity, it is still an indirect indicator of firing rate, has time lags, and limited spatial (limited by distribution of capillaries) and temporal (limited by flow rate) resolution.  The second  approach is better, but still not perfect from a pharmacology perspective. Although it gives us good information about the post-synaptic potential (EEG) or intraneuron potential (MEG), it still provides no information on specific neurotransmitters released. The approach also suffers from limitations on spatial resolution and the fact that EM-fields follow the superposition principle and thus it is mathematically impossible to reconstruct signals that interfere destructively outside the neuron but before the sensors.  The perfect approach for a pharmacologist would be to track individual types on neurotransmitters. Are there imagining techniques that use the resonance, absorption, or other properties of neurotransmitters (instead of hemoglobin)? Or is there a fundamental reason why this won't work?  I know that the same exact techniques as for hemoglobin won't work (since as far as I know most neurotransmitters don't contain nice things like iron to play with), but is there a reason other resonance or scattering techniques wouldn't work?    The closest work I know in this direction is the event-related optical signal (Gratton &amp; Fabiani, 2001) because it tracks the light-scattering properties of something other than hemoglobin: neural tissue. Unfortunately, this is still tracking activity of the neuron and not neurotransmitters. "
2094,What is the reliability of GPA?,"I'm in the process of performing a meta-analysis that includes Grade Point Average (GPA) as one of the variables. For some purposes, it might be useful to have an estimate of the reliability of measurement for GPA.   What has empirical research estimated the reliability of GPA to be? What factors influence the reliability of GPA measurement?   Additional points   I'm looking for specific coefficient values that I could use in a meta-analytic context. I am not interested in personal opinions about the value of GPA. I can also see that reliability would vary based on how you define reliability.  I imagine that GPA would be more reliable and valid when it is obtained from a group of students at a single university. I can also see that GPAs based on more units of study would be more reliable.  I can also see that in some contexts GPA is an end itself, and therefore it would not be appropriate to adjust for reliability.  "
2095,What is the correlation between self and other ratings of goal orientation?,"In educational psychology goal orientation is a popular construct. In particular popular dimensions of goal orientation include performance-approach, performance-avoidance, and mastery. The studies that I have read (e.g., Elliot et al, 1999) have used self-report measures of goal orientation. I.e., students have been asked to rate themselves.   In general, I am sceptical of people's self-ratings of their performance or strategy. Thus, I was wondering how well self-ratings correlated with other ratings (e.g., by knowledgeable teachers or other careful observers).  Questions   What is the correlation between self and other ratings for goal orientation? How do correlations between goal orientation and performance vary based on whether the goal orientations ratings are by the self or an other?

2096,Inferring relationships between psychological variables in clinical samples and issues in generalisation,"Context  I sometimes speak to researchers studying the relationship between variables in clinical psychology samples. A typical example is as follows:   100 patients with diagnosed depression many clinically relevant variables are measured such as demographics, anxiety, intelligence, drug and alcohol use, and so on.   Researchers often want to then develop models of what predicts depression.  However, the problem is that the sample was selected because they already have been deemed to possess a certain threshold level of depression. Substantial variation still remains in depression with some participants being more severe than others.  Thus, there are problems in trying to generalise observed relationships to describe what predicts depression, because it is not a random sample of the population.  I use depression as a specific case, but the problem applies to many studies of clinical populations (e.g., kids with behavioural problems, kids with intellectual disabilities, OCD, etc.).  Question   What advice would you give to such researchers about how to analyse and generalise from such data? Are there any references that provide an example of best practice of how to analyse and generalise from such data?  "
2097,"When counting a given letter in sentences, why do people tend to omit occurrences in certain common words?","I have noticed that when I, and presumably others, count the number of times the letter F appears in the following passage:  FINISHED FILES ARE THE RESULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY COMBINED WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS   They typically get a count of three, yet the real answer is six. The letter F in the the word ""OF"" tends to be omitted from the count.  I imagine that this effect has something to do with top-down processing.  Questions   Have there been any scientific studies of this or a similar task? What proportion of people complete the task successfully? What explains the tendency of people to not count the letter F's in the word ""OF""?  "
2098,What constructs help explain limited cognitive processing and the cognitive effects of rules that limit decision making choices?,"Supposed that I'm a married man, and my wife asks me to pick out a paint color for our new house. It's not terribly mentally taxing. However, my wife starts to add rules. The color can't be too bright, no green, neutral, etc. The additional rules that my wife give me add an additional burden to the process of selecting a color. So in my mind, there is the base cognitive effort required to select a color, and a secondary cognitive burden that requires me to process the rules that my wife gave me.  What mental effort constructs would apply in this scenario?  From instruction design, cognitive load theory defines intrinsic load, extraneous load, and germane load. In my example, I think intrinsic load would map somewhat to the base effort required to choose a color, and extraneous load would map to the additional rules imposed by my wife. However, I'm not sure that the process of learning as explained by cognitive load theory translates well into this scenario where a choice/decision is trying to be made. Are there other constructs that would be more applicable? "
2099,Why do we prefer visually aligned objects?,"We all know visual alignment is one of the foundations of design. Everything must be aligned with everything else.

2100,How does daily amount of sleep vary within and between healthy adults?,"I'm interested in research that has employed the following or similar research design:   Measure the daily amount of sleep  every day for an for an extended period (e.g., more than a month) in a relatively large sample (e.g., [tex]) of ""normal"" healthy adults   This would give rise to sleep measurements on multiple days and for multiple individuals. Thus, we could define [tex] as the amount of sleep of person [tex] on day [tex]. Descriptive statistics could be calculated on the set of daily sleep measurements of person [tex] such as the mean and standard deviation. These within-person descriptive statistics could also be summarised at the group-level.  Questions  In general, what are the main descriptive statistics of such data?  More specifically, I'd be interested in knowing:   What is the mean of the within-person mean of daily amount of sleep? What is the standard deviation of the within-person mean of daily amount of sleep? What is the mean of the within-person standard deviation of daily amount of sleep? What is the standard deviation of the within-persons standard deviation of daily amount of sleep?   Presumably such results are contingent on how sleep is defined and measured, as well as many other factors such as the nature of the target population. Thus, any comments about these factors would also be welcome. "
2101,Modern treatments of Alan Turing's B-type neural networks,"In the cognitive sciences Alan Turing is best known for launching AI with his Computing machinery and intelligence (1950). However, this was not his first contribution to the cognitive sciences, in his unpublished 1948 technical report Intelligence Machinery he foresaw connectionism with his B-type neural networks.   The model is a recurrent neural network that is wired at random, and synchronized by a global clock. The neurons are two input [tex]-gates. The connections have one of two states: they either forward their signal perfectly ([tex] and [tex]), or replace it by [tex] ([tex] and [tex]). The learning algorithm adjusts the states of the connections.   Unfortunately, the director of the National Physical Laboratory rejected Turing's work and it was not published until significantly after Turing's death. The original manuscript, though predates Hebbian learning (1949) and Rosenblatt's perceptrons (1957; and they weren't as sophisticated, only doing feedforward as opposed to recurrent).  Was Turing's B-type neural networks are the earliest neural-like models of computations capable of learning?  Although by modern standard Turing's approach is dated, and has been supplanted by more realistic and general treatements (for instance ones that incorporate dynamic Hebbian updating on weighted connections without a need for central clock synchronization). When did the state of connectionism first surpasss Turing's B-type neural networks?  Is there modern treatments of B-type neural networks and their learning abilities?    Notes  I am interested in this mostly from the historic perspective, and not in how accurate Turing's model was under current interpertations. Although current knowledge would help answer when other models surpassed Turing's. "
2102,"How to measure student activity, participation, tendency to ask questions, etc?",We would like to compare students from different education systems on the following variables:   tendency to actively participate on lessons tendency to ask questions tendency and experience in presenting own opinion etc.   Questions   What studies provide examples of measuring these variables?  What methods are typically used to answer questions related to these variables?  What survey papers provide a good starting point?  
2103,The effects of bilingualism on colour perception,"Peltola et al. (2012) showed that there are two types of bilinguals.    Balanced bilinguals mix their two languages and are effected by linguistic categories from both.  Dominant bilinguals seem to switch on the categories of the language they are using, and suppress the categories of the language not in use.   The task Peltola et al. (2012) studied was phoneme categories. The boundaries between vowels are arbitrary and set by the language of the user. The researchers focused on two sounds that are categorised as different vowels in Finnish, but are the same vowel in Swedish. When dominant bilingual participants were briefed about the study in Finnish, they distinguished the sounds quickly. When the same participants were briefed about the same experiment a week later in Swedish, their ability to distinguish the sounds slowed significantly. The balanced bilinguals were equally slow under both briefings.  A similar arbitrary language-dependent categorization exists in colour perception (Regier &amp; Kay, 2009). In fact, the effect of this arbitrary categorization is even lateralized: the Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left (Gilbert et al., 2006)! So the basics of linguistic relativity seem to be cross-modal.  Do dominant bilinguals switch linguistic categories on and off in the visual domain? Is the result of Peltola et al. (2012) cross-modal? "
2104,Are different types of long term memories stored in different parts of the brain?,"I recently had some questions concerning the capacity of the brain's memory:   Are different types of long term-memories like know-how, your-life, etc. remembered in different parts of the brain?  If so, how large are these different kinds of partitions of the brain?    See also: Savants and Volume. "
2105,Does intelligence cause greater alcohol consumption?,"I just stumbled on a blog post that asserts that more intelligent people drink more than less intelligent people.  The author writes:     Controlling for a large number of demographic variables, such as sex,   race, ethnicity, religion, marital status, number of children,   education, earnings, depression, satisfaction with life, frequency of   socialization with friends, number of recent sex partners, childhood   social class, mother's education, and father's education, more   intelligent children grow up to drink more alcohol in the UK and the   US.   The data presented reportedly comes from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) in the United Kingdom and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) data in the United States. However, the author does not cite a particular reference where such analyses are reported.  Furthermore, I also wonder about what the meaning of any association between intelligence and alcohol consumption would be after controlling for so many factors. In particular, mother's education, father's education, social class, and education together should predict a lot of variance in intelligence.   Questions   What articles report the actual analyses mentioned in the blog post? Or what other articles summarise the relationship between intelligence and alcohol consumption? What is the relationship between intelligence and alcohol when you don't control for other factors? How does the relationship change between intelligence and alcohol consumption when you introduce some but not all of the covariates? In particular, which if any covariates modify the relationship between intelligence and alcohol consumption? Taken in totality is it reasonable to assume that intelligence has a causal effect on alcohol consumption?  "

2110,Is there a way for a man to be as sensitive as women in understanding other's thoughts and emotions?,"If women are better than men at reading thoughts and emotions by looking at eyes, because they are born for this, then is there a way to make a man to be as sensitive as women?   Is it similar to language acquisition?

2111,Childhood IQ and pattern of drug use in adulthood,"A study by White et al. (2012) using a large UK sample  concludes that      In this cohort, high childhood IQ was related to illegal drug use in adulthood.   Note that this does not refer to habitual use, but to have ever having tried illegal drugs:     Preliminary analyses revealed that, at the 42-year follow-up, the use of drugs in the past 12 months was rare [...] We therefore used assessments of the lifetime prevalence.    The same paper of White cites another UK study Batty et al. (2007) in which regular smoking and heavy alcohol consumption ware negatively correlated with childhood IQ.  Is this type of finding, namely positive correlation of IQ with what I'd call experimental drug use [I think the medical term is drug abuse], but negative correlation of IQ with heavy/regular use [which I think is called dependency or addiction] generalizable across countries? Or [if this is far too ambitious to ask] at least reproducible in other countries?  And if so, are there other confounding variables that might explain some of it better, e.g. openness to experience for ever having tried an illegal drug? "

2113,"Psychological explanation for the success of ""class systems"" in video games","Over the last decade, Role Playing Games and Mobile Online Battle Arenas have been a dominating force in the video gaming industry, millions of people playing sometimes every day and often being quite passionate about their favorite game.  The thing that strikes me when looking at the most successful of those games (not sure I'm allowed to say any names) is the recurring presence of ""class systems"", ways to label characters and players with a specific set of abilities and roles.      Examples of this are the classic ""warrior, mage, hunter, assassin..."" classes attributed to RPG characters or the the ""tank, support, damage dealer..."" roles that players in MOBAS take on in a team.  What I find interesting is that players seem to like having a more or less defined role, class or play style in these systems. One such example of this phenomena is the use of the pronoun ""a"" to refer to someone or oneself:        ""I am a mage player""       ""He is a [insert MOBA character name] main"" (main here means most played character)       ""Where the heck is our support?"" (referring to the player playing in the support role)       ""She is the best [insert MOBA character name] on the     EU server""   Is there a psychological explanation to why people seem particularly attracted to these systems that ""label them"" in a way?  My hypotheses:    - The discomfort of not fully knowing one's personnality and capabilities drive people to ""symplify their personnalities"" by endorsing specific roles in these games.    -  Players ""specialize "" themselves as a way to get singled out and feel special.   Please tell me if there is something I can do to make the question better, this is my first time asking on this site. "

2115,How exactly does transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) work?,"The method of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) involves the flow of electric charge from a positive electrode to a negative one.  This method is not exactly a stimulation method because the current applied do not provoke neurons firing such as TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), it just modulate the level of excitability of neurons. How happens this modulation of excitability?  Precisely, my question is:  How that positive or negative current interferes with electric fields generated by neurons?  references:   Impact of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Neuronal Functions  "
2116,Do antipsychotics have a delayed onset of action similar to (monoamine) antidepressants?,"I've been trying to understand the position of Steve Hyman (a former NIMH director), who has been amply quoted in an recent article in Quartz, saying among ohter things that     There’s not “an iota of direct evidence” for the theory that a chemical imbalance causes depression.   I looked into Hyman's papers and I found a fairly cited (~500 in Google Scholar) paper of his some 20 years ago in AJP, co-authored with Eric J. Nestler, in which they propose that     drug-induced neural plasticity [...] underlies the long-term actions of psychotropic drugs in the brain [...] Biological investigation in psychiatry has often focused too narrowly on synaptic pharmacology,   especially on neurotransmitter turnover and neurotransmitter receptors. A paradigm is presented to help understand the long-term effects of psychotropic drugs, including   the latency in onset of their therapeutic actions.   The paper further details that     Acute dosing of the antidepressants   produces little in the way of subjective or   behavioral effects (other than side effects). Initial doses   of the antipsychotic drugs produce subtle motor effects   or some degree of sedation, and initial doses of the   stimulants produce euphoria and locomotor activation.   However, substantial improvement in depressive or   psychotic symptoms, or the development of addiction   to psychostimulant drugs, occurs only if the drugs are   taken at adequate dosage and with adequate frequency   and chronicity. For example, depressive symptoms   would not be expected to improve if an antidepressant   were taken at too low a dose, only occasionally, or for   too short a period of time.      We therefore conceptualize antidepressant-induced   increases in synaptic serotonin or norepinephrine, antipsychotic-   induced blockade of dopamine neurotransmission,   and cocaine- and amphetamine-induced increases   in synaptic dopamine as initiating events for longerterm   changes in neural function. It is the adaptive response   of the nervous system to adequate repeated perturbations   mediated through these initial targets that   produces the therapeutic responses to antidepressants   or antipsychotic drugs or, in the case of the psychostimulants,   addiction [...].   I'm somewhat familiar with the slow, cumulative effect of monoamine antidepressants and with the mechanism of addiction. Hyman and Nestler can be probably be forgiven for not anticipating the ketamine-as-fast-antidepressant fervor 20 years later. But what I want to ask here is:   What is the evidence that anti-psychotics also work in this delayed manner? Is it uncontroversially so? "
2117,Is there a case of multiple personalities that is not a disorder?,"Is there a case of multiple personalities that is not a disorder? For some reason everything I found about ""multiple personality"" comes in a ""disorder"" form. Or is it a given that one mind can only have one personality?  Is there any information on cases where multiple personalities coexist in the mind of a single individual, without the adverse effects such as disassociation, memory loss or self harm, that is not the product of a trauma?  Note that I do not ask in the context of ""social context"" personality, but two distinct personalities that persist throughout different social settings. Also it might be worthy to note that even though they are vastly different in the way they perceive and react, there is no pronounced conflict or any adverse side effects as far as I can tell, if anything it appears to have a wide array of benefits.

2118,"What was creativity called before the 1950s, i.e. before Guilford coined the term?","It is known that Guilford coined the term, but the concept is much older. What did people in Freud's time call it? Genius? innovation? Something else? "
2119,(Why) Do US studies of violence and mental illness tend to report no link but European studies seem to find one?,"Studying the link between mental illness and violence seems a sure way to   get attention from the mass media, and contradict some other study, and not necessarily one published that long ago.   A pretty old review (and not in some high impact venue) by Stuart (2003) seems to me to still hold water 15 years later with respect to a few general observations:     Definitive statements are difficult to make and it is equally possible to find recent literature supporting the conclusions that the mentally ill are no more violent, they are as violent, or they are more violent than their nonmentally ill counterparts. [...]      Because of the significant methodological challenges faced by researchers in this field, the nature of this association remains unclear. For example, violence has been difficult to measure directly, so that researchers have often relied on official documentation or uncorroborated selfreports. The prevalence of violence has been demonstrated to differ dramatically depending on the source. [...]   And it goes on to talk about confounders as the perennial problem of epidemiological studies.  Stuart also highlights a (highly cited) US-sample study of the ""no-link"" variety (at least if substance-abuse is controlled for), Steadman et al. 1998 ... and I certainly found some newer ones myself, Elbogen &amp; Johnson (2009) or Anderson et al. 2012, just to mention some picked up by the press.  On the other hand, the Oxford group of Fazel has been publishing study after study on European samples including on Sweden (2015)  or UK, Finland and Netherlands (2017) that do find a link between depression and violence... and these have also been picked up the press. There are older studies in Scandinavian countries which concur; Hodgins et al. (1996) for instance.  So is this a trend? And (the really tough question) is there a meta-analysis of such studies that does moderator analysis (e.g. by meta-regression) to determine which study parameters matter most with respect to the finding? Is it the case that the Europeans are less violent overall so that the ""inherent"" violence of the mentally ill ""stands out"" in Europe but ""gets lost in the noise"" of the higher society violence in the US? (It certainly is the case the US is more violent than Sweden.) Or is it some other factor that is dominant, e.g. is depression more conductive to violence than other forms of severe mental illness (makes sense to ask since 2 of 3 US studies I've looked at aggregate severe mental illnesses — SMIs). To give you an example of the kind of meta-analysis I'm hoping to find, for ADHD prevalence it seemed that there might be geographical differences between US and Europe, but they turned out to be methodological.    I found a paper by Van Dorn et al. (2012) reanalyzing the same data as Elbogen &amp; Johnson, and coming to a European-style conclusion of a link between SMI and violence. The difference in methodology came down (in this case) to:     important is spatio-temporal contiguity (i.e., the causal factor must be   spatially near the effect).   So merely lifetime SMI prevalence wasn't a good predictor but recent symptoms (within 12 months) were. That and the fact that the control group of Elbogen &amp; Johnson apparently was not clean enough (of substance abusers) apparently tipped the scales.  But Eblogen didn't quote concede the field, and in a 2016 study on the exact same data (using 12 months window this time) but with more attention to confounders... found again in favor of their original findings:     Mediation analyses informed by the I3    model revealed   that the positive association between SMI and violence   was by and large indirect. Statistically controlling for   impellance and disinhibition completely wiped out any   positive relationship between SMI and violence.    This is somewhat similar result to what Anderson et al. (2012) obtained on different data after controlling for impulsivity and ""present orientation"" (using just two simple questions for these two factors!) "
2120,Is this brain map scientifically correct?,I'm not an expert in neuroscience but always read about information that seems conflicting to me. On one side I hear that the idea of single brain functions localized in specific brain areas is incorrect since everything is processed globally and on the other side I come up permanently with such kind of depictions of the brain    Can someone tell me how far this is correct or incorrect?  
2121,Task-based vs task-positive networks,"Do the terms ""task-positive network"" and ""task-based network"" refer to the same thing, such as the Fronto-Parietal Control Network (FPCN), as distinct from the task-negative networks such as the Default Mode Network (DMN); or do the terms refer to two different types of brain networks?  The question arose to me after having read Fischmeister et al. 2016 (""Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition""), a paper that contrasts the roles of the DMN and FPCN, each seen as archtypes of the task-negative and task-positive (task-based??) networks respectively. However, there are other papers that also seem to employ the two terms interchangeably, while yet others appear to use only one or another - which is why I thought the question might be worth raising in this forum. "
2122,How to detect which memory is being used when answering a yes or no question?,"I am asking participants some questions on a form. I have to know which kind of memory they are using when answering these questions. I am having difficulty deciding this. Is there any special technique to determine this?  For example, consider these questions :   Is your name Majid?  Is the memory used semantic or episodic? I know that most probably everyone would say semantic because there is no event being recalled, but I am not sure if remembering own's name is possible without recalling an event. Is your hair black? This one is only available while thinking of a memory, but like the last one it could be semantic too. Do you know how to ride a bike? This one could be semantic or episodic because I might recall an event of riding a bike and then answer.  Or it could even be procedural memory as I might simulate riding a bike and then say, ""Yes"".   I am trying to figure out how do I assign each question one or more of the memory types?  I am using the memory types introduced by Squire in 2004. The picture is from Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience by Bernard Baars.  "
2123,Scientific legacy of Carl Jung (and of analytical psychology)?,"In the sprit of Is there anything in Freudian psychoanalytic theory that is scientifically sound? I want to ask the same question about the works of Carl Jung, because I know even less about them. Wikipedia has a short paragraph about his legacy, which is mostly about how cited he was (and that does not, alas, entail much how correct his ideas ultimately were), which mentions MBTI as a concrete offshoot of Jung's ideas. I know MBTI was mostly superseded as personality theory. In an blog discussing the latter matter, John A. Johnson (prof of psychology at Penn State) says of the wider Jungian works     Jung's scientifically dubious ideas about archetypes, alchemy, synchronicity, the collective unconscious, the paranormal, and so forth are irrelevant to his theory of psychological types. Jung's theory of types gave us the concepts of introversion and extraversion, which modern, scientific personality psychologists are perfectly happy to use today.   Does this mostly summarize Jung's legacy? I know there have been entire books on his works like The Handbook of Jungian Psychology, but I don't want to read all that to come to a conclusion. Also it seems that book has a single review in the Journal of Analytical Psychology, which looks like an in-house thing; nevertheless the review (by psychoanalyst Joseph Reppen) says:     Although psychology is one of the most popular American majors, Freud,   Jung, and depth psychology are rarely present or are marginalized in introductory   psychology texts. As one colleague remarked to me, if Freud gets a page, Jung   gets a paragraph. And that paragraph probably includes a short comment about   extrovert-introvert–case closed.   Which kinda mirrors what Johnson wrote, but with a bitter tone. The rest of the review is book-oriented, but Reppen seems to me to fail to make a clear case what else is important, legacy-wise in Jung's work.  So, are there other reasonably concise takes on Jung's scientific legacy? And do they agree or disagree with Johnson's take on that? "

Is there a liking curve that goes up and then down with the number of favors? "
2125,Eyewitness testimony study from Power of Habit,"In his book The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg refers to some study from the University of Western Ontario:      STEP THREE: ISOLATE THE CUE      About a decade ago, a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario tried to answer a question that had bewildered social scientists for years: Why do some eyewitnesses of crimes misremember what they see, while other recall events accurately? (...)      She wondered if researchers were making a mistake by   focusing on what questioners and witnesses had said, rather than how   they were saying it. She suspected there were subtle cues that were   influencing the questioning process. But when she watched videotape   after videotape of witness interviews, looking for these cues, she   couldn’t see anything. There was so much activity in each interview –   all the facial expressions, the different ways the questions were   posed, the fluctuating emotions – that she couldn’t detect any   patterns.      So she came up with an idea: She made a list of a few elements she   would focus on – the questioners’ tone, the facial expressions of the   witness, and how close the witness and the questioner were sitting to   each other. Then, she removed any information that would distract her   from those elements. She turned down the volume on the television so,   instead of hearing words, all she could detect was the tone of the   questioner’s voice. She taped a sheet of paper over the questioner’s   face, so all she could see was the witnesses’ expressions. She held a   tape measure to the screen to measure their distance from each other.      And once she started studying these specific elements, patterns leapt   out. She saw that witnesses who misremembered facts usually were   questioned by cops who used a gentle, friendly tone. When witnesses   smiled more, or sat closer to the person asking the questions, they   were more likely to misremember.      In other words, when environmental cues said “we are friends” – a   gentle tone, a smiling face – the witnesses were more likely to   misremember what had occurred. Perhaps it was because, subconsciously,   those friendship cues triggered a habit to please the questioner.      But the importance of this experiment is that those same tapes had   been watched by dozens of other researchers. Lots of smart people had   seen the same patterns, but no one had recognized them before. Because   there was too much information in each tape to see a subtle cue.      Once the psychologist decided to focus on only three categories of   behavior, however, and eliminate the extraneous information, the   patterns leapt out.   Whole chapter is available here How Habits Work.  Do you know guys where I can find this study? In it not listed in notes. "
2126,Why would someone be offended if you season your food before eating it?,"I like to put ketchup on my pork chops but my wife gets mad that I do this before I taste her pork chops.

My View: I obviously dont feel its a big deal to add to something I was going to eat anyway and it did not reduce the amount I enjoyed it, if anything it made it better for me.   Her View: Was that it was rude to the cook and incorrect etiquette to modify the food in anyway that was served to a person. She believes that you should not modify the food in anyway during the meal.   Scenario 1: You get a burger at your friends BBQ and you put ketchup and mustard on the burger. No one is offended in anyway. (she agrees to this one)   Scenario 2: You go to Gordon Ramsey's burger restaurant and he serves you a burger made by him. I am sure the burger is good, but I still like to eat burgers with ketchup and mustard on it. (she thinks this is ultimately rude)    We would like to know if the scenario, occasion and or formality of the meal dictates the etiquette in which the eater is supposed to follow some unspoken eating rules or is this just a difference of opinions that are conflicting with a personal taste preference?   Not ignoring the persons feelings, but are they presumptuous in that someone should eat the food they were given the way you dictated it to them?

2133,Psychoanalysis and its metaphores derived from ancient Greek mythology,"Introduction:  It's fascinating how many of the key concepts of psychoanalysis are presented by metaphores of the ancient Greek mythology. One might wonder whether the Greek mythology is actually the whole psychoanalysis in disguise.  Some examples to remember are the myth of “Narcissus and Echo” (embodied in Freud's essay ""On Narcissism""), the Oedipus and Electra complexes, the Icarus complex, the Medusa complex.  Question:  My question is, could the building blocks of psychoanalysis be derived from the mythologies of other peoples, as well?  (The same questions from another perspective: could we find corresponding myths in the mythologies of other cultures. E.g, is there an equivalent to the myth of “Narcissus and Echo” in the mythologies of other cultures?) "
2134,"""High-conflict people""","While having a look at a recent question here, I ran into some (non-peer reviewed) articles with a description like     High-conflict people (HCPs) have high-conflict personalities. This means they have an ongoing pattern of all-or-nothing thinking, unmanaged emotions, extreme behavior or threats, and a preoccupation with blaming others. They have a Target of Blame, whom they regularly bully, harass, blame, humiliate, annoy, spread rumors about, and subject to many other adversarial behaviors. This pattern increases and maintains interpersonal conflicts, rather than reducing or resolving them — which is what most people try to do.    If you google the HCP term, you'll find several articles with a similar definition, most from the same author. One was even published in the mainstream mass media,  Eventually this HCP is cast a sort of cross-sectional aspect of several personality disorders (at least in one article)     Narcissistic HCPs are characterized by an underlying fear of being inferior or powerless, so they are constantly putting themselves above other people — which alienates them in the process and tends to make people look down on them. Borderline HCPs have a deep fear of being abandoned, so they are constantly clinging and demanding reassurance, but alternating that with occasional rages when they feel abandoned — which often pushes people to abandon them. Antisocial HCPs really don’t want to be dominated by others, so they try hard to dominate others, but often end up in prison, where they are dominated. Paranoid HCPs have a fear of being betrayed by those around them, so they may overreact and attack those they fear — which tends to drive people to turn on them. Histrionic HCPs are preoccupied with being the center of attention and will often publicly criticize other people’s behavior (their Targets of Blame) in an effort to get sympathy and more attention. Knowing these patterns makes it easier to spot them, especially when this is combined with observing the four characteristics of HCPs at the top of this article.    This has some similarities with the alternative (research) abnormal personality model from DSM-5 in the sense that the latter is also using some traits which possibly span several conventional personality disorders:     In the alternative model, the essential criteria to define any personality disorder are: a) moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, and b) the presence of pathological personality traits. A “level of functioning” scale is provided, and sensitivity and specificity data supported the designation of “moderate impairment” as the appropriate threshold to indicate the presence of a personality disorder. As defined in the alternative model, personality functioning consists of the degree to which there is an intact sense of self (involving a clear, coherent identity and effective self-directedness) and interpersonal functioning (reflecting a good capacity for empathy and for mature, mutually rewarding intimacy with others). Pathological personality traits are organized into five trait domains (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism), each of which is further explicated by a set of trait facets reflecting aspects of the domain itself. This trait system has been shown to correlate well with the Five Factor Model.   ""High-conflict people"" don't quite seem to match any of those 5 traits specifically, but I suppose they would score high on antagonism, disinhibition, negative affectivity, and possibly even psychoticism. (On the FFM they'd probably score low on Agreeableness, high on Extraversion and on Neuroticism.)  Is there peer-reviewed research on ""High-conflict people"", perhaps under different terminology? Or is this more of a fringe-scientific grouping? "
2135,What is the psychology behind epiphany?,"What are the neural precursors that lead up to the epiphany? How can one, have more creative insights? How this affects our psyche? What's the psychology behind it?   The word ""epiphany"" has a deep, archetypal resonance for us, dating back to ancient Greece. It comes from the Greek ""epiphaneia,"" meaning ""appearance"" or ""manifestation,"" and referred to the revelations brought to us by the gods. Today ""epiphany"" carries a range of meanings, including ""an intuitive grasp of reality,"" ""an illuminating discovery, realization, disclosure, or insight,"" or simply ""a revealing scene or moment.""   An ephiphany may change your life and most likely the life of the people around you. It could be as simple as braking a mental model, which could open many new doors or neural pathways... For that matter, lets share an interesting examples:      Allegedly Albert Einstein was struck as a young child by being given a   compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it   move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred   in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to   reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a   trolley car to home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in   Bern and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light,   he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later   remarked, ""a storm broke loose in my mind,"" which would allow him to   understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two   years later in 1907 which he called ""the happiest thought of my life""   when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger   would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of   falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him   to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a   curvature in spacetime.   What is happening on the psychological level when one experience such ""aha moment""?    EDIT: What conceptual models of epiphany are out there?  "
2136,Do any personality factors reduce illusory superiority?,"Apparently individuals suffering from schizotypy lack illusory superiority in one particular domain: evaluation of their affect. That is to say, neurotypicals overrate their positive affect (and underrate their negative one), whereas individuals with schizotypy don't do either relative to how their affect is perceived by others.    There's another article which concludes that the five-factor model is good enough to capture schizotypy, although in practice (insofar) specialized tests are used to detect the latter.     That begs the following question: do any of the big five personality factors, especially those that load most heavily on schizotypy (neuroticism, introversion, low openness to experience) have a moderating effect on illusory superiority (in some domain) on their own? By ""on their own"" I mean: is there a correlation between any of the big five (or even HEXACO) factors and lessened illusory superiority (on some issue), including via an interaction effect of the factors, but found without segregating the sample into schizotypy and non-schizotypy?  N.B.: I'm aware of the controversy surrounding depressive realism, but let's stick just to personality here. "

2138,"Does societal view of epic musician, author's epic work affect mainly any human the way they view them overall or it's their personal life or both?","I am trying to figure out this question. It's just an inquisitive thought.  Does a musician, author, novelist, poet's personal life affect a human being's personal view of that epic figure rather than enjoying these figures' personal poetry, short story, novel, a novella, and other works?  If no then why do epic figures are constantly criticized for their personal life? Is it fair? "
2139,How is illusory superiority reconciled with the false-consensus effect?,"On one hand, people often seem to exhibit various forms of illusory [self-]superiority, perhaps the best known example of that being the Dunning–Kruger effect.   On the other hand, the false consensus effect aka social projection seems to work in the opposite direction of making the subject believe he is more similar to others (by making the subject assume the others are [more] similar to him).  Is there an integrative account of these two effects? When does one dominate and when does the other? "
2140,How long it would take to form a conceptual framework to justify a belief?,"From what I understand, the reason to set 1 week as the time between two therapy sessions is for the clients to do homework, which can be: take notes on recursive thoughts and emotions, remember important information that lead to the belief, rewire the brain to build a new habit. (In case of threaten of suicide, it is allowed to have more than one session in one week.)   But from my experience, it takes up to 3 days or less to fully remember the necessary information and organize it in a clear, succinct manner. At then, the person basically satisfies with the answer, and only need to wait for feedback. We can say that the rest 4 days are for them to continue challenging their own view, but it seems that any new information that come up are just minor points, and don't really change the original outline of the answer.  Question: How long does it take to assimilate information, recall memory, verbalize tacit knowledge and organize them as a conceptual framework to justify the belief? Is the number 3 a typical number for most people, or is it just me?  I would exclude other non-cognitive factors, like having a day-job. The belief doesn't need to be true either.  A consequence is that the 1 week waiting between sessions could be different in cognitive therapy, since I think in a logical discussion, any emotions that are evoked will quickly be overcome, as long as the client concentrate on the logic.

2141,Do we learn to improve our working memory capacity without sitting WM tests?,"Do we learn to improve our working memory capacity without sitting WM tests?  Working memory capacity can be measured, but I wondered whether the only way to improve it is learning techniques for working memory tests (such as the digit span test)? I think I remember that working memory capacity is relatively stable in adulthood and reaches that level at a relatively young age in childhood. So I'm asking whether general education improves our WMC, not for supposed brain training techniques. "
2142,"Psychopathy, conscientiousness, selfishness","Having read a miniscule amount about concepts like secondary psychopathy and conscientiousness, I am wondering about how and why psychologists  have decided (or maybe the field of psychology has) that eschewing social norms is a sign of selfishness&mdash;if I have understood or characterised that means of measurement correctly.  From my point of view, the norms of any particular society as a whole cannot be relied upon to be a good indicator of what it is right or wrong to do. Many, if not most, societies inadvertently endorse behaviour which causes extreme suffering to others without any due justification.  In the face of this huge problem facing any moral individual, whereby their inadvertant actions, if they are not thought through (but are merely followed through because they are expected), may cause  or contribute to massive suffering to others, why should anyone think it morally correct or psychologically 'beneficial' to fall back on or adhere to social or societal norms?   How would someone who didn't care about reporting their neighbour for harbouring disfavoured people (Jewish people, gay people, communist people) in Nazi Germany come out on a secondary psycopathy scale, or conscientiousness scale? And how would they fare if they didn't really care too much about when they got their paperwork in, or how punctual they were, because there was far more important stuff to worry about?  If we don't want to fall into the trap of endorsing whatever violence one's society wishes to inflict upon a disfavoured or invisible group, don't we need to be sceptical about the priorities that we are superficially handed down arbitrarily by our immediate society and try and find out what it is actually important to do or not do?  And if we don't undertake to do this, but instead follow societal norms, are we not risking inadvertently blindly sending people or other sentient beings to ends involving huge amounts of pain and suffering? And is this, and other norm-following behaviour not a form of indolent and lazy selfishness?  What is the structured thinking behind psychologists assigning behaviour that doesn't fall in with societal norms - often very superficial types of behaviour - to selfishness? "
2143,Impact of pre-college schooling on IQ (WAIS)?,"Introduction  I'll give context for my question from personal experience, but then I'll generalize my question so that it's broadly useful.  When I was a child, my mother home schooled me. When I entered the 9th(?) grade, I dropped out. And for a few years prior to that, I cheated through most of my schoolwork. Someone suggested that even if I was cheating, I was still learning; this wasn't the case, because my cheating involved memorizing ""A A B D B B A.""   My understanding of the WAIS is that it merely serves as a way to approximate general intelligence, but it can't directly measure it (except perhaps working memory). And at least in cases like these, it won't work very well because it relies heavily on crystallized knowledge. When I took it, there were questions which I might have learned from school, but obviously I didn't have that experience; I believe this harmed my verbal IQ. You'll understand how verbal similarity and perhaps other sub scores could be likewise impacted. I also imagine that my math score suffered. My thinking is that there are numbers I would have been familiar with, thus reducing my response time. And I am more prone to error in my responses, due to lack of practice. I also would have had better schemes to quickly translate the data into an answer.   Total years of schooling the child missed Age of child when those years are missed (college vs highschool) Child's general intelligence (not as measured by the WAIS)     Questions:   How would increasing total years missed accumulatively affect IQ (e.g. 6 years = 9 points)? There's an article below about college increasing students' IQs, but what about K-12--would missing earlier years affect IQ more severely? And would missing school have more or less severe impact on IQ scoring among more intelligent children?  If the child (perhaps now an adult) studies, would the child's IQ increase relatively drastically? When I say relative, I mean relative to someone else who also studies and has the same real general intelligence, but did attend K-12. And to keep it simple, let's stick to math IQ score for this question.   Lastly, is there a better test for measuring such a person's intelligence?  I asked many questions, probably more than exists within current research. If you work in psychometrics or have approximately relevant knowledge, I'd be happy to hear your assumptions.  And if I need to reduce my questions, then consider the full-scale scores below. If those are the scores of someone who missed school as I described, then what score would you expect them to earn had they not missed school? ... And, is there a better test for them?   80  100  120     Related data:  Per the link below, adding a year of school increases IQ. Although not stated, they give the impression that this is referring to college.   [website]"
2144,What are some criticisms of HEXACO from the Big Five camp?,"I read the 2009 review-ish chapter of McCrae in The Cambridge Handbook of Personality Psychology and I noticed he never once mentions HEXACO (or its 6th axis: honesty-humility), although McCrae does spend the spacetime to debunk a (totally obscure to me) Polish model of personality that had added a 6th spirituality factor. That to me felt like sweeping HEXACO under the rug, so to speak.  Most of the research on relating HEXACO to Big Five has come (unsurprisingly) from the researchers/proponents of the former, see e.g. What are the correlations between HEXACO and NEO-PI factors?   So, has there been some explicit criticism of HEXACO from the Big Five ""heavyweights"" (well known researchers/promoters)?    There is a passage in the same book in another chapter by Boele De Raad noting that:      While the Big Five structure has found large adherence, claims for psycholexically   based factors beyond the Big Five have been made, for two reasons mainly.   The first reason is that the correlation matrices may not be optimally exhausted,   and the second reason is that the trait domain may not be truly exhausted. This   second reason comes in two versions, one suggesting that the psycholexical   approach has been too restrictive in selecting personality descriptors (Almagor,   Tellegen andWaller 1995), and the other suggesting that the psycholexical approach   has been restricted to the use of trait-descriptive adjectives (cf., De Raad and   Hofstee 1993).      Ashton and Lee (2001) argued along the lines of exhausting the correlation matrix.   They suggested that an additional Honesty-Humility factor, representing such   traits as honest, sincere, fair and just, versus dishonest, conceited and boasting,   could systematically be extracted. Support for this sixth factor was observed in   several languages (Ashton, Lee, Perugini et al. 2004), but not, or not clearly, in all   languages where this sixth factor was studied, as in American-English (Ashton,   Lee and Goldberg 2004), Turkish (Somer and Goldberg 1999) and Croatian   (Mlacic and Ostendorf 2005).   This is basically lexical criticism, but since the lexical perspective was hardly dominant in the development of the Big Five (according to the highly cited review of McCrae and John, 1992), this lexical criticism seems like a rather minor point.  Also note that De Raad himself appears to favor lexicalism, having proposed an eight-factor model from the latter perspective, by extending analysis to more parts of speech than the traditional approach using just adjectives. So De Raad's criticism of HEXACO being from a lexical perspective isn't surprising. "

When I pet him, does he know that this action originates from my brain (head)? Or does he think that there is a mysterious soft massaging machine hanging in the air? Of course, most of us believe the former. Especially as he seems to be attentively looking into my eyes when I do so. But I wonder if there have been any rigorous scientific experiments verifying that? And from the Lex Fridman's interview of Christof Koch (47:47), he mentioned that bees have very complex neurons and can identify individuals. I also wonder how the experiment was done to verify that.

2147,Clear definition of ego,"Is there a clear definition of the ego which is accepted by the neuroscientific community?

2148,Can signals from the prefrontal cortex alone trigger a readiness potential in the pre-supplementary motor area?,"Background  In Haggard, Patrick. ""Human volition: towards a neuroscience of will."" Nature Reviews Neuroscience 9.12 (2008): 934., the author states in the caption of Figure 1 (pg. 4):        The primary motor cortex (M1) receives two broad classes of inputs.   One key input (left-hand panel) reaches M1 from the supplementary   motor area (SMA) and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), which   in turn receives inputs from the basal ganglia and the prefrontal   cortex.   Question  I'm failing to disambiguate the ending phrase (emphasis mine)       basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex   Is the ""and"" meant to be interpreted as a logical AND or logical OR? In other words, does a readiness potential in the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) require an active input from both the basal ganglia AND the prefrontal cortex concurrently or is a sufficiently strong signal from either region alone sufficient?   Hunch   My guess is that the latter is the case. For example, on the very same caption of Figure 1 part b, the author indicates that the signal from the frontopolar cortex starts a chain that ends with voluntary action of the right hand. This indicates that executive control from the frontopolar cortex  alone can trigger an eventual movement. Since this is only a hunch, I still want to clarify the point of confusion.    Intent  I'm asking this question because I want to figure out a situation at the behavioral level, namely if people can trigger movements purely by executive function and independently of primal urges/apprehensions.    Standards  It may be difficult to give a direct and bulletproof answer to the question without a deliberate experiment (see comment). However, I find it acceptable to have a lower standard for potential answer post - for example, conjectures based on indirect evidence.  "
2149,how to correctly determine false alarm rate (in a specific experimental setup),"i have a specific experimental setup (at least i think so :) It's a replication and i don't know how to correctly determine the false alarm rate for the visual fields since in the article i replicate the FA calculation procedure is not explicite shown. But my impression is that it kind of deviates from a simple 50% noise 50% signal+noise design. Moreover correct d'prime and bias measures depend on the calculated FA% scores. Maybe the design as such is not suitable for calculation of such SDT meassures? I read through the Nacmilian Creelman book (though not very carefully) and am not able to find a solution.  ok it's a lateralized lexical decision study testing the left hemisphere superiority in word recognition ( better word - non(pseudo)word discrimination in the Right vs Left visual field)   overall 256 trials on every trial 2 letter strings are presented for 100 ms: one string to the left and one to the right of a fixation point. ( xxxxx + xxxxx ) on 128 trials a word is presented  randomly to the left and right accompanied by a pseudoword: 64 RVF word presentations (e.g. gilus + virus) and 64 LVF word presentations (e.g. virus + gilus) on 128 trials pseudwords are presented to both sides-hemifields e.g.(mudo + mumi).   Subjects must press left button if word in LVF right button if word in RVF and spacebar if nonwords are in both hemifields.  Generally i would like to determine the d' or A' and bias measures for each hemifield, the correct calculation of FA% is crucial.  The Hit rate determination for LVF and RVF seems straight forward: correct left and right presses, each divided by 64, since there are 64 word presentations in each hemifield.  Question 1: when it comes to determining the false alarm rate for one hemifield which i would like to use for d' calculation: should i divide the measured FAs on one side by all possible FA occurences on that side i.e. 192 (128  bilateral nonword presentations + 64 nonwords in word-nonword trials)?  Question 2: because the script did not repeat timed out trials should they be  considered as misses?  thanks  Kuba "
2150,Why doesn't psychology impose higher standards to solve its replication crisis?,"This question is inspired by a previous one on Physics.SE. If we believe the answer to that question, particle physics doesn't suffer nearly as much from the reproducibility crisis because it has much higher standards than the social sciences.     The 'replication crisis' is that many effects in social sciences (and, although to a lesser extent, other scientific fields) couldn't be reproduced.      ...      If anything, there is a suspicion that the practices at the LHC might even result in the opposite of the 'replication crisis;' analyses that find effects that are somewhat significant might be examined and tweaked until they decrease.   But if that answer is true, that suggests a simple way to solve the reproducibility crisis in fields like psychology: just impose higher standards.  Question: why hasn't psychology (and other fields as a whole) done that? Or is that answer misrepresenting what psychologists already do? "

2157,"Is it really possible to ""go too deep inside the killer's mind""?","We've all seen it in film and hour-long format TV dramas, a brilliant criminal profiler, seen as the best in his field by their peers, delves 'too deeply' into the mind of the killer/rapist/undesirable he or she is looking for and disastrous consequences ensue. This often turns out in one of a few ways (the profiler committed the last N crimes unaware, he/she is led into a trap, he/she becomes the new killer, etc.).  My question is could this realistically happen? Would spending enough time trying to make yourself think like a serial murderer/crazed sex offender/phantom peanut butter thief really cause someone to 'slip in' to their behaviour patterns, unbeknownst to the profiler?  On one hand it seems like if you were trying to force yourself to think like a killer, eventually with enough dedication and time it might become second nature. But it still seems a little far-fetched that a perfectly normal (aka. non-murdering) person would be capable of it. Is this really even a technique used in this field? "
2158,Is continuous split or meta - awareness a scientifically supported concept?,"There are a number of spiritual practices that practice self-awareness and continuous awareness of one's thoughts and actions (for example the teachings of Ekhart Tolle):     Tolle writes that ""the most significant thing that can happen to a   human being [is] the separation process of thinking and awareness"" and   that awareness is ""the space in which thoughts exist"".   There are also a number of techniques employed by people who practice lucid dreaming - namely reality checks and being aware of one's thoughts and surroundings. Lucid dreamers expect that this kind of awareness would carry over into the dream experience and help achieve lucid dreaming.  Both have a common goal - to create some kind of a meta-awareness, or a watchdog awareness, similar to a background process on a computer. A watchdog task on a computer can wake the computer up if some other process has hanged, or some other task is taking up too much resources.  My question is - Does modern science (2015) have evidence to support that human brain is capable of running the ""background process"" kind of meta awareness of one's thoughts and actions for extended period of time""?   My question about ordinary daily activities - can this kind of background awareness process be running all the time, regardless of activity performed? "

The same test was taken three times within 3 and a half hours.

2160,Research on aversion to cognitive effort?,"I was reading Danny K's recent book for fun (Thinking Fast and Slow, 2011), and he suggests briefly that some people's reliance on their intuitions (i.e., ""System 1"") might sometimes indicate a sort of aversion to cognitive effort (i.e., ""System 2"").    For example, if you give a participant ""Joe"" a tricky problem that has an intuitive but false answer, Joe might not think too hard about the question, so he'll just give his (false) intuition.  In this case, Joe does not attempt elaborative processing or sustained cognitive effort (i.e., engaging System 2) because he has learned that this can be unpleasant and/or tiring.  Thus he relies on his intuition and gets the question wrong.  While there are probably many alternative explanations for Joe's behavior, it seems that aversion to mental effort could be one.  Is there any research exploring this idea? Or any research that frames it in another way (e.g., something to do with affective forecasting, learning, self-regulation)? Or am I totally making this up?

2163,"Consumer vs creator, what are the differences?","Creators create, consumers consume what has been created. Consumers watch TV, creators write the script. Consumers play the game, creators design and make the game.  There are all kinds of creators and consumers I guess, from chefs and gourmets to artists and art collectors. Architects and people who like buying cool houses, mechanics/engineers and car enthusiasts, graphic designers and whoever uses their designed software.  In the end though the situation is always the same, on one hand we have a person or a group of people who created something, and on the other hand we have a person or a group of people that bought and ""consumed"" it. (There is a fine line between creator and someone doing what he's paid to do though)  I'm wondering on which side the grass is greener on the psychological level. Given that the creator likes to create what he's creating, and the consumer likes to consume what he's consuming, which is going to be happier? The artist while he paints, or the person while he admires the painting, the chef while he creates the recipe and cooks, or the person enjoying the food afterwards, the game developer or the person playing the game?  Is the creator or the consumer more likely to be happy in the short (while it is being created vs while it is being consumed) and long term? (after it has been created vs after it has been consumed)  And what are the long term effects on our brains by spending most of our days creating (be it writing, painting, welding or programming or whatever) versus the long term effects on our brains by spending most of our days consuming ? (watching tv, playing video games, eating fast food or mindlessly browsing the internet)  Or in just one question: how will it affect a persons mind to go from being mostly a consumer to being mostly a creator or vice versa?

2164,Correlation between BIS and BAS responses,"As a part of my lab experiment, participants had to answer questions for BIS and BAS (BAS reward, drive and fun) scales. The correlation matrix shows that BIS is significantly positively correlated with BAS reward, BAS fun and BAS drive. Has anyone experienced similar issues? Is this an issue? If yes, is it possible (and how) to correct for that? BIS (Behavioral Inhibition System) and BAS (Behavioral Activation System) - I administered the scale developed by Carver and White (1994), as presented on pg. 323 in their work ""Behavioral inhibition, behavioral activation, and affective responses to impending reward and punishment: The BIS/BAS scales"" (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, 319-333). I would assume that BIS should not be positively correlated with any of the BAS scales as BIS is related to avoidance motivation and BAS is related to approach motivation.I.e. a person scoring high on BIS should not be scoring high on BAS measures and vice versa.  The variables are intended as predictors. I want to examine if BAS (approach motivation) sensitivity predicts a rightward bias in product choice, and if BIS (avoidance motivation) sensitivity predicts a leftward bias.  "
2165,Is there a rating scale in psychology that is related to happiness?,"There are many rating scales used in psychiatry to rate the severity of disorders. Thus, the extensive depression scales. What about the opposite, happiness scales? If 0 denotes excessive depressive symptoms and 100 denotes absence of these symptoms, does a scale exist that say goes from 100 (absence of depressive symptoms) to 200 (hyperthymia, euphoria)? "
2166,What studies can tell me more about Big5 facet O3?,"The big5 facet O3 is called ""Feelings"". What does this facet tell about a person's feelings exactly?  Where can I find more information on correlations to Big5 facet O3 - ""Feelings""? (Im looking for links to scientific studies) "
2167,When can we say that machines are conscious?,"We have already witnessed complex computing systems winning chess games and IBM Watson beat his human counterparts at a game of 'Jeopardy!'. However, so far we have not seen signs of consciousness amongst these machines.  Is it theoretically possible to create conscious machines? Are there any philosophical bottlenecks that will never allow the development of consciousness in any nonliving carbon-based organism?   Furthermore, can scientists ever agree on a definition of ""consciousness"" if a machine claims that it is conscious? "
2168,"What would explain an intense feeling of being extremely present, for no reason?","What would explain an intense feeling of being extremely present, randomly and for no reason ?  The feeling is not tied to any behavior, thought or action. It comes out of nowhere, when doing a usual remedial task, like driving or walking somewhere. Also, it is not periodic (could happen once or twice in a life time).  ..and is there a name for this?   (It shares some similarities with peak experience but seems different than flow, in that flow it is based on an activity and incorporates polarized emotions, enjoyment, etc).  Edit - To clarify as asked in the comments:    This feeling of intense present can be analogous to the moment of having a dream full of action and chaos, then all of a sudden awaking to a dead silent and still bedroom. Or another example; one is sitting in a library and a large air conditioning system is running but not consciously noticed. Then, all of a sudden it switches off and there is a feeling if intense quietness and stillness and awareness of its absence. (These are analogous moments, where there is that dramatic switch in state... that is the subject in question but in this case not tied to any external event or dream.)  Or perhaps just feeling really awake or effortlessly alert more than usual. It also is ABSENCE of any conflict, tiredness, negativity and/or tension. In addition, it is of a neutral disposition- not happy and not sad, just extreme sense of being.  "
2169,Why do we like stories?,"Almost everyone likes a good story, the way in which it is delivered matters, but most people love a good story in one form or another, whether it's delivered through conversation, a book, a video game, a movie, or even if it's just them trying to make sense of how a shoe got into a swimming pool (That's right, it's ok if the story is created in your own mind, it's still a story, so we seem to like telling stories as much if not more than we like hearing or reading them).  So why do we like stories at all? Why do some of us like stories to the point of obsessing over them?  How does this happen? And is this something that can be controlled (i.e. could you make someone who prefers violent stories prefer switch over to preferring romance stories? Can someone be conditioned to not be interested in any stories at all no matter what they may be about?)  Why is it also that once we start with a story, it can be hard to stop because you want to know what happens next or want to know how it ends? Why do some of us care if people ""spoil"" the ending for us by telling us what happens before we see or read or hear it, while some of us seem not to care?  Has any real research been done on this?

2170,Can I teach my brain to understand binary?,"The question is if I could teach my brain to understand binary codes (for example, ASCII) just like I teach it to understand English, French or any other language.  That includes:   not to translate it each time I read some binaries, like 01100001 01100010 automatically reads 'ab'. understand both written, pronounced and somehow sound-coded form (like Morse) write and say it naturally   The idea is not to teach computer speak to people, but to teach people speak to a computer in his language. In general, human brain can be taught anything. It is a programmable computer. However, you can only program it very slow. If you can teach your subconscious to multiply numbers, why can't you teach it to encode MD5? Or decoding HTTPS data given a key? Even bruteforce?   So the question is if there are any researches on the topic, or the people who tried such learning? Are there any techniques? Also, what if we teach a 2-year old child this language, will it be natural for him just like the English is natural for English-grown child?  P.S. Some upgrade of this idea is to place some radiowaves-to-soundwaves direct converters and ""listen"" to the radiosignals around you. Somehow ""spy"" on neighbours Wi-Fi.  P.P.S. I've asked this questions on datascience stackexchange, and the community suggested moving it here. However, it is also moved to lifehacks, where I received a few answers: [website]"
2171,Are there gender differences in color discrimination ability?,"There appears to be a prevalent stereotype that girls seem to have ""heightened"" color perception. By this term, I mean that they can identify the salient features of different shades of color. However, many ideas that are widespread in public consciousness do not seem to be based on empirical evidence.   Is there any research that has investigated gender differences in color perception? In particular, are there any well-performed experiments in the study of perception or cognitive neuroscience that may shed light on this perceived phenomenon?  There are many 'sources' on the internet that seem to have commented on this, but I can't find any compelling evidence personally. There is some literature on cross-cultural variation and cross-language perceptual differences, is there any literature on cross-gender variation?    Sources:  Jameson, K. A., Highnote, S.

2172,"Is there a biological limit for ""amount"" of happiness?","I have heard about neurotransmitters like dopamin and serotonin that are supposed to play a role in our feeling of happiness. I don't know how these chemicals works in our brain, but I am thinking that if happiness is dependent on chemical reactions in our brains there must be some physical limit to how happy we can be.  If I own a 10 million dollar yacht, and upgrade to a 100 million dollar yacht could it be that my happiness is already at its maximum and I am throwing away 90 million dollars?  Does the chemistry of the brain impose a limit on how happy it is possible to feel? "
2173,Does sitting idle for one month without work leads to depression?,"Does sitting idle for one month without work leads to depression?  Following case is an example:  If a human do 8 hours job before Computer. Because of no work or a few work; generally sitting idle for one month. and when work came after a month; then that human do not want to do it because:  Symptoms which generally such human is facing:  1) that humans head remain heavy; always feel like outing. Even if that human go to outing and come back to office feel like go out again.  2) It is like nothing is in that human head. Just sounds ""shaaan shaaaan"".  3) Sometimes it is like that human need to get my ear clean from ENT; may be due to that head is heavy. but nothing is there in that human's ear , because that human use to clean my ears during bathing.  4) Life becoming dull. Now work came after 1 month; that human being lazy not to attempt that work. that human do not want work now.  5) Not agreeing to any external Motivation and self motivation is becoming zero.  6) Just looking at Facebook, Amazon and doing nothing. Not a like on facebook; but looking just. It is like NOTHING NEW.  7) if reading news forget the story after 15 minutes. Forget the work that human's family member says.  8) that human feel like that human is blunder; that human do mistakes; you all leave that human; throw that human out of computer company.  Could anyone please figure out situation of that human's mind!!! is that human getting mad or depressed? "
2174,Does classical music enhance intelligence in children more than other genres?,"This question is based on a previous question I have written on Parenting SE: Does playing classical music for infants and young children make them smarter?  Question:     Are these claims actually saying classical music is more intelligence enhancing than other forms of music? If so, is that true?   As a composer, I would find this interesting because I think certainly there are many different kinds of music and it seems very surprising to single out one genre as requiring more intelligence.   For instance, suppose you say Mozart is more sophisticated then the Boss (Bruce Springsteen) and therefore more intelligence promoting.  By that logic then, Schoenberg's music should be better for children than Mozart since Schoenberg is certainly more complex than Mozart (e.g. chromatic vs diatonic scales; polymeter vs single meter). But I would never play Schoenberg for my child instead of Mozart because I find Schoenberg unnatural to listen to because it is so weird and complex. The point is I think simply saying classical music is more sophisticated or superior isn't a very meaningful distinction and greater clarification should be given about why classical music in particular enhances learning (if in fact that has any basis).   Another way of saying this is, why doesn't music in general enhance it then?  Why classical music in particular?   "
2175,Research on properties of effective feedback,"I've been searching everywhere I know of for research concerning the topics listed below, but have been unable to find anything. The best I can come up with is general literature on feedback. Specifically I am looking for research on the following subjects:   The effects of feedback on an artifact given in-context of artifact versus out-of-context. A concrete example is feedback on a report; is it preferable to provide written feedback in the report margins (in-context) or in a separate document (out-of-context), and why/why not? Context switches in workflows and why they are bad/good in general. Related to 2: theory supporting integration of related workflows into a single computer, supported workflow. A concrete example is Microsoft Word which has a feature to edit images inside the application itself even though it is a word processor. Why is this preferable compared to e.g. editing the image in an external application and inserting it afterward?  And is it (always)?  Are there special cases where it may be counter-productive? Properties of effective feedback. Preferably supporting the theses that:  4.1 feedback on a produced artifact is more effective if given early than late. This could be supported by arguments about memory and learning in general, e.g. that it's easier to remember what you did just now than a few hours ago, and thus also easier to comprehend feedback about what you did and the artifacts you produced in that time.  4.2 feedback on an artifact is more effective when the receiver is in the same ""environment"" he was in when the artifact was produced. A counterexample would be to give feedback on a report written in Microsoft Word by copying the report onto a web page and writing the feedback there. In that case the environment where the feedback is read by the receiver (the webpage) is completely different from the one where the artifact was produced (Microsoft Word). This has negative effects on effectiveness (which and why?).   I imagine the literature would be within cognitive load theory, learning theory, user interface design, usability design etc, but any suggestions are very much appreciated. "

2178,Why do the hemispheres of the brain control the opposite sides of the body?,"History of question: This previous question asked about both hemispheric specialisation and control of opposite sides of the body. The point was made that these are two very different questions. So the original question has been reduced to the specialisation topic, and the ""opposite sides"" question is asked here.  So the question here is:  Why do the hemispheres of the brain control or receive sensory input from the opposite sides of the body? What is the benefit or purpose of this? "

I want to know how neuroscientists use mathematics to describe memory in living creatures. How do neuroscientists model memory and show how it works by mathematics?  I am a theoretical physics PhD student, and interested in neuroscience too. The only tool which I have and I could use to study neuroscience is mathematics and programing. That's why I want to know how neuroscientists address the memory by mathematics. I know how math works to describe neurons oscillations and action potential, but I don't know how it works for memory.  Any reference or review article is welcome too. "

2181,What is the appropriate action when using poorly worded scales from previous literature?,"I work with questionnaire data and am fairly sensitive to good practice in questionnaire construction. Usually I generate my own, but when I draw on existing literature to use reliably reproduced measurement scales, sometimes the items are poorly worded or vague enough that I would not consider them appropriate or valid. Consider the item:  ""Weeds should be eradicated because they inhibit the full development of useful and ornamental plants.""  A participant can say that they disagree with this item. So do they think weeds shouldn't be eradicated? Or that they should be eradicated, but not for the reason given. Maybe they think that weeds do inhibit the full development of useful plants, but that is not sufficient cause for eradication of weeds. The question is vague enough that it doesn't confer any useful information about the participant's broader view on weeds except in the one fringe case where they agree with it as stated. Clearly it should be split into two items and already the scale is much improved by it.  There are other examples that are much more shockingly bad, but have been reproduced enough times that they form reliable scales. Is it better to use them as-is, with all their flaws, or to use them as fully as possible while fixing any glaring errors, or not to use them at all? "
2182,What exactly is meant when it is said that only you can make yourself happy?,"From Lifehack:     Thinking that having a significant other will complete you.         If you are not a whole person already, then having a romantic partner will   not make you whole. Plus, it puts a lot of pressure on the other   person to “make you happy.” You need to be happy with yourself with or   without someone. Having a significant other doesn’t make you happier.   Only you can make yourself happy.   Also, on many other self help sites I have noticed similar statements.  I don't understand this. For example, because you are a human, you probably want to have a man or woman in your life who would love you both mentally and physically, so how exactly are you going to make yourself happy if you don't have that significant other or can't get one?  Does that quote mean that you need to forget/suppress your human needs?  "
2183,Neurosurgically grown neural link between two brains?,"I guess it's possible to surgically restore neural connection after a trauma (e.g. a severed hand can be reattached if done quickly).  And, from history of evolution of hominids, it seems that just by increasing brain size by 30% it's possible to develop a radically higher level of cognitive abilities.   Putting these two ideas together, I wonder if anyone tried to grow a neural link between two separate brains. Maybe even a narrow, low-bandwidth wisp of neurons between two brains would adapt itself to expand the consciousness. I wonder what will be the effect of such a 100% increase in brain size. And if it works, we can connect three brains, then four, five, etc. Of course, these ""compound people"" would have trouble moving around as they won't be able to separate their heads more than few centimeters...but if the tradeoff is that they become exponentially more sentient...?   Could you please point to some research performed in this direction?  Is it even legal in developed countries? Thank you. "
2184,What are the cognitive effects of increasing testosterone levels in men?,"I've recently became interested in the effects if testosterone on the cognitive function in men, but cannot find much hard scientific evidence on the subject.   What are the cognitive effects of increasing testosterone levels in men?. There's a tremendous amount of anecdotal evidence from body builders, etc, but I'm looking for hard science, where the levels were measured before and after, and the trials were less than a month long.  Some of the claims made about increased testosterone levels seem very interesting, and I would like to know if any of that is true.    does increasing testosterone levels increase subjective feeling of well being in men? does increased testosterone benefit concentration ? does increased testosterone benefit non-sexual motivation or ambition? does increased testosterone benefit logical/math/engineering endeavors?   Here's what I see on Wikipedia snippet on testosterone and brain:     The literature suggests that attention, memory, and spatial ability   are key cognitive functions affected by testosterone in humans.   Preliminary evidence suggests that low testosterone levels may be a   risk factor for cognitive decline and possibly for dementia of the   Alzheimer's type,[70][71][72][73] a key argument in life extension   medicine for the use of testosterone in anti-aging therapies. Much of   the literature, however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic   relationship between spatial performance and circulating   testosterone,[74] where both hypo- and hypersecretion (deficient- and   excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on   cognition.

2185,Progress on Arnheim's perceptual forces in vision,"In the second edition of Rudolf Arnheim's Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye, published in 1974, (Google Books Preview available here) the opening chapter on ""balance"" begins with a discussion of ""perceptual forces"" in static imagery, such as line drawings and paintings. For Arnheim, perceptual forces are literal forces that act on perceived objects, with a point of application, a direction, and a magnitude. They usually do not have direct counterparts in physical reality, but ""Perceptually and artistically, they are quite real."" On page 17, available here, Arnheim states that he doesn't know where these forces are represented in the brain:     … Where, then, are these forces?      In order to answer this question we must recall how an observer obtains his knowledge of the square and the disk. Light rays, emanating from the sun or some other source, hit the object and are partly absorbed and partly reflected by it. Some of the reflected rays reach the lenses of the eye and are projected on its sensitive background, the retina. Many of the small receptor organs situated in the retina combine in groups by means of ganglion cells. Through these groupings a first, elementary organization of visual shape is obtained very close to the level of retinal stimulation. As the electrochemical messages travel toward their final destination in the brain, they are subjected to further shaping at other way stations until the pattern is completed at the various levels of the visual cortex.      At which stages of this complex process the physiological counterpart of our perceptual forces originates, and by what particular mechanisms it comes about, is beyond our present knowledge. If, however, we make the reasonable assumption that every aspect of a visual experience has its physiological counterpart in the nervous system, we can anticipate, in a general way, the nature of these brain processes. We can assert, for instance, that they must be field processes. This means that whatever happens at any one place is determined by the interaction between the parts and the whole. If it were otherwise, the various inductions, attractions, and repulsions could not occur in the field of visual experience.      An observer sees the pushes and pulls in visual patterns as genuine properties of the perceived objects themselves. …   (Emphasis mine.) What scientific progress on this problem has been made in the 40 years since?  Have we confirmed the existence of a universal, involuntary process that generates perceptual forces? If so, what is its mechanism? Where and how early are the forces perceived? To what extent are they influenced by top-down attention? Does the mechanism share neural resources with the perception of motion, or with other senses? "

2187,Does mental rigidity cause psychological problems?,Is there a correlation between mental disorders and mental rigidity?  I suspect that when people have very strong beliefs and it happens that this beliefs are dysfunctional they can incur into mental disorders. To further clarify the question it can be also reformulated in another way. Is it possible to state that most of people change their beliefs to become adaptive to the requirements of society while stubborn people don't?  Is that correct? 
2188,Is depression an inflammatory disease?,"In the paper:   Michael Berk et al, So depression is an inflammatory disease, but where does the inflammation come from?, BMC Medicine 2013, 11:200, doi:10.1186/1741-7015-11-200   it is presented as an undisputed fact that depression is an inflammatory disease.  For example (the first sentence of the abstract):     We now know that depression is associated with a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response and activation of cell-mediated immunity, as well as activation of the compensatory anti-inflammatory reflex system.   However, AFAIK, we are far from understanding the etiology of depression (perhaps there is no universal one). Sure, there are many correlates (for example – levels of neurotransmitters), but I haven't heard  that there a single, accepted cause (except for the cited paper). For the reference, Wikipedia mentions inflammation as one of multiple related conditions in the ""Other hypotheses"" section.   So, as of now, is it universally accepted that depression is an inflammatory disease? And if not, is it at least one of many mainstream opinions?  Discussion on HN, through which I've learnt about this paper "
2189,Is perfectionism related to OCD?,"Is it right to say that a really strong attitude and stubbornness to do something is really similar to an obsession?  I'll try to explain better what I mean.  Let's take a really good developer or a really good scientist. Very often the reason which is leading him to be so good is the addiction to his work.   For some guys, for example, the respect for the rule should be maniacal.   So, is it possible to state that a strong perfectionism / addiction is often readable as a form of obsessive personality trait? (maybe ego-syntonic, and since not a disorder) "
2190,Why does optogenetics not mean that perfect brain-computer interfaces are possible?,"There have been multiple articles and videos circulating on the Internet claiming that optogenetics has made it possible to have perfect input/output to the brain from a computer. This is obviously false or someone would be making a lot of money selling this.  Consequently, I'm curious as to why this is false. Why does having the ability to fire and read the firing information off of individual neurons not imply that a seamless human-computer interface is possible? I'm assuming that this has something to do with the limits of the processing power of our brain and the limits of neuro-plasticity, but my experience in this domain is limited.  If this question is too broad (and I think it is), it can be reframed as a request for references. What current research is being done on this problem? What are the current approaches? Who is working on it? Are there any publications that nicely describe the progress in this (hypothetical) domain? "
2191,Why isn't psychotherapy more direct with patients?,"While it is possible to  tell someone that they are affected by OCD or they are narcissistic, I think that trying to help people simply by giving them direct advice doesn't work. I also think that citing authoritative sources, which show that they are positive to some disorder diagnostic test, usually doesn't work.  Dale Carnegie explains that people don't take into consideration what is right or the truth, but what doesn't hurt their self-esteem.   Can you explain me better why psychotherapy is not directly telling patients what their diagnosis is?  Why is it more effective to avoid being direct in trying to correct people's personality traits? Is this phenomenon bound to confirmation bias?  "
2192,Is there difference between a memory of a dream and memory of waking experience?,"I'm very interested in dreaming and have pretty good dream recall. This makes me able to recall and distinguish hundreds of experience within my memory and label them as ""dreams"". I'm trying to understand if there's indeed some feature of a dream memory that makes it different from an ordinary waking memory?  Upon reflection on my personal experiences, it appears to me that when I recall a waking life memory, typically the process is two fold and sequential - first recall the scene then recall the action and combine the two. For example: I was sitting in a room at a local hackerspace + I was talking to fellow hackers there. I can then proceed to try to recall pieces of that conversation. This process seems sequential to me.  However, when I recall the dream memory, it seems that I recall both place and action at the same time, together, with a typically longer sequence of events all recalled much quicker. For example: I was locked in a room with no exit and has created a portal in the wall to escape from the room, flying out of a portal in some other location.  These events are recalled all together, in less than a second, and are clearly identified as a dream along with the recall. The content of that dream, although clearly non-real is similar to a video game called ""Portal"" that I played on a computer in the waking life. I can recall the waking life expeirence of playing that game, although in a linear fashion.  Has there been any brain imaging studies or other evidence that supports the idea that the recall of dreams is different from the recall of waking life experiences? "
2193,Are words and ideas written in a distinctive font easier to remember?,"I read that serif fonts have more distinctive characters, and I was wondering if, at the brain level, the fact that something is written with more distinctive characters would be more easily remembered?  I saw a study telling that less legible fonts were easily remembered, but actually, I'm wondering if they are more easily remembered because they are less legible or more because they have more distinctive characters (even Comic Sans MS that is considered by many, including me, as a very bad font, have some characters that are pretty distinctive)? "
2194,Are there neural loops within a column or an area of the cortex?,"Neuronal networks can make loops because a neuron has a direction (from dendrite to axon).  What's the smallest area in the cortex where we can find a loop and what are these loops?  I understand there are loops between different cortical areas through the white matter.  Experiments, like this one, show there are interactions between cortical layers. But it doesn't necessary mean there are loops.  Other experiments, like this one,   looking at signals propagation in pieces of cortex with a  cut showed the propagation could  somehow circumvent the cut and keep propagating. Again it shows the existence of some local circuits but not necessarily loops.  Do we have a proof of local loops in the cortex?  How large a piece of cortex has to be to contain a loop?  What are these loops? "
2195,Signal detection theory: How to calculate c' when d' is 0?,"Reframed the original question to include more background information:  My experiment concerns the recall ability of individuals concerning information about animals. Within-subject design: Whether an animal is dangerous or safe (danger). Whether an animal lives in Africa or Australia (location). In the recall phase, participants had to identify the animals they saw as dangerous/safe, African/Australian.  Responses were coded as Hit (stimuli danger, response danger), Miss (stimuli danger, response Safe), correct rejection (Stimuli safe, response safe) and finally false alarm (stimuli safe, response danger) We expected that sensitivity depends on the importance of the information to wellbeing (this has been found in other studies as well), but also that bias is affected by individual differences. D’ refers to sensitivity as it is the difference between the signal (danger) and noise distribution (safe). C refers to the bias (the criterion of the respondent, a tendency to say yes or no) and c’ is c relative to d’ . However, d’ in some cases is 0, when the proportion of hits (hits/(hits+misses) is equal to the proportion of false alarms (false alarms/(fa+correct rejections)) making it impossible to compute c’ (c/d'). As such, my question is whether there is a commonly used and supported correction?  More information about signal detection theory and its use in cognitive sciences can be found here  Thank you for the comments so far, I hope the question is clearer now.  Original question: As described in Detection theory: A user's guide page 28, bias indicator c can be normalized into c' by dividing it by d'. In short, d' = z(H)-Z(FA); c = -0.5(z(H)+Z(FA)); c' = c/d'. However, in some of my cases d' is 0 (For instance, H=.72, FA =.72). Is there a standard correction that allows for the calculation of c'? "
2196,How is an action potential conducted across axonal branches in a neuron?,"As the action potential travels in the dendrite towards the cell body, it may encounter axonal branches. What happens at the branch? What makes it go to the cell body instead of other dendrite?    Also, as the action potential travel from the axon to its branches, does it go to only one or all terminals? If it goes to only one terminal, how is it decided which terminal it has to go? "
2197,What causes CSF to flow?,"Since matter at rest tends to stay at rest until acted upon, there must be some mechanism in the brain causing cerebrospinal fluid to move from the choroid plexus to other areas of the central nervous system.  Is there some kind of hydraulic pump that causes it to flow from one area to the next?  Also, the ventricular system seems to be more of a continuous cavity, rather than a unidirectional closed circuit. How does the fluid make it's way into the far corners of the lateral ventricles, and other nooks and crannies of the ventricular system without the risk of fluid in some areas staying stagnant? "
2198,The relationship between creativity and focus,"From what I have read here and there, I've managed to stitch together some superficial understanding of focus and creativity. My understanding is that focus and creativity seem like opposites.  I've seen references (which all seem to originate from a coursera course on learning) to two distinct ""modes of thought"". One called 'Focused' and one called 'Diffuse'. In focused mode, we focus on doing something we already know how to do. In Diffuse mode, we don't focus on a specific task we are instead searching for a way to do something, until we come up with an idea - it is at that point we focus on completing a task.  Whether this view of thought is scientifically grounded or not, there does seem to be some truth to it: the default mode network, whose activity is reduced during certain types of meditation (at least, according to wikipedia), from what i can understand is linked to creativity . The explanation of this default mode seems similar to the ""diffuse"" mode of thought.  It seems (at least, to me), that focus and creativity are opposites - which makes sense in some ways. But is it really so?   Are creativity and focus competitive as far as the brain structures that support these are concerned? That is, if I improve my ability to focus, will it interfere with my ability to be creative? This seems somewhat ridiculous to me, but I suspect it's only because I want to believe it isn't so. For the moment, my understanding is that creativity and focus are separate,  and require ""switching"" between them, which leads to the next question: Are creativity and focus competitive as far as brain activity goes? that is, if I try to focus on something right now, will it interfere with my ability to be creative? If I focus on solving a problem I know how to solve, I probably won't be looking for a creative solution (also, there is the Einstellung effect). But does the same mechanism responsible for maintaining or focus interfere with our ability to be creative at the moment?  "
2199,How does the intravenous administration of cholecystokinin provoke panic attacks?,"Background  I recently read a paper (The James-Lange theory of emotions: a critical examination and an alternative theory), in which the James-Lange Theory was challenged by Walter Bradford Cannon.   Hence it was stated that:     {Emotional responses can be distinguished by on the basis of autonomic activity., emotions were less intense when the brain was disconnected from the viscera} ... Some artificial manipulations of organ activity can induce emotions such as intravenous administration of of cholecystokinin (a gastric peptide) which can provoke panic attacks.   Question  What is the physiological process of intravenously inducing an emotion?  "
2200,What are the techniques to get over the learning plateau?,"I often end up having loads of things which I am learning. One of the pattern which I have observed over time is that I often end up leaving things half way - for months and then, I have to restart doing the basics again. I feel that if only I ended up taking a few steps more, I could have gained much more from my revisions.  I have a couple of questions -    Is this good practice? Is there any cognitive reason behind this? How does one overcome/control this tendency to start off something new before finishing the older ones?  "
2201,Where can I get data on lie detection and brain activity?,"Are there databases or data sets that contain metrics about lie detection?  The data would include variables such as:   Did the subject lie? (0 or 1 variable) Brain activity measures (fMRI, EEG) when subject was given question.    For example, was the hippocampus hyperactive when the subject was probed about a question? (Could be a discrete or continuous variable)   Metrics of the rest of the body   For example: Average heart rate, blood pressure level, level of various hormones, facial expressions, body posture, etc.   Any other metrics to describe people (remains to be seen if some of these variables would be useful): socio-economic status, age, race, gender, political affiliation, relgious affiliation, etc.   Does data involving, at least, points 1, 2, 3, exist? Point 4 would be a luxury, I suppose. "
2202,How to convince subjects that the computer is playing fairly,"We are planning an experiment using the odds-and-evens game. The rules of the game are simple: player A selects either ""1"" or ""2""; player B selects simultaneously either ""1"" or ""2""; if both select the same number, player A wins \[tex]1 and A wins nothing.  In our experiment, player A is a human subject and player B is a computer program (the computer is programmed to play randomly - select ""1"" or ""2"" with equal probability each time). Our concern is: how to convince the human that this is really what's going on? The problem is that, the human reveals his choice by clicking a button, before the computer reveals its choice. So in theory, we could have programmed the computer to always choose a number different than the choice of the human. Indeed, we have an incentive to do so because it will reduce the amount of money that we will have to pay to the subjects!  How can we convince the human subjects that the computer makes its choice simultaneously and does not ""cheat""?  As computer scientists, the first option that came to our mind is to use a cryptographic commitment scheme. But, this might be too complicated for the subjects to understand. Are there simpler solutions? "
2203,Why so few subjects in psychophysics?,"Why is it that most psychophysics experiments only use a handful of subjects (typically around five, but sometimes even four, three or two), whereas the ""norm"" for experimental psychology (assuming a medium effect size) is around N=25? Is the motivation to reduce sampling error and increase external validity not the same for psychophysics as it is for e.g. decision-making experiments? Or is it the case that individual differences are smaller in perception than they are in cognition? "
2204,How do you form a rationale to justify choice of time windows in ERP analysis?,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) can reflect the electrophysiological phenomena behind perception &amp; attention. Often, certain time windows are applied for the analysis of ERP peaks (components). I cannot find any explicit justification in the literature why or how those time windows are chosen? E.g., P1 being the largest amplitude between 90 - 120ms. What factors should one consider when choosing time windows, and how ought this to be reported? "
2205,"What do chimpanzees do with fire in the wild, and can they be trained to manipulate burning objects?","It seems that most animals run away or avoid fire at all costs. This is especially apparent during wild fires. Humans, obviously, have figured out how to use fire as a tool.   Are we the only known species that is capable of manipulating fire? Do chimpanzees, or other primates, learn to approach fire? Are there any known examples of successfully training primates to use fire as a tool? "
2206,Is there any evidence that better sleep reduces the symptoms of chronic severe Fibromyalgia?,"Is there any evidence that better sleep reduces the symptoms of chronic severe Fibromyalgia?  Severe fibromyalgia has been linked to the possible depletion of serotonin through prolonged and persistent sleep deprivation. Is this clinically proven and is there evidence that serotonin will intermediate to reduce the cycle of sleep loss, low serotonin production, chronic muscular pain, back to sleep loss?  "
2207,Are we trying to motivate ourselves by combinating safe stressful situations with pleasure regards?,"When there's a stressful situation with no real danger like we need a hug  or we stress-eat. Are we trying to develop in our brain networks a fear of actually dangerous situations instead of fear of situation when we're safe and have what we need?  Or what is the reason behind the evolution of this phenomenon?  Some more examples of the followed phenomenon:   Antidepressants are part of the official treatment plan of depression or PTSD. When we cause ourselves an injury, we pat our wounds. People crave sweets after exercise (might seem like an escape from a predator to our body) Stress-eating   Could those be examples of it? "
2208,Do children inherit intelligence from their mothers and not their fathers?,"This article, [website]Since often journalists can misinterpret scientific studies, I am interested, if there are researchers in this field on this site, who can say to what extent is the statement in this article:  ""Children inherit intelligence only from their mothers and not their fathers"" -  true? "
2209,What are the differences between Orch OR and Hartley's vibratiuncles?,"Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff have a theory called Orgastrated Objective Reduction or Orch OR, and they claim this has been confirmed. The article says:     ""The origin of consciousness reflects our place in the universe, the nature of our existence. Did consciousness evolve from complex computations among brain neurons, as most scientists assert? Or has consciousness, in some sense, been here all along, as spiritual approaches maintain?' ask Hameroff and Penrose in the current review. 'This opens a potential Pandora's Box, but our theory accommodates both these views, suggesting consciousness derives from quantum vibrations in microtubules, protein polymers inside brain neurons, which both govern neuronal and synaptic function, and connect brain processes to self-organizing processes in the fine scale, 'proto-conscious' quantum structure of reality.""   In the 18th century, David Hartley proposed in his book Observations of Man that counciousness arises when particles of matter vibrate in our brain. Wikipedia says:     Hartley's physical theory gave birth to the modern study of the intimate connection of physiological and psychical facts. He believed that sensation is the result of a vibration of the minute particles of the medullary substance of the nerves, to account for which he postulated, with Newton, a subtle elastic ether, rare in the interstices of solid bodies and in their close neighbourhood, and denser as it recedes from them. Pleasure is the result of moderate vibrations, pain of vibrations so violent as to break the continuity of the nerves. These vibrations leave behind them in the brain a tendency to fainter vibrations or ""vibratiuncles"" of a similar kind, which correspond to ""ideas of sensation."" This accounts for memory.   Joseph Priestley expanded on this idea in his essay Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit. Priestley believed that all matter had the power of attraction and repulsion  (fundamental interactions?) and that perception and thought arises from this phenomena in our brain through association. Priestley says:     Nothing but a precise and definite knowledge of the nature of perception and thought can authorize any person to affirm, whether they may not belong to an extended substance, which has also the properties of attraction and repulsion. Seeing, therefore, no sort of reason to imagine that these different properties are really inconsistent any more than the different properties of resistance and extension, I am, of course, under the necessity of being guided by the phenomena in my conclusions concerning the proper feat of the powers of perception and thought.   Giving Hartley and Priestley a little latitude because they lived 300 years ago, is Orch OR basically a reworking of their theories? "
2210,What stands behind the desire to want things now?,"We've all heard the sayings that we would rather have half of a chocolate right now, than a whole chocolate in a month, because we, as wild animals, are constantly seeking for sources. But what's really the evolutionary principle behind this? Is it just that we are better at imagining a near pleasure? "
2211,Neural field application question,"I am following a class where we have just learned about so-called neural fields (the prof called them recurrent neural networks and said they are used to model large populations of real neurons). Now we received homework to get to know the method using a simulation, but we got stuck at the last question, about the usefulness of a certain behaviour.  These are our guidelines:  Reset the field; make sure it can memorise one bump.  Give two equal inputs &lt; 15 degrees apart. Reduce until the activity level forms one concave signal (so not like in the picture below).   This all works. As soon as the difference goes below 10, the bump changes from the signal below to a concave one, just as the input signal does. However, then we get the question:  In what situation would such behaviour be useful?     And we're sort of stuck there. Is there someone who could point us into the right direction?   .  Picture of neural field. The green line is the input signal, the red line is the output, the blue line is the neural field activity. The x-axis is the position in degrees.   "
2212,Why is Biological plausibility in Machine Learning important?,"I have found that many authors of machine learning papers, that employ the Hebbian learning rule, refer to the biological plausibility of it, as one of the arguments to use it instead of the well known back-propagation algorithm (Whittington &amp; Bogacz, 2017; Pugh, Soltoggio, &amp; Stanley, 2014; Burms, Caluwaerts, &amp; Dambre, 2015) (I imagine the same argument is used for other biologically plausible algorithms).  But why, in actual fact, is biological plausibility important in the first place? Why do so many sources qoute such argument, and what are the advantages of biological plausibility, when related to machine learning applications?  I have searched a lot, but haven't really seen anyone answer this specifically. "
2213,What is the frequency range of electrotactile stimulation?,"I have been trying to find out what the (human) electrotactile frequency range is. Since this is a much more experimental method (and more unpleasant) than the traditional vibrotactile method, the research is more limited.   E.g., for vibrotatctile I could find in Sonar and Paik (2016)     The mechanoreceptors responsible for vibrotactile sensation are the rapidly adapting (RA) and Pacinian corpuscle (PC) receptors with perceptible frequencies ranging from 3 to 100 and 100 to 400 Hz, respectively (Choi and Kuchenbecker, 2013).   Actually that seems to contain a typo or misquote of the paper they cite, which puts the PC at 10-500 Hz:    Anyhow, for electrotactile I could only find what some researchers have used in some of their devices, e.g. Okpara et al., 2007:      Based on our prior unpublished work, the four levels of frequency were set at 100, 35, 15 and 10 Hz.   That suggests a lower range perhaps of only 10-100 Hz. But is that the full range range that can be felt using electrotactile stimulation?  It's been suggested to me that it may be exactly the same as for vibrotactile, but a set of slides comparing various methods says about electrotactile:     Stimulate receptors and nerve endings with electric charge passing through the skin   Since there's some suggestion it may bypass receptor (in part), perhaps the results can be different.  What is the frequency range of electrotactile stimulation? "
2214,"What does ""unconscious memory"" mean?","Is there a single notion in the cognitive sciences for ""unconscious memory""? For example a in a 2015 Northwestern University press release, we find that         Scientists retrieve unconscious memories   Could lead to new treatment for patients with repressed traumatic memories       So this is basically talking about repressed memories (in humans, as the motivation) and also state-dependent memory, as what they actually studied in mice.  On the other hand, in a different area of research we hear that     The brain’s unconscious memories of patterns are likely to be partly responsible for some children struggling to learn to talk.    Is this the same notion as any of the previous two? Looking briefly at the paper it seems like it's talking about procedural memory instead (correct me if I'm wrong).  So how many (sufficiently) different notions of ""unconscious memory"" are there in the (contemporary) science literature?  "
2215,Why are empty spaces around hippocampus and striatum not filled with astrocytes?,"I understand that, generally, when a neuron dies, the vacated, empty space will form a scar in the form of an astrocyte. Basically, the astrocyte thus replaces that neuron.  Why then are there empty spaces around the hippocampus and striatum that aren't filled with astrocytes? I am talking about the same spaces where adult neurogenesis might occur.  Why are these spaces left empty? Are they ""waiting"" for possible adult neurogenesis and therefore don't get filled in with astrocytes?  A better question might be ""How does the CNS distinguish between types of empty spaces inside it?"" "
2216,What type of imagination is responsible for hallucinations?,What about the type of imagination which medicine calls hallucinations? Is it a great gift or a curse for those who sense extremely? Is imagination a mild form of hallucinating?  
2217,How is hypnosis not mind control?,"OK, you might have to bare with me on this one.  The concept that someone might influence another, even through suggestions, has never once sat comfortably with me.  Across the internet people seem to be in two camps about hypnosis – those who have no idea what hypnosis is and portray it as blatant mind control, and those that reckon they understand what it is, saying that people under hypnosis have complete control and can reject suggestions if they do not agree with them – if this were entirely true, you wouldn’t be able to induce hypnosis on unsuspecting victims in the first place.  However, I feel that the truth lies somewhere in between.  While it is true that people can reject suggestions in hypnosis, it appears to me that this can be simply bypassed through a correct strategy of wording suggestions.  By wording suggestions that avoid evoking conflict with the subject’s belief system, a hypnotist can make the subject feel like the hypnotist’s interests are enjoyable and relaxing, even if the subject wouldn’t ordinarily consent.  For example, the suggestion “The deeper you go, the better you feel, the better you feel, the deeper you go” followed by “every step deeper you go, you feel 10x more comfortable with the words I say” - helps the subject to believe that following the hypnotist’s instructions is the right thing to do, even if it doesn’t follow their moral code (and why should they care, they feel really really good because they are following the instructions). The first suggestion focuses on going deeper, and the second uses that deepening loop as a lever to strengthen the suggestibility of the subject. After extended suggestion and deepening, does this not allow for more ‘edgy’ suggestions because the subject is more comfortable with the words that the hypnotist says?  It’s often commented by hypnotists that a patient can wake up at any point if they do not feel comfortable with the suggestions, but the whole key to hypnosis is creating comfort and using that comfort to embed suggestions. Most people are looking to relax and enjoy themselves. If a hypnotist associates doing something illicit with relaxation and joy, I foresee the patient being easily manipulated, which in laymen terms, is brainwashing.  This was demonstrated by Derren brown, whereby he uses hypnosis to compel a man to shoot a target on command ([website]Furthermore, cases such as ([website]Even if hypnosis is not as simple as: “you are now hypnotised, now kill this person/have sex with me”, is this principle not still the same through carefully worded suggestions, manipulation and making the person believe what they are doing is desirable? (as Darren Brown proves can be done)  If such manipulation is possible, then HOW is this not discussed with more criticism? And, probably more importantly, HOW can anyone trust a hypnotherapist if they have the ability to slowly word their way around your belief system one suggestion at a time?  After-all, what are we but animals without a personalised belief system?  Given the above, how close is hypnosis truly to the infamous 'mind control' that it is depicted as in pop culture? And why is this always overlooked by hypnotherapists when discussing hypnosis? Have I missed something? Is Derren Brown, the world famous hypnotist a fraud? "
2218,Is hypnosis-enhanced therapy more efficacious than its non-hypnotic counterpart?,"There is a farily upvoted question hene (and so are answers to it) on whether ""Does hypnotherapy/hypnosis, in any form, for any type of disorder, work?"". To me, that's a pretty weak and confusing question to ask. You can interpret it as ""is hypnotherapy better than no therapy"", which is quite a different question than ""does hypnosis enhance (or not) another therapy, i.e. is hypnotherapy better than (a similar enough) non-hypnotic therapy"". The latter question is in some sense superior because it tries to isolate whether hypnosis is worth the hassle when you can also do without.   And the studies I could find on this latter contrast are not as clear-cut as one would like. An 1995 meta-analysis on various conditions reported that hypnosis significantly improved outcomes, but a re-analysis a year later of just the obesity subset showed that the initially reported meta-analytical conclusion critically hinged on one study that was an outlier in terms of the effect size it reported; upon exclusion of that study the overall result lost statistical significance. Furthermore this re-analysis found numerical errors in the original one. From this, it's unclear to me whether the conclusion of the 1995 meta-analysis is tenable for any illnesses.  Likewise a 2012 review of CBT vs CBH for anxiety disorders could not really come to a conclusion and called for more research.  So--my question is--is there an illness for which hypnosis unequivocally enhances treatment outcomes compared to a similar enough non-hypnotic therapy? By unequivocally here I mean at least a review based on several studies deemed of reasonable quality. "
2219,"Do men, on average, have a higher general intelligence score?","I'm aware of this study that was linked during an argument: ""Sex differences in brain size and general intelligence (g)"" and this question Gender differences in IQ among undergraduate psychology students.  So, do men, on average, have a higher general intelligence score? And if yes, why? "
2220,Memorization of incorrect math facts,"Today I had a talk with a friend who told me that according to him, it is possible to ""destroy"" someone's ability to do math for his entire life by taking the person at age 5, telling him something totally wrong (for instance that the digits used in the decimal enumeration system are in order something like 8, 5, 4, 9, 2, 3, 0, 6, 1, 7 and calling them respectively ""three"", ""seven"", ""one"", ""six"" and so on) so that once the wrong information has been assimilated in the long-term memory it would be impossible for the person to correct and ""overwrite"" something that has been learned by heart.  Of course this example is an exaggeration, but I was wondering whether this would explain some difficulties people have who write hundreds of times the same mathematical errors like (a+b)2=a2+b2, and other stuff like this, even after many mathematical teachers explain to them that they are wrong. My assumption here is that the ""correct"" way had not yet reached the long term memory, so it would have done less harm than in the first situation.  Do you agree with this idea or has it been challenged by cognitive studies?  Is there something specific to mathematics here? I'd be very happy with more readings.  "
2221,Mental rotation test in a virtual environment,"Parsons et al. (2004) found that the widely reported sex difference in performance in the pen-and-paper mental rotation test could not be reproduced in a virtual environment:     The visuospatial ability referred to as mental rotation has been shown to produce one of the largest and most consistent sex differences,   in favor of males, in the cognitive literature. The current study utilizes both a paper-and-pencil version of the mental rotations test (MRT)   and a virtual environment for investigating rotational ability among 44 adult subjects. Results replicate sex differences traditionally seen   on paper-and-pencil measures, while no sex effects were observed in the virtual environment. These findings are discussed in terms of task   demands and motor involvement. Sex differences were also seen in the patterns of correlations between rotation tasks and other neuropsychological   measures. Current results suggest men may rely more on left hemisphere processing than women when engaged in rotational tasks.   Since VR is much more prevalent now has this result been replicated? And/or is there more insight (say from neuroimaging) on the difference between pen-and-paper and the VR version? "
2222,How to counteract the deterioration of speech in stutterers by targeting sympathetic arousal?,"I am quoting a good overview from a Quora member about the reasons why people stutter when exposed to stress:     ...The underlying physiological basis of why stress provokes stuttering   has been addressed by Weber &amp; Smith, (1990). It shows that speaking   increases autonomic activity (elevated blood flow, increased heart   rate, sweating) and that this sympathetic arousal was correlated with   increased stuttering behaviors in stutterers. Interestingly, the   sympathetic arousal of stutterers was found not to be outside the   range of controls. The authors bring up several hypotheses as to why   sympathetic activity may deteriorate speech fluency in stutterers:      Increased autonomic activity has been associated with irregular   breathing, which may affect speaking;       Release of the stress hormone adrenalin may induce muscle tremor and spasms that can affect speech production;       Sympathetic regulation of afferent control of the   sensitivity of sensory receptors (muscle spindles and   mechanoreceptors) in the oralmotor, laryngeal and respiratory system   may affect speech motor processes;       The gain of reflex arches   (feedback) involved in the musculature engaged in speech may be   modulated such that speech fluency is negatively impacted.   Unfortunately, clinical research in this field is not that advanced and good evidence on human studies is yet to be seen.  My question is whether we already know compounds whose mechanisms can in theory help to deal or ameliorate these pathological process in stutterers?  "
2223,How long should I work before taking a break?,"I'd like to work as effectively as possible for 8-9 hours a day, whether at work or studying.  At some point in completing my major in psych I remember hearing about the importance of taking breaks while doing work (e.g., Trougakos and Hideg, 2009 on momentary work recovery). Gopher et al (1995) discuss  ultradian rhythms and working for 90 minutes for every 15 minutes of break. Some methods like the pomodoro technique suggest 25 minutes of work for every 5 minutes of break, with a 15 minute break every 4 cycles.   Is there recent, widely-accepted research on what work-break rhythms work best? (Even if the research was done for specific tasks or for specific populations.) How does the optimal work-break rhythm vary by task, context, or other moderating factors?   References   Gopher, D., Lavie, P., &amp; Zomer, J. (1995).

2224,Self-fulfilling stereotypes: Have researchers tried inventing new group stereotypes?,"Studies on the stereotype threat have typically used stereotypes that that are common in contemporary culture, i.e. the canonical example being the study that showed African American SAT scores lowered when faced with the stereotype that African Americans are less intelligent than other groups.  Have there been any studies where researchers invented a stereotype (i.e. something random, like ""Hispanics perform more poorly at jump rope than other groups"") and tested to see if it had any effect on well controlled test subjects?  Have there been any social studies where scientists have tried inventing a new stereotype and implanting it into the mainstream population?  (I doubt this because of ethics issues, but it would certainly be interesting!) "
2225,How to conduct surveys using facebook?,"More and more often I read in papers, that an online survey has been conducted through Facebook. What I have yet to understand is how this can best be done. I understand that Facebook allows the creation of a survey app that allows surveys to be embedded in fan pages or timelines. Thus, I have many little questions:   How and where do the existing Facebook survey apps (like [website]Which apps are best, and why? I would like to run the actual survey on my own website. Is it possible to embed an external website in a Facebook app? How can I implement a survey that does not need the test subject to allow the app access to profile data? Since there is no way to advertise a survey on Facebook, except by having someone use it and let his friends know that he uses it, how do you, who have conducted surveys through Facebook, find a large enough and random enough sample? Or: How do you advertise your survey?   My overall question is  Regardless of the little questions above, I'm interested in:   What is an effective way to conduct surveys using Facebook? Are there any existing tutorials that describe best practice?  "
2226,How is intelligence correlated to beauty?,"Recently, I read several interesting questions on the web about the relationship between IQ and general intelligence and physiological symmetry. But more importantly, what explains the correlation? Or is it even true? Because many of the world's foremost thinkers, such as Plato, and Sartre, were ugly.   Is there really a relationship between beauty (physiological symmetry) and intelligence? And if so, does physiological symmetry cause high intelligence?  "
2227,Aesthetic preference for even or odd numbers,In my experience most people prefer the appearance of even numbers or numbers divisible by 5.    Is there any research which proves or disproves my theory? Is it all about symmetry?   I expect that people prefer the number 5 because it is half of 10 and we live in a world that primarily uses a base-10 system. e.g. I like my gamerscore on xbox-live or reputation here to be even or divisible by 5. 
2228,When can anchoring backfire?,"Anchoring is a well-known phenomenon [1]. However, I just ran an experiment where the effect seemingly backfired. Basically, I asked people to estimate the number of jelly beans in a jar. In my anchor condition, people were given an estimate produce by the Jelly Bean Counter 5000 computer system which was purported to be highly accurate, then they were allowed to see the jar. They were then asked to estimate the number of jelly beans.  People who were not anchored were allowed to see the jar of jelly beans first, then estimate the count. Then, they were showed Jelly Bean Counter 5000's estimate. They were then allowed to re-estimate the number of jelly beans in the jar.  In all cases, Jelly Bean Counter 5000 provided the exact number of jelly beans in the jar.  The results are shown in the figure below. Basically, people who were anchored with the Jelly Bean Counter 5000 number were about 62% accurate. People who made their own estimate first (self-anchoring) were initially about 46% accurate, but after seeing Jelly Bean Counter 5000's estimate, they increased to about 72% accurate.  I'm at a loss to explain why people exposed to an accurate estimate (Jelly Bean Counter 5000) ended up being less accurate than people who formed their own inaccurate opinion first. Can anybody provide any alternative explanations? Are there any theories that might be applicable?    [1] Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. (1974). Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.

2230,How do I change my tiredness patterns?,"All of you probably know what the human 'circadian cycle' is, and depending on your personality, you would either be a night-owl or a morning-lark.  I am interested in understanding the patterns of alertness and tiredness throughout the entire day, between waking up and sleeping.  Personally, my alertness gears up in the morning until 12.30 pm, after which I will, consciously or not, begin to feel very very drowsy. This happens even in the absence of lunch (lunch makes people feel tired because the body works to break down the carbohydrates). I will continue feeling tired and exhausted throughout the entire afternoon before I become alert again from 5 pm onwards. And then of course, in the night I am quite alert.  Here are my questions:   Has research been conducted on this? Are there strategies to alter the patterns? Does the tiredness have to do with eating patterns? What are the relationships between tiredness and our circadian cycles?  "

2235,What causes gender differences in responses to farting?,"Background: By casual observation, I have noticed that males tend to react differently to the sound of a fart. It seems that men are more likely to laugh whereas women are more likely to show signs of disgust. I thought that perhaps there might be some evolutionary basis for this.  Questions   Is there any serious psychological research on the causes of our responses to farting? Are there any systematic gender differences? What are the posited causes of such gender differences?  "
2236,Does cognitive training enhance dopamine release?,"Joe Hardy reports on a study by Backman et al (2011) in Science, where from the authors report:     Updating of working memory has been associated with striato-frontal   brain regions and phasic dopaminergic neurotransmission. We assessed   raclopride binding to striatal dopamine (DA) D2 receptors during a   letter-updating task and a control condition before and after 5 weeks   of updating training. Results showed that updating affected DA   activity before training and that training further increased striatal   DA release during updating. These findings highlight the pivotal role   of transient neural processes associated with D2 receptor activity in   working memory.   Joe Hardy goes on to claim:     This result shows that cognitive training with exercises similar to   those on Lumosity can change the way the brain works at a fundamental   chemical level. Indeed, we’ve known for several years that the right   kind of cognitive training can enhance brain functions like working   memory.   Question   Is it true that cognitive training enhances dopamine release ? Are there any studies that disprove this ?

2237,Can the Go/No-Go Association Task be faked?,"Go/No-Go Association task:     The GNAT (pronounced like the bug) is a flexible technique designed to   measure implicit social cognition.  Conceptually similar to other   implicit measures like the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald,   McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, JPSP, 1998), the GNAT assesses automatic   associations between concept (e.g., gender) and attribute (e.g.,   evaluation) categories.  The GNAT has two features that distinguish it   from other measures of implicit social cognition.  First, the GNAT is   designed to be use signal detection statistics in its calculation of   automatic associations (d-prime), but can also be adapted to utilize   response latency as its operational dependent variable.  Second, the   GNAT is flexible in the establishing of contextual characteristics for   the evaluative situation.  For example, the IAT requires an attitude   toward one category (insects) be assessed relative to a second   category (flowers). With the GNAT, experimenters can vary whether   insects are evaluated in the context of a single category (flowers), a   superordinate category (animals), a generic category (objects), or   with no context at all.   The GNAT is often used with the intention of obtaining an implicit measure of self-esteem, sexism, racism, aggression, and so on. In some cases, test takers may be motivated to score in a particular way on the GNAT (e.g., not implicitly sexist or racist).   Question   To what extent can the GNAT be faked? If an individual does fake the GNAT, can the faking be detected?  "
2238,"What is a reliable physiological measure  (e.g., serotonin levels)  of positive affect? "," Is there a reliable physiological measure or correlate to positive affect? What does research say on this?   I thought that serotonin levels are correlated with self-reported happiness levels, but, after a google scholar search I am not so sure. I tried google scholar and couldn't find any papers reviewing/summarizing multiple experiments. I only found a whole lot of papers with vague sounding titles than what i am looking for.   EDIT 1: Replaced happiness by positive affect. As Geek on Acid pointed out happiness is too general. "
2239,How to efficiently get a sense of the meaning of a score on a non-aptitude test that you encounter in a journal article?,"Context: When reading research articles in psychology, you often encounter new non-aptitude self-report psychological tests (e.g., measures of personality, well-being, psychopathology, learning style, stress, goal orientation, etc.). Most of these tests involve obtaining the sum or the mean of a set of items for one or more scales or subscales. Each item typically involves item text and a consistent set of response options (e.g., Likert-type response scales, yes-no response scales, etc.). There are thousands of such scales, some which are frequently used; others are used only once.  A lot has been written about how to assess test validity. However, here I wanted to focus particularly on how to assess what a particular individual or group score means. Specifically, I'm thinking of the situation where you are reading a journal article and you encounter a scale that you have not seen before, such as:   A 10-item measure of self-esteem on 1 to 5 scale; group mean is 3.2. Is the sample generally high, low, or moderate in self-esteem? A 30-item check-list of good eating habits with a mean of 20.7. Does the sample have good eating habits?    For well developed tests, there is a test manual. Other times there is a website or key journal article with information. Finally, in some cases, very little information is readily available. In some cases useful information is given in the methods section, but typically, on its own, this is inadequate.  Thus, the process of trying to locate information such as item content and normative comparisons begin.    A lot has been said about normative and criterion referenced test interpretation.  If you are using a test in clinical practice or you are using a test in your own research, you should invest time in understanding what different scores on the test actually mean.   However, when casually reading a journal article you can encounter many tests.  In such cases, the article is one of many, and you might just want to get a quick sense of what a given score means.  Question   What is a good way to get both a normative and absolute understanding of the meaning of a group or individual non-aptitude test score? What is an efficient way of obtaining the information required  to make such a judgement?   Note the use of the term ""non-aptitude"". I'd like to exclude discussion of intelligence testing, ability testing, and knowledge testing, and so on.  Update: To clarify, I didn't mean to imply in the question that item information was not available anywhere. I guess the question is referring to the general situation where there probably are previous uses of the measure in the literature, and there might be a key article that describes the measure somewhere. I guess I'm thinking of a good general strategy for securing relevant information and then using it to form an understanding of the scale properties. "
2240,Is the Myer Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) a reasonable scientific theory?,"Background: MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. It's a theory that suggests that people can be divided into 16 types, based on the way they percieve and analyse information (whether they make decisions based on logic or their feel, rely more on intuition or direct sensoric perception, and whether they are more on judging or percieving approach to things happen).  All of these ""preferences"" are fit into the ""consciousness model"" in the way, in which you can understand the appearance or behavior of a certain ""type"" by looking what are the dominating preferences (feeling against thinking, sensoric perception against intuition, judging vs percieving).  For a comprehensive overview, see the wikipedia article on the MBTI. Go here for another discussion of the MBTI.  Questions   Does the MBTI have a fundamental background?  Were there any scientific experiments conducted? Are there any ""type"" theories that are based on actual brain research?  "
2241,Problems with using personal feedback to motivate participation in an online psychological experiment?,"I am planning on running an online psychological experiment where participants must learn about various simulated environments and then make inferences about them. Because completing the experiment would require a nontrivial amount of attention and time, I have been toying with the idea of giving personal feedback at the end of the experiment (i.e., using gamification).   I am considering giving participants feedback regarding how their responses compare to our computational model's predictions and/or to the average. The hope is that receiving a ""score"", even when it's made clear that such a score is not evaluative or absolute, will get people to pay more attention and will make them more likely to complete the task. The feedback would only be offered following the experiment itself, and its precise nature would not be revealed until that time. Moreover, I wouldn't specify how our predicted scores are derived. Calculating the exact values by hand would be extremely time consuming, so even if the derivation is explained I don't see how anyone could realistically bias their responses with that knowledge.  Questions   Does giving personal feedback raise any ethical problems?  How might it affect response patterns? Will giving personal feedback elicit higher completion rates and more attentive responding, without any significant complications?  "
2242,To what degree do fetishes differ from conventional sexual orientation?,"If a person can develop - through some function of psychology/imprinting - an explicit attraction to some object (objectophilia - and in some cases, such individuals go so far as to have fully expressed relationships with such objects), then is it possible for a homosexual to develop a 'fetish' towards members of the opposite sex, or similarly a heterosexual towards members of the same sex?  Furthermore, how would such an attraction differ (if at all) compared to 'non-fetish' based sexual orientations such as individuals that identify as bisexual? Or would they appear, at least superficially, indistinguishable?  [website]EDIT:  I was reading different studies on the whole, ""nature vs nurture"" debate regarding homosexuality - controversy aside, it sparked the idea that perhaps, like paedophiles who become infatuated with children etc, whether its possible for a person to become (through some exceptional circumstances) infatuated with members of the opposite/same gender, even if they would not otherwise be considered as bisexual.   My point being, if someone is able to become attracted to cars in early childhood, that we can easily label as a fetish because of its context: is it therefore possible for a naturally gay person (or otherwise) to become infatuated with the gender which they would not otherwise be attracted to, because of the similar circumstances that, in my described example, would drive a man to fall in love with his car – and would we be able to identify this as such. (In short becoming 'bisexual', but perhaps superficially)  (Ps - for the people arguing over my use of the term ""fetish"", I do not presume to be an expert on the subject, and frankly wouldn't want to :), but seeing as people can be attracted to objects: objectophilia, animals: zoophilia, children: paedophilia, etc, it seems to me that just because the opposite gender doesn't fit into an accepted category as a ""non-genital body part"", it couldn't occur under the guise of bisexuality. And, as one comment so enthusiastically assented, ""Anyone who has an attraction to both sexes is bisexual,"" which is what we all assume, and yet, should my proposed hypothesis be true, this might not be as straight forward as it is intuitively understood.)

2243,"What is the term for the rhetorical, ""How hard could it be?""","I looked through the wikipedia page listing cognitive biases looking for a bias that describes the tendency to assume a poorly understood problem must be simple. Planning fallacy is kind of in the right ballpark; it gets the underestimation part, but I am associating the behaviour with a snap decision more than a plan. Is there another that fits better?  I really thought it would be easy to find this term on wikipedia. I mean, how many psychological terms could there possibly be? "
2244,At what point does a human become self-aware?,"What are the conditions for being self-aware? If this answer can not be answered by naming specific traits, behavior unique to a self-aware being, complexity of development or other tangible concepts, is there at least a time frame after conception, when we suspect self-awareness arises?  EDIT: As pointed out in one of the comments, my question lacks more information on the research I have done prior to asking it. The background for my question, arises from a discussion of pre- and postnatal development of humans during a seminar held at Department of Psychology at Charles University of Prague. So far, I have come across a lot ""we don't really know"", ""many signs ..of self-awareness"", biased religious theories, or answers more specific, but philosophical. Accurate methods of testing, such as MSR, do not provide a good general answer. So, to rephrase my question a little, is there some kind of general / 'official' concensus on the subject? "
2245,Is there a mindfulness meditation technique that tends to produce gamma rhythms in the brain (and not just the alpha frequencies that are typical)?,"This is a follow up to a paper (^) that was cited in a response to one of my past questions here. It was found that experienced Buddhist monks generate a substantial increase in gamma waves on demand during their meditation, while novices don't.    This website cites a study (*) that found that mindfulness meditation causes an increase in alpha waves in subjects.    I'm therefore wondering if there is something that the Buddhist monks are doing differently. Is there a mindfulness meditation technique that tends to produce gamma rhythms in the brain (and not just the alpha frequencies that are typical during mindfulness practice)?    Perhaps gamma waves (in the orbitofrontal cortex and areas of the prefrontal cortex) are generated from simply a deeper focus. However, if that's the case, it's still not clear to me how one can attain this. What kind of techniques are likely to lead to this phenomenon? Is it more likely that a more open/wide focus (example cue: ""pay attention to all thoughts/feelings/sensations that appear in your mind and, if you get distracted, just come back to the meditation"") or narrow/sharp focus (example cue: ""pretend to receive a huge reward for focusing on your breath with high clarity and minimal distractions"") leads to gamma activity? Are there any other dimensions of mindfulness meditation that are relevant here?

2246,Are we programmed to live together?,"In general, the humane tendency is to couple with only one person and to be faithful to one's only partner. So dating someone else is very poorly looked.  But there are in some parts of Africa, for example, people in whom having relationships with other people is normal, even if you are married. Is it normal for humans to have one partner and to have strong feelings (such as jealousy and anger) when the partner is interested in someone else or when they go elsewhere? or is it society and evolution that taught us to think like that? "
2247,Is decision making inference?,"Inference is the process of generating further premises from information. Sperber et al (2012) write:  'An inference, as the term is used in psychology, is a process that, given some input information reliably yields as output further information that is likely to be true if the input information is. Inference is involved not only in thinking but also in perception and in motor control. When you see a three-dimensional object, a house or a horse, for instance, you have sensory information only about the part of its surface that reflects light to your retina, and perceiving it as a house or as a horse involves inferring from this sensory information about a surface the kind of three-dimensional object it is. When you decide to grasp, say, a mug, you use your perception of the mug and of your own bodily position in space to infer at each moment throughout the movement the best way to carry out you intention. Inferences so understood are performed not only by humans but by all species endowed with cognitive capacities. They are an essential ingredient of any cognitive system.'  Judgement and decision making are different processes.  Judgement, the process of generating factual conclusions from evidence using generalisations is clearly inference. Jolls et al (1998) refer to judgement as '[assessing] the probability of an uncertain event.' Baron (2008) confirms '[T]he term “judgment,” ... refers to the process of inference.'  However, is decision making, the process of choosing a course of action based on a judgement about the state of the world also an inference? If not, what is it?  Decision making is described by Tor (2008) as:  '...how individuals choose among the alternatives available to them...' "
2248,What is the evolutionary advantage of being embarrassed?,"What I am trying to understand is why do I feel embarrassed in certain situation.   E.g. when I'm talking to people, why do I think about being judged or sounding stupid that would result me in embarrassment. I have been considered as ""intelligent"" since I was a kid and may be making or looking stupid goes against my own belief of me being 'intelligent'?  Also, when I'm playing a game or playing music, I think about embarrassing myself, making mistakes and think what may the audience/team mates thinking about me? So I avoid it and when I actually get a chance of play, I make mistake and regret/punish myself mentally for making a mistake or regret quite a bit. So, basically, this results me in being low confident.   I'm thinking about ""impressing people"" and me resulting in an embarrassing situation, acting stupid, sounding stupid would spoil my ""impression"".  However, I want to act stupid or sound stupid sometime and be ok with it.  Somehow my biology/mind prevents me every time and I feel the resistance.   So, in search of understanding the reason, I wanted to ask if this has any evolutionary benefit or is it part of natural selection? E.g. having a better chances of survival, when you express less/ be quiet or shy, so that others are not threatened by you?   Can anybody with more knowledge shed some light or possibly guide me to help my situation?  Thanks for reading a long post! "
2249,Efforts to create metrics of understanding and comprehension of some sentence?,"Let's assume that S is some sentence (e.g. theorem). Are there efforts to quantify how well some agent (pupil, student, machine agent) understands this sentence S (or some sent of sentences)? E.g., if student is capable to derive many other sentences that are conclusions of the S+preexisting_knowlege_base_in_the_head_of_the_student, then, obviously, her understanding of S ir higher. Hence - maybe we can quantify the understanding by the cardinality (volume) of the set of conclusions that can be derived from compounded knowledge base (and use the volume of the initial base as the normalizing factor/divisor).  Am I alone in my efforts to formalize and quantify the understanding and comprehension of statements or are there other efforts? What are those efforts? What ar common terms, name, scientists in this field?  I guess, that such notions can have application in education sciences, e.g. to devise frameworks and tools for boosting the comprehension. "
2250,"Has ordering people along a Ape to Human diagram, as a measure of dehumanization for people in general, been validated in any way?","Has ordering people along a Ape to Human diagram, as a measure of dehumanization for people in general, been validated in any way?  Because it seems, if confronted with such a diagram and asking people where to place a specific person, or group of people...  It seems rife with the possibility of jokey answers, or only those thoroughly convinced in their belief of there being humans of unequal worth, such that it'd be more a test for whether someone is an unashamed racist or anti-vegan or some such, instead of a test about whether there's implicit dehumanization, like there are tests of implicit bias.  Is there any proof that the tests can screen out joke answers and are applicable to people who are not unashamed discriminators?  I don't have any access to journal subscriptions, so I wouldn't know where to go to check if there's been any proof that it successfully tests for deliberately hidden / repressed / implicit dehumanization.    Places where such a test has been described as being used, as reported by Vice.     Researchers have now found an explanation for why many drivers act out toward cyclists: They are actually dehumanizing people who ride bikes, according to an April study by Australian researchers in the journal Transportation Research.      [...]      The researchers asked 442 Australians, including those who identified as cyclists, to rank the average cyclist on a scale from ape to human. This ape-to-human diagram has been used in other studies, like this one from 2015, looking at the dehumanization of marginalized groups, such as Muslims and black people.     The April 2019 article says, in its abstract:     This paper presents a pilot study applying two validated dehumanization measures to a road user group for the first time.  "
2251,"Is there a real benefit to starting grade 1 at a older age? If so, why?","I think that some people think people should start school at the normal age instead of older because they claim they might become too old to learn. I learned from [website]Maybe Mary and Janelle being too old to learn each other's way of thinking actually meant they were very smart. They cannot possibly figure out absolutely everything anyone else can figure out like a God and maybe being too old to learn means they're smart enough to be quite well aware that although there are risks with doing things exactly the way they are used to, there are also risks with trying doing things in a new and different way.  I think that in addition to that, sometimes when somebody learns something while they're so young, they're more likely to misinterpret what they're getting taught. This answer appears to support my claim. According to [website]Is it actually true that students tend to learn better from school when they start grade 1 at an older age? If so, could one reason be because those who start grade 1 at the normal age are more likely to face the problem where they are not yet ready to learn the basics and then they move on from the basics before they were ready to be able to learn them and then struggle to learn the later material because they're missing the basics? Could another possible reason be because they're less likely to be young enough to misinterpret what they're getting taught? "

I wonder if this is a psychological thing in which, because I am male, I am less interested in the particular characteristics of males than females.  It makes me wonder do females think most men look the same? In Western society it is usuall the men who do the chasing so it would make sense for women to at least appear to be distinct?  I suspect men's uniqueness might present itself more in facial hair which because mostly it's socially accceptable to be clean shaven then the uniqueness doesn't come through. "
2254,What is the state of the art on the wiring optimisation problem?,"One of the earliest neuroscientists, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, postulated that brains are arranged to minimise wire length [1]. In [1] Dmitri Chklovskii and Charles Stevens formulate this problem as follows:     Wiring a brain presents formidable problems because of the extremely   large number of connections: a microliter of cortex contains   approximately 105 neurons, 109 synapses, and 4 km ofaxons, with 60% of   the cortical volume being taken up with ""wire"", half of this by axons   and the other half by dendrites. [ 1] Each cortical neighborhood must   have exactly the right balance of components; if too many cell bodies   were present in a particular mm cube, for example, insufficient space   would remain for the axons, dendrites and synapses. Here we ask ""What   fraction of the cortical volume should be wires (axons + dendrites)?""   While the formulation of this problem continues to evolve and its solution is far from settled, I am motivated by its potential impact on different areas of neuroscience. In particular, the areas of developmental neuroscience, network neuroscience and biophysics(i.e. the energetic constraints on information processing in human brains).   Due to its historical importance and potential impact on the field of neuroscience, I'd like to learn more about the state-of-the-art on this problem. From my own literature review and a question I asked on Twitter, I managed to gather the following references listed below.   In this context, are there essential post-2000 publications that aren't in this reference list? One thing I find curious is that although there has been an explosion of neuroscience data since the year 2010 nearly half the papers I have found that directly attempt to answer the question were written before 2010.

2255,What are the ethics (for clinical psychiatrists) of posting videos on Youtube with poorly-worded guidance about disorders?,"I've watched a few Youtube videos about dealing with narcissists and I noticed a few patterns.    Videos.  The videos appear to be genuine attempts to provide some help to people who are dealing with narcissistic abuse.  The people publishing them are either practitioners or coaches.  Usually they post contact information in the video descriptions to promote their practices.  This seems par for the course.  Some videos provide examples of narcissistic behavior by showing recorded episodes of interactions with extreme narcissists.  They claim to have been recorded legally, which is fine.  Comments.  I also noticed that many of the comments to the videos seem to express a great deal of hostility towards current of former narcissists in their lives.  Frankly, I am having trouble telling the difference between the narcissists, as they are described in the videos, and those who claim to be their victims in the comments.    It's not that there is just a rage directed towards those whom they perceive as having taken away their control over their lives.  It's that these supposed narcissists do not acquiesce to the victims' various demands.  Which shows both a feeling of entitlement and a lack of self-awareness.  And it is, in fact, expressed with a great deal of rage.  Contradiction.  I am having a difficult time making sense of it because, on the one hand, the ""victims"" do describe some patterns of behavior which the videos attribute to narcissists.  On the other hand, the ""victims"" themselves seem to exhibit behavior symptomatic of narcissists.  The recorded audios of narcissists abusing their victims demonstrate clearly abusive behavior.  But the definitions of narcissistic abuse, given in the videos, seem to ""cast too wide a net"".  They provide good guidance for what makes a narcissist, but do not provide any real tests to exclude the possibility of someone being a narcissist.   They can probably provide a justification for actual narcissists to justify their abuse of their victims, as they appear to do in the comments.  The fact that all these practitioners can correctly identify narcissists as such, but give poor definitions, as guidance for other on how to identify potential narcissists, makes me think that the practice of making such videos should be unethical.  Question.  Is it unethical though?  Is the idea of avoiding the risks of casting aspersions (through definition which are overly pathologizing of normal behaviors) a part of ethics of clinical psychiatry?   "
2256,Generosity in the World Happiness Score,"One factor in the World Happiness Score is generosity. I had trouble to understand what this actually means and how it enters into the score.   These were my specific questions:   Does ""generosity"" mean that the individuals feel or are generous themselves (which feels good)? Does it mean that the individuals experience generosity by their fellow citizens (which would affect happiness in a different way)? Does it mean that the individuals experience generosity by their government or employer or other superior party? Does it mean all of this together, giving a cumulated number of some kind? Why is generosity preferred to other similar factors like fairness or solidarity?   At Politics (Beta) I got this answer:     According to [website]     Generosity is the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.   But for several reasons, this question - even with regression to GDP per capita - doesn't give a good measure for generosity, I believe:   Many people (in the Western world) donate money mainly around Christmas. The amount of money they donate can hardly be considered really ""generous"". Many people in poorer regions of the world don't have enough money to give some of it away (but possibly other things).   So my questions are:    Why did ""generosity"" enter into the World Happiness Score nevertheless, and in the way it does? And why so prominently, on an equal footing with social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, and - also quite surprisingly - perceptions of corruption? Why is especially ""generosity"" believed to help quantifying ""happiness""?    (Of course it's easy to believe that someone who is generous and experiences generosity is happier than someone who is greedy and experiences greed. But the same holds for fairness, solidarity, etc.) "
2257,Are there scientifically grounded alternatives to analytical psychotherapy?,"I'm a physicist and am interested in exploring taking therapies to help me overcome anxieties and other issues that I have that seem to me to be psychologically founded. Anecdotally, a few people close to me have been in therapy over the years and have strongly advocated its efficacy. However, and equally, someone close to me tried therapy and found it useless. Moreover, as a scientist I am deeply sceptical of psychoanalysis as a theory and therefore quite adverse to contributing to its continuation.   So, are there alternative therapeutic techniques I could consider that have a more objective, scientific grounding? Or, am I simply wrong headed and modern psychoanalysis has evolved to the extent that it can be considered objective and scientific? "

My question, is the act of studying more a defense mechanism? If it is, under which category we can classify it?  I thing closest is displacement, but as I understood if you are angry you redirect your anger with displacement. We can substitute other emotion for anger. If it is frustration, frustration needs to be redirected. But the person pushes herself more here so she is not redirecting her frustration(you can always clarify if I understood a concept wrong or send me a resource to clarify, I study by myself I just like learning).

2259,Information Encapsulation of Geometric Module vs Cortex Remapping,"According to experiments by Gallistel and Spelke, there seems to be a specific geometric module in the brain that doesn't (cannot?) use feature information (eg. color of walls) for reorientation. From the little that I know, it seems that Elizabeth Spelke even goes so far as to say that the whole brain is modular, and language permits breaking of information encapsulation by ""dropping in"" information to other modules.  But cortical remapping seems to indicate the opposite. At least certain areas of cortex seem to be ""general purpose"", in that they can be remapped to other areas (visual for auditory?) and still learn to perform the same function.  What's the most recent information concerning this debate? Is there a good paper/talk summarizing this? "
2260,"Many military leaders died by suicide to avoid punishment, but weren't judged irrational. Does this evidence rational suicide?","Peru's ex-president Garcia's suicide to avoid arrest reminded me of general officers and politicians who, although unethical and wicked, were foxy but rational. They ought've been punished, but they cunningly escaped punishment through suicide. They haven't been labelled of 'mentally ill', as their suicides are disapproved.   I'm assuming that some of the jumpers in the Sep 11 2001 attacks on the WTC weren't judged irrational for dying by suicide.    Doesn't this subjectivity mean that rational suicide is pathologized?  See List of suicides in Nazi Germany, Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany. Generalfeldmarschalls Robert Ritter von Greim and Walter Model. Any similar lists for Japan? I know of this one that refers to a handful of Japanese WW2 top brass.   I can think of only: Field Marshals Hajime Sugiyama,  Hideki Tojo (who missed his heart when he shot himself, but  was executed), General Shizuichi Tanaka,  Admiral Chūichi Nagumo.  "
2261,Optical illusion when looking at parallel static bars,"When looking at this picture for a while, without moving the eyes, my brain starts to hallucinate moving shapes. Why is that? Is there some math to explain this effect?   I'm asking about math because the fine pattern of lines reminds me of Moire patterns.   "
2262,CBT approach and why we generate unrealistic thoughts,"On reading about Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)  I encounter     But, if you feel sad after a friend cancels your lunch plans and you   begin to think there’s obviously something seriously wrong with you   and no one likes you, this is problematic because this thought is   extreme and not based on reality.   This makes sense because concluding that none likes you from canceling lunch is overestimation.  But my question is different: how or why are we generating these unrealistic thoughts in the first place? Especially given that after some challenging these thoughts, we can correct them ourselves. So if we can correct them ourselves after challenging them, why do we generate these unrealistic thoughts in the first place, and not the correct ones? "
2263,How does an animal learn what a predator is?,"A while ago I heard the following anecdote:      ""On some tropical island, explorers infested the island with rats that   wrecked the native ecosystem. To get rid of rats, people introduced   cats that instead of hunting rats killed off the entire island's bird   population"".   The explanation given is that birds could not recognize cats as predators and/or did not have natural predators in the environment. This made me think - is there any part of a bird that on a genetic level knows that some other organism is a predator and is to be avoided?  For animals that live surrounded by predators, for example a house sparrow - how does a bird learn that cats are predators, but squirrels are not?   An example might help illustrate my question: Let's say someone takes house sparrows from America and breeds them for 3 generations on the same tropical island with no predators - would such 3rd generation sparrow still recognize cats as predators? "
2264,"How to explain/name the ""Feeling gigantic"" sensation?","A bit similar to this question, I did experience, twice, something, that I would qualify of, pretty weird.  A feeling of being gigantic, it was very very disconcerting.  Like, you look around you and you feel like everything around is you is way way way large, like if yourself you were being a tiny ant.  Then again, you may experience that your body is a mere gigantic vessel in which you, tiny entity, would be trapped in.  I did also experience fear at that time, of moving, of things. Because they were so gigantic and could ""hurt"" me if they'd fall on me for instance, etc. It also induced me dizziness.  Ultimately it wear off after a while. I do not do drugs, nor consumed anything.  My question is: Does anyone else has experienced similar and what is it called like? (Finally, could someone explain it to me?)  A few searches online yielded poorly results.  I do suspect that fatigue was at play but I can't link both together for sure. "
2265,How is ADHD different to internet/social media/information addiction?,"One of the concerns about ADHD diagnosis is how is it not just inattentiveness due to the modern hazard of instant gratification via social media/the internet.   Here's a post of a wrote on the subject.   I had a quick look at the Wikipedia article on ADHD controversies, but this arguement doesn't actually appear. Instead it's more about methods of diagnosis, and whether ADHD like symptoms are simply personality traits.   Can you answer:   Is the possible issue of inattention due to ADHD and inattention due to social media addiction an issue in pyschiatric/medical circles? How are they distingushed?   "
2266,Mental illness vs mental condition vs mental disorder,"I posted this at English.SE, but I'm wondering if you guys can also shine some light here.  Is there perhaps a distinction between mental conditions that are disruptive and mental conditions that just are (and require managing)?  Eg. Someone might argue 'I have depression and this requires curing' (much like cancer requires curing). Someone else might argue 'I have ADHD, and this is just a part of my personality'.  Can someone help shine some light on the distinction between these terms? "
2267,"Scientific name for the phrase: ""The first image is the image that stays""","I've always heard about an effect that is entitled: The first image is the image that stays. It comes from a translation from a portuguese phrase, I don't know if it's properly translated.   It seems that this is some kind of effect in which the way you present yourself to other person in the first meeting is the one that works as an anchor. It's a very popular saying where I live.   My curiosity is: Does this effect really exists? I mean, has someone studied this effect? "
2268,Word for the opposite of “hypochondriasis”,"This question was posted in English.stackexchange.          Is there a word for the opposite condition of hypochondriasis? For   example, someone who denies being sick when they clearly are? I would   just say that they are ""in denial"". Is there any other adequate   word?   Some answered egosyntonic. Is it correct?  P.S. Credits to Renan "
2269,Are action potentials necessary for experience?,"We know that, for example, during brain surgery, electrical stimulation in certain parts of the cortex is sufficient for experience, and result in reportable experiences in human subjects.  We also know that action potentials are not sufficient to cause experience when they occur in other parts of the body. For example, as far as I know, humans are not aware of action-potential-caused insulin release in the pancreatic cells.  Further we know that mechanical stimulation of the fingers is converted to action potential trains, then relayed via interneurons, and is subsequently reported as touch. The situation is similar with other senses.  But, are there any examples of reportable experience without preceding action potentials? In other words, are there any cases of experience that is not correlated with electrical activity?   I'm interested because my deeper question is ""Does all qualia result from action potentials?"" "
2270,Research on improving long term focus,"I have seen a lot of research on concentration or focus in the short term. But what about concentration and focus in the long term? For example, if I set a goal to write a novel over the course of 4 years, what factors go into predicting my ability, willingness, and interest in finishing that novel?  "
2271,Are the skills trained and learn from world memory championship transferable?,"I recently learn something about world memory championship and I am considering to embark on some training. But I would like to know if the skills trained and learn from world memory championship are transferable? Like improving IQ, improving imagination capability, improving ""innate memory power"" (meaning that your memory improves even when not applying techniques)? "
2272,Is talking to oneself loudly a very common sign of schizophrenia?,"Schizophrenia.com states that      Replaying or rehearsing conversations out loud- i.e. talking to yourself [is a] (very common sign) [of schizophrenia].   Looking at the site it's not clear who edits it (or what their credentials are)... so is this claim supported by research, i.e. is talking to oneself loudly a very common sign of schizophrenia?  And is it so irrespective of the content of the talk? E.g. talking to ""oneself"" as if having a conversation with an imaginary person [different than oneself] seem somewhat different to me (and indicative of hallucinations) in contrast with clearly self-directed self-talk, e.g. as described in the first paragraph of a NYT article of someone wondering out loud in a supermarket. Or is it simply the case that so few people talk to themselves loudly so that the group (of loud self-talkers) is dominated by those who have schizophrenia? (About 75% of people with schizophrenia experience auditory hallucinations.)  I also found that      Self-talk [and by this the article means loud] and behavior rituals were found to be common behavioral features in adults with Down syndrome, and in most instances, were not a sign of a psychiatric disorder.   But then the number of people with Down syndrome is only about 1/12 of those with schizophrenia. "
2273,"What are the differences between Cognitive, Psycho-linguistic, and Behavioral approaches to learning?","I'm having trouble wrapping my head around cognitive, psycholinguistic, and behaviorist learning acquisition methods in the context of second language acquisition. I don't really understand their differences or how to identify which one is being used. From what I understand,   Cognitive: Sequencing grammatical forms in a syllabus for individualized learning. There is some innate learning mechanism that facilitates learning, so it is better for teachers to focus on ""inputs""   (Shoebottom, P. (n.d.). An introduction to the work of Stephen Krashen.

2274,Cognitive control tasks,"What are the tasks that can be employed to measure cognitive control of an individual (proactive and reactive control). I have read about AX-CPT task [1]. In this task, they use letters. But I am looking for a non-linguistic task.   How about the use of:   antisaccade task   double step task   stop-signal task   go/no-go task?     Can we use these tasks to measure proactive and reactive inhibition? If so, how do we do that? I am looking for a task that uses eye-tracking method.   Are there any papers that measure proactive and reactive inhibition and how they are employed using these tasks? Especially, studies comparing monolinguals and bilinguals.  Also, I wanted to know how we can manipulate the antisaccade task to measure both proactive and reactive inhibition.  [1] ""Dual mechanisms of cognitive control in bilinguals and monolinguals"" by Morales et al. "
2275,Are many anticonvulsants just coincidentally also psychoactive?,"Many of the antiseizure I'm aware of are described as having the potential for behavior altering side-effects. I am curious about this.   Is there something about the chemistry of the brain that frequently makes anticonvulsants also psychoactive? Does it have to be this way?   OR   Maybe the anticonvulsant drug profiles are like this because much more money is invested in R&amp;D for psychoactive drugs used in psychology than is invested in R&amp;D for epilepsy drugs. And, during the R&amp;D process the anticonvulsant property of a drug is discovered as being the side effect of the drugs whose main property is psychoactivity. And this might be why the anticonvulsants being sold are psychoactive?   Viagra was discovered during R&amp;D into high blood pressure. Viagra does lower high blood pressure. Viagra also has a side effect. People take Viagra for the side effect.  So, might it be like: During R&amp;D into psychoactive drugs, Zonisamide was discovered to have the side effect of elevativing the seizure threshold. Zonisamide is psychoactive. Zonisamide also elevates the seizure threshold as a side effect. People take Zonisamide for the side effect?  Is it understood why anti-epileptic drugs are always mood altering? Is it chemical? a product of the R&amp;D cycle? a simple correlation that a person with the disease might be more emotional? "
2276,Is there an innate human bias against admitting you are wrong or uncertain?,"During interactions with people, I've noticed that it seems like certain people have a habit of admitting uncertainty and a willingness to admit error. There doesn't appear to be a clear group that I could bucket them into (like scientists, conservatives, etc.), but these people seem to be a minority.  After thinking about why people might bias against admitting they were wrong, I couldn't come up with a good reason. It would almost seem better for an organism to admit a mistake and learn from others, than stick to something that might actually be wrong.  Is there an innate human bias against admitting you are wrong/uncertain? If so, has any research been done on why? "
2277,Is it possible to raise the complexity of what you can mentally process?,"I know that I can solve some simple systems of linear equations in my head by visualizing the terms and moving them. But if I don't concentrate enough, it gets blurry quite fast. In the same way, I can remember some structure of an algorithm, a mathematical proof or a speech, but not with details. In the same way, I tend to forget the first elements if I add new ones.  I feel that, by saying that, I mix at least two things:   what I have heard as a ""mind limit"", around 3 or 4 elements anyone can process at the sale time, or recognize visually without counting them memory, which you can theoretically train to store large amounts of elements   What can be trained, and how, to be able to process more elements at the same time? Even if there's a hard mind limit, is it possible to make playing mentally with N elements much clearer, and how? "
2278,Perception: thinking a minority behavior in a minority group is the majority of said group,"I once heard that we tend to have some perception bias : we tend to think that a behavior by a minority of a minority group is in fact the representation of the majority of this minirity group. Classical example would be that we tend to think that people from another state drive badly. This would come due to the fact that when we see a car driver behaving badly on the road, we will see the license plate from another state and that would ´stick’ better in our memories. And from there, we would generalize that people from that region are bad drivers as we don’t check the license plate of good drivers. Is there such a thing? If so, is there a term/denomination for such perception bias? I hope that I was clear enough as English is not my primary language "
2279,Is it true that old people loose the ability think creatively/ formulate new ideas,My friend said something about that people get older than 50 loose the ability to think creatively and formulate new ideas.  There is also a saying like “stuck in his ways” and people say the “older you get the harder it is to change”   Is this a thing? If it is there a scientific name for it? 
2280,Why are there few studies in the literature regarding human's pheromones?,"Pheromones are thought to be the biological underpinning of the social behaviour. They have been extensively studied in animals. Pheromones are chemical factors that trigger a social response in members of the same species.  Why are there few studies in the human-literature?  Wikipedia pose the problem of ""the need for cleanliness and odorlessness in human participants""  Is this a real experimental problem? Are there further limitations? "
2281,why can't we override memory priority?,"Is it known why certain information cant be retained by some people even  when it's important to do so? I've read that our ability to remember things   is based on every memory accessed before, priority, interest in the subject,   etc. So why doesn't it always work when you need it to? Like the time/date of   meetings, birthdays, names of co-workers, items you know will be on a test  later.   On the flip side, is it known what mechanism it is that gives a person  (like myself) the ability to remember the same things when generally speaking   it's not something they normally can do with any accuracy? Without really  trying I have little trouble remembering appointment dates/times but ask me   what day something happened a couple weeks ago and i've got nothing.    I hope thats not too much at once. thanks very much "
2282,How is the effect of current vote scores on people's votes interpreted in psychology?,"On a site that people can vote on others' posts (like Stack Exchange sites), I believe people tend to be affected by the current vote score (and for Stack Exchange, if the user has enough reputation, the current vote counts as well) before they cast a vote, or even more, before they decide to whether cast a vote. A typical case is illustrated by this Reddit post,     I tend to upvote people who have been downvoted out of sympathy.   The linked Reddit post already contains part of the answer but it's more like a subjective discussion so I am not satisfied with it.  Can somebody elaborate on what effects can take place in this process? What is effect on the final vote count/score if we consider it as a whole? Are there any known terminology or models to describe this behavior?  I am new to psychology so any hint will be helpful.    Related: Why do people make rants on Meta Stack Exchange sites? "
2283,What is an explaination for the light-headed and slow-motion feeling after a long hard mental exam?,"Question  After taking a long final exam, people often report feeling like the world is moving in slow motion. I've heard this exam effect jokingly called ""zombie feeling"" or ""brain-fog"". I describe the effect as strong desire to stare with a blank mind.   Background  Based on answers from this question: [website]Could it be caused by an exhaustion of certain nutrients, like Vitamin B12 or D?  "
2284,Why can't we understand text without subvocalizating it?,"I wonder why can't we understand text the same way we understand pictures?  Everything we see but text we understand without the inner voice, we don't subvocalize/describe a forest, a street or anything. We just understand it.   Why can't reading work the same way? When I look at words I recognize them but they have no meaning until I read them in my mind.  Is there even anyone who got rid of subvocalization completely and can read a 300 page book just in one evening understanding pretty everything?  It even works the same the other way around. If I try to see a textural representation of some thing like let's say a table, I first have to say in my mind. Why is it so? It's really annoying.  text &gt; voice (in my mind) &gt; understanding   why not  text &gt; understanding   I also don't get it why people consider this normal. It slows everything down. Imagine you could read a book in a single eventing if not the subvoc. We must do something terribly wrong when learning to read.  I'm not asking about speed-reading because subvoc is not only an issue there - although it is most noticable when reading - but it also interfers when thinking and forces you to say your thoughts. "
2285,Term for using hyperbole to make a softer argument seem more palatable?,"Say that I wanted to convince a person that oranges tasted nice. One particular method I could use would be to go on an hour long spiel, where I take on two voices - a hyperbolic voice (which says that we should ONLY eat oranges every single day because they are LITERALLY the best tasting thing ever) and a rational voice (which is more subtle, gives reasonable arguments as to why oranges taste nice like 'they have high sugar content', and is generally less explosive)  After hearing the hyperbolic ""WE SHOULD ONLY EAT ORANGES"" message, which the person will probably immediately reject, it seems likely that the person will accept the more rational message that 'oranges taste pretty nice' as a compromise.   This might sound very vague, but I feel like I've read about this theory (in some form) a few years ago, I just can't remember what it's called? Is there a specific term in psychology for this effect, or does this make no sense?  "
2286,What factors determine a healthy individual's required amount of sleep?,"I suppose that it is well-known that different people need different amounts of sleep. I read somewhere that most people need something between 7 and 8 hours each day, though some people need only 6 hours, and (for instance) I have two friends who only need 5 hours.   Q: Besides genetic factors, what determines a healthy individual's required amount of sleep?  For example:    Is there a correlation between an individual's g factor and their required amount of sleep?  Is there a correlation between an individual's weight and their required amount of sleep?   Note: I am not interested in findings related to infants or teenagers.  "
2287,Current estimates of the capacity of hippocampal episodic memory?,"Let me preface this by saying I'm as skeptical as anyone about equating neural structures with traditional computing hardware (e.g. 'how many MBs is long term memory?'), but episodic memories seems like one place where talking about storage capability seems warranted, since episodes are quite discrete.   I've heard discussion about the hippocampus being able to store all of the relevant events for the past 10 years, and that it slowly transfers its knowledge to the cortex, which has a much higher capacity. But how many separately encoded events can it hold? I know it uses a sparse coding scheme to keep related memories separate, so it should be possible to infer capacity from the size of the neural populations involved and the average activity. Has someone looked into this before? "
2288,Is there a fundamental difference in the way we think while writing when compared to speaking?,"I had a discussion with my friend recently about slip-ups in speech - the ones where you intented a gramatically correct sentence but somewhere between the conscious mind and your mouth a (usually small but often times a rather unexpected) mistake occurs.  My question is whether this phenomenon arises in the same way in the brain (what happens?) as a analogous mistake in writing, where one might for example mistype a letter, or put one too many bellies on a 'B' etc. Or in an even broader view, how does this compare to mistakes in a well trained movement, e.g. while playing a guitar a finger escapes its well-intentioned, and many times practised passage to an unexpected fret? "
2289,Why are visualizing mnemonics usually wacky?,"Why are visualizing mnemonicsusually wacky? I've been told to picture images and associated stories (for example, with the Major System) as ridiculous and zany as possible. Is it because our brains are more likely to remember extraordinary things? "
2290,What does the literature say about why women aren't attracted to nice guys?,"Dating coaches make the point that women may ""like,"" or ""appreciate"" a nice man, but they aren't likely to be attracted to, or fall madly in love with such behavior (until fairly late in the relationship, e.g. steady dating or engagement).  One such person, Leil Lowndes in ""Undercover Sex Signals,"" noted, ""A woman subconsciously listens to her genes."" That one quote opened up a whole new way of thinking to me.  For instance, a domineering, hard-as-nails man might not be pleasant to live with, but a woman might be attracted to him because he is signaling that he would be a good (protective and providing) father for her children. Likewise for the ""bad boy,"" who is unconventional, independent, and seemingly courageous, even though he may be ""independent"" to the point of being unfaithful.   Is it true that at some level, women and men who are dating ""rate"" each other based on the other's presumed parenting ability (e.g. that men prefer good looks as a sign of good ""motherhood"")? And that members of the opposite sex that aren't perceived as good parenting material are often ""friend-zoned"" despite their other virtues?  Of course, dating coaches have their points of view, but they are ""street smart."" More to the point, they sometimes cited scientific studies to prove their cases. So what to the ""scientists"" have to say about this matter?  Edit: This question is not about ""externals"" preached by pick-up artists like Pellicer, using such techniques as body language, eye contact, or good conversation skills. This is about the theory of a woman (Lowndes) who hypothesizes that we are only one step (in evolutionary terms) away from ""cavemen,"" and that therefore evidence of good cavemen traits (toughness and self sufficiency for men, physical appeal for women) still makes one attractive (at a visceral level) to members of the opposite sex. Even though other traits such as intelligence, humor, and empathy might be more relevant in the modern world, they might not do as good a job at sparking immediate attraction as the more primitive traits. "
2291,Are hallucinations mostly 'real' fantasies or are they 'real' memories?,When someone has a hallucination of a person or odor does is that a fantasy which one have never seen before (so a kind of construction) or can it be a remembering but then more real as seen in the mind?   Are they considered to be the same or is there made a distinction in therapy (if necassary)? 
2292,What is the difference between apparent motion and apparent movement?,"A definition for apparent movement is:     The perception of movement produced by stimuli that are stationary but are presented first at one position and then, at an appropriate time interval, presented at a different position.    Example:       And apparent motion is defined as:     Motion can be detected even if there is no real motion    Example:   Flip Books     Now to my actual question: I know that those two forms of perception are very close; so what is the actual difference between the two? Is there a pure definition of the difference?  I feel that both apparent movement and apparent motion are according to Gleitman et al. (2010) pretty much the same, and could be applied to both sorts of examples. So if presented with a stimulus/illusion, how would one approach them to discern which is which? "
2293,"Why baby animals seem ""cute"" to us?","I understand why babies seem cute to us from an evolutionary point of view: They need our protection and love to grow, so it's beneficial for them to look good for us, or at least their parents, since that makes them more likely to be taken care of.  But why does this pattern repeat with baby animals? It seems that small puppies or kitten appear cute to a large number of people, so how does that make evolutionary sense? Do they remind us of our babies? Did domestic animals evolve to be ""cute"" in order for us to take care of them? "
2294,Adult talking in the 3rd person when talking about himself,"   The therapist asked John ""Tell me about yourself?""      John  starting talking about himself, his upbringing and his family. However Instead of using the word ""I"" he mostly uses the word ""He"" in all his sentences      When the therapist pointed this out to John he was unaware he was doing this and he didn't believe the therapist. John said he has permanent employment and someone at work would have pointed it out to him if he did this.      What condition could John have? What does it say about John that he doesn't realize he is doing it.   Some answers I can think of   He has an inferiority complex and speaks about himself in the 3rd person in order to distance/disassociate himself from the person who he is. Him not realizing it means he has been doing it for some significant time so that it has become second nature. he could have a fantasy prone personality which results in him losing touch with reality resulting in him seeing himself in the 3rd person like a computer game   What other possible answers could there be or where can I be pointed to do research on this condition?

2295,Manipulating the difficulty of guessing a correlation,"I am trying to generate correlations between random variables (two dimensional) with a defined linear relationship (in the [tex] sense), but with different visual patterns when plotted. I am trying to create a 'guess the correlation' task where I can systematically manipulate the difficulty for an observer to guess the linear relationship.   What I am doing now is given a correlation [tex] I generate the first and second values, [tex] and [tex], with [tex] samples from the standard normal distribution. Then from there I make [tex] a linear combination of the two [tex]  Then:  [tex]  And now [tex] and [tex] have a correlation [tex].  For manipulating the difficulty I've been playing with the parameters of the distribution and [tex], however, I am not satisfied with the results.   Any idea on how to systematically increase the difficulty of the task? (i.e., adding outliers, for instance etc).  Note: Difficulty is a cognitive/psychology question rather than a statistical one. I intend to test the notion of difficulty empirically (i.e., under a specific parameter combinations, people tend to do worse). The idea is to generate plots with varying parameters for a given correlation value (i.e., changing the number of points, the variance, outlier, functional form? etc). What are the parameters and what would be a systematic way to manipulate them. "
2296,Unconscious Racial and Gender Biases: The role of IAT,"Recently the term unconscious bias, referring to race and sex, has increasingly appeared in the media. It appears that the support for these terms come from research conducted using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). However as I understand it the IAT is not a particularly reliable measure. My questions are quiet simple:  Are these findings reliable and valid?  What is driving these effects? In-group/out-group differences, sexism and racism, methodological errors etc.   Can the findings of previous IAT studies be used to extrapolate to unconscious racism and sexism? What are the consequences for the research and media based upon these findings.     RULES  I understand that this is a very emotive subject, but please try to remain rational. Any emotional or subjective answers will be rejected.    Note. I have done a bit of background reading on this while creating the question, but I don't have time to answer this myself at this time.   Here are a few references...   Lebrecht (2009) Perceptual other-race training reduces implicit racial bias.  Kaufman, psychology today article. (2011) Rezaei (2011).

2297,Can information in the media increase fear of something?,"I'm working on an essay trying to link an increased fear of something with information received from the media about it and I'm trying to find out if there are any studies on the matter.  Let me give an example:  An african-american sees news about cops shooting other black men in the US.  Is he now more afraid of running into police?   Another:  A person sees news about a friend being arrested for his political opinions Is she now more afraid of expressing her opinions?   To me it seems that both are true, but I'm looking for studies that could confirm it or deny it. "
2298,"When the DEA says a drug is X times more potent than another, what do they mean?","E.g.     Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80-100 times stronger than morphine.    What does that refer to?  According to [website]  The IUPHAR has stated that 'potency' is ""an imprecise term that should always be further defined"", for instance as EC50, IC50, ED50, LD50 and so on.   I guess effective dose is the relevant notion here, but which version does the DEA use ED50, ED95 (does it matter which)?  Presumably they are not talking about receptor affinity which would be mostly irrelevant from DEA's perspective (although the FDA suggests otherwise). The latter ratio between fentanyl and morphine is only 1.35 to 1.14 on the μ-opioid receptor. Even that is not really a good way to compare, because actual measurements of affinity have a large margin of error:   "
2299,"If self-control is the executive function to resist temptation, how does the brain decide what is and what is not a temptation?","What determines the ""default behaviour"" if no self-control is applied?  Most documents refer to satisfaction of immediate desire, but that does not seem to explain how quite sophisticated behaviors can occur as the result of a failure of self-control. A temptation to eat fast food which involves purchasing it, or to consume internet pornography, can require higher or executive functions to satisfy in terms of computer operation and engagement with a purchasing process. A temptation to take illegal drugs can potentially require delaying gratification for an unknown period of time (to find a supplier).  So is there research on what determines the behavior without self-control, and how it is able to ""hijack"" executive functions that should rightfully be limiting the undesirable behavior? "
2300,What information does the connectome actually contain?,"I am not a brain scientist but the following question seems reasonable to me.   Prof. Sebastian Seung has given a TED talk named ""I Am My Connectome"". If I understand correctly, connectome is basically the graph whose vertices are neurons and whose edges are synapses (strictly speaking, there are many different kinds of neurons so the vertices of the graph should be colored, but let us forget it for now).   The title then appears to be a (probably intentional) oversimplification, since even though we do not understand how exactly memories are stored in the brain (and there are many different kinds of memories), things I will roughy call ""electrical and chemical variables"" play some role in it (so simply remembering whether there is a link or not between two neurons is not going to fly). I understand that studying these ""electrical and chemical variables"" is like over a half of the brain science but the exact definition is not particularly important for this question. If my understanding is correct, then one should not get overly excited about the present achievements of the Brain Preservation Foundation (the most promising one is, I think, preserving the connectome of a mammal for some time after its death using a chemical solution/freezing), since they have not shown that they can preserve any of the ""electrical and chemical variables"".  The question is: what information can you actually extract out of a connectome, assuming you do not know anything else about the brain? Like something about a person's health, personality, anything? The chance of them having schizophrenia? Their most likely age? "
2301,How does a brain without sensory inputs function?,"If for some reasons a brain would be deprived off all inputs, it (he/she) would still have memories to process and all thoughts would be based on past experiences. But in case a person was born without any inputs to hint there is ""anything out there"", would the mind/brain somehow go on? Would it be aware of time (at least biological rhythms, since it would probably still need sleep), of causality, of self? Now I'm not sure if this is a hypothetical question, or if some data on the subject exists from a real-world observation/research or at least a deduction from our knowledge of how the brain works? "

2305,What are effective methods to overcome the initial psychological resistance towards an unpleasant task?,"Background  Some self-help books note the difficulty of starting a boring or cognitively-difficult task (relative to maintaining the 'momentum' once the task has been started). Sometimes they describe an analogy to physical systems whereby a certain amount of 'activation energy' needs to be provided in order for a process to start.    Examples  To generate this initial energy, some self-help authors have described simple techniques:       The moment you feel an instinct or a desire to act on a goal or a   commitment, use the Rule. When you feel yourself hesitate before doing   something that you know you should do, count 5-4-3-2-1-GO and move   towards action.   Robbins, Mel. The 5 Second Rule: Transform Your Life, Work, and Confidence with Everyday Courage. Simon and Schuster, 2017.    See also: Is there any direct or indirect empirical support for the effectiveness of Mel Robbins&#39; five second rule?     Shrink your desired hyperfocus period until you no longer feel   resistance to the ritual. Minimize the amount of time you’ll dedicate   to focusing on one task until you no longer feel mental resistance to   it. Even setting a mental deadline of five minutes will likely be   enough to get you started.     Bailey, Chris. Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. Macmillan, 2018.    One could certainly enumerate an endless amount of techniques beyond these. For example, closing the eyes and visualizing oneself of performing the task, or one could pretend with a high degree of conviction that there is an infinitely large payoff for doing the task and an infinitely large penalty for not doing the task. However, it is not clear whether any of these methods would actually be effective.    Question  However, I have not found a single study that evaluated these, or similar, methods (i.e., interventions that increase the probability of people to initialize a psychologically unpleasant task).   What are effective methods to overcome the initial psychological resistance towards an unpleasant task?     Assumptions and differentiation from related questions  Kelly McGonigal distinguishes between I won't and I will willpower (see The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It (2012, ISBN 978-1583335086)). The former type of willpower (I won't) has been discussed in this Q&amp;A forum previously:    Best meditation techniques to overcome Behavioral Addictions?    Beyond CBT and MBI, what are effective behavioral interventions for modern lifestyle addictions during their engagement?    However, the question here is more in line with the I will willpower type.    "
2306,"why are all human brains so similar in brain structure, specialization of their parts and functioning?","As a result of my growing interest in neuroscience, I have begun to try and understand the functioning of the brain. However, I am always confronted by the  following questions:    The brain is a highly specialized organ with innumerable nuclei and pathways, and yet the brain of one individual is surprisingly similar to that of another. Hence, it must be the case that the structure of the brain must, in part, be determined by our genes. If this assessment is correct, how much is our brain structure dependent on our genes? Now consider the case of a newborn and suppose his/her brain structure has been established somehow. As he/she grows, the brain starts taking sensory input and learns to process it better through neuroplasticity. If so, then why does everyone's, say amygdala only process fear, anxiety, etc. What prevents it from maintaining autonomous functions? Are the functions of different parts also determined by our genetics? (Is neuroplasticity the only force dictating learning?)   In other words, why are all human brains so similar in brain structure, specialization of their parts and functioning?  Thank you "

2308,Are orgnizations like European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP) or European Family Therapy Association (EFTA) genuine?,"My sibling mentioned me about her idea of pursuing a additional post-university training for obtaining an EAP and EFTA compliant certificate for psychotherapy.   I raised a question regarding the credibility of such programs, which visibly made her feel uneasy.   I have a technical background, and scam and pay per publish conferences and journals are very common in my field, and given my experience I can easily tell what a scam is in my field. However, my sister has little experience in her field, i.e., psychology, so I would like to make sure that she does not take the wrong path. The price of the course that she mentioned was over $3000 for a 4 year training.  In short: are EAP and EFTA trainings genuine? What is the worth of their certification programs in the field?    Note: I apologize if this question is inappropriate to anyone who might be associated to those organizations, but as I said, my background knowledge is very limited, but at the same time I want to be a helpful bro. "
2309,Any research on IQ (general) and coping with abstract concepts?,"Is there any good research on how general IQ correlates with levels of abstractions people can easily handle?  I understand, that abstractions are different, but here it's probably enough to cover base logical reasoning, set (in math sense) membership and such, maybe some other classification. Also, of course there are situations when language already contains metaphors, which allow people to reason (like ""file"" can be put into ""folder""). My question is more about situations, when there are no suitable ready metaphors (""X"" can contain ""Y""). (memory can also be a factor?)  The notion of complexity of abstract concept systems is also interesting (if there are several), but my hope is to find an answer for any good notion. Basically, ""common sense"" logic whatever it is is probably enough reference point.  The idea is simple. Lets say, people with IQ greater than X can understand and recognize part-whole relationship and use that understanding in their work. Then, of course, it is easy to calculate how accessible some system is: IQ has very simple statistical definition (given standard deviation).  I am not a psychologist so I do not quite know even what are the right terms to search. However, my interest is in making software applications accessible to more users and user interfaces oftentimes rely on users handling of abstract concepts. So my interest is pragmatic. Still I think this question is more on psychology side than UX.  I believe IQ matters because if a user can't figure out something in a ""moment"" (in seconds), system is not usable. "
2310,"Phrase used by jordan peterson about ""revealing""","In his book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Peterson, 2018) has following quote:     If you will not reveal yourself to others, you cannot reveal yourself   to yourself. That  does not only mean that you suppress who you are,   although it also means that. It means  that so much of what you could   be will never be forced by necessity to come forward. This  is a   biological truth, as well as a conceptual truth. When you explore   boldly, when you  voluntarily confront the unknown, you gather   information and build your renewed self  out of that information. That   is the conceptual element. However, researchers have  recently   discovered that new genes in the central nervous system turn   themselves on when an organism is placed (or places itself) in a new situation. These genes code for new    proteins. These proteins are the building blocks for new structures in the brain. This    means that a lot of you is still nascent, in the most physical of senses, and will not be    called forth by stasis. You have to say something, go somewhere and do things to get    turned on.   I am puzzled what he means by word reveal above?   why would you not want to reveal (whatever he means) yourself? Can you give some explanations what you think?  References  Peterson, J. (2018). 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Toronto: Penguin Random House. ISBN: 0345816021 "

2312,Is a deeper capability of feeling emotions linked to a higher intellectual intelligence?,"Kazimierz Dąbrowski, in his Positive disintegration theory talks about overexcitability as the most evident aspect of developmental potential. He distinguishes five types of overexcitabilties: psychomotor, sensual, intellectual, imaginational and emotional. The emotional excitability, according to the Wikipedia      is characterised by heightened, intense feelings, extreme experience   of complex emotions, identification with others' feelings to the point   of actual experience and strong sentimental expression   These overexcitabilities tend to be present to different extents in gifted people, so it seems reasonable to think that in this case, a deeper capability of feeling emotions is linked to a higher intellectual intelligence.  Does this also happen in the wild? Are there any studies that not only establish the intellectual development of the species that surround us, but also their capability to feel emotions, and any correlation between that?  Ultimately, is intellectual intelligence development associated to emotional development? Are emotions needed to develop intellectual intelligence in a species? "
2313,"Can we really motivate ourselves ""on-demand""?","There are so many articles online and books selling on the idea that we should motivate ourselves daily, as motivation doesn't last long. Many cite numerous experiments and advise on techniques you can supposedly use, because some experiment showed positive results.  From all the popular psychology and life coaching books on Motivation, all I can gather is that motivation is something a person should think about constantly and regulate on their own, on a daily basis.(10 proven ways to motivate yourself,...and similar titles).  Can you really talk yourself into feeling motivated? Or is motivation something that just happens subconsciously? Is popular psychology really onto something or their claims too big?   Edit: My question is not answered with the suggested answer in the comment section. I'm not interested in obstacles to motivation, I'm interested in whether one can consciously spark motivation within oneself, regardless of existing obstacles. "

2315,Can critical thinking be taught?,"Critical thinking is central to the scientific method and believed to be essential to a successful democracy. Recently, the 2012 Texas Republican platform voiced the party's opposition to the teaching of critical thinking skills in public schools. This stance raises many controversial questions on the GOPs motivation, but also a fundamental question: are public schools in the US successfully teaching critical thinking?  In the West, critical thinking descends from the Socratic method and is a central tenant of the tutor system at the earliest institutions of higher learning (Oxford and Cambridge, for example). This historic dedication of the top institutions to teaching critical thinking suggests that the method is effective. On the other hand, contemporary psychologists of education are suggesting that critical thinking cannot be effectively taught (Willingham, 2008).  Can critical thinking be taught? Are there studies (with proper controls) that show that a course on critical thinking teaching the skill beyond standard domain specific problem-solving/fact-knowing courses? "
2316,How can prolonged stress lead to a sustained reduction in cognitive functioning?,"Background: Ten years ago or so I went through a traumatic period which resulted in a lot of stress and anxiety. I initially assumed there was some depression but cognition and short term memory was gradually affected such that I had serious difficulty understanding new concepts at night class. At one stage I was practically ""cut off"" from emotions. I understand that this could be partly due to something happening on the hormonal or biological level.  Questions   What does research show about the causal effects of stress on cognitive functioning? How is the brain affected by stress? (e.g., chemical/physical, or  perhaps a ""softer"" level).  What could be done to minimise the negative effects of stress on cognitive functioning?  "
2317,"Are some methods of teaching reading ""bad""?","I have a young daughter who I am teaching to read, and I was given a ""Your Baby Can Read"" DVD set by a friend.  When discussing it with friends, several of my teacher friends frowned upon the use of ""memorization"" to teach reading, and implied it would have negative long term effects.  Is there data to support this claim?  Since I expect there is a lot of research in this area, are some methods of teaching reading considered ""bad""?  For reference, the ""Your Baby Can Read"" series proposes that babies even can ""read"" even before they can talk by watching videos and looking at books which show words and then show a picture or short video that explains the word.  This is intended to make the connection between the word and what it represents, and ideally guide the child in a reaction to indicate they know what it means.  There is no mention whatsoever of spelling, or phonetic sounds - it is all word/picture or word/video associations one after another. "
2318,Have the abilities of John Lorber's patients with limited cortical mass been further evaluated in adulthood?,"Short of minor lesions or infarcts, most high-functioning adults have an intact cerebral cortex.  Yet, a surprising result published anecdotally in Science in 1980 caused a lot of scientists to take note of Dr. John Lorber's hydrocephalus patients in England.  Most famously, Lorber reported:     There's a young student at this university...who has an IQ of 126, has gained a first-class honors degree in mathematics, and is socially completely normal.  And yet the boy has virtually no brain...instead of the normal 4.5 centimeter thickness of brain tissue between the ventricles and the cortical surface, there was just a thin layer of mantle measuring a millimeter or so.   Now, arguing that the subject had ""virtually no brain"" is perhaps a bit of hyperbole, but the fact remains, he had accomplished an academic feat which many ""normal"" humans have not.  What's even more astonishing about this particular case is that this subject was purportedly not even aware of his condition until the initial brain scans were performed.  Aside from 1-2 other publications in peripheral journals around the same time period, I have never heard anything further about these patients that Dr. Lorber was following.  In the intervening 30+ years, have there been any follow-up scans/studies of these patients particularly those featuring the mathematics scholar mentioned above?  What mechanisms does the cortex use in these unusual circumstances to counter the effects of decreased cortical thickness?  Are the cortical columns shorter, and in what sense does their connectivity compensate for lower neuron counts/lower cell densities?     Lewin, R. (1980).  Is your brain really necessary?

2319,What does daytime actigraphy reveal about an active and awake brain?,"I have interest in the study of human motion ( Actigraphy), and have built a couple of smartphone apps using its principles. The apps look at gross motor activity of an individual. Up until now, most of my reading into the field has been focused on the study of sleep. With Actigraphy, there are clear ~90 minute activity patterns visible over the course of the night that roughly correlate with the 4 stages of sleep. There are algorithms by Cole and Sadeh which describe how to score sleep using activity counts.   Are there any uses of actigraphy for awake patients?  Are there any investigations of the correlation between the overall activity pattern/level and the brain wave frequency (alpha/beta/...)?  Are there any wake-related actigraphy algorithms?   Update thank you for answers and comments! Let me clarify the question. I'm interested in comparing a rather long history of events for the same individual wearing an actigraph.  For example we have a person who's both an athlete and also does meditation. I'm interested in using actigraphy to determine the length of the meditation sessions, along with any increase/decrease of overall activity pattern that may accompany meditation activity (ex: deeper concentration moves the brain to a different brainwave and relaxes the body, or nervousness and fidgeting rising, the person cannot get to the correct brainwave and cuts the session short).  Lets say the same person is a runner. Wearing an actigraph during sessions displays two important characteristics: When the person is and is not running. (going out to run is an action that requires conscious action. How long the person is running.  If a person is feeling ""negative"", the person may not go out to run). If a person does go out to run, the running session may be cut short if a person is not in the right state of mind.  Combined with self-reported events (ex: running session started, meditation session started), such actigraphy data may be plotted day by day. I'm interested if there have been studies of such data.

2320,Are intelligence scores correlated with detection of second stimulus in an Attentional Blink test?,"Definitions  Attentional Blink: An attentional blink is a phenomenon where when presented with rapid visual stimuli if you are asked to track two particular stimuli you will fail to notice the second if it is preceded shortly after the first (Raymond, Shapiro, &amp; Arnell, 1992).  Intelligence: A quantifiable score, or set of scores, aimed at measuring human cognitive capacities (such as the Raven's Progressive Matrices test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, etc.).  Question:  The results of Attentional Blink Tests have led some to see attention as a commodity that can be allocated, by will or nature, but needs time to be restored before additional attentional resources can be spent on subsequent activities (Raymond, Shapiro, &amp; Arnell, 1992).  It has been noted  that emotion plays a role in recognition of the second target – particularly, if there is an emotional investment or relevance in the second target it is more likely to be detected (Schwabe, 2010). This illustrates that emotion can mediate attention.  My question is whether intelligence could also mediate attention.    Does intelligence increase a person’s attentional abilities? Does, or would, an intelligence score positively correlate with the detection of the second stimulus in an Attentional Blink Test?   References   Raymond, J. E., Shapiro, K. L., &amp; Arnell, K. M.

2321,A study about preference for making relatively vs. absolute more money?,"I remember reading about a study. I forgot the actual details of it, but the gist of it was: people were asked in what situation they would prefer to live, one where they make \[tex]200,000 dollars, or one where they make \[tex]5000 dollars. Most participants chose the \[tex]5,000 situation, even though they would have ended up with much less money (note: I am pretty sure I got the actual numbers wrong).   Sadly, I don't remember where I read it (thought it must have been in Predictably Irrational, but can't find it there).   Questions   What is the reference for the study What theories explain this behavior?  Where can I read background information on the topic?  "
2322,How can STDP fit with reciprocal connectivity?,"I have rather technical question regarding STDP dynamics.  I am working on a neural network implementing an STDP learning algorithm, and have noticed that it is extremely anti-reciprocal. When two neurons have bidirectional connectivity between them, the conditions that will strengthen one direction will inevitably weaken the other, as far as I can understand. If B consistently fires immediately following a spike in A, the A->B synapse will strengthen, however the B->A synapse would weaken, as the pre-synapse / post-synapse roles are reverse.  This wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for empirical evidence of high reciprocity in cortical connectivity.    Am I missing something? Is this a known shortcoming of the model?  "
2323,Can processing effort for sub-tasks in neural networks be measured?,"I often heard statements like:     80% of your brain processing is computing the effect of gravity   or, similarily:     You only use 20% of your brain power   My question isn't about the truth of these statements but if they are well-formed: can we measure 'processing' in the brain (or a sufficiently complicated artificial neural net) to quantify how much of the processing resources are allocated towards specific sub-routines?  As an example of when this is doable in another domain: consider a computer with a standard von Neumann architecture. In this case we can tell how much processing goes into sub-routine by simple counting the number of steps each subroutine holds the processor. However, this simple counting is only possible because of two features:   There is a clear central processor, and data is not transformed by anything except it. There is a clear duality between software and hardware allowing us to identify when a specific sub-routine (software) is being allowed access to the processor (hardware).   Both features are missing in a computer with a neural architecture. How can we measure the resources that a computer with neural architecture (example: the brain) devotes to subtasks?    Notes  I am interested in settings where there isn't an obvious localization of sub-tasks. So an answer like:     we can measure the amount of resources that go towards recognizing faces by looking at the metabolic uptake of the fusiform face area.   Is not that interesting to me, since it is only valid for sub-tasks that happen to have specially-devoted areas. Of course, if there is an argument that any reasonable (or more restricted: human-like) neural-architecture has to compartmentalize its computations then I would like to hear that. However, the answerer would be left with the task of explaining how to identify the group of neurons that should be associated with a specific sub-task. "
2324,Does each sensory neuron type have a characteristic spike sequence pattern?,"Background  It is known that all sensory information is input to the brain as neural spike sequences. Now, to distinguish between the spike sequences generated by retinal red/blue/green cone cells from each other, and these from the cochlear (inner ear) hair cells, and so on, some sort of encoding scheme must be used.   To further clarify, in the case of retinal cone cells, the rate of incident light quanta in a given energy range, is the primary information that is coded. But, if all 3 types of cone cells generated identical responses for a given rate-of-incidence, like the CCD pixels in our digital cameras do, then there would be no way for upstream neurons to tell what type of cone cell a spike sequence came from. Instead, my guess is that, each type of cone cell encodes the rate-of-incidence in its own characteristic way, similar to how different types of musical instruments sound differently, even when playing the same pitch at the same intensity, via timbre.     An oversimplified illustration of Timbre  Question  Is there evidence that each sensory neuron type has a characteristic spike sequence pattern?  Why message type must be encoded in the message itself  During the development of the visual system, the retina, the LGN and the visual cortex develop separately initially and sometime later, axons from the retinal ganglions grow into LGN, and optic radiations from the LGN grow and reach into the cortex. As far as we can tell it is not guaranteed that a specific ganglion will project its axon to a specific neuron in the LGN. All that is guaranteed by the growth process is that ganglions close together will project to LGN neurons that are also close together.   Given this development process, when a higher region say in the V1 receives a spike stream from a neuron somewhere lower, the question arises: how does it know that this spike stream means, red, blue or green? A simple idea that occurred to me from information theory is that the message type could somehow be encoded in the message itself.   Motivation  Evidence for characteristic spike patterns for each sensory neuron type would take us one more step towards understanding qualia, the hard problem of consciousness. My speculation is that qualia are the neuronal analogs of timbre in musical instruments.  Erwin Schrödinger thought we'd never get there. He said, ""The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective picture of light [as] waves [or as quanta]. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so.""   I guess he's right in the sense that we will never be able to fully wrap our minds around the mysterious and ineffable nature of qualia.   However, evidence of characteristic spike patterns would offer resolutions to qualia related thought experiments, such as Is there something about Mary?, that philosophers seem to be pulling their hair out over.  "
2325,How many times can someone listen to a song before he/she stops enjoying it?,"How many repetitions do we need to get tired of listening to a song over and over again? I want to know if some kind of average number of repetitions exisits.  Is there any research related to this question? Or is there no need to put this in the context of a song.

2326,"What research exists in the areas of formulating questions and ""problem shaping""?","After recalling Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen's How to Ask Questions The Smart Way and a discussion in a systems engineering course regarding the impact of the proper formulation of a problem in order to achieve the optimal solution(s), I began to look for research into methodologies that can be used to formulate a question prior to asking it.  In Raymond and Moen's post, they have a few short lines touching on what I'm referring to. They mention to prepare your question by thinking it through and to beware of asking questions based on false assumptions. However, I'm more interested in psychological research into how people go about these activities, preferably in some kind of methodology or framework that can be applied to assess how one is formulating questions or even how to go about forming a question that can then go through a methodology similar to Raymond and Moen's process.  Searching for information about asking questions has so far yielded things about creating surveys with effective questions and how questions can influence answers. Perhaps I'm not using the right terms or looking in the right fields.  I found the term ""problem shaping"" on Wikipedia. The article (which is a stub) describes the concept that I'm looking for. However, I checked into the related articles and they don't appear to describe anything that I'm looking for in more depth. The ""see also"" pages appear to focus on topics related to problem solving, not actually formulating and shaping the problem. It seems that in order to effectively solve the problem, you need an appropriately formulated problem statement, yet I can't find anything about the methodologies or processes to do so stated formally.  My specific questions:   Is there any research (of any level of scientific rigor) in the frameworks or processes of developing a good question or problem statement?  If so, what are some examples of work done and what information or products have been generated?  If not, what topics might be used to provide insights to gain a deeper understanding of the formulation of questions or problem statements?  "

Certainly some kind of internet addiction, combined with a good portion of gamification, represented by reputation, badges, ... But in this case, I think there is also some kind of altruistic helper-syndrome.   Does this make math addiction a good one? Are there examples of helpful, let's say in a social sense, addictions? "
2328,When one activity makes you less distracted doing another activity?,"Background: When I'm coding, I sometimes make tea, and as long as I'm drinking the tea, I find myself more focused. Drinking tea seems to make me focus more. Thus, it seems that while doing something else I am less likely to be distracted. Another example that seems similar is listening to music while working out (running for example).  Question   Is there a term that describes the process by which engaging in a small secondary task increases focus on the primary task? Are the two examples of drinking tea while coding and listening to music while working out related?  "
2329,Advantage of active learning on classification tasks,"I am looking for a specific type of experimental test of active learning. Given some artificial or natural learning task that consists of classifying inputs [tex] from a large input space [tex]. There is some underlying function [tex] to be learned, this function can come from some restricted function class [tex]. The subject knows the description of the function class, but has to learn the specific parameters that define the function. I am looking for experiments that had two conditions of this type:   The subject is given labeled samples [tex] from some distribution on [tex] that they have no control over. The subject is allowed to ask for specific [tex] and receive the labeled sample [tex].   The first condition would correspond to passive learning, while the second to active learning.  From arm-chair expectations (or formal theories like CoLT), one would expect that on certain tasks the subjects in the active condition would be able to significantly outperform (predict the underlying function more accurately) than in the passive condition.  Can you provide references to specific experiments that would fit in this paradigm? What were their results? On what sort of tasks does active learning provide an advantage? How significant is this advantage?    Example  An example would be a subject sitting in front of a blank screen. They are told ""there is a straight line that divides this screen into a red and green region. Can you find it?"". Thus, the set [tex] would correspond to coordinates, and an input [tex] would be a specific coordinate, say [tex]. The function class would be the set of straight line partitions of the screen. A specific function with [tex] meaning red and [tex] - green might be:   [tex]  In the active task, the participant can click on any point [tex] on the screen to turn it from blank to either red (if [tex]) or green (if [tex]). In the passive trial, some number of points are selected and revealed at random to the subject. "
2330,How much sleep is required to restore maximum cognitive functioning?,"Background: Recently I have really messed up my sleep schedule due to my procrastination. The internet points to some very basic conclusions but I would like to see actual experiments on effects of sleep on cognitive functions.  Questions   What is the absolute minimum hours of sleep one needs to completely restore brain functionality to peak levels?  How much sleep is required for muscle rebuilding processes?  How does this amount of sleep affect learning process, memory recall, and ability to infer relationships?   "

2333,What is relationship between being a good person and functioning in society?,"The phrases ""No more Mr Nice guy"" and ""Nice guys finish last"" imply that being a good person can sometimes be detrimental to your well-being. In corrupt societies being fair and good might be detrimental. I'm interested in what research says:   What is the relationship between being a good and fair person and adaptive outcomes in society? Is being good and fair sometimes detrimental to one's well-being? If so, what contextual or other factors are related to this?  "
2334,How does human brain pick out the most likely representation of object when an object is ambiguous?,"For example, it is dim light and an object is in partial shade, hiding some features of an object. It is a rounded, dark brownish object. The object is rather ambiguous - it could be a rock, a potato, a turtle, a grenade, a ball, etc.  When looking at an ambiguous object like that described above, do different neural networks get activated with different intensity? Does the brain pick the highest probability and the person label the object with that name? For example, does the brain get input like:   63% of potato detecting neurons get activated, saying it looks like a potato 50% ball 34% turtle 28% grenade  Or is it the feature recognition that helps distinguish objects?  For example: potato has skin texture and dimples ball is perfectly round turtle has irregular edge and rectangular pattern grenade has a handle and pin   If an object has one of these features, it is unlikely to be another object?     "
2335,Does explaining a visual guidance system affect visual attention distribution?,"I'm working on a driving simulator that uses an eyetracker to monitor the users gaze behavior. Based on a study I modeled an optimal scanpath that the users should follow in order to best maneuver through curves. If the users gaze hasn't hit certain AoIs in time, a visual cue is being shown to manipulate the user to include this point in his scanpath.  My question is, should I explain the meaning of the cues and the system behind them to the testers? Wouldn't that bias their scanning behavior?  "
2336,Can we explain the tendency of investors dollar cost averaging in terms of loss aversion?,"For those unfamiliar with the term Dollar cost averaging (DCA)     is an investment strategy for reducing the   impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets such as   equities. By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (eg   \$100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals   (eg \$1000 over 100 weeks), DCA reduces the risk of incurring a   substantial loss resulting from investing the entire ""lump sum"" just   before a fall in the market.   Dollar cost averaging appears to perform worse than lump sum investment. If this is the case, then why do a lot of people engage in dollar cost averaging instead of lump sump investment?  My own guess is that dollar cost averaging ""allows you to sleep better"" at night because the chances of making catastrophic losses are smaller than lump sum investments; in other words, loss aversion is at work here.   Am I right? In other words, I have two intertwined questions here   Does dollar cost averaging have a lesser chance of blowing up? If yes, is this why people prefer it?  "
2337,Can observing a composite photo of one's own face have an impact on own personality?,"A while back I created an iPhone app that helps me create a composite like the one below. Can observing such a composite have an impact of attributing the qualities perceived in the composite to oneself? For example feeling more open or extraverted.    The reason I'm asking is that I foundthis answer to question about facial features and personality. Within an answer, there's a link to this paper: Personality judgments from natural and composite facial images.  The paper suggests that ordinary, untrained people are capable of naturally recognizing and rating a face on a big 5 personality traits. The author proceeds to show that composite faces that are rated high on the ""socially - desirable"" traits, like extraversion, openness and agreeableness are rated as more attractive by the study's test subjects:    Here are the attractiveness ratings summary from the male faces above:    When using my app, the user's brain is tricked into recognizing the composite image as one's own, because it is made of a live camera image + static image, and the image can blink, smile, frown, etc. The brain merges the two images, potentially distorting the true geometry of one's face by perceiving a composite image.  Here is a quote from that article on the self fulfilling prophesy effect (page 635):     For example, people with facial features that elicit attributions of   agreeableness may be treated as more trustworthy and may perhaps   consequently develop more agreeable personality characteristics.   I'm interested if perceiving such composite can activate the same mechanisms used to judge other faces, thus creating the same self-fulfilling prophesy and having an impact on one's personality?  Probably a part of the answer to the question is in answering the question: ""does one's own image in the mirror affect one's personality?"" "
2338,How is music preference related to personality traits or particular qualities?,"I'm a big music enthusiast myself, and one thing I noticed about myself, and not exactly about other people, is that I don't have any music genre I prefer listening to. For example, I don't mind it being rock, rap, techno or any music genre for that matter. As long as the beat is catchy, the quality of execution is there, and I can enjoy listening to it, I'll do so.  Hence, I've been wondering if there is any correlation between people liking certain kinds of genres and having certain qualities, skills or personality traits? For example, are people who like certain genres more creative or outgoing?  "

2340,".Do students learn better when challenged (specifically, in math education)?","Originally posted on Math.SE, but it was suggested cogsci.SE would be a more suitable venue.  I'm aware of two publications that have trickled onto the radar screens of non-specialists:   Fortune Favors the Bold by Diemand-Yauman &amp; Oppenheimer Designing Effective Multimedia for Physics Education  by Derek Muller (TED talk)   The former focuses on the impact of ""disfluency"" on retention and success when processing written material, and the latter seems to focus on learning in the  case where preexisting misconceptions need to be corrected (physics).  I'm interested to hear about similar research results in the learning of abstract concepts, specifically mathematics.  The motivation described in the original question on Math.SE is the fact that many mathematicians seem to hold the (painful, to students)  belief that forcing students to struggle (in some sense) is beneficial. I've quoted multiple examples of this attitude from various sources in  the original question, you are welcome to have a look.  Does current research support the belief that (in mathematics) difficult learning is better learning? This might be in terms of retention, long-term achievements, motivation, etc'.  Update   I've posted an expanded form of the question on matheducators.SE beta: [website]Still hoping for helpful answers from the cogsci.SE community.  "
2341,Why does your recorded or objective voice sound different to what you hear in your own head?,"When speaking, I hear my own voice very differently from how others do and from what it really is. The sound differs in tone, pitch, volume, etc. For example, recordings of my singing or speaking in foreign languages sounded a lot worse than what I heard in my own head.  Is that a popular phenomenon? Or is that a ""syndrome"", and which parts of sensation and perception are unusual? Last, is it modifiable?  "

2343,"What is the cognitive mechanism that creates strong feelings, from environmental organization and appearance?","After doing a home remodel, I leaned that within the interior design community, most professionals refer to their work by the ""vibe"", ""energy"" and ""feeling"" their design of a room (or house) creates, within the individual occupying the property.  A simple example, a wood log cabin designed home creates a very different ""feel/vibe"" than a sleek modern home.  Cognitively speaking, what exactly is this ""vibe"" and ""energy"" that is referred to and what is happening within an individual that causes it?  Also, are some people more sensitive to the ""vibe"" the environment gives off and why?  Any help is appreciated. "

When do people pick this up when they grow, or is this just natural?  Some people laugh differently again, but I tend to believe they are just acting, not naturally letting it out, just so they feel different from others. Is this true?  "
2345,Is there any research showing success of teaching with smell?,"Cognitive science holds that smell is the sense that has the strongest ability to trigger memories. It is discussed in awe.   We see anecdotes such as the sudden striking memory of sitting in your grandmothers kitchen when you were 6 - because you have just smelled the same scent of the food she cooked (30 years later). Has anyone been using scent timed with instruction to improve performance? I am only seeing studies of the effect of certain smells (peppermint, cinnamon, etc) on the neural activity of lab rats being watched with fMRI.   Is there any research in which a control group (no smells) performed worse than an experimental group (had smells during learning and testing?)   "

2347,What is known about how visual stimuli / preconceptions influence auditory perception?,"This question occured to me as I was walking along the street today. I saw two fashionable-looking women on the street ahead of me. One of them pointed to something outside of my field of view, and said ""Oh look, Katy's Boutique!"" When I turned to look, I saw no boutique, but I did see a branch of the bank HSBC, which made me realize that the woman must have said ""Oh look, HSBC!""  Now, maybe I'm wrong here, but I can't imagine that I would have heard ""Katy's Boutique"" if I had seen two men rather than two women. It seems that my preconceptions caused me to interpret the same stimuli differently.  Have any studies been done on this? How well known is the effect, and can we say anything quantitative about it?

2352,How do you make psychology experiments?,"Have you used Inquisit, E-Prime, DirectRT, or Qualtrics to make psychology experiments? I worked in a psychology lab as a programmer and I thought these programs felt very outdated and not user friendly. I started making a software that lets you make experiments without having to code. But posts like this(How can I create computer based psychology experiments using OS X?) seem to suggest researchers or professors don't mind learning a little bit of coding to make experiments.  Question: if you have used such softwares to make experiments, what did you think about the process? Also, do you think there are many people who would want a new software that does everything but without coding?  Thank you so much! "
2353,Which intervention improves the ability to remember names the most?,"Is there research about psychological interventions to help the average person remember names? If so, which intervention or interventions have the best evidence base to support them?  Are there good academic books about the subject of how humans manage to remember names? "
2354,How long does the trace of a memory last in the brain?,"With long-term plasticity one refers to the phenomen by which synapses are modified by neural activity and these modifications last for long times, a day perhaps of the order of days. This phenomenon is often described in contrast to short-term plasticity, where the response of a synapse has a non-linear component that depend on the history of the presynaptic activity in a short time in the past of the order of hundreds of ms.  Plasticity is in fact a much more complicated subject and involves processes at different levels, at the synapse, neuron, network and whole brain (e.g., homeostasis) level. Given our current knowledge of memory systems in the brain, how long are we able to trace even small bits of the memory of a stimulus we were exposed in the past?  Obviously one can answer the question at the cognitive level, i.e., we can rephrase the question and ask instead: What's the oldest memory I can recall? It is well known that our behavior as adults is a reflection of even the oldest memories of our lives. However, I would argue that this is an inderect effect, namely those events that happened in our childhood had an influence on how and what we experience say in the adolescence, and then what we experience as adults is a reflection of what we experienced in adolescence. One known phenomenon that seems to ""elongate"" memories in the future is the one of replay, i.e., the fact that our brain spontaneously recalls memories of the past like in dreaming.  In computational neuroscience, we can trace bits of patterns stored in a neural network with plastic synapses by probing the network, e.g., by presenting a noisy version of a training pattern and testing if the network is able to recall that pattern, something like an associative memory paradigm. A statistical tool used to test the scaling properties of synapse models is the signal-to-noise ratio analysis. Using this analysis, one is able to address the question of a memory lifetime by assessing whether the synapses maintained some information of a pattern in the past (the signal) with statistical arguments (i.e., with respect to the ""noise"" of all the other memories interfering with the old one).  Is anybody aware of any experiment where people tried to trace single bits of memories at a single synapse level? In models, the weight of single synapses is maintained for ever unless other memories interfere with that. In reality, it would be interesting to see whether single biological synapses can maintain information on long time-scales (days? months? years?), even considering protein turn-over, or if its the network dynamics that plays a crucial role in maintaining those memories or refreshing them.  Note that answers that go beyond the synapse level are also welcome, that's why the main title doesn't specify to much details. "
2355,Can memorising a new thing erase existing memories?,"   Homer: But every time I learn something new, it pushes out something old. Remember that time I took a home wine-making course and forgot how to drive?      Marge: That's because you were drunk.   Yeah, but all jokes aside, when all other conditions are equal, does  memorising a new thing increase the chance of losing existing memories that are not directly related to the new memory (different subjects)?  If there is no OS that keeps track of data (i.e.,file system), and each program writes small data anywhere on a large hard disk it wants, as the data grows, the chance of overwriting existing data will increase. And even if OS keeps track of data, when there is no more space it must delete some existing files. "
2356,Lifelong avoidance coping style,"Suppose someone has been using avoidance coping style for most of his or her life. The avoidance tendency is present in a broad range of situations, relatively constant through his or her life, not preceded by a major event or trauma, and not associated with any cognition or emotion.  According to current models, what are the likely causes of the coping style?How changeable is the coping style through various therapies?  P.S. For the purpose of this question, I only ask about the coping style itself (that is, his or her tendency to avoid as opposed to counterattack or surrender) not the consequences of the coping style (the disorders and pathologies and so on).

2357,Taking into account reliability of Raven's Matrices and Self Monitoring tests,"I've results of two tests administered to university students:    the 18-item true-false version of the Self-Monitoring Scale (Snyder &amp; Gangestad, 1986); the Raven Progressive Matrices Test (John &amp; Raven, 2003).   In the past I've been assessing personality profiles of students, referring to the five factor model of personality and using a test based on the International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg et al., 2006). In this case I was measuring reliability by Alpha coefficients. However, these coefficient seems not to make sense in a test like Raven's where there are only correct and wrong answers. Same doubts apply to the other test.  Should I measure the reliability of these two tests (Raven and Self-monitoring) on my sample? If so, which measure should I use? "
2358,How can psychometric or behavioural tests be used in banking to evaluate creditworthiness?,"Suppose an entrepreneur or borrower with little credit or business history goes to a bank or some financial institution to borrow money.

Where can I read more about these (eg some articles, what kind of articles or journals, keywords to google)? "
2359,Could ketosis be therapeutic for ADHD based on the neuro-energetic theory of attention?,"I'm a complete neuroscience novice so please bear with me.  One of the more interesting theories of the etiology of ADHD that I've read posits that the disorder may be one of neuroenergetics - the result of insufficient and variable neuronal energy production due to insufficient ""formation and supply of lactate"" in astrocytes. As the theory goes, this impairs immediate response to cognitive demands due to a lack of sufficient ATP for ""rapidly firing neurons,"" and also affects development of the brain by impairing myelination on longer time scales. Abstract here: [website]I'm quite interested in how ketosis can be therapeutic for neurological/cognitive issues in general, and how it might ameliorate ADHD symptoms in particular - there appears to be some experimental evidence (at least in rat models) that it might do the latter. There also appears to be experimental evidence that ketosis increases levels of lactate in the brain: [website]My question: if the theory proposed in the first link above is correct, would it be reasonable to think that a ketogenic diet might eliminate ADHD symptoms by addressing the lactate supply issue? Obviously the effects of years of impaired myelination would still be present, but could ketosis resolve the more immediate energy-supply issue and also possibly improve myelination going forward? "
2360,Thinking consciously or unconsciously - Any difference in brain scan?,"I've been wondering how a person would be affected if brain activity that is normally done automatically and unconsciously in a normal human being has to be done consciously by him, or vice versa.  For example, I have seen videos of mathematical savants where they describe their mental mathematical calculation process to be unconscious rather than conscious. They would say things like, ""I see many colorful shapes and colors, then suddenly I know the answer to the equation."" Whereas for the average person, calculating math mentally is a conscious activity.  What difference does it make if a thought is processed consciously or unconsciously? Would the brain scan look different?  Also, I'd like to read more on this topic, but don't know how to go about searching on the internet because I don't know what the topic is called. Would be very helpful if you could suggest readings or topics I can search for. Thank you! "
2361,What is the relationship between top-down mechanism and priming the visual system in the following experiment?,"I am currently conducting an experiment where a subject is shown a series of photographs of various objects. Each photo contains a single object. Before showing the photograph, a screen with a text indicating the name of the object is shown briefly. The objective is to analyze the eye-fixations that occur as subjects view the objects.  This is a free-viewing task, i.e. the subjects are asked to gaze at the pictures without explicitly searching for any attribute in particular. Typically, a bottom-up mechanism is thought to be active for such situations. Since I show the name of the object before showing its picture, most likely, I am priming the subject's visual system. Does this manner of priming make the task a top-down one even though there is no explicit ""search"" traditionally associated with top-down mechanisms ?  More generally, what is the relationship between top-down mechanisms and priming the visual system ? "

2364,What is the relationship between perceived difficulty and mistakes/errors?,"I'm looking for any empirical research about the correlation between the perceived difficulty level of humans and the mistake / errors they make while performing a task.   I would prefer studies with longer/more realistic tasks compared to simple task performed in the lab. I would also prefer studies in the field of software engineering.  So far I could only find one study in this direction:  Varying task difficulty in the Go/Nogo task: The effects of inhibitory control, arousal, and perceived effort on ERP components  Are there others with longer/more realistic tasks? "
2365,Is it conceivable that even basic human behavior is genetically determinined only to a very limited extent?,"I'm wondering whether even basic human behavior (beyond what appears to be directly wired into our nervous systems, like swallowing and face-related mirror neurons) are indeed facilitated by genetically determined features of the body (and by features of the environment), but only acquired through either operand conditioning (i.e. through exploration) or observational learning (i.e. through culture).  Cats, for example, have an innate urge to catch things, but they only really learn to hunt from copying other cats. To some extent, the art of hunting can be thus seen as cat culture (it might just be very easily re-discoverable).  In this interpretation, the genetic predispositions for a fit phenotype are partly outsourced from a genetic to a memetic encoding, and even basic behaviors require a fairly universal learning apparatus to be acquired. Given that a basic behavior such as hunting is not fully genetically encoded in cats, can we assume that no behavior roughly more complex than chasing things is directly genetically encoded in humans, and that more complex behaviors are at most genetically facilitated in the body to be acquired by exploration and observation? Could, for example, the mother instinct be broken down to heuristic rewards a mother receives from seeing a small human, from empathic rewards from caring, from a heuristic attachment of the baby to a food source and warmth, and the rest is a matter of operand conditioning, exploration and culture?  Are there any explanatory approaches along these lines in the literature? "
2366,"What is the relationship between the ego, amygdala and consciousness?","I've been reading a lot about emotional responses lately, and the following points seem to surface in different writings:     ""Amygdala is a very ancient system, intended to quickly alert a   person of danger"".   At the same time, we have a part of our consciousness, where thoughts of danger, lack or negativity towards others may arise. I've seen spiritual/personal development writers attribute these thoughts to the function of the ego. I'm not sure if they are using the term correctly, as they have a mostly negative perception of the ego, as something that strives to dominate cognition and act out of fearful/selfish desires.  Here's a description from wikipedia:     The ego is the organized part of the personality structure that   includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive   functions.   I'm trying to understand - Is person's ego a projection of the responses of their amygdala onto the conscious experience?  I've looked around and see some bloggers like this one make a claim that the amygdala and the ego are one and the same. Is this true?  To clarify my question - I'm seeking to understand if there's a structure/process in cognition that integrates input from various ""lower mammal brain"" structures and translates them into thoughts? "
2367,Which format of secret would be the most efficient for human memory?,"In information security a shared secret is often used to authenticate users. (so-called sth-you-know authentication factor; examples include passwords, passphrases, numeric pin-s, graphical passwords ([website]A common form of secret, 8-character password over all 95 ASCII chars, would contain ~53 bits of entropy ([tex] possibilities). A password in top 1000 most common passwords would contain only ~10 bits of entropy (1000 possibilities) but would be easier to remember. A 4-word passphrase over 10'000 most common words would also contain ~53 bits of entropy ([tex] possibilities), but would maybe(?) be easier to remember that 8 random characters.  My question is based on the assumption that same amount of information represented in different formats (sound, image, text, song, movement, etc.) are not equally easy to remember. Maybe passwords (or text based methods in general) are not the best option.  In which form can humans memorize the largest amount of information and present it to a computer device? I'd be glad if you could link some relevant research too. "
2368,"Why would I be asked to count backwards by 3, from 100 in a psychological test?","On an initial mental health consultation with a psychiatric nurse practitioner, I was asked, among many other odd questions, to count backwards by three. 100, 97, 94...  This was quite a number of years ago and I've often wondered what the purpose behind this question was, and what some of the the other curious questions accomplish. I have my suspicions, but I'm not certain.  What's a baker's dozen? What do you think ""people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"" means?  Thanks "
2369,Would courts sentence differently if we used a different numeral system?,"I hear a lot in the media about people sentenced to go to jail for a number of years divisible by 10.  Does our numeral system affect it? Would courts sentence the same if we counted - for example - in base 7 (when ""10 years"" means 7 years, ""20 years"" means 14 years and so on)? Which other important issues can be affected by this? "
2370,"Due to Gestalt Psychology, is the face an illusion?","Gestalt Psychology maintains that we perceive a whole from parts, and that we fill in missing gaps.  The ""whole"" we perceive is more than the sum of parts we perceive - it also involves what our minds add in.  Given this, is the concept of a ""face"" a result of Gestalt psychology on our minds?  All that's on the face are eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose.  Yet we combine all these parts (which objectively seem discrete from each other) and come up with the concept of a face (the ""whole"" in this example).  Is this kind of reasoning correct? "
2371,Why is conditioned taste aversion an example of classical conditioning (rather than operant)?,"The internet seems to be in complete agreement that conditioned taste aversion is an example of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. My (admittedly limited) understanding of classical conditioning is that it's a process in which two stimuli are paired in such a way that the response to one of the stimuli changes. I'm having trouble spotting what those stimuli are in this case. This seems more like operant conditioning, in which unpleasant consequences (the symptoms) mold behavior by causing us to associate the taste of that food with those symptoms.  Am I misunderstanding operant/classical conditioning? Am I overcomplicating things? "
2372,Are there any practical implications for the purported neuroprotective effects of lamotrigine?,"Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug used to treat seizures. Off-label, it is used to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Judging from Google Scholar, lamotrigine continues to be the subject of active research: both on the neuroscience end to elucidate its mechanism of action, and on the clinical end to investigate its efficacy in treating disorders beyond its approved usage for seizures.   There are interesting statements in the literature regarding the neuroprotective effects of lamotrigine, for example:      ... several studies have investigated   LTG’s neuroprotective effects in models related to the toxic   effects of glutamatergic agents. [1]   and     Like the other mood stabilizers lithium and valproate,    LTG also has neuroprotective properties but its exact mechanisms remain poorly defined. [2]   There are additional, supporting studies cited within the previous two references. I believe this bibliography, though of course not exhaustive, is at least representative.  My question is this: What on earth is the relevance of these statements for real-life scenarios involving humans? Neurodegeneration is a relatively common occurrence in human populations, resulting from such diverse sources as toxins, physical injuries to the head, and aging. Based on what is known so far about the involved neurological mechanisms, could lamotrigine potentially protect against neurodegeneration in any of these cases?  One particular case that came to mind is neurodegeneration due to binge drinking. I have heard that neuronal cell loss in this case has been hypothesized to arise from glutamatergic mechanisms, which could be relevant for lamotrigine since lamotrigine is thought to suppress release of glutamate. On the other hand, this article calls into question the glutamatergic explanation for alcohol-induced brain damage:     ... the mechanism [for binge-drinking induced brain damage]   is not directly related to glutamate neurotoxicity. [3]   Another case that occurred to me is amnesic shellfish poisoning, an illness caused by the neurotoxin domoic acid, which has a strong affinity for glutamate receptors.  I'm not an expert in neuroscience and/or pharmacology, so I have limited ability to take 1) the theoretical understanding of lamotrigine's mechanism of action, and 2) the theoretical understanding of various neurodegenerative disorders; and make some hypothesis about a possible neuroprotective effect, if any.  Is it likely that lamotrigine could have neuroprotective effect against the two illnesses mentioned above? Or are there other examples?  "
2373,How does this experiment prove a causal relation between coherence and good feelings?,"I'm reading Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and I came across the following text:     The Remote Association Test has more to tell us about the link between cognitive ease and positive effect. Briefly consider the two triads of words:      [tex] You could not know it of course, but measurements of electrical activity in the muscles of your face would probably have shown a slight smile when you read the second trial, which is coherent (sea is the solution). This smiling reaction to coherence appears in subjects who are told nothing about common associates; they are merely shown a vertically arranged triad of words and instructed to press the space bar after they have read it. The impression of cognitive ease that comes with the presentation of a coherent triad appears to be mildly pleasurable in itself. The evidence that we have about good feelings, cognitive ease, and the intuition of coherence is, as scientists say, correlational but not necessarily causal. Cognitive ease and smiling occur together, but do the good feelings actually lead to intuitions of coherence? Yes, they do. The proof comes from a clever experimental approach that has become increasingly popular. Some participants were given a cover story that provided an alternative interpretation for their good feeling: they were told about music played in their earphones that ""previous research showed that this music influences the emotional reaction of its individuals"". This story completely eliminates the intuition of coherence. The finding shows that the brief emotional response that follows the presentation of a triad of words (pleasant if the triad is coherent, unpleasant otherwise) is actually the basis of judgments of coherence. There is nothing here that system 1 cannot do. Emotional changes are now expected, and because they are unsurprising they are not linked causally to the words.   (Kahneman refers to the automatic and intuitive way of thinking as system 1)  My Question: Why does the adding of the cover story in this experiment show that good feelings lead to intuitions of coherence (that there is a causal relation)? I find this conclusion rather strange. I'm probably mistaken but it seems to me that Kahneman is saying: the fact that there was no intuition of coherence when these participants were expecting to respond emotionally to music, shows that there is a causal relation between the good feelings and the intuition of coherence. Why would this make sense? "
2374,How to implement an incidental processing task without a fMRI-compatible response box?,"Background  I'm planning an event-related fMRI-experiment to investigate the difference in processing natural and computer-generated facial emotion expressions. My supervisor and I are discussing different task instructions for the scanning session (see below).  Two often applied task instructions involve:   Passive processing of facial emotion expressions Subjects are instructed to passively attend to the stimuli shown, no motor response or judgement required incidental processing of facial emotion expressions For instance, subjects are required to press a button in case an inverted face appears (in 10% of all cases for example)   As we do not have a MRI-compatible response box available, I prefer the passive processing task instruction, even though possible attention interferences may emerge as we cannot ""control"" cognitive processes of the subjects while scanning. My supervisor prefers the incidental processing because of these possible attention interferences and suggests subjects may answer with a hand signal. For me it will be impossible to track those hand signals because of the room setup and I am bothered about reviewers criticizing that we implemented a task that we were unable to control and report. Furthermore, I'm worried that the hand movements may interfere with the image quality as subjects are moving. My supervisor rejects all those arguments as sustaining attention of the subjects is the strongest argument for him and he thinks reviewers will criticize that if we implement a passive task.  How to implement an incidental task with low cognitive demands without a response box?  We discarded a recognition task after the scan (e.g. have you seen this picture before?) or a counting task during the scanning session (e.g. how many female faces?), as the cognitive load may be too high during the scanning session.

2375,Catching a thief in a closed circle of people,"I am trying to investigate the issue with money getting lost form peoples wallets in a shared flat.  There are 4 suspects for being a thief of the money. Some of the suspects have been affected as well - the money was stolen from them. This complicates the issue, cause I believe, from the psychological point of view, some people may report that their money were stolen from them as well, just to get out of the picture. The question is - is there a psychological approach as to how to find the person behind this? Are there any methods how can one lead the conversation with the whole group to slowly navigate a thief to confess directly or indirectly through guiding questions or perhaps some bluffing? Are there signs of behaviour to look for when leading the discussion? "
2376,Study claims that human brain does not produce new brain cells?,"Neurogenesis is one of the most fascinating subjects to discuss. However, it seems like scientific community has difference of opinion about whether neurogenesis is possible or not in adult humans. The aim of my question is to gain insights about whether neurogenesis in adult humans is possible or not.  According to an article presented in Scientific American ""The Birth of a Brain Cell: Scientists Witness Neurogenesis"", Mirjana Maletic-Savatic, an assistant professor of neurology at Stony Brook University in New York State, claims that neurogenesis is possible. Her study is based on brain imaging and suggests that scientists ""witnessed"" neurogenesis and the birth of new brain cells in adult human brain.  However, on the other hand, there is a Californian study, reported on in ScienceNews ""Study casts doubt on whether adult brain’s memory-forming region makes new cells"", that claims that neurogenesis in adult humans does not exist.  Analyzing the study contradiction  These two studies contradict each other. One may try to reconcile these two studies by claiming that humans only produces new cells in only certain parts of the brain but not in other parts of the brain, including hippocampus. Hippocampus may not be able to produce more brain cells, but other parts of the brain may generate new brain cells. However, this explanation and the above mentioned study directly contradicts another study that was published by Berg D.A. et al., 2013:     active adult neurogenesis is confined to two distinct locations: the   subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles in the forebrain;   and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the   hippocampus    We can see that the Californian study contradicts the other study clearly when it comes to studying and analyzing neurogenesis in the hippocampus.  The question  This theory and the Californian study does not explain why people who suffer from memory loss in some parts of their lives regain memory and perform much better on memory tests.  If the hippocampus does not make new brain cells, then how do people regain memory by eating the right diet and exercising? Is neurogenesis possible in the hippocampus region of the brain?   Berg, D.

2377,Priming people with self-image/social-image concerns,"I have a hypothesis that if you prime people with self-image or social-image concerns, they will behave less anti-socially and more prosocially. For example, they litter less, they discriminate less against racial minorities, etc.  Are there any such studies examining this? If not, how can I prime people with self-image or social-image concerns? "
2378,"Validity of the ""Common Factors"" perspective","Research and practice in psychotherapy has been deeply influenced by two different approaches:   the Empirically Supported Treatments (ESTs) movement, due to the development of Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) attitude in the mental health field, and the Common Factors perspective, and the importance of common factors in the explanation of the therapeutic process.   These two different approaches are well described by Terence Tracey et al. (2003):     One view is that each model of therapy has distinctive effects on clients. This assumption of distinctiveness leads naturally to the inference that some models are more effective than others with particular client types      ...      A  competing and perhaps complementary view is that different theoretical approaches are comparably effective” (p. 401).     ESTs can be tested with randomised controlled clinical trials (Herbert,  2003; Morrison,  Bradley, &amp; Westen, 2003);, however there is a growth of studies about the “Common Factors” perspective confirming the notion that all therapies are equally effective — the so-called “Dodo Bird Verdict” (Luborsky et al., 2004; Luborsky &amp; Singer, 1975).  There is emphasis on the economic factors in play when looking at Evidence Based Medicine, and the current ""gold standard"" seems to be CBT, not just for anxiety disorders (Otte, 2011), but for everything. Yet, there are shortfalls with CBT and some say that the efficacy was artificially inflated.  While I can understand the standpoint of those who push for scientific scruitiny of psychotherapeutic approaches, as can be seen in Psychology.SE meta I am also a defender of approaches which have been denounced as purely pseudoscientific and therefore invalid.  Apart from what I covered in my answer in meta, and Sven Hansson's revision of his definition of pseudoscience (Hansson, 1996), are there other arguments, for and against, each side of the debate?

2379,"How can a country's IQ be different of 100, if the average IQ of a population is always 100?","In The Idiot Brain: A Neuroscientist Explains What Your Head is Really Up To, Dean Burnett write that:     ""the average IQ of a population is 100. Without exception. If someone says, “The average IQ of [country x] is only 85,” then this is wrong. It's basically the same as saying, “ The length of a meter in [country x] is only 85 cm”; this is logically impossible, and the same is true for IQ."" (cf [website]I think this is misleading. He is right to write that the average IQ of a population is 100 (as explained here). But it doesn't imply that it's ""wrong"" to say that “The average IQ of [country x] is only 85,”. If one takes the whole word population as the population then one can then calculate the average IQ of the people in a particular country.   But then if it's how countries' IQ are measured, why so few countries have an IQ above 100? There is only 15 countries with an average IQ of 100 or above (the max is 108), and so many countries are below 100, the lowest being 59. Even with China (representing about 20% of the world population) pulling the world average IQ closer to 100, the countries' IQ given on that page are not coherent with an aveage wold IQ of 100.   So how are the countries IQ measure? My question isn't about why the average IQ of a population is always 100 but about the discrepancies between countries. "

Affect seems to refer to conscious experience:     Affect is the experience of feeling or emotion.   And confusingly, so does feeling:     In psychology, the word is usually reserved for the   conscious subjective experience of emotion.   I realize that the definitions of emotion and mood are dicey as there are several different approaches (with corresponding definitions) in common use today.

2388,What bias is responsible for people perceiving immediate and sudden value over long time value delivery as more?,I have a scenario where people are receiving a massive value of not getting sick and dying in a relatively long period but not valuing it as much as short term solutions that make them feel better within shorter period with added risks.

2389,"Can compulsions be defined in a way that is independent of obsessions, culture, etc?","DSM-V defines compulsions (as part of OCD) and then adds a bunch of qualifications.  I wonder if we can define compulsions in a more objective way.  Compulsions are repetitive behavior/thoughts intended to reduce distress and/or prevent a potentially serious situation.  In this way they are different from other repetitive behavior, for instance, in autistic disorders.    But this definition alone does not seem to be enough to distinguish compulsions from socially sanctioned and justified rituals and activities, be it praying for hours, working 16 hours a day, or whatever.  In addition, when we talk about compulsive gambling, shopping, gaming, TV watching, studying, eating, whatever, about people feeling ""compelled"" to do things in a certain rather rigid and repetitive way, how are we defining compulsions?  Is it about reduced wilfulness (as in addictive behavior)?  Is it about how irrational the behavior is (though it's hard to decide logically how we should live our life, as even philosophers can differ on this point)?  And so on.    Thanks.   "

Lets define CNS arousal in the context of this question as the measure of gross motor activity measured by an actigraph in a given hour. A person with high arousal would display more intense and more frequent pattern of activity (any motion), while a person with less CNS arousal would exhibit smaller and less frequent motions.   Is there any correlation between the gross sum of body movement and choice of activity? Are people experiencing high CNS arousal more likely to engage in activities?  A related question is - if they are related, how are choice of activity and arousal give rise to each other? Does arousal cause choice of activity or does choice of activity influence CNS arousal? "
2399,Judgments of similarity between samples of writing,"I was thinking last night about the possibility of an experiment that investigates the factors contributing to peoples' judgments of 'stylistic similarity' between two samples of writing. For example, such an experiment might consist of multiple trials for each subject, each of which would present a different set of say 3 short excerpts of writing (text randomly sampled from a corpus of authors' writings... maybe no more than 500 words each). Each participant would be asked to make a judgment of either ""Which 2 of these writings are most similar in style?"" OR 'Which 2 of these writings were most likely created by the same person?"".

When I was in grade school, I often heard art teachers claim that they were ""not teaching us to draw or paint or sculpt... but teaching us to SEE"". From personal experience with human figure drawing, it appears to me that the most observable change that comes with practice in drawing the human form from observation is learning to pay attention to the most essential details.  My question: Is there any reason to believe that if we were to take a group of people who could be considered to have ""visual expertise"" (let's say they have years of experience with observational drawing), that we would find notable differences in the patterns of their eye movement traces when scanning an object such as the Nefertiti bust shown above... when compared with people who do not have such expertise?

Otherwise, what evidence and/or theory leads you to believe that it would be unlikely to observe such a difference? "
2402,Controlling for response bias in a forced choice memory task,"I want to present participants a pair of items [tex] and [tex], each with an association [tex] or [tex]. Later on participants will presented with the items singularly, and asked  'what was the association?'.  I'm interested in differences in their memory for the association, between levels of the association.   As I've specified it there is no way to separate differences in memory performance between levels from response bias, because being incorrect on association [tex] means that another response for association [tex] is recorded.  Signal detection methods seem to give me an overall measure of discriminability between the two and bias, but can't tell me if the bias is due to genuinely improved memory for [tex], or simply a predisposition to respond [tex].  What is the best way to deal with this?  Initial thoughts: I'm considering including previously unseen elements into the memory task and getting a measure of response bias that way.     Here is some random example data to help with thinking:  choice X | X    choice Y | X   choice Y | Y   choice X | Y    18               18         18              18        24               12         18              18    30                6         14              22        29                7         14              22  "
2403,"Do the students that report ""friendly"" teachers perform better on standardized tests?","I'll preface this by saying that I've been considering this question in light of the ""Summer of Love"" initiative and subsequent blog posts, which are looking at the extent to which comments are ""friendly"" on Stack Exchange.  Much of the impetus behind the movement is a commitment to treating new members better, and it's safe to assume that a majority of these new members are here for help in the process of learning something (e.g., programming, statistics, new software).  Comments can both set the tone while also being a means through which to deliver learning.  The actual Stack Exchange study is measuring the response of a third party to the comments made on the site, but, as more readily available system, I'd like to find out if a teacher who projects a ""friendly"" attitude positively affects the learning process.  Conversely, it's not ideal if a teacher uses ""unorthodox"" methods to motivate students (e.g., sarcasm), but controlling for all other factors, could these methods actually motivate some students to learn better?  While the analogy between educators, students, and Stack Exchange participants is far from perfect, is there support in the educational psychology literature for the notion that teachers reported by students as ""friendlier"" (on average) help those students achieve higher levels of performance on standardized tests and other evaluations?

We are gathering Information on different methods from relevant organizations etc. I want to be able to contextualize what we learn there.  Questions   What is a useful framework or model of how cognitive and other abilities develop in young children that can be used to understand their needs (not only the special ones) on a level that is not purely phenomenological? What is a useful framework to understand why certain trainings etc. are effective, in comparison with others? Are there any frameworks suited to an engineer with a basic understanding of neural networks and control theory as opposed to more qualitative psychological theories?   I'd be happy about pointers to texts relevant to my question. "
2407,Reproducible meta-analysis in psychology,"I am a big proponent  of reproducible data analysis. In particular, I like when researchers share documents in formats like Sweave and knitr which weave statistical output (e.g., text, tables, and graphs) into a statistical report.   I previously asked for examples of reproducible research of any kind on Stats.SE and for advocating articles in psychology. However, at present I'm particularly interested in complete examples of reproducible meta-analysis.  Meta-analyses involve a number of steps. Summary statistics and study information is extracted from source studies. Various transformations and steps are applied to the data (e.g., corrections for reliability, conversion from one statistic to another, etc.). Various models are tested; tables and graphs are produced. Some journals are requiring that researchers supply tables of data used (e.g., references used, summary statistics).  However, I can see meta-analysis as an area which could benefit from a more comprehensive reproducible approach: (1) it would permit greater inspection of specific methods used; (2) researchers could more easily build on the analyses used.  Thus, my questions:   Are there any complete examples of reproducible meta-analysis preferably in psychology or a related discipline? Is there any published advocacy for reproducible meta-analysis?  "
2408,What is the mechanism explaining the effect of a positive attitude on immune system functioning?,"It seems likely that a positive attitude can speed up the healing process. but I can't decide by what mechanism it would operate by.   Questions   Does having a positive attitude improve immune system functioning? If so, what is the mechanism by which this occurs?   Initial thoughts: Is it the inhibition of some sort of stress cortisol?  The answer seems like it would have to do with how the placebo effect or hypnosis suggestion functions. "
2409,Computational differences between spiking neural networks and previous ANNs,"This is an AI question regarding ""3rd generation neural networks"" - spiking neural networks (SNN).  I hve been studying this concept online from various papers, mainly Maass (1997). I and am not entirely sure I understand why SNN's are considered pulse-code in contrast to earlier ANN's which are rate-code.   I have background in neuroscience so I understand the terms and ratio, I am asking regarding the actual implementation.   Is the practical difference in the fact that when each neuron updates its current state in an SNN it deals with the entire history of every pre-synaptic neuron and not only the last step? Is that what gives it temporal characteristics which previous generation ANN's lack? What is the key computational difference between SNN and earlier approaches?  Notes  This question was migrated from SO, and a duplicate was asked on cstheory that was migrated to CS.SE. "
2410,Are there any personality theories that use the scientific method?,"Background  I have come across a number of personality theories. There are even disciplines of personality theories, dividing these theories according to the assumptions they are based upon. The most accepted/used theories seem to be Big 5 and Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). However, I assume these theories use traits to determine people's personality types too.  For example, the Big 5 traits seem to be of very limited scope. Also, measuring traits like introversion and extroversion using some random questions which have polar opposite choices seems to be a fitting into a box sort of thing. There seems to be no scientific method while testing to determine whether people fall into one region or other for all the defined traits.   By scientific determination, I mean one could use methods like the one laid out in ""Cerebral Blood Flow and personality: A Positron Emission Tomography Study"" to determine between, say, introversion and extroversion traits. I am not sure whether the other traits have such methods researched enough to distinguish between them.  Question   Are there any personality theories that are based purely on scientific grounds? Are there any existing personality theories (that are being researched) that could one day be backed up by scientific research? I think the Big 5 might come under this category, but any evidence to the above regarding any theory will be appreciated. Thanks!  "
2411,Do the Jungian Cognitive Functions/ Processes really exist?,"Background   Many of us must have come across personality theories like MBTI which use part of Carl Jung's concepts to make a theoretical system used to divide people into types. For example, MBTI says that if the person is not neurotic or something like that, then he/she must fall into one among the 16 personality types that have been defined. Over simplification of the MBTI over the Internet has made the base of this theory unknown to many people, but talking about that in this question helps nobody.  MBTI as taken by psychologists, seems to be centered more around the concept of Functions more than the four letter model. Typing a person is done generally after recognizing their Dominant function. Some psychologists seem to have made their own different models about these Cognitive Functions (like John Beebe and Lenore Thomson for example). Some claiming 8 exist in the human Psyche, and some claiming 4 exist, some saying they gradually develop, some opposing the views and so on...  Recently, I have come across a Youtube video in which a researcher claims to have made this theory scientifically observable and researchable - and seeing that this video has been made at Google Talks makes it believable.   I think Jung's concepts - which are based on observation, introspection, Energy flow etc. seem to be somewhat like Pseudoscience to any scientific mind. However, after watching this video I started to wonder whether what he says is really true or not?  Additional Material   An extract from Carl Jung's Psychological Types where Jung speaks about these types.  An online forum where each personality type profile exists as a sticky thread in its own subforum. These profiles use what seems like a modified version of the Cognitive Functions concept. EDIT: What Dario Nardi speaks about in the video is essentially an outline of what he published in his book. I have found a forum post where a summary of material he published in his book has been written. Please take a look at it if you don't have time to watch the whole video. Here's the link to the presentation he shows in the video (a pdf file).   Questions    Short version: Is the evidence quoted in the above source (the forum link) a valid evidence to support a concept like Cognitive Functions as described by Jung? Long version: There are two main things in the above source (the forum link) that I want someone to confirm as a proper evidence.    Firstly, as quoted by the source above, Nardi speaks about various regions in Neo Cortex region where he placed these EEG sensors. From what I have read, it seems that he mapped the regions to some activities.        Here's what he says about these regions is like:     Fp1 ""Chief Judge""  (is used when/to)         Provide a reason   Decide between options   Detect an error      Writing all of them here would make this question look like a book, but I want to know whether all this is as rigid as it looks or not. I want to know where Nardi is making a mistake in this research. (There could be some activities which might have been mapped wrongly, or those which have deeper mechanisms in brain rather than just in Neocortex region.)   Secondly, I will not be long here, but there is a similar part where he speaks about various patterns (in regions of brain ""lighting up"") he observed during this observation. Although asking for an evidence to this would be basically an extension to the first question, but my question here would be whether such patterns (not necessarily the same ones) have ever been classified/suggested in literature already?   Lastly, (this might be rhetoric question) if the answer to the above question is affirmative, Does this imply that theories like MBTI are really valid, and that there are really types among people's brains? (Nardi tried to map those patterns into types of people, as I said their dominant function) "
2412,Is the theory of Information Metabolism a reasonable scientific theory?,"Background  I have been checking out various personality typing assessments lately when I came across a Personality typing system known as Socionics which aims at explaining relationships between people of different types. It's based on some of Freud's ideas, Carl Jung's Psychological Types and Anthony Kepinski's theory of Information Metabolism.   Socionics uses a mixture of all the above to create its own sound theory about human psyche for each type of person. Socionics is considerably different from MBTI and other typing systems in its approach largely due to ideas from Information Metabolism.  While digging out more about Information Metabolism theory, I have found out that it implies things like information that is exchanged between people are like inputs and outputs from our brain. Socionics theory seems to extend this concept saying ""Psychological features such as attention, interests, memory and motivation are components of this theory of information metabolism"", because people differ in the way they process information.   Whether our brain really has parts corresponding to information elements like that is a different question, but I first doubt the scientific reason behind the theory of Information Metabolism. It seems to be based on Freud's ideas (which seem like mere observations), but yet on the other hand speaks about parts of brain.  Questions    Is this theory of Information Metabolism based on Scientific grounds? Are there any theories/research like Information Metabolism that has been developed or in development and is/are scientific? Does CREATES brainset model qualify to be one such in development? This may seem like a tangential question, but I will ask it because it's somewhat related: Do these Information Elements, provided they really exist, influence our facial expressions and body language while we interact with others?   The last question is to check out the validity of infamous Visual Identification used in Socionics communities for typing people by looking at them.  Other links   Wikipedia entry about Information Metabolism. (The resources in western community about Socionics and related theories are limited because the theory is largely developed in USSR and it looks like a counterpart of MBTI over there!)  A wiki about Socionics which has articles about the theory.  An excerpt from Carl Jung's Psychological Types which has been largely used in Socionics.  "
2413,Do the motivations and fears behind Enneagram have any scientific reasoning?,"Background  The Enneagram personality typing system defines set of motivations and basic fears for its nine personality types among people.  The system seems to be aimed at personal development of a person, and uses various approaches for the same (like one type integrating into other - which is essentially the person overcoming their basic fears using their motivations in a different manner etc.). For more info regarding the system, look here.  A large part of this system seems spiritual and based on very strange assumptions, but equally strangely - I don't know why or how - many people identify themselves with these basic motivations and fears in a way that doesn't seem like Forer effect - at least to me. The system is flexible enough that a person can identify his/her motivations towards one type and to some extent towards another type.  Questions   Are the motivations and fears for people listed in Enneagram typing system discussed in any other scientific theory about motivations among people? There doesn't seem to be much of Forer effect taking place because people seem to identify themselves and ""grow into other types"". If we assume people are basically overcoming their fears doing so, what is the scientific term/explanation for such a process?  Provided we have a flexible system here, people may develop in a more complex manner than by just overcoming their basic fears while integrating/dis-integrating into other type. What are people doing to themselves doing so?  "
2414,What makes people easily subscribe to pseudoscientific theories?,"There are many theories/disciplines that have been categorized as pseudoscience in the scientific community.  The list includes many things that are regularly even quoted in media like graphology, astrology, psychoanalysis, personality types, etc.   Questions:   What attracts people to such theories? Do any cognitive biases make people believe them easily? Which part of pseudosciences acts as a stimulus that triggers this cognitive bias? If there's a cognitive bias behind people believing in pseudoscience, knowing that a majority of the population does that – is there any term for such a phenomenon in social psychology? A majority of the population believes in some kind of pseudoscience. Does this signify an evolutionary aspect of our minds – that people are still evolving into better species that might one day believe in proper science? Pseudoscience seems to be older than science; correct me if I am wrong here.  "
2415,Does teaching a bird an artificial task like eating from a feeder hurt its performance in the wild?,Can training a wild animal through operant conditioning somehow cause the animal to forget or be unable to perform tasks which it had perviously learned?  Is it likely that training wild animals through operant conditioning would somehow cause them to be unable to learn or retain other skills? Or is that not how learning actually works?  Does teaching a bird an artificial task like eating from a feeder hurt its performance in the wild? 
2416,Which type of stimulus results in an optimal learning curve for rats and mice?,"When using operant conditioning to train mice or rats, what type of stimulus is most effective? For example, does a negative reinforcement of a loud noise have a more profound effect than a negative reinforcement of pain? What about for positive reinforcement? Is pleasure more powerful than food? Which type of stimulus is considered optimal for learning?  "
2417,What makes someones good at math (or anything)? Is all about practice and hard work?,Could mathematical and abstract thinking be acquired through hard work?  To have the same mathematical skill as a student who goes to Mathematical Olympiad seems quite impossible.  Could their skill be explained by some difference in their brain structure? Is their brain more math-oriented? 
2418,is it unconcious?,"Roughly speaking, I as well as some other people probably have observer following. (1) Sometimes ideas start to come to me out of nowhere, (2) then we sometimes analyze it further and either reject or accept some of these idea. My question is what are the terms for these two incidents:which part of me is responsible for generating these sometimes out of nowhere coming ideas, and which part of me is responsible for filtering and analyzing them? Why how these random ideas come from? "
2419,Are the images in our heads physical?,"I can think of a banana in my mind, and I can see it, it's there, but it's not really there at the same time. It doesn't feel physical, but for me to be able to see it, it must be physical, right? Are the images just a collection of neurons firing? "
2420,System 1 and unconsious,"Kahneman (2011) apparently suggests there is system 1 and system 2 in decision making.   If I am not wrong he says system 1 is more prone to errors because it is automatic. Is this correct assumption of mine?   If yes, next question I have is: Is system1 related to unconcious? If yes, then isn't there a conflict between above assumption and this one:       that unconscious thought (UT) is better at solving complex tasks,   where many variables are considered, than conscious thought.   So if UT is related to System 1, then doesn't it contradict Kahnemans view that System 1 is more prone to errors (because if it is prone to errors according to Kahneman how is it better at decision making according to Wiki)? Needless to say there are articles which don't agree with wiki article I linked. This one for example: Acker (2008).   References  Acker, F. (2008). New findings on unconscious versus conscious thought in decision making: Additional empirical data and meta-analysis. Judgment and Decision Making, 3(4), 292-303.  Kahneman, D. (2011). Thinking, Fast and Slow. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux "
2421,What thoughts should one contemplate to minimize sleep latency?,"While trying to fall asleep on night, I was wondering what my strategy would be if I was challenged to a competition where the goal was to fall asleep as fast as possible once I was lying in bed. The only degree of freedom would be thoughts. I.e., we assume I can't take a sleeping pill or exploit any other external factors (which are assumed to be averaged out).    What thinking strategies would likely yield the best results in terms of sleep latency? We're considering an average person here (i.e., not a person with special circumstances like insomnia or a biological predisposition/talent for falling asleep immediately).   That rumination will lead to the complete opposite effect has been documented in several studies (here's one among many) and is also intuitive. It has also been shown that gratitude reduces sleep latency. For me personally, imagining myself in cozy environments (e.g., a treehouse covered in moss) has been more effective than any other strategy (including mindfulness, trying to think about nothing, counting and others). The worst thought strategy for me was observing the process of falling asleep and I've never been able to fall asleep while in this mode of thinking (while I have been able to with heavy rumination in some cases).    Besides gratitude, have there been other thinking modes that have proven effective or are likely to be effective to minimize sleep latency? Perhaps there are other common themes in the positive psychology literature that pose likely candidates.  "
2422,Question about interrole conflict,"Katz &amp; Kahn defined the interrole conflict as a conflict between two roles that are incompatibles, or when more than one person has the same role.  I had a question today in an exam about role conflicts induced stress in the workplace and wondered if someone could shed some light about this.  Its a true/false question that goes like this:  A policeman is in a situation where he must rescue someone while risking his own security. This is an interrole conflict. (T/F)   I wrote false, because the question does not imply the policeman necessarily has other roles in conflict with this one. For example what if he doesn't have any family, any friends, etc.? But I ain't sure! Is simply being alive an implicit role? Is being healthy and in a state of security a role?  Isn't it more an intra role conflict then? In the sense his job probably doesn't ask for him having to put his own security at risk? I found this one quite difficult to answer.  I would like some opinions on this! I want to understand this correctly.  Thanks a lot for any help! "
2423,At what age a child would develop a sense of racism or a minority discrimination?,"I wonder if what happened with my son(6yo) is a matter of concern or just a coincidence.  I think I need to give a bit of background to help analyze what happened. We are an Arab family live in the UK, majority of my town is of European/Caucasian ethnicity, although there are few Arab families we know about, but we don't really communicate much. He is the only student who speaks Arabic in his class (there are Polish and maybe other European languages), I don't know about the rest of the school, but if I guess, there isn't in this school.  Me and him were in the car, I was looking for a place to park, and just went by a car park but it wasn't available for normal parking (contract parking). I said: We can't park here. He said: Why? Is it because we speak Arabic?  At the beginning I laughed, and told him there is no such thing, but couple of seconds later I was wondering, how would he develop such idea?  I know this might sound like a troll, but I swear that what really happened, and I am concerned if my son is facing any acts of racism/discrimination, maybe in the school. "
2424,Are there any official guidelines of person-centred therapy?,"I understand that the person-centred therapy is based on humanistic psychology.  Humanistic psychology is sceptical about the use of the scientific method to study human behaviour. Rogers (1965, p. 190) said that: 'it is the dedicated, personal search of a disciplined, open-minded individual which discovers and creates new knowledge ... no refinement of laboratory or statistical method can do this.'   Regarding this I understand that the research for humanistic is mostly qualitative and not quantitative.   What would you refer to as evidence/research for person-centred therapy? Is there any official manual for it?   Rogers, C. R. (1965). Some Thoughts Regarding the Current Philosophy of the Behavioral Sciences. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 5(2), 182–194. [website]"
2425,experimental design,How does a researcher come up with the number of experimental stimuli (e.g. number of targets and number of foils) for the experiment?   My supervisor told me there should be at least 8 items for the experimental condition. Is it a common practice?  
2426,How important is it to have a job that is aligned with one’s passion?,"Ever since I left high school I kept reading and being told that it was of great importance to look for a job that alignes with one’s passion. Brochures distributed by both high schools and universities were stressing the need to choose the right subject; and judging from newspaper articles even a new profession had appeared, namely the “carrier advisor”, who was supposed to help high school graduates find the job or course that was aligned with their talents and passions. While I can’t remember this explicitely stated, I have feeling that it was implicetly assumed that one’s passion was not subject to their conscious choice, rather it had been predetermined (by genes? environmental influences in early childhood? I don’t know), and so it was important that one correctly discovers what really interests them and what they are really talented at.  In the field of IT I kept hearing similar stuff. Namely, I witnessed quite a few times when an experienced programmer was straightly recommending someone to not continue pursuing qualifications in this field. The arguments were usually along the lines of this:     If you have to make yourself programming or learning to program, if you don’t program because you deeply love this work and wouldn't go for a higher paid job even if you had an opportunity - do yourself a favor and find a different job. If you like programming in your spare time, do yourself a favor and keep it as a hobby. Going to this profession because it is well-paid is a major misunderstanding. You will soon hate your job so much that the very thought of sitting in front of the computer again will make you want to vomit. You might even become a decent programmer, but you will never be a great one, and those are paid best – so you will not even be getting the proper money you want in exchange for your wasting of your health.   I remember university trainers also saying something similar, however, they were putting more emphasis on the need to have the proper innate talents.  So I kind of accepted the above as facts.  However, then I asked a man I know who is a psychologist and, as far as I'm aware, is highly respected in his field. To my surprise he told me something entirely contrary:     Go ask a miner if he has a deep passion for his job and if he loves it so much that he wouldn’t exchenge it for a more highly paid one even if he could. He will tell you, ‘F*** off, I do this because I have a wife and kids to feed, I hate my job!’ And yet the society needs miners. All this talk about the need to find a job aligned to one’s passions completely ignores the simple fact that the main purpose of having a job is not to fulfill one’s passions but to make a living. While it is good to have a job one also has a passion for, this is a secondary goal, only to be pursued after one has already achieved financial stability. Ironically, those who reject the opportunity to work at a stable, relatively convenient and well-paid job because they choose to pursue their dreams to be, say, musicians or athletes or any other high-risk occupation often fail and have to work in a lowly qualified, poorly paid, tiresome and inconvenient jobs that do not even give them opportunities to pursue their hobbies in spare time. I also do not believe that IT is any different – on the contrary, a passionless job in IT might provide one necessary foundations to start trying to requalify.   I must say I'm confused.  To add one last thing to the mix. In the Uni we were told that symbolic operations, commonly found in computer science, mathematics, programming, and the likes, are not what our brains evolved to and, therefore, they are painful for our brains and one has to force themselves to perform such operations; as opposed to e.g. pattern-matching our brains like to do and are good at. Thus, people usually do not like, do not want and will not perform symbolic operations unless this innate aversion is offset by necessity or rewarded by satisfaction.  I’m now left with 4 hypotheses, not sure which one (if any) is correct…   It is unconditionally necessary for a job to be aligned with one’s passions, otherwise their quality of life and satisfaction will suffer greatly. (But the miner example! – on the other hand, I remember having read that many people are farmers out of deep passion rather than necessity, so maybe it also applies to lowly qualified, physical labors?) A person may work physically without deep passion – this will be suboptimal but not unsustainable. As many people work at McDonald’s. However, highly qualified, intellectual work actually requires deep passion, because otherwise the subjectively felt urge to not work in this field and rather find something else to do may become unendurable. This requirement to have a deep passion for one’s work is a trait appurtenant to intellectual work that requires symbolic opperations, like mathematics, programming or science; a person may, however, do a more humanities-related intellectual work out of pragmatism rather than passion. The need to have a passion for one’s job is being over-emphasised regardless of the scope; it is first and foremost required to find any job that allows one to make a living and it is possible to work at such a job even without passion. Then, and only then, a passion may be pursued.   I suppose this topic had to be tackled by experts? What is the correct answer? "
2427,"What does it mean to ""accept my shortcomings""?","The need to accept one's faults and shortcomings; or accept oneself in whole, with all faults and shortcomings; or self-acceptance is being repeatedly stressed by psychologists.  However, I've always had problems with this. Whenever I was hearing something along the lines of ""acceptance is a necessary precondition of change"" from a professional therapists I would usually start arguing with him. This is what was reaching me:     To be able to change something in your life you must decide you want to change nothing.   So for example, an alcohol addict must decide he will continue drinking until he meets his grave in order to be able to stop drinking? This seemed to me to be either an oxymoron or a particularly twisted form of self-delusion.  Today I read in a newspaper an interview with a professional psychologist and dietician, who was criticizing people who oppose the promotion of self-acceptance among obese people. She elaborated that the dichotomy between obese people accepting their bodies and the fact that obesity is unhealthy and is a both personal and societal problem to be solved is a false one. She pointed out that people who think that way are thinking stereotypically, that this stems from lack of knowledge, that this is a way people cope with cognitive dissonances, etc etc. She claimed that according to research positive motivation is far better than negative motivation that stems from the society rejecting obese people and from obese people not accepting their bodies; instead, if the society accepts obese people and obese people accept themselves, we will take a step closer towards solving the problem of obesity. She explicitly claimed that this does not mean, contrary to a popular belief, that an obese people will not wish to lose weight.  Ah. So apparently, contrary to what I was understanding, ""acceptance"" in the mouths of psychologists does not mean ""decision not to change"". Then what does ""acceptance"" mean?  These are the definitions of 'accept' according to the Cambridge Dictionary:        to agree to take something   to say yes to an offer or invitation   to consider something or someone as satisfactory   to believe that something is true      Definitions 1-2 seem clearly not relevant here.  Definition 3 seems to me to be this exact faulty definition that I had in mind and that was preventing me from understanding was psychologists were really trying to communicate. For example, I suppose, the verb ""accept"" is used here in the same definition as in the sentence ""*The editorial board rejected Mr. Smith's paper two times already, but finally accepted the third revision for publication*"". So the paper had to be changed two times until finally it was deemed satisfactory and no longer in need of change.  Finally, definition 4, while not obviously inapplicable, nonetheless doesn't seem to be relevant here: I have feeling psychologists, when they are saying that obese people should accept themselves, don't actually mean ""obese people should stop deluding themselves into thinking they are thin"".  Therefore, what does a psychologist mean when they say ""acceptance"" or ""to accept""? "
2428,Separation of romantic and sexual attraction,"Occasionally I meet people who say that they are sexually attracted to X group of people (e.g. men) and romantically attracted to Y group of people, X and Y not being the same (Sometimes they overlap, e.g. a bisexual person who is only romantically attracted to people of the opposite gender,but sometimes not at all). Recently I got into an argument with a friend about to what extent this viewpoint (i.e. to what extent such separation is real vs. imagined) is supported by professional researchers and by hard data.  I found a variety of old articles regarding distinguishing between the different neurological and evolutionary bases for these being different separate systems:   ([website]([website]and a couple articles from Lisa Diamond which specifically address whether these two modes of attraction can diverge:   ([website]([website]In the lattermost article, Diamond argues in the abstract ""not only can humans experience these feelings separately, but an individual's sexual predisposition for the same sex, the other sex, or both sexes may not circumscribe his or her capacity to fall in love with partners of either gender.""  Diamond's work, being the work most directly addressing the question, seems to give a pretty direct answer - yes, this separation a real thing. The articles are very highly cited, making me think that this viewpoint is viewed favorably throughout the field.  However, my friend is not convinced and demands further evidence. I've had trouble finding more research or data that follows up on this topic one way or another. Is there more recent research or data on this question that follows up or supports Diamond's work? Diamond herself admits that she doesn't have much hard-data to draw upon at the time (over 15 years ago). "

2431,Is it possible to calculate d prime if no catch trials were done?,"I am new to Psychology, particularly the signal detection theory (SDT). Before understanding SDT, I performed an experiment to measure what speed difference between a subject's car and the front vehicle could a subject correctly percieve. But I ignorantly only tested subjects on 'signal + noise' trials, i.e. there always was a speed difference in each trial. There never was a catch trial (no speed difference). Thus, I can't estimate the false alarm rate. I only have the Hit and Miss rates for a given speed difference stimulus.  Can I still use SDT by any chance? Or the estimation of the 'threshold' of detectable speed difference my only option? "
2432,Can humans unconsciously realize that they are being sold?,"It is said in the marketing community that the order in which you present ""Price"" and ""Value"" in business propositions changes the consumer behavior.   It is said that when price is presented first, the customer goes into a ""is it worth it?"" kind of reasoning when looking at the price. And that when ""value"" is presented before price, the customer goes into ""Do I like this?"" kind of thinking.   I have to main questions:    Do you know of any scientific source for that framing? If it is actually a framing, would that mean that the customers can realize that they are being sold? That making them expect the value after seeing a price or expecting a price after being presented with the value.    At surface this question might look like a marketing question, but I am looking for a behavioral answer. Is there some specific biases or framings detected for this behavior?  Thanks "
2433,Can you prevent your biases from swaying your logic if you're aware of them?,"As in the title.  Assuming you are aware of all your biases,and how they interact with your ideas, can you foresee how your biases will warp your judgement or logic, and stop that from happening?   Living a bias free life sounds like a lot of work though, my curiosity is simply in knowing if it would be possible to do so with the necessary knowledge, or if there is some sort of bias-avoiding killer hidden somewhere in the brain.  It looks like similar questions have been asked before, but none literally answer mine. Introspection Illusion, IF it affects you only when comparing yourself to others, then it's of no obstruction to my question.  Superficially, the Introspection illusion doesn't look like a roadblock if all you're considering is ""I know i like strawberries. I like no other fruit i tried, so if given the choice between strawberries and other fruit i tried, i will always pick the former.""   The Bias Blindspot, superficially doesn't look like a negative answer to my question either.  Confirmation Bias is a good candidate for a negative answer. ([website]Here ([website]If i may use myself as an example, i get slightly sick when i am typing biased arguments or fallacious ones, usually before i actually write them out, but sometimes the revelation of bias comes to me later on. One example was one time i was talking about abuse, and having been the target of some types of abuse, i recognised beforehand (Because i was getting sick after predicting where my conclusion was going), that i was about to say that all abuse is equally damaging, but only based on my experience, and not on hard data or some experiment's conclusion. My experience was blinding my conclusion and i noticed, but can you do that with every bias out there?  I definitely don't think of myself as avoiding all bias just because very often i feel sick during debates or essays. When i have the information, i can also reliably predict my future behaviour, and if i can't, i just say ""I don't know"". It would still be useful to know if some research which i can't access because i'm a mere layman said anything about it. "
2434,Are introverts actually very anxious people with detail focus?,People seem to think that introverts are calm people but I have experienced that many introverts easily get anxious  about details. I found this: [website]Are introverts actually very anxious people with detail focus? How am I supposed to read this research?  
2435,Psychology of guessing number of objects,"Someone I know is a pretty good guesser. One day we had a guessing contest, and went around the house guessing how many objects were in different containers.   I was surprised that I was outperformed every single time, and the other person guessed faster than I did every time as well. For example the person I was competing against guessed correctly, after taking less than five seconds to think, that a container had 218 marbles in it. This individual continued to perform consistently, test after test.  The person's accuracy rate over [tex] different tests was about [tex] percent, and [tex] percent for objects with over [tex] objects and less than [tex] objects.  What is the psychology of a person being able to accurately guess the number of objects in a container? Are there any neuro-correlates for this ability? Is there a certain time frame that one should guess in and not overthink too much?  I googled ""the psychology of guessing objects"" and didn't find anything useful. But I did find that as the number of objects increases, the accuracy tends to decrease linearly.  My own thoughts on the matter are:   1) It might have been a lucky day for the guesser.   2) They guessed with relatively few objects in the containers. If we had guessed with 500 or 1000 objects I think he or she would have seen a linear decrease in accuracy. "
2436,"Is it hard to change people's beliefs without resorting to marketing techniques? And if so, why?","Background:      Dale Carnegie was the developer of famous courses in   self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking,   and interpersonal skills. He was the author of How to Win Friends and   Influence People (1936), a massive bestseller that remains popular   today.   The thesis explained in the book are really well synthesized in the Wikipedia page.     Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. Give honest and sincere   appreciation. Smile. Remember that a person's name is, to that person,   the sweetest and most important sound in any language. Be a good   listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Talk in terms of   the other person's interest. Make the other person feel important –   and do it sincerely.   The strategies don't talk about telling the truth, presenting rational arguments, and citing the sources.  Cognitive Psychology explains the reasons behind this:   Confirmation bias Backfire Effect self-serving bias Rationalization Cognitive dissonance    All of these terms suggest that changing people's ideas requires an effort in a direction that is not rational.  Question   Why is it hard to change other's people beliefs? Is it true that marketing strategies are more effective than rational argument in changing other's beliefs?   Refer also to:   Why are most people not persuaded by rational arguments? Which is the scientific name of stubbornness? Why isn&#39;t psychotherapy more direct with patients? How to refer to the phenomenon of people only absorbing evidence which confirms their beliefs?  "
2437,How does the body experience free-fall during a hypnic jerk,"Today I learned that a sudden jerk that you sometimes experience when you are just about to fall asleep due to a sense of free-fall or weightlessness is called a hypnic jerk.    If, while sleeping, I roll over to the edge of the bed, I feel free-fall &amp; jerk up from sleep if I am about to topple down. But in case I am comfortably lying down in the middle of the bed with no chance of toppling down, how do I feel weightlessness or free-fall when I am just about to fall asleep and jerk up, i.e. hypnic jerk? And not just on the bed; this is also experienced if you are sleeping on the ground where u cannot possibly physically fall.    A bit more research in Falling sensation  tells me its the ears &amp; the eyes that sense the free-fall.       Sensation of falling can be induced when the eyes detect rapid   apparent motion with respect to the environment.     How is this accounted for during sleep. Or is it something entirely different? "
2438,"Is there a scientific definition of ""fairness""?","The concept of fairness, in my opinion, is somehow defined by the concept of empathy through some searches by Daniel Goleman in his book Social Intelligence.   The book deals with scientific measurement through MRI.   Ethic and Moral are also trying to define what is fair.   Can you give me some hint achieving a definition of what is fair?   i.e. why killing people, slavery, exploiting are not fair stuff? "
2439,Sense of time: Evaluation and correlation with psychological traits and states,Some of us are often in hurry and always late. Some make mistakes while evaluating time-needs for tasks. How is our sense of time connected with our personality? Is it more correlated with the process we are involved in? How we can develop this sense so to make more of our time?  
2440,Why (and how) do people seek acknowledgement?,"I don't think I need to give evidence that people do seek acknowledgement; if it's not from parents, it's from lovers or friends. It can be things as big as life ambitions/achievements (e.g. 'I will support your dreams are!', to smaller things like acknowledging you understand ('I understand what you're going through').  Possible pointers:   What makes us seek acknowledgement? (evolutionarily-wired or socially-induced) What is the process that turns this acknowledgement into a good feeling?   I've come across a lot of blogs and opinions, I am interested in seeing if there's any scientific research on this. "
2441,"Is it possible to induce the processes that occur during sleep such as memory ""garbage collection"" without actually sleeping?","Some time ago I opened a question comparing drug withdrawal and sleep deprivation symptoms.  In fact, my main objective for that question was to know if there was by any chance, a possibility to live without sleeping.  I got a good answer for the “Why we need sleep?” question, mentioning all the injuries that its deprivation causes.  So here are my current questions :   What really happens in our brain during sleep that makes us feel much more ""light"" when we wake up and that its deprivation kills us? Is it memory cleanup? Is there any research done on the reproduction of those “cleanup” processes without sleeping?  "
2442,Could an ethic stating that everyone should care about himself go into justifying exploitment?,"Let's assume that one man has the following belief:  1) Everyone has to take care of himself; it's not mandatory for people to be nice and good, it's mandatory to defend ourselves from others and to avoid letting the others exploit us.  The first time he will need to rationalize one of his egoistic behaviours to avoid guilty feelings, the thought could become:   2) No one is guilty if he exploits someone, since he should not let me exploit him.  Is there a correlation between the first and the second beliefs?  Further explanation of  what I'm wondering: in some way the first belief can be considered similar to assertiveness. It's a mantra about putting effort in every action of our life, going out of the comfort zone, and so on. The second instead is, in my opinion, a degeneration of the first thought, which is rationally prevented mostly by empathy.   Since the lack of empathy can result to disorders, is it correct to state that holding the second belief increases the likelihood that a person would be diagnosed with a disorder like psychopathy? "
2443,What are the differences between Asperger's Syndrome and Schizoid Personality Disorder?,"They are specifically listed as two separate disorders in the ICD, but what are the differences between Asperger's Syndrome and Schizoid Personality Disorder?   Since both result in a withdrawal from social situations, the two can seem quite similar to an outside observer; is there any accurate method used to distinguish between the two in a subject? "
2444,Can attention be improved to reduce the frequency of mistakes?,"There is a class of error that is sometimes colloquially referred to as ""not paying attention"". These are the sorts of error where the subject knows the correct way to perform a task, but fails to follow it due to a lapse in whatever mental process is responsible for ensuring that actions are carried out according to intention.  Some examples are:   A mathematically competent adult solving an advanced math problem incorrectly because of a simple arithmetic mistake, such as 5+3=15. A well-prepared student getting a multiple choice question wrong because it was asking ""which of the above are not true"", but she mistakenly selected the ones that are true. A skilled roboticist damaging an expensive circuit because he accidentally wired the components incorrectly. Mixing up two terms which refer to different things, despite understanding very well the concept that either term refers to. Typos and simple grammar errors.   Note that I do not necessarily mean attention in the sense of being able to concentrate on and pay attention to a topic. I am specifically talking about the ability to not make mistakes (where mistakes are simple errors, which the subject is capable of recognizing as errors, but happens not to in that particular instance - not errors committed because of imperfect knowledge, understanding, or reasoning). Thus, ""mistakes"" are:   Not reproducible: If the subject is asked to repeat the task, they will probably do it correctly. Unrecognized: The subject believes that the task was completed correctly, until explicitly checked. Paradoxical: If asked about how the task should be performed, the subject answers correctly - but occasionally fails to perform as described. Mental: The mistake is not due to failures in fine motor control but has to do with the output of the mind. The mistake may be due to incorrect interpretation of sensory stimulus, but not due to an overt corruption of the stimulus itself (a person with good vision ""misreading a word"" in a brightly lit room from a black on white page with a suitably large font counts, but trying to read by starlight on a moonless light doesn't).   So, my question: Is there scientific research dealing with ""attention"" in this sense (ability to make few mistakes)? What factors influence it? Can it be trained, or is it an innate, invariant quality of a person that can only be accepted and accommodated?  Also, I am asking specifically about ""healthy and normal adults"", not disorders such as ADHD (unless the pathology helps elucidate the healthy case). As the saying goes, to err is human - but some humans err more than others, and I am interested in understanding why (and what strategies are available to reduce this tendency).  (edited from my original question on Academia.SE) "
2445,Are most self-help books properly rooted in cognitive sciences?,"The following books are explained from a cognitive sciences perspective and rely strongly on psychology or sociology.    Self-help books  Dale Carnegie - Social Intelligence (empathy, emotional intelligence) Wayne Dyer - Your Erroneous Zones No more Mr. Nice guy Dale Carnegie - How to win friends and influence people  Books about Seduction  The mystery method    For example one of the books about seduction speaks of Pavlovian conditioning. Additionally, even though they don't often use words like ""rationalization"" the books are often written by psychologist.  Are these books classified as psychology books?  Further clarification  Under the name of Cognitive Sciences are going a lot topics.  From very low level science to more applied. But the books I've cited are at a very high level (and since that also less verifiable). This kind of stuff is still classified as ""applied psychology"" or something like that?  They don't deal with stuff like ""rationalization"" but with the consequences of it. (i.e. childish behaviour, assertive behaviour, seduction, manipulation, conditioning, emotions, self-esteem handling, NLP, and so on..) "
2446,Increasing the quantity of something which is initially good will always lead to an excess?,"Take this sentence from a psychological article on wikipedia about the comfort zone:     However, White (2009) also observes that if the work of Robert Yerkes   (1907) is considered in which he reported 'Anxiety improves   performance until a certain optimum level of arousal has been reached.   Beyond that point, performance deteriorates as higher levels of   anxiety are attained', if a person steps beyond the optimum   performance zone they enter a ""danger zone"" in which performance will   decline rapidly as higher levels of anxiety or discomfort occur.   In this case, scientific evidence are suggesting that anxiety initially improves the performance but when it raises it has the opposite effect. Since that the word ""excess"".  Sometime is really less intuitive that a raise of something which is initially good will become un-optimal.   An excess of perfectionism could lead to OCD and to an anankastic disorder. See: Is perfectionism related to OCD?  But it's very less intuitive. Starting from this consideration, at an intuitive level, I would guess that every good thing when applied and applied will become suboptimal.  (*)The concept of ""too-much"" and ""excess"" is already bound to the consequence and applies only when there are negative consequences.   Is it a generalizable result that very often the complete lack of something or the excessive presence of it can lead to problems? "
2447,Does taking a deep breath reduce the experience of stress and negative emotions?,"Sometimes when I have negative feelings, it seems that a deep breath resets these feelings. Does that really happen? Is there any research on the effect of taking a deep breath on reducing the experience of negative emotions? "
2448,"What do we call the ""middle"" variables in a complex research model?","Basic theory building goes like this: you create a theory which has an independent variable and a dependent variable. I have also been taught to use ""explanatory variable"" as synonym for ""independent variable"" and ""goal variable"" and ""response variable"" as synonyms for ""dependent variable"". Then you do empirical research and measure the connection strength, or find out that there is no connection after all :(   As this is rarely complex enough for theories in disciplines where humans are involved, there is also the option to create a multivariate model, where many independent variables will explain a dependent (or goal) variable. There, the terminology is still unambiguous.   But many models from recent publications are more complex than this. Consider this path model:     Continuance intention seems to be the goal variable, because it doesn't lead to any other variables. Interaction and User value are certainly independent variables in this model, because they don't depend on others. But what are Satisfaction and Flow experience? They depend on lots of other variables, but they are not our goal variable, because this model is about Continuance intention, not about Satisfaction or Flow experience.   So, what is the proper terminology for such variables stuck in the middle of a multi-level model?

2449,Does high IQ give cause to doubt an ADHD diagnosis?,"My friend was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but her parents disagreed with such a diagnosis on the grounds that she had a high IQ which was discovered when her psychologists and psychiatrists were investigating what mental illnesses she may have had.  Edit: There was medicine prescribed, but she and her mother can't remember the name of her prescribed medicine.  I thought back to that when reading this:     Myth #10: Kids with ADHD won't amount to anything.      Many famous artists, scientists, and politicians had ADHD as children.   Here's a list of some well-known celebrities with ADHD:   It seems to me based on that and the things I've heard that people think ADHD in children causes poor academic performance, but the myth is that such poor academic performance is suggesting that said children ""won't amount to anything"".  So, people don't think that children with ADHD can be geniuses?  Expansion: Is it, however, also a misconception (whether as prevalent as a myth or not) that people who are thought to have mental illnesses instead are geniuses or something like that?  By genius I mean someone with a high IQ. "
2450,How do neurons decide how to alter their output signals?,"In computer science, neural networks are trained using backpropagation and other methods. Backpropagation heavily relies on mathematical formulas to describe how the weights should be changed throughout the network to effect the final output of the system. Biological neurons need to be able to adjust as well, if I'm not mistaken. What happens within a neuron to cause it to adjust its output? In other words, are biological neurons ""trained"" and if so, what is the process behind it? "
2451,"According to Yalom, what mental disorders are caused by inefficient anxiety coping strategies?","Irwin D. Yalom is a famous existential psychotherapist who's sporting his own theory about human psychology. Based on psychdynamics, he's stating that questions and thoughts pertaining to death, freedom, meaninglessness, and existential isolation lead to anxiety. Further, when it comes to psychopathology, he states (page 110 of his book Existential psychotherapy) that his theory     as do most paradigms of psychopathology, on the assumption that   psychopathology is a graceless, inefficient mode of coping with   anxiety.   Now, I'm trying to figure out whether he views all kind of psychopathology this way, and indeed what he thinks counts as psychopathology in the first place. I recon he's not talking about things like for example autism or psychopathy (even though I haven't found any passages where he explicitly excludes these), but what about diagnoses such as schizophrenia?   For Yalom, where does one draw the line between mental illness caused by inefficient coping strategies for anxiety, and brain disorders that simply are due to other reasons? "
2452,Parasite that takes over cognitive functions,"I am testing an idea for a book. The backbone of the story is that there exists a parasite that can enter the brain of a creature and take over its cognitive functions. I imagine that it could wire itself in some central part of the brain or neural system, but I am not an educated physician. Let us assume that the being infested is a human. I would like some input:  1) Is this at all possible? I know it is possible with parasites that infest insects.  2) What area of the brain/neural system would it have to take over, or how at all could this happen?  3) The parasite just hijacks the brain, does not destroy it. If it decided to retreat, how much of the information/memories acquired during the infestation period could it carry with it? How much of the events happened during this period would be accessible to the subject after retreat?  4) If we assume a parasite that itself has some cognitive ability, and does not act just out of infestation instinct, how large would it have to be in order to be able to have its own (even basic) thoughts, and retain memories of the subject?  I would appreciate any input on these questions, and any related thoughts you might have.  This question has been put on hold because answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise. With all due respect to the hard work of the moderators, I have to disagree. To begin with, all answers to all questions and even the questions themselves are exclusively opinion-based. Otherwise we would have to assume that there really is any truth that can be objectively be known and agreed upon. No one has ever been able to prove that anything besides our consciousness exits. But if even we have to tone down our agnostic perspective (why do we have to do that?) if you mean that there is not (in the world that you believe you perceive) enough evidence and research to support informed answers, then again this is not right. A user replied with an example of something like this occurring (evidence) and another with a very elaborate answer with examples and cited references to how something like this could happen. I strongly believe that more informed answers can come through. "
2453,How does it come about that specific areas of the brain are associated with specific functions?,"During the development of the human brain, specific areas come to perform specific functions. How (and when) does this differentiation come about?  Presumably, some areas of the brain naturally take on a function that is based on their physical proximity - for example, the visual cortex is the brain area directly connected to the optic pathway. Hence from a developmental perspective, it is natural for it to take on the role of processing visual information.  However, the production of language, for example, could potentially take place in any area of the brain adjacent to the auditory cortex. So how does it come about that it typically always gets processed in Wernicke's area?   Is it predetermined genetically? And if so, how? (pre-mapped synapses?) Or is it determined later through some kind of learning process?  And if so, what is the explanation for the similarity of brain maps between individuals?  "
2454,Gratitude and Affection," If a person X has gratitude towards person Y, will that cause bias of affection for X towards Y ?

2455,Why do I forget important things and remember things that I don't care about?,"Why do I forget things that I want to remember? And when I forget them, I seem to remember small details that aren't so important.  I might forget what the main topic of a YouTube video is, but I can remember what the guy who was talking in the video looked like.  I might forget where I left off when I'm working on the computer, but I can remember a time when Microsoft Word auto-corrected my spelling.  This has happened many times. I recall unimportant details and forget the important things. Everyone will recognize this for sure, for example when studying topography, you know which number accompanied the city, but you can't recall its place on the map during the exam.or you can remember which chapter and section number the question is explained in, but you dont't know the answer.  My question is why is memory selective in storing sometimes irrelevant details and discarding important things? "
2456,What are the consequences of prolonged cognitive dissonance?,"We know that situations that induce cognitive dissonance cause a variety of interesting behaviors in humans.

Are there any known cases from history or animal experiments where humans or animals were subjected to prolonged cognitive dissonance? If so, what happened in those cases? "

2458,How does one respond to an ADD/ADHD diagnosis of one's self or one's child?,"I read:     Is ADHD even a thing?       This kind of question can be offensive to some. The same kind of thing   can be applied to other conditions:      Is depression even a thing? Or are they just lazy? Is gender disphoria   even a thing? Or have they just sexually confused? Is homosexuality   even a thing? Or are they just a deviant? Is otherkin even a thing? Or   are the just a teenager looking for a unique identity?   Apparently, there is much controversy over ADHD, according to Wiki (not enough reputation)  Part 1:  What is a diagnosed person to do? How does one evaluate methods used by a doctor? How does one evaluate if prescribed medicine and dosage is right or at least not severely wrong?  I'm guessing initial prescription, if any, is going to be experimental. From there we see if dosage needs to increase or decrease or if medicine needs to be changed or stopped. How then should one evaluate a doctor's decision?  Part 2:  Why not controversy over depression? Bipolar? Schizophrenia?  Some psychologists seem to believe ADD/ADHD is a myth. Is there any truth to such?  The blog also points out how homosexuality was wrongly considered a disorder. How do we know ADD/ADHD won't turn out like that? "
2459,How much communication is -really- verbal?,"It is often said that only a small part of our daily communication is through words, sometimes accompanied with claims that X% is through words, Y% through body language, Z% facial expressions, etc.  However, several studies show that introverts and extroverts communicate differently.   Several studies show that introverts are more precise and effective at giving information with their communication. At least 1 study shows that extroverts use more body language than introverts. At least 1 study shows that extroverts use more eye-contact than introverts.   Based on this I am certain that communication style can be used as a cue to personality traits. So I'm looking for studies that could tell me several correlations on this at the same time. A study that can tell me correlations like these:   The correlation between Big 5 traits and communication through body language? The correlation between Big 5 traits and communication through eye contact? The correlation between Big 5 traits and verbal communication? The correlation between Big 5 traits and tone of voice/vocal pitch?

2462,How common is the form of amnesia depicted in fictional works?,"There are any number of movies and television shows based on some variation of the same premise:    A character suffers some sort of mishap (the most frequent mishap being a bump on the head), which renders them incapable of remembering who they are.  They assume a new life, often as someone totally different from their former self, hilarity ensues, and eventually, they are cured of their affliction.  The premise is so common that it has become a trope.  Examples include the Goldie Hawn/Kurt Russell vehicle Overboard, the movie Muppets Take Manhattan, and too many episodes of television shows to count.  How common is this form of identity amnesia in the real world?  How often does someone forget everything about who they are? "
2463,What is the mechanism behind one's fascination in a topic or subject?,"I've been reading about saliency and wondering about its relationship to human interests, particularly hobbies or fields of study. I am thinking that there are typically patterns in what kinds of things humans enjoy spending their cognitive resources on.  My first question: What is the mechanism behind one's fascination in a topic? Are 'personal interests' related to the incentive saliency in reward-prediction? If so, how? For example, might we choose to explore topics that we are naturally good at, under the (perhaps unconscious) assumption that we might be rewarded for what we can produce from our efforts, thus increasing incentive and interest in the topic? Or, if there is an incentive, would it mostly be a cultural one?  My second question: is there scientific evidence to support that females are more 'naturally' interested in human endeavors / abstracting within the real of human nature, whereas men are more 'naturally' interested in objects / abstracting outside the realm of humanity?  Note that I'm primarily interested in what facilitates interest in concrete topics, and less interested in the mechanisms behind human attraction, unless they are relevant to how interest in concrete topics is formed.

2464,Are Sex Offender Treatment Programmes (SOTPs) effective?,"Background to my question on SOTPs  NOMS is the UKs National Offender Management Service, which is now called Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service.  If you look at the UKs official website on Offender Behaviour Progammes (OBPs) run by Her Majesty’s Ministry of Justice, it states     There is growing international evidence that the type of cognitive-behavioural techniques that NOMS accredited programmes apply are the most effective in reducing offending behaviour; evidence Fact Sheets are available from Interventions Unit.   Trying to find these fact sheets is difficult, but a document titled Suitability for Accredited Interventions (NOMS, 2010) has the following on page 5.       A number of offenders are either diagnosed with Personality Disorder or present complex needs linked to their risk. The degree of complexity may prevent them from engaging fully with a shorter programme or may make shorter interventions inadequate. In this instance, a referral should be considered for a Democratic Therapeutic Community (DTC).      Participation in a DTC can occur at any point during the sentence, depending on the needs of the offender. Some will benefit from completing shorter programmes, such as ETS/TSP first to support responsivity and engagement in the DTC. Other offenders may find the therapeutic community approach can prepare and support participation in future high-intensity offence-focussed interventions, if applicable. DTCs currently exist in the Category B and C closed prison estate.      Further information on DTCs can be found at Appendix D.   Appendix B (Page 45) covers all the tyes of SOTP in detail  Appendix D (Page 65) states     Democratic Therapeutic Communities (DTCs) (Custody)      Democratic TCs provide a living-learning intervention for offenders whose primary criminogenic risk factors need to be targeted whilst simultaneously addressing psychological and emotional disturbance.   This is followed by details of the risk assessments required, including a     Sexual Offences Attitude Questionnaire (Hogue &amp; OBPU) (for male sex offenders only)   and the questionnaire     can be used independent of whether the victim or victims were male or female, adult or child. (Hogue, 1994)   My Question  Apart from what I mentioned above, I found the following:   a study (Wakeling, et al., 2007) covering UK SOTPs by evaluating participants’ experiences using both qualitative and quantitative methods.The authors state that     SOTP staff from the establishments conducted the interviews, most of whom were involved within treatment delivery. Participants’ responses may therefore have been more positive than they would have been if an   independent party had interviewed them.  Beech, et. al. (1998) again used offender questionnaires!     Two approaches were used to evaluate treatment impact. The first approach examined the extent to which treated child abusers showed statistically significant changes in their levels of denial, pro-offending attitudes, and social competency/acceptance of accountability. Using this approach it was found that both shorter (80 hours) and longer treatment groups (160 hours) were effective in producing statistically significant reductions in these areas   The second, and more sophisticated, analysis considered to what extent the child abusers had, by the end of treatment, a ‘treated’ profile.    Are there any studies which evaluated effectiveness using data on reoffending rates?  A study on Californian programmes (Marques, et al. 2005) states that:     The study was a randomized clinical trial that compared the reoffense rates of offenders treated in an inpatient relapse prevention (RP) program with the rates of offenders in two (untreated) prison control groups. No significant differences were found among the three groups in their rates of sexual or violent reoffending over an 8-year follow-up period.   Has there been any further evaluation, and is this the same with the UK SOTPs and the rest of the US?  References  Beech, A. et al. (1998).

2465,systems of thinking - how to relearn,"According to Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow), we have two types of thinking:  I. fast, instinctive and emotional II. slower, more deliberative, and more logical   I found interesting Kahneman's remark that IQ score represents a person's System II ability (it does not measure System I nor the subject's ability to apply them appropriately).  I assume that it is possible to prioritize the System I early on in one's life because it is a fast way to the end. (Example: In elementary/high school Maths, many tasks can be solved somewhat intuitively since they are simple reoccurring problems. And instead of real deep understanding of the rules, the problems can be solved by application of problem-solving patterns. This applies especially to situations when competition is promoted, thus speed is rewarded.)  Now, Is it possible (how?) to (re)train oneself to apply more of the System II? "
2466,How does one escape learned helplessness?,"I've been researching learned helplessness lately, an idea that seems to be responsible for much of the negative behavior observed in humans. Basically, the idea is that once repeatedly exposed to an inescapable pain, a subject learns to accept the pain even when it becomes avoidable.  This was first described by Martin Seligman who observed such behavior in dogs, who, upon being placed in a box that would shock them at random times and then moved to a box where the shock could be escaped by jumping over a barrier, refuse to even attempt to jump the barrier to escape, whereas dogs that could stop the shock in the first box with a lever would easily jump the barrier.  In all my research, however, it seems that the ""learned helplessness"" could only be unlearned by manually moving the dogs' legs to simulate the behavior to overcome the obstacle. However, in humans, such helplessness situations are often very abstract, for example the idea that no matter how hard one works they will never be able to escape debt, or pay their taxes. In such cases, ""manually moving people's legs"" is anywhere from extremely impractical to impossible. Does this mean that human learned helplessness is most cases is insurmountable?  How in the case of abstract helplessness conditions can human learned helplessness be escaped? "
2467,"Cognitive Bias, illusory truth effect: its effects on Software Engineers","I have been trying to understand how illusory truth effect creates problems for Software Engineers. I have found research on  the effects of other cognitive biases (e.g. representativeness, availability, etc.) have on Software Development, but none of them mention anything about illusory truth effect.   Does any such research exist? Can anyone guide me? "
2468,"In TD learning, is the weight function used as a linear filter?","In the Temporal difference learning algorithm (TD-learning), an agent seeks to predict the total value of future rewards that will be received during the current trial. The agent updates the prediction as the trial progresses, based on conditioned stimuli (CS) that have been seen so far. Specifically, the prediction is calculated as a weighted sum of the intensities of past CS presentation. At time [tex], the prediction is calculated as   [tex]  where [tex] is the prediction at time [tex], [tex] is the CS intensity at time [tex], and [tex] is an array of weights.  My question is: why are we summing the terms [tex], rather than [tex], i.e. why isn't each weight associated with the CS strength at a particular time?  [Thanks to user honi's reply, I subsequently understood that each element of the weight array is associated with an elapsed time since seeing the CS. For example, [tex] is the weight given to the CS strength experienced three units of time ago.]    [Original phrasing of the question: I am reading Theoretical Neuroscience by Dayan and Abbot, and I am confused by the use of [tex] in equations (9.6) and (9.7). In the former, it is a window function (linear filter) and in the latter it is the weight function. Is this (a) an unfortunate use of the same name for two different things, or (b) is the weight function really used as a linear filter to calculate [tex]?] "
2469,"In psychiatry, what does double-bookkeeping mean?","TL;DR What does double bookkeeping mean? +1 for sharing stories about your Tappy  Tappy (Talbott) has always been a tad odd, but who'd blame him, right? The guy took a whole bunch of tropane delieriants, then locked everyone out of his apartment, flipping out for reasons unknown, then in all the chaos, seriously cut an artery on the side of his head.  Now, Tappy tells me that one term he picked up from his $350/hr psychiatrist is the concept of ""doublebookkeeping"" ... My impression is that it has to do with   From wiki:     Double Bookkeeping. The tendency, among those who experience delusions, to perceive reality and the delusions as both being real, while remaining unbothered by the discrepancy or inconsistencies between the two.   Isn't this description the same as the concept of reality testing? You may have weird things go on all around you, but it's not so much as ""aliens are inserting thoughts into my mind as it is just merely a more open-minded approach to one's phenomenology: ""It would appear as though..."" ""aliens are doing this to me   So, within the context of psychistry, mental-health, or psychology, how might one interpret the term doublebookkeeping?   Does it relate, if even only thematically, to the actual accounting concept of of double-entry bookkeeping? My alternative interpretation is that it means ""take the raw crazy inside your head"" (""insanity""), run it through a cultural appropriateness filter, process, shake, dress it up for mainstream consumption, and then release: hello outsanity.  Or, do you reckon Tappy lied to me just to sound cool?  "

2471,Jung's Anima and Neurological Basis in Split-Brain Patients; Left-Persona and Right-Anima,"So, having skimmed some studies on split-brain patients, it makes me wonder about the whole ""left-brain/right-brain"" dichotomy that made its rounds in public perception some time ago.  I'm not sure how much of that is really good science, but it looks like there's some real truth to the different sides taking on different roles and cognitive abilities.  One thing in particular I wonder about now, is can you map Carl Jung's concept of Anima (I'll refer to the Anima, but what I have to say applies to Animus, as well) onto the right half of the brain?  Jung's idea of Anima was essentially the male brain's mental image of ""the typical woman"". Thus it would posses typically feminine traits.  Since the right half of the brain is associated with creativity, emotional response to (ie, recognizing) faces, and is more typically ""feminine"", would it be possible to devise an experiment with MRI to see if invoking the anima fires more neural activity on the right half of the brain?  Say, have a subject describe ""the typical woman"" and watch activity, have them describe ""the typical man"" and some other controls to also invoke creativity and see how the neural activity compares? See if when men don a dress, their right-brain fires more activity than if they just don any other unfamiliar clothing (a hospital gown or a robe are gender-neutral but may also be unfamiliar enough to control for that part alone)?  It's a very roundabout way of asking, but hopefully the questions kind of highlight the underlying question;   in terms of Jungian Psychology, is it reasonable to hypothesize that you could split the hemispheres of the brain into ""persona"" and ""Anima"" as ""left"" and ""right""? (and perhaps reversed for Persona and Animus)  The interesting thing is that this leads to a testable hypothesis perhaps some people here already know the answer to: Is there any link between gender dysphoria and right-brain dominance? If there is, that would seem to support that hypothesis that the left hemisphere generally takes the masculine identity and the right houses the Anima (in general, though I would expect if the Anima exists as a largely separate neural network (or combined set of networks) that it would probably at least share a little activity on the left hemisphere). "
2472,Do memories cease to exist?,"Do memories ever cease to exist?  For example, did the memories I had 20 years go (which I can't remember) disappear? If a machine that could access and show memories existed, could it bring back those 20 year old memories, or are they gone for ever?  "
2473,Has there been any substantive neuroimaging done to study Gendler's belief/alief distinction?,"Tamar Gendler proposed a distinction between the concept of ""belief"" and ""alief"", ""belief"" being the more commonly held, intuitive conception of a certain type of propositional attitude and ""alief"" being a more subconscious or ""primitive"" mental state. She argues that, for example, while someone might have a belief that standing on top of a glass floor above the Grand Canyon is safe, they usually have a more primitive alief that they are very high above the ground and it is not safe for them to be standing there.  Since her proposal of the distinction, has there been any neuroimaging or other neuroscientific techniques implemented in a study to outline if there is a neuro-physiological difference between belief and alief? She argues that alief usually involves behavioral response patterns (anxiety being the example used in the Grand Canyon example) but has there been any research done to show any other distinctions between the neurological processes that play a role in belief?

2474,Filter of perception,"I read a book about sensory perception in ASD from Olga Bogdashina(Sensory Perceptual Issues in Autism and Asperger Syndrome, Second Edition).

2475,Why am I sometimes astonished when I doze,"Why am I sometimes extremely astonished with no reason when I doze, especially I am really exhausted?  When I am tired and doze, I am sometimes stunned so suddenly that my whole body shakes and punches things in front, messing evrything placed in front of me. (e.g. a cup with cocoa drink, pencilcase which was open.. etc , about twice a year)  Is there any scientific reason for it? "
2476,Intuition behind loss quadrant of prospect theory,"This picture summarizes prospect theory by Daniel Kahneman.     Looking at the gains part: The slope of the graph is getting smaller. I can understand this: If I own a million, then adding 100 euro's isn't as impactful as when I own only 1 euro.  My question is about the losses part: Here also the slope of the graph is getting smaller away from the reference point. This implies that if someone would either lose 100 euro or have a 50% chance of losing 200 euro, he would go for the gamble and become risk seeking.  But to me this doesn't make intuitive sense for two reasons:   If I am loss-averse, which I am, then why would I take a gamble with my second 100 euro's? I would look at it as if I already lost 100 euros and then I can take the gamble of 50% of winning 100 euro or 50% losing another 100 euro. Since I am loss-averse I would not take the bet. Let's say I only own 200 euro in total: in that case I would definately want to hold on to my last 100 euro, since then I can at least pay for the rent. In other words, the utility of my last 100 euro is way bigger than the utility of my second-last 100 euro. But this is not represented in the slope.   Can anyone explain to me why according to Kahneman the slope of the losses-part diminishes away from the reference point? "
2477,Proportion of cortex dedicated for vision and hearing,"I have read in some websites that the percentage of the cortex devoted to processing visual information is from 30-66% with some claiming even 90%. And compared to that, only about 3% is dedicated to hearing.   Is this true?   The only source I've found stating something similar is from Sells &amp; Fixott (1957) where 50% of the neural tissue is devoted to vision and almost two-thirds of the electrical activity of the brain is devoted to vision when the eyes are open.  I haven't found anything related to hearing though. Does anyone know of a paper where this is discussed?  References  Sells, S.B. &amp; Fixott, R. S. (1957).

2478,What's the difference between Confirmation Bias and the Affect Heuristic?,"I've been reading ""Thinking Fast &amp; Slow,"" by Daniel Kahneman. At the end of Chapter 9, he introduces the ""Affect Heuristic,"" a concept introduced by Paul Slovic that effectively states that people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world.  Isn't this just an extension of confirmation bias - e.g. that people look for confirming evidence when evaluating ideas? It seems obvious that if you like something or dislike a concept, you'll search for evidence to affirm your preexisting position. For example - if I was a conservative and I learned of a bill introduced by a liberal politician, I'd naturally make the assumption that the bill is misguided and search for evidence to confirm that assumption (and vice-versa).  What's the difference between them? I'm having trouble defining the ""Affect Heuristic"" clearly in my mind. "
2479,Is Tinnitus a result of brain damage?,"   It is well known that loud noises can lead to hearing problems such as temporary hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and even permanent hearing loss. But this is the first time scientists have been able to identify damages to nerve cells as a result of noise exposure.      The research allows us to understand the pathway from exposure to loud noises to hearing loss. Dissecting the cellular mechanisms underlying this condition is likely to bring a very significant healthcare benefit to a wider population. The work will help prevention as well as progression into finding appropriate cures for hearing loss"", said the lead researcher Dr. Martine Hamann, from the University of Leicester in the UK. (Hear-it.org, 2014)   Listening to tailor-made notched sound or notched music reduces tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related auditory cortex activity (Okamoto, et al., 2010)     Abstract   Maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization may contribute to the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. Because cortical organization can be modified by behavioral training, we attempted to reduce tinnitus loudness by exposing chronic tinnitus patients to self-chosen, enjoyable music, which was modified (“notched”) to contain no energy in the frequency range surrounding the individual tinnitus frequency. After 12 months of regular listening, the target patient group (n = 8) showed significantly reduced subjective tinnitus loudness and concomitantly exhibited reduced evoked activity in auditory cortex areas corresponding to the tinnitus frequency compared to patients who had received an analogous placebo notched music treatment (n = 8). These findings indicate that tinnitus loudness can be significantly diminished by an enjoyable, low-cost, custom-tailored notched music treatment, potentially via reversing maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization.   (Image Source: Notched Music Therapy App for Android)  --Update--further information found--  The hear-it.org website at the paged linked above says:     Loud music played on earphones causes hearing loss by having a similar effect on nerves as multiple sclerosis, research finds. The research shows that noise levels above 110 decibels strip insulation from nerve fibers carrying signals from the ear to the brain. Loss of the protective coating, called myelin, disrupts electrical nerve signals.   Looking for the source, it seems to be coming from John Von Radowitz's article within The Independent newspaper (2012), stating that:     Loud music played on earphones causes deafness by having a similar effect on nerves as multiple sclerosis (MS)   With both articles mentioning Dr. Martine Hamann from the University of Leicester, I found that she was involved with three studies in that year.  The article which seems to be related is Pilati, et al. (2012), which states within the abstract:     Here we investigate mechanisms contributing to excitability changes in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) shortly after exposure to loud sound that produces hearing loss. We show that acoustic overexposure alters synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN in different ways. A reduction in the number of myelinated auditory nerve fibers leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells, which cannot be restored by increasing auditory nerve fiber recruitment. In contrast, a decreased membrane resistance of DCN granule cells (multisensory inputs) leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells that is overcome when additional multisensory fibers are recruited. Furthermore, gain modulation by inhibitory synaptic transmission is disabled in both auditory and multisensory pathways. These cellular mechanisms that contribute to decreased cellular excitability in the central auditory pathway are likely to represent early neurobiological markers of hearing loss and may suggest interventions to delay or stop the development of hyperactivity that has been associated with tinnitus.   The following is also in the article:  Acoustic overexposure (AOE):   induces hearing threshold elevations (shifts of hearing thresholds of 20–30 dB sound pressure level were observed for frequencies above the frequency used during the AOE protocol), decreases fusiform cell excitability, down-regulates auditory nerve (AN) and multi-sensory (MS) synaptic transmission to fusiform cells (FCs) reduces FC maximal firing rate upon AN stimulations decreases the number of myelinated AN fibres in the cochlea reduces FC maximal firing rate upon MS input stimulation and decreases granule cell membrane resistance disables FC gain control by inhibitory synaptic transmission   Auditory Nerve stimulations           AN stimulations (25 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger smaller Excitatory post-synaptic potentials after AOE (blue)). Membrane potential was −70 mV. Histogram summarizes excitatory post-synaptic potential amplitudes measured at similar stimulating voltages in unexposed (25 ± 4 V, n = 4) and exposed conditions (28 ± 2 V, n = 6). * P &lt; 0.05,            In unexposed condition (black), AN stimulations (40 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger action potentials in a FC (membrane potential of −60 mV). After AOE (blue), AN stimulations (40–45 V, 0.3 Hz) fail to trigger action potentials.   Multisensory stimulations           MS stimulations (15 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger smaller excitatory post-synaptic potentials after AOE (blue). Membrane potential was −70 mV. Histogram summarizes excitatory post-synaptic potential amplitudes measured at   similar stimulating voltages in unexposed (16 ± 1 V, n = 8) and exposed conditions (19 ± 2 V, n = 6). ** P &lt; 0.01: unpaired t tests.            In unexposed condition (black), MS stimulations (20 V, 0.3 Hz) trigger action potentials in a FC (membrane potential of −60 mV). After AOE (blue), higher stimulation voltages (25 V, 0.3 Hz) are required to trigger an action potential.   Not having a background in neurology, I am wondering if altered synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN equates to brain damage or is the altered synaptic transmission caused by information received from the damaged cochlea?  In other words, has it really been found that the cause of Tinnitus is brain damage which can be repaired through playing sounds or music with a ""notch"" in specific frequency spectrums?

2481,"Ability to identify an ""average"" vs a maximum (or minimum)?","I have a hypothesis that humans are better able to identify the largest (or smallest) in a set of objects, compared to their ability to identify an average object, i.e. the one closest to the mean.  Has anyone tested response times or accuracy of people given a collection of objects or shapes, when the subjects are asked to identify the most extreme object, as opposed to the object that best represents the ""average"" object?  Or for a set of numbers, are people faster and/or more accurate at identifying the largest number as opposed to the one closest to the mean? "
2482,What exactly does paranoid mean in terms of psychoactive drugs?,"When I went to my local marijuana dispensory, since recreational use of it is legal, they told me that when I first use it, I might get paranoid. When I read this word in context, I imagined somebody being afraid of getting caught. So, wouldn't you be paranoid if you didn't want other family members knowing that you smoked weed? Or, would this feeling or emotion be sharpened by THC? "
2483,What determines inebriated personality?,"I've studied that alcohol impairs the functioning of the limbic system, slows functioning of the prefrontal cortex, which alters judgement and reason, and damages neurons leading to memory failure, death, etc.   Noting certain people seem to portray similar stereotypes drunk what determines what personality you have when intoxicated?  Is it a liberated version of more natural expression, free of stress? A certain part of the limbic system damaged? "
2484,Why is almost all therapy done as one-hour sessions weekly?,"It seems far too spread out to me. Why do we pause mid-conversation and wait seven days?   When my car needed repair after an accident, the bodyshop spent 25 man-hours on repair. They did that over the course of one week, which is good because my car is essential for my life. I can't function without it. But if my car had needed therapy, it would've taken 25 weeks (almost six months) to get fixed. I'd have taken my dangerously broken car to them and had them start checking damage, only to say ""times up"" an hour later and boot me out the door to use my broken car for another week.  Mental health is more complex and also more immediately essential to a person. Why then do we work on it at such a slow pace?  I've tried researching alternatives, and other than checking into full-time inpatient care, the other option is to find a therapist who can schedule more than one appointment per week, which is very rare. The therapists that have more than one open slot in their schedule at any time are the least well-regarded online. The well-reviewed ones have wait-lists to get a single appointment.  I understand that some therapy is a 'maintenance' model, where the patient only needs to talk about what happened since last session, but what about patients who have a long history to unpack, or are in the middle of a crisis? Why do we apply the weekly appointment model to those cases?  Why have therapists adopted this model? What is the rationale and history that led to it? "

2488,"If demyelination doesn't typically occur, what happens when a musician doesn't practice for a month?","In ""The Talent Code,"" the author makes this statement:     What's the simplest way to diminish the skills of a superstar talent? The answer: don't let them practice for a month. Causing skill to evaporate...only requires that you stop a skilled person from systematically firing his or her circuit [and continuing to grow myelin] for a mere thirty days.   However, later in the book there is this statement:     Myelin wraps—it doesn't unwrap. Like a highway-paving machine, myelination happens in one direction. Once a skill circuit is insulated, you can't un-insulate it (except through age or disease).   Assuming these are both true, how do they coexist? If a neural circuit is not getting un-insulated in a month of no practice, why can't the performer resume at their previous level of skill? "

What is its meaning in relation to cognitive functioning and what are some real-life implications that can be derived from such a performance in this test? "
2490,"Recognizing which object is new, while forgetting original objects","I was looking at a row of candy bars in a vending machine today. Later on, I found another vending machine in the same building. Most of the bars were the same, but I immediately noticed that one was different.  If I had to list the names of the bars, I would have a lot of difficulty remembering all of them. I also would not be able to say which of the original bars was missing. But they must all be stored somewhere in my memory, because a different bar stood out at once.  Is there a name for this phenomenon in cognitive science? The idea that humans can forget the details of information, but are still able to tell when a new piece of information is different. Perhaps it had some early evolutionary advantage? "
2491,Biological plausibility of RBMs,"How biologically plausible are Restricted Bolztmann Machines (RBMs) and their stacked equivalent Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)? I know that Deep Learning (DL) in general isn't considered biologically plausible, since it requires information to be propagated backwards through uni-directional synapses. However, from what I understand, DBNs don't use back-prop and instead uses some sort of unsupervised learning algorithm. Does that make them more biologically plausible?  "
2492,Cognitive dissonance and interpreting unplesant situations as having a good effect,"I took a sociology class that I didn't agree very much with. One thing we discussed was why people who go through hazing (e.g.  Jean-François Caudron joining a hokey team) often report feeling closer with their colleagues and a increased sense of happiness after such an unpleasant experience. Apparently this is to avoid cognitive dissonance: if the person didn't think it's worth it, then he would be a fool for going through such a bad experience.  Do I understand that right? Are theories like this scientific or are they more of just a suggestion? For example if someone likes their job, but gets paid poorly, according to this theory could it be that they are tricking/convincing them self into liking the job so they don't feel like a fool for getting paid poorly? "
2493,What is the name for the psychological therapy involving socially isolating a patient?,"At a hospital I work in (as a new psychiatry trainee), some admitted patients - especially those with conversion disorder - are made by psychologists to:   Stop meeting their friends or family Spend the entire day in isolation on their beds Only eat simple (but not aversive) food such as bread with milk.   This treatment lasts for weeks. They call it ""extinction therapy"". However, in attempts of finding scientific evidence relating to this practice, I looked it up online and couldn't find any references to ""extinction therapy"".  My question is: Is the above psychological management a known and named concept? If so, what is it called? "

2496,Does Golden Hammer really exist?,"Note: I am not talking about Law of the instrument.  I am referring to the following (anti-)pattern of behavior:     A person very competent in one area (say, Philosophy) peremptorily expressing his opinion on an unrelated area (say, Medicine) as if he were an expert there also (and he is not).   There are many prominent examples (e.g., an expert in finance making sweeping assertions with great confidence and surrounded by insulting language ... [about] a field he palpably does not master), but, obviously, plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data"".  Does this pattern actually exist statistically or is it just a variant of the Dunning-Kruger effect (""Unskilled and Unaware of It"")?  One way to test this would be to plot the DK curve (actual expertise vs. self-assessment) for a given domain for    the ""general population"" (people who have no significant expertise in other domains) and the ""outside experts"" (people who are experts in an unrelated domain)   and check whether they would be statistically significantly different.  E.g., one can try to use StackExchange as the source of data: measure the user expertise by the reputation and subjective assessment thereof by the ""confidence level"" of their posts (questions/answers/comments).  Has something like this been done?  Does the question make sense to the practitioners in the field? "
2497,How to determine percentile rankings for responses to for Big5 Mini-Markers test?,"I'm writing a big 5 personality test using Big 5 Mini Markers by Saucier, as described here: [website]Given that most markers have about 0.7 correlation to Big5 trait, there's a limit to the score a user can get. While the theoretical max is 72 (8 markers * 9 points), the user can only get 55 on openness to experience and 67 on others.  I want to give the user percentile score as to how high they rate.   Do I use the theoretical max of 72 or the actual max the user can get on this test for determining low-medium-high or percentiles? In other words, would 55 openness be equal to 100th percentile, or would 72?  I found this example of a mini marker result online:  Your Scores Exraversion = 45 Agreeableness = 45 Conscientiousness = 45 Stability = 45 Openess = 45 Scores should range between 8 and 72.  Scores from 8 to 29 could be considered ""low,""  from 30 to 50 ""average,""  and from 51 to 72 ""high.""   My personal calculations are as follows (by giving 1 or 9 each question that has a relevant coefficient):   MIN  openness: 6.21  conscientiousness: 7.44  extraversion: 8.02  agreeableness: 7.51  stability: 7.49   MAX  openness: 55.89  conscientiousness: 66.96  extraversion: 72.18  agreeableness: 67.59  stability: 67.41  "
2498,What self-image do most people have?,"There seem to be a lot of studies about the influence of self-image on our psychology, but I've been wondering: Is there research on what type of self-image (positive, negative) most people have? Do people in Western countries tend to have a positive or a negative self-image? "
2499,How many memory systems do we have?,"I read that humans have 2 memory systems.  One is fight or flight memory located in amygdala. Another is episodic memory located in hippocamus.  Then I've heard that there is another memory system. Semantic memory located on the temporal lobe.  So, how many memory systems do we have?  If I can derive most math formula on top of my head but keep forgetting where I put my glasses, is something wrong in my hippocampus? "
2500,How does the brain project pain on to a particular part of the body?,"How does our brain translate periheral sensations due to injuries into pain perceptions? As an in silico analogy - if a stimulus is applied to a sensor it can be transmitted to a microprocessor. The micro processor then processes the information. However, a microprocessor will not cause the sensor to ""feel"" that stimulus. In other words, the processed information of the sensor is not projected back to that sensor as a perceived stimulus. Hence, in electronic circuits the information is processed unidirectionally. In contrast, in the peripheral nervous system sensory inputs are processed in the central nervous system, ultimately resulting in perceived sensations on the location of the sensor. Thus, apparently, the peripheral and central nervous systems operate in a feedback loop.   How does our nervous system do this? In other words, how does it localize the source of the stimulus (e.g., pain) and turn that sensation into a perception on that location, rather than just unidirectionally process the information? "
2501,Scales in Oral vs. Paper Surveys,"I am designing a survey that will have to be administered over the phone. While I have used 7-point Likerts on many occasions, saying ""On a scale of one to seven"" out loud makes it seem, suddenly, extremely unintuitive. If I were to ask a friend something, I would ask on a scale of 1 to 10.  I understand the issues behind having an even number of points, but is there any other strong reason not to ask 1:10? My own sense is that the simple familiarity of the scale would allow for more reliable answers, and I have no desire to list (each time) ""Not at all, a little, somewhat ..."" which I anticipate will simply exhaust my already time-strapped and generally no-nonsense population. 1:10 is fast, and low burden. Or will that familiarity itself result in biases? "
2502,Why do suicide has been kept in natural selection?,"Since I've heard about evolution theory, I tend to think about new things with the help of this theory. While not being always accurate, I find the reasoning that makes this theory possible very interesting.  We can ask a question like Why do humans have 2 eyes? and answer hypothetically that it was more advantageous for creatures to have 2 eyes than having 1 or 3. We can imagine that having 1 eye wouldn't allow to see the depth and make the creature able to live even when losing 1 eye. This answer isn't correct but makes sense.  We can do the same with behavior. Why do we tend to be jealous? We can imagine that forcing your sexual partner to stay with you gives your more chances to spread your genes. I'm not saying that this is the only answer but that's one hypothetical answer that makes sense.  However, what about suicide? From what I have read, people tend to suicide when their amount of pain is higher than what they can support. I don't see any reason why creatures(or anything from bacteria to human) would be advantaged from committing suicide. Why didn't the natural selection keep the individuals that can endure anything since they have more chances to stay alive and spread their genes? "
2503,Could any kind of learning be framed as learning a language?,"People learn (or actually acquire) languages naturally. As we grow up, we learn also multiple other skills which we then use in everyday life.   A lot of these skills are often compared to a language, for example:   Mathematics Reading Playing musical instrument Programming languages Law Playing chess (proven to rely on patterns) Dancing Painting or, more generally, producing works of art.   All of the above have been compared at one point to a language. They are used to communicate ideas, emotions and information.   The language is used for communication. In the same way, one person knowing the law/programming language/accounting wouldn't actually possess any useful skill without the presence of other lawyers/computers/tax system. So one can argue that all these skills are relevant and can be evaluated only in the presence of other people who receive the message expressed using them.  In the same way, if one person invents their own language but nobody else understands it, we wouldn't classify it as a language.  So, could it be that most of the skills we learn could be described as a language?  What would be arguments against it? Is there any evidence I can look into with regards to similarities between learning different skills and learning languages? "

2506,How sound is the psychology of Westworld?,"Disclaimer: I am very much a layman in these areas of research, so please do amend the question in order to conform to conventional usage of terminology and definitions thereof.  In the series Westworld (not the film from 1973), there are a number of themes related to consciousness, sentience and self-awareness. However, it seems that the main in-universe theory of what drives consciousness&dagger; is:   Firstly, a version of bicameralism, namely that the (sentient) mind is, was, or &mdash; in the case of Westworld &mdash; can be defined as being composed of an active part ""generating"" thought and a passive part which ""accepts/consumes/processes"" this thought. Secondly &mdash; and, according to my limited knowledge of psychology/cognitive science, perhaps more accurately &mdash; that memory and (past) experience is a fundamental part of the development of consciousness/sentience/self-awareness.   Now, I know that ideas in psychology and the philosophy of mind are extremely difficult to prove even empirically, let alone formally. However, it is still possible to not only do experiments which provide corroborating evidence proving the above but also to intrinsically evaluate the above hypothesis for general consistency. Therefore, regardless of how accurately these ideas describe how human minds actually work, how plausible is it to define some form of consciousness according to the above? (yes, I know that one point of the entire series is to drive home the idea that there is no magical ""switch"" to ""turning on"" consciousness/sentience; It's not a binary distinction).  Own speculations  At least in the human mind, memories in fact involve complex chains of synapses which, allow us to, in some form, indeed ""re-live"" past experience to some degree. In fact, (please help me find the citation), it has been shown that people thinking about doing physical activity display activity in parts of the brain responsible for planning of the actual motor movement for that activity. Given that the Hosts in the series are able to ""perfectly"" re-live past experiences, is it possible that ""consciousness"" could even more plausibly emerge as a complex interaction between these networks, i.e. sensory input triggers multiple memories (which are in fact parts of a larger neural network), which then ""output"" a response of some kind?  Even in humans, what constitutes a ""mind"" develops over time (cf. theory of mind) &mdash; whether or not this is due to accumulating experiences and memories is beyond my (current) knowledge. Since even we aren't born with some sort of ""fully-developed"" cognition, is it not plausible that some other being/machine/whatever could develop cognitively from a ""lower"" point than what children start at to something similar to our own adult ""cognition"" (ignoring the problem of philosophical zombies)?  However, if cognition can be driven by such a network of  ""memories"", is this not in fact then incompatible with the notion of a ""bicameral"" mind? Does that not mean that, despite how smart/sound the individual ideas in the show seem in isolation, that Westworldian cognition is intrinsically unsound?    &dagger;In this question, I conflate consciousness and sentience for the sake of convenience; Is there not a more proper term which encompasses both? "
2507,How is the size of a video related to its perceived quality?,"Video is often presented at different sizes. On the Internet, many websites provide quite a few size settings. In the store, you can buy TVs of many different sizes. In both cases, it's the same resolution video being stretched to a various sizes. To the technically savvy, making the same pixel occupy a larger physical space does not increase the quality of the video. But to the average consumer, he may think bigger is better.   What does the graph of perceived quality VS physical size look like? Is it linear, that is bigger is always better. Or is it parabolic? That is, there is a perfect ratio of pixel to size and any deviation from this ratio will result in a worse perceived quality. Or is it some other shape?    "
2508,Why do humans have sex in private?,"Human couples usually have sex in private, hidden not only from predators, but also - other humans. It is unlike behavior of most species, including our relatives: bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas.  Is private sex mostly a biological or cultural behavior? What is the advantage (if any) of such behavior? "
2509,What makes the difficulty of an arithmetic item? The operation or its length?,"When presenting someone with an arithmetic item, let's say 2+2, what makes it difficult? Is the item 2+2+2 only longer, or also more difficult?   Does the mental operation of addition make the difficulty, or also the amount of mental operations? Or should the amount only be seen something influencing the length it takes to solve the item, but not it's difficulty?   Are there any publications that address the idea of difficulty for psychometric items which address this question?  "
2510,Measuring meta-intelligence,"Does anyone know of any research in measuring metacognitive abilities (i.e. metacomprehension, metamemory, meta-emotions(?), etc) in people?

2511,Do personality survey responses correlate to the success or failure of minimum wage employees?,"I recently watched a friend fill out a personality survey for a minimum wage job. These surveys generally have a few dozen to as many as a couple hundred statements with which the applicant must agree, disagree, or stay neutral. The survey is designed to filter candidates. What puzzles me is what basis they use for this filtering.  Some of the questions are obvious correlates with negative employee qualities:        Sometimes I shout at customers to get my point across.      Well, gee, I wonder if I should ""strongly agree"" with that one?  Others, however, are not so clear:        I will work hard to get a job as an executive at a large company.   My former bosses all say I'm the best employee they've ever had.   I spend a lot of time thinking through about a problem before solving it.      For example, being a self-starter might help or hinder a job behind a cash register. Exercising leadership is great until you're one of 40 people restocking the shelves. Thinking through problems is a useful skill unless the problem facing you is trivial, in which case ""consideration"" might be construed as ""procrastination"". Based on examples like these, it's not inherently obvious if these questions measure positive or negative qualities, or what the model response might be.  Moreover, the size, type, and prevalence of these questionnaires suggests a level of sophistication in the selection process that I'm not convinced it is due. Supposing they test 5-10 core competencies, qualities like leadership, professionalism, and decorum, there are more than enough responses to establish inter-survey response validity. Of course, that assumes these employers spent millions of dollars developing valid, proprietary psychometrical measures, or co-opted something in the academic domain.   So what are these surveys really testing?  Tongue-in-cheek, if faced with such a test, what would agreeing, disagreeing, or remaining neutral with the statement, ""Employer personality tests correlate with success or failure in the workplace?"" reflect about an individual? "
2512,Is religiousness a genetically heritable feature?,"I know that parent beliefs have very strong influence on child, but is it possible that genetic factor also play a role? I doubt that the content of any religion could be heritable through genes nor anyone could be genetically predestined to be Christian, Jew, Buddhist or votary of any particular religion. But is it possible that some kind of sensitivity to religious aspect of life could be heritable?   I know that it is hard to distinguish genetic and environmental factor in such case, but maybe someone have already made such research for example on monozygotic and dizygotic twins or adopted children?   I've thought that if it is indeed heritable, then celibacy in the Catholic Church might be suicidal for this faith, as it eliminates the (potential) ""godliness genes"". "
2513,"Do measures of Big 5 personality have a positive bias towards extraverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, ageeable and open individuals?","Background:  One free measures of the Big 5 is the IPIP. I have noticed that IPIP items seem to have a positive bias towards items loading on the extraversion (EX), emotional stability (ES), conscientiousness (C), agreeableness (A), and openness/intellectance (O) pole of the scale.  For example, for agreeableness, you have items ""I am interested in people"" (positive) and ""I insult people"" (negative), or for conscientiousness you have items ""I pay attention to details"" (positive) or ""I make a mess of things"" (negative).  However, at the level of a construct there are positive aspects to all the other poles of the Big 5. Being disagreeable could mean that you are comfortable confronting people when you believe they have done something wrong or that you are comfortable pointing out social injustice. Being lower on conscientiousness may mean that you don't feel the need to do everything perfectly in life or that you believe that sometimes it's better to be a little messy so that you can focus on more important things.  Questions  Thus, I'm interested in the positive bias in measures of the Big 5 towards conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability, and openness.   Is there any research that quantifies the degree to which different measures of the Big 5 display this positive bias? Are there any Big 5 measures that specifically try to avoid this positive bias? To what extent is this positive bias inherent to the concepts of the Big 5?  "
2514,What is the average amount of new vocabulary adults retain when learning a second language?,"What are the realistic/optimal (or maximal) number of words of vocabulary that can be learned (retained and later successfully accessed) by an adult learner of a foreign/second language?

2515,Chunking Patterns and Enjoyment of Applying Patterns,"I've been reading a book ""The Theory of Fun in Game Design"" it talks about two concepts of psychology that I wanted to confirm are true. The writer the book isn't a psychologist.   The two concepts are Chunking Patterns and Enjoyment of Applying Patterns.   So, according to the book he says we are pattern matching all the time. That's one of the things our brain does best. Once we recognize a pattern enough we chunk it. So when we drive to work every morning we don't sometimes remember the details because we do it so often we chunk those details.   Art, Movies, Music, Games, etc... that interest us are because they are introducing new patterns that we can either learn or combine with previous patterns.   This has been essential to our survival so our body rewards us for processing these new patterns by releasing endorphin's.   So, basically is this a bunch of hogwash or is there some truth behind the ""theory"" that pattern recognition is rewarded with a release of endorphins?  Also if this is true, is there somewhere I can read more about this? "
2516,Is there cognizance or meta-awareness of classical conditioning?,"Behaviorism's initial popularity was largely due to it's ability to take cognition and consciousness out of the equation; bringing it close to something that could be tested completely objectively by judging behaviors. Two of the most significant remaining findings of behaviorism are classical and operant conditioning. Because these acts can be studied in terms only of stimulus and reaction, cognition is largely ignored in related studies, especially in the traditional radical behaviorists' work.   My question is, to what extent is cognition actually at work during classical conditioning? Has it been shown that participants in studies are actually aware that they are starting to associate the conditioned stimulus with either the unconditioned stimulus or the conditioned response?  I'm excluding operant conditioning as I assume that at least for humans it is much more likely that a conscious awareness of the associations between stimuli and punishment/reward will result; perhaps this assumption is incorrect, I just thought it would help narrow the scope of the question. Feel free to correct me if it's wrong, I thought it should probably be a separate question however.  I'll also exclude Conditioned Taste Aversion as it's a rather special case and often only takes a single exposure to stimulus.  Is there evidence of conscious awareness of classical conditioning, especially while the association process is still going on? "
2517,Does breastfeeding lead to increased intelligence?,"Several studies suggest that breast-fed babies become more intelligent children than formula-fed babies (e.g., Lucas et al 1992).  Questions   To what extent overall does research support the association between breastfeeding and intelligence increases? Is it reasonable to conclude that the association is causal? Or alternatively, are there better alternative explanations for the association?   References   Lucas, A., Morley, R., Cole, TJ, Lister, G. &amp; Leeson-Payne, C. (1992). Breast milk and subsequent intelligence quotient in children born preterm. The Lancet, 339, 261-264.  "
2518,What is the distribution of performance in academic programming subjects?,"On Programmers SE there is a popular question about scientific evidence for whether some people either are or are not able to program.   One person cites an unpublished manuscript by Dehnadi and Bornat (2006) who state in an abstract:     All teachers of programming find that their results display a 'double   hump'. It is as if there are two populations: those who can, and those   who cannot, each with its own independent bell curve.    That said, educators have choice in how individual assessments are scored, how assessments are combined, and whether and how any final scores are scaled. These could all influence the shape of the final grade distribution.  I also imagine that to get a double hump would suggest that the variables that best predict student performance (e.g., time spent on subject, general ability, subject-specific ability) would have to either show a double hump or show a discontinuous relationship with performance. In particular, I can see that students that drop out of a subject without formally un-enrolling are likely to fail very badly and appear in a separate hump. I also suspect that certain types of subjects where answers are clearly correct or incorrect and where intuition from everyday life is less directly relevant may also give rise to a process where it appears as if people can either do the subject or they can't.  Questions   What is the distribution of grades in university subjects? To what extent does the distribution of grades in programming subjects differ from non-programming subjects? Is it bimodal? Is there any theories or empirical evidence about what leads to bimodal grade distributions?   References   Dehnadi, S. &amp; Bornat, R. (2006). The camel has two humps (working title).

2519,Cultural brain hypothesis and gene-culture co-evolution,"Recently, Joseph Henrich of UBC has been promoting his cultural brain hypothesis. The goal is to explain a selection pressure behind the development of the human brain and general intelligence. The basic premise is that our brains evolved to be better and better at accurately replicating cultural information (or memes) between generations. A secondary part of his hypothesis is that there was a tight co-evolution between culture and the genes that shape us.  This seems contrary to the more orthodox thinking of that genes shaped the base of humans largely without large-scale culture (when we were small hunter-gatherer tribes and thus culture was minimal), and then recently (on an evolutionary time scale) large-scale culture 'turned on' and there has not been a sufficient time for this to produce large genetic differences. In simplest terms, the co-evolution was minimal and instead we should think of the key players being gene evolution followed by cultural evolution (on different timescales).  To confuse things further, some scientists (like Satoshi Kanazawa of LSE) view most of what we associated with the 'perks' of human brain (such as general intelligence) as mal-adaptive on the individual level. Thus there seems to be a large distinction between the 3 general threads, which raises the question:  What is the key evidence for the cultural brain hypothesis and gene-culture co-evolution?  The only evidence I know of potential recent co-evolution of culture and genes is Dediu &amp; Ladd's (2007) suggestion that the split between tonal and atonal languages is related to a recent (~6k years ago) mutation in the ASPM gene. Is there other evidence of recent co-evolution between genes and large-scale culture?    Related questions   Do atonal languages have a tonal ancestor? Is religiousness a genetically heritable feature?  "
2520,"What happens when a person ""imagines"" how food could taste like just from looking at it?","What processes are triggered by imagining the taste of food (let's assume it's sealed so that its smell doesn't reach the test subject's nose) only by looking at it, based on memories of food with similar color, shape, texture and size?

2521,At what point does a complex become pathological?,"I've a first question so I apologize if the format is completely awry.  I'm reading Meeting the Shadow: The Hidden Power of the Dark Side of Human Nature and I came across this passage by Edward C. Whitmont:     The shadow cannot be eliminated. It is the ever present dark brother or sister. Whenever we fail to see where it stands, there is likely to be trouble afoot. For then it is certain to be standing behind us. The adequate question therefore never is: Have I a shadow problem? Have I a negative side? But rather: Where does it happen to be right now? When we cannot see it, it is time to beware! And it is helpful to remember Jung's formulation that a complex is not pathological per se. It becomes pathological only when we assume that we do not have it; because then it has us.   The bold is my own addition to emphasize where my question stems from. This is the whole paragraph to the end of the chapter so as much context as I could give on it. To me (psychology as an interest/hobby with no classes or experience) this means that when we ignore the effects a complex has on us then it becomes pathological.   An example: Say I have an amputated hand and am lividly jealous at the sight of people doing things two-handed. By refusing to acknowledge and deal with this dilemma, I am relegating it to others to deal with by default and it thusly becomes pathological.  Is this accurate? Are there other important factors to take into consideration when considering a complex pathological? "
2522,"When faced with a choice and trying to make a quick decision, are 2 options better than 3 or more options?","Bastardi &amp; Shafir (1998) show how too much data disabilitates your decision making. There is also the popular Paradox Of Choice argument.  However, I can't find a reference stating that, when faced with a decision, 2 options are better than 3 or many options. It makes sense--you either like one of the options less or more than the other, and can then come to a quicker conclusion.  Is my intuition correct? If so, Could someone please point me in the direction of a thesis or paper which shows that?  UPDATE  I just found this paper and will update my question (or answer it!) if I find an answer.  UPDATE 2  I realise that the converse can be true as well, especially in the scenario when obtaining something, like the latest tablet. For example, bias and culture could make it really easy for you to discount the vast majority of options (e.g. anything not made by Apple), but then you struggle to make the final decision (e.g. shall I get an iPad 64GB or an iPad 4G?). "
2523,Why do people donate money to others engaging in activities for charity?,"In the UK and elsewhere individuals often engage in activities (e.g., running, shaving your head, etc.) for the purpose of eliciting sponsorship. The money raised is then donated to charity.  Questions:   What motivates people to give money to the participants who then give it to the charity?  If the cause is worthy, why not give anyway?    Possible explanations I have include:   The participant willingly endures hardship and people give money as a reward for that hardship. In other words, it is a form of an emotional blackmail. This would mean that someone apt at the type of activity should receive substantially less.  The event is fun to watch and it is merely a PR opportunity.   "
2524,How do songs trigger memories associated with previous experiences of listening to the  song?,"Background: If I like a particular song, I listen to it while doing other things until I get sick of that song. This creates an extremely strong bond between the two things: the song and the activity. The activities usually being programming languages or video games. Whenever I hear the song again, the emotions and/or visuals of whatever I was doing flood my brain, and I can remember them vividly.

2528,Upper Bounds on Rat Maze Complexity,"Suppose you make a rat run through a maze to find it's food. Every day, you put the rat into the same maze. The first few times this rat has to run the maze, it will probably take a little while to figure out. After doing it several times, the rat will find a path through the maze and stick to it; he'll make a habit out of each turn, and become an expert in his path, finding the food quickly every day.  I'm wondering: has anyone ever performed a study quantifying rat-maze complexity in terms of the number of decisions (left, right, or straight), and then measuring the number of daily maze-traversals required before the rat habituates a path through the maze for his food?   Does the number of traversals required to habituate a path increase linearly with the number of decision-points in the maze, or is there a curve in the relationship between traversals and decision-points?  Is there an upper-bounds on complexity, where the rat will no longer be able to habituate a path?   The reason I ask is first of all just to learn about animal psychology, but also to provide myself with an organic baseline for path-finding and path-normalization algorithms I'm writing into some code for a programming project.  ETA: Also, if you cite a study, please link me to it. Google knows I like code, and won't give me anything but programmer links when I google rat-maze stuff. I don't know what to search for to find actual rat studies. "
2529,Does learning by heart improve memorizing abilities?,"Some people around me believe that if you learn poems by heart in childhood, it will help you to memorize things better further. They say about improvements in memory in general: things like mathematical formulas, historical facts, and even to remember better conversations in real life. I'm talking not about using some memorizing techniques, but about the ability to remember things better if you have ""trained"" your memory (short-time one?) by learning poems (not songs, not formulas, not stories).  I looked for answers on Quora, but they look like ""I think"" or ""Researchers say"" without any references to rated scientific journals. Are there any scientific works on this topic? "

The details are as follows:  Experiment Design  This experiment was performed in a driving simulator. In each trial, the participant drives a car in a single lane.   Procedure   Initially, the participant's car and the lead vehicle (car or truck) moved at 100 km/h (27.78 m/s). The lead vehicle was at one of the two distances from the participant's car in a given trial: 50 m or 100 m.    After few seconds, the 'Observe' message appeared on participant's windscreen. At the onset of this message, the lead vehicle began to change its speed (increase or decrease) by 1 m/s or 3 m/s at the rate of 0.5 m/s (e.g. it would take 6 seconds to decrease speed by 3 m/s).    Once the speed difference was complete (e.g. lead vehicle reached 27.78 - 3 = 24.78 m/s speed), the participant was given 4 seconds to observe this change in speed. Then the 'Change Speed' message appeared. At this point, participants were forced to push either the gas pedal or the brake pedal to indicate that they noticed a positive speed difference (e.g. +3 m/s) or a negative speed difference (e.g. -3m/s). They had to provide their reaction even if they did not see any speed difference. Please note that the instructions were given before the experiment began.   Details/Limitations   There were no catch trials, i.e. there was no trial in which a speed difference was not created. The trials were done with random combinations of spacing and speed difference. Sometimes negative speed difference trials were done consecutively; in other cases the trials were positive speed difference followed by a negative one. For example: 50 m and +1 m/s -> 50 m and +3 m/s -> 100 m and -3m/s -> 100 m and -1 m/s. These could be in any order.     Possible sources of bias  A smaller distance of 50 m is relatively unsafe compared to 100 m, especially when the lead vehicle is a truck. So, with small distance, small speed difference and/or a truck, participants might be biased to apply brakes even if the lead vehicle accelerates.   Results  I now have proportions of correctly detected responses for each combination of distance and speed difference.   Question  How do I determine an unbiased measure of the threshold of speed difference in each case? Does a speed difference that is correctly detected in at least 75% of the trials an appropriate threshold?   Kindly share any beginner-friendly resources for estimating threshold in a single stimulus forced choice task. Thank you in advance. "
2535,Are emotions rational?,The issue of whether emotions are rational (or intelligent) is at the center of philosophical and psychological discussions.   What is the mainstream take on the logic and nature of emotions? Or where might I be able to read more about the nature and logic of emotions? 
2536,Why do we like music?,"Why does music sound good to us? Why is it that a single guitar bend, blues riff on a piano, or a scream by a singer can cause us such a sensation? What makes it better than just noise?  As a physicist, I tried to think of this question from our perspective. Every sound, song, noise or what have you can be decomposed to single frequency waves. We can write the spectrum, i.e. what frequencies (or equivalently musical notes) compose this particular sound and at what intensity. 'A' is well known to have a 440 Hz frequency, for example.   Composed music usually have well defined frequencies. Most of the frequencies will have no effect on the composition (zero intensity), only the ones that the composer decided. Maybe some frequencies will be added due to the digital nature of modern recording, but the highest intensities will be at the frequencies that the composer / pianist played.  Noise, on the other hand, is usually composed of all frequencies (ideally). Every frequency will have a significant contribution to the overall noise. Maybe there will be a central frequency that dominates a bit, but it would not have a significantly higher intensity than the other frequencies.  So my question is, can our brain prefer compositions with well defined frequencies over a scramble of frequencies? Can this be one of the reasons we like composed music better than noise? "
2537,What research is there into content of conversations vs IQ?,"I wonder if there is any research into the content of a conversation between two people and how that relates to IQ. My casual conversations are that people of, lets say a more humble background, which generally correlates to a lower IQ, the topics of conversation tend to involve:   Food: What did you have for dinner.  Drink: How many pints did you/will you have this evening/last night. Relations: Who said what to who, e.g. ""He said.. then she said... then.."" What you like: Do you like Jam? I like Jam. Do you like Marmalade? I like Marmalade.   i.e. fairly simple stuff. I don't think it would be too hard to program that into a computer. In fact, I would even say there is a lower form of conversation along the lines of:  ""Alright?"" ""Aye"" ""Yup."" ""Aye"". ""Ow's it going?"" ""Aye. Good."" ""Yup"". ""Aye"".  (Some might argue that such utterances actually have deeper meaning learned through years of use.)  Whereas I would characterise higher IQ conversations tend to involve more imagination, meta-language, ""And then he said... but why? And what were the motives?"" Critical thinking, and going against the grain. But then this could be because it's more socially acceptable to have these ideas, whereas in working class areas you don't want to be seen as different or above your station.  I don't think this is a class thing. Because you can have quite rich people whose conversations are quite simple. e.g. like the stereotype of the Valley Girl who just like talks about like clothes like thing like.  "
2538,Has there been any neuroscientific study of polydactyly?,"I have been reading about polydactyly and found that surgery is only necessary in certain cases.  It depends on way the extra digit on the hand or foot is attached.  For example, central polydactyly (a very rare situation, in which the extra digit is on the ring, middle or index finger) requires early osteotomy and ligament reconstructions to prevent deformities, such as angular growth deformities.  What I am wondering about is the most common type which is ulnar polydactyly also called postaxial polydactyly (the extra digit is on the ulnar side of the hand, thus the side of the little finger).  Neuroscience and psychology have studied the consequences for humans of losing a limb or other body parts, including documenting the pain caused by the phantom limb effect (usually explained as due to reorganisation of the brain’s representation of missing part).   What has neuroscience been able to establish regarding the extra sensorimotor information the brain would be dealing with?  Can those with extra fingers use their extra digits with no problems with coordination etc? "
2539,Scoring of the Wechsler Nonverbal Scale of Ability,"How is the global test score supposed to be computed based on the individual scores in the Wechsler Nonverbal Scale of Ability?  Let's say the sub-test scores are A, B, C, and D.  From there:   how do we obtain the global score? is it age dependent? I understand that the standard deviation on the total score is 15. Is this correct? how is the confidence interval computed? is it symmetric around the ""measured"" value?  "
2540,What's the pathfinding algorithm the human brain uses?,"I was trying to build a software simulation of people using different pathways in a city to get from point A to point B. I do know the Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm, but what they do is to find the shortest path between two nodes. Those algorithms can be used to do it, but they problem is that they only do that, they just find the perfect shortest path. And when I see realistic population movements in a city, I see different people choose different pathways to get from point A to point B, even the same person sometimes chooses a different pathway in two different moments.  I know part of that depends on emotional factors that would be impossible to predict. But my point is that when you look at a map and you decide yourself the path you are going to use to go from you location to a desired destination, you don't seem to run a Dijkstra or A* algorithm in your brain. In fact, I can't possible know the length of every road which is something necessary to run a Dijkstra or an A* algorithm. What algorithm does the brain use to choose a path? It's clearly not always the shortest path. I'm not just talking about the seemingly randomness that other factors like safety of the road can add to the result, or other emotional factors. Because even if my only goal is to choose the shortest path between two points, I am probably going to choose a pathway that is different from the one another person would choose, even with the same goal. I even saw that men and women tend to have brains adapted for this in a different way; in this Brain Games episode from National Geographic they briefly mention it, I don't know how scientifically accurate it is, but well, that's why I am asking.  I shorter words, I'm curious about the actual pathfinding algorithm the human brain uses. If there's one at all. Is there any paper or source that I could read about this? "
2541,Can meditation be associated to lucid dream?,"The principal reason of this question is that I know people that can willingly enter in lucid dream (and so do what they want in it, and wake up when they want). Some of then use EEG (not professionnal one, ZEO sleep manager or Olimex) and they lucid are on NREM2 or REM. So it's still sleep (the brain waves length are said to be sleep). But they can basically fall asleep and start lucid dream.    Important point to mention: those people are doing polyphasics sleep, hence the capacity to fall asleep for a nap really easily. But because of this they don't try to sleep outside their schedules.  However, the thing is that they relax and then fall asleep in a lucid state.   Meditation can be observed in theta wavelength (Manocha, n.d.; Aftanas &amp; Golocheikine, 2001) (referenced by Wikipedia). But it's mindless meditation.  Also this question refer meditation as a good method to fall asleep.  If you simplify it (a lot) meditation and lucid dream can have a lot of common points.   But is there any known relatio between the two? Is it possible to fall in lucid dream by meditating?  References  Aftanas, L. I., &amp; Golocheikine, S. A. (2001).

2542,Punishment v.s Negative Reinforcement,"Consider the following scenario:     Every time I do the groceries with my son he constantly asks for a packet of lollies. I find this constant asking for lollies very annoying, so I always end up buying him the lollies.    For the parent, the textbook states that this an example of negative reinforcement. Now this seems very intuitive, but I am wondering why this could not be an example of a punishment?  The definition of punishment that I have been given is:     ""If the behaviour brings about a negative outcome, it's less likely to occur in the future"".    I would've thought that the if the son's behaviour changed from misbehaving, this is an example of a punishment (albeit a tasty punishment). If the son continued to misbehave after receiving the lollies, then this would be typical of a reinforcer.  Am I on the right track? "

2544,Is there any scientific data showing one can learn while sleeping?,"Time is short in the days of learning for me but I like listening to lectures and case studies about code in my field. I've thought about getting a Bluetooth Sleep Headphone to possibly listen to these lectures and studies while sleeping.   However, upon my research I've only be able to find on this site one a Q&amp;A without an answer: ""Can one learn whilst sleeping? Can one solidify a memory &amp; study for exams by listening to recordings while asleep?"".   In my research and Google kungfu I've seen questionable sites that indicate as yes and some no but I was wondering have there been any creditable university case studies that show wether this is factually possible?

2545,Is a concept of good and bad innate or learned?,"Some people would say that without religion, there would be no moral code to tell us what is good and bad.  Some Darwinist's like Dawkins say that acts like sharing and feelings like guilt are innate and that we don't need religion. And that we can have morals without religion. He gives the examples of a monkey sharing it's food.   However there appear to be some religions, e.g. human sacrifice in paganism, or death for apostasy in Islam, which seem to suggest that the notion of what constitutes good and bad is more flexible. And the feeling of guilt would be more a social construct.  Sure we can have laws without religion. But these laws might just suit the majority not the minority.  So for instance would a person who had never been taught that murder is bad. But that murder as a revenge for steeling (for example) is good. Would they then feel guilt after comitting a murder? (As Dawkin's might posit). Or feel like they have done a good deed?  Thus, from a psychological standpoint, is Dawkin's correct in thinking that humans would be kind to each other in the absence of society built on the foundations of a religious code. If so what exactly is ""guilt"" if it only exists with respect to social expectations. "
2546,Why are we generating wrong ideas in the first place?,"In CBT they tell you to challenge automatic thoughts. So say someone doesn't say hello to you, then you think he doesn't like me. CBT says to challenge this and maybe you realize that he didn't see you actually.  I have a more philosophical question in such sense. CBT assumes that at some point we are generating wrong ideas (automatic thoughts) and later we are able to correct them ourselves. My question is, if we are able to correct them, why are we generating the wrong ideas in the first place? What is the mechanism that allows this to happen? Which mind processes are in play here? Concious/unconcious? "

To support this argument the author points to Niklas Luhmann who was a very productive social scientist in the 20th century and used the method. However the author does not actually cite any research that proves that the system works for everyone. Is there actually any research? If not, is there any consensus on which system students should use to organize their knowledge?  Edit: Here is Luhmann himself explaining his system. [website]"
2548,May somebody use oddball paradigm solely for psychophysical studies?,"I'm an undergraduate linguistics student with a strong interest in cognitive psychology of visual attention. Nowadays, I'm studying on an undergraduate research project in which I'm planning to use reaction-time measurement and oddball presentation. However, when I dive into the oddball paradigm literature it seemed to me that it is only used with some other neuro-imaging techniques like EEG, fMRI etc. So I started to wonder if it is inappropriate to use oddball in order to elicit some behavioral data for some reason. Although I've searched for this on Google Scholar or Science Direct, I could not find anything directly related to this.   Is it uncommon / inappropriate / methodologically flawed to use the oddball paradigm only with reaction time? If so, why?  "

2551,"Can a person ""self-induce"" the placebo effect?","Despite a recent dubious claim that placebos don't require deception (critiqued here), placebos appear to function on the basis that a subject believes X will have effect Y. Without knowing too much detail, we say that the subject's mind/body will assist or attempt to achieve Y upon the perception that X causes Y.  Can a person, without self-deception [1] and with knowledge of the placebo effect, induce a placebo response? Or can a person knowledgeable of the placebo effect induce the same ""reactions"" that a placebo can normally be used to induce?  Consider a silly example.  Persons A and B each have a headache. They are told that balancing a spoon on one's nose eliminates headaches with very high success rates by conducting electricity via the sinuses. Person A believes the claim. Person A balances a spoon on their nose, and their headache is eliminated.  Person B, having a background in medicine, doesn't believe it at all. Person B, to prove the point, balances the spoon on their nose and remains in pain.  At this point, is there any way for Person B to ""simply decide"" that this ritual, which he knows to be an attempt at a placebo, to start working?

She was saying something about a study was done that found the best indicator of a physical attractiveness is feet, and that men preferred small feet and women prefer large feet. Does anyone know the study being referred to? I can sort of see what is being said, as perhaps women are attracted to tall men and there's a correlation between height and foot size. What confuses me is my prof was definitely saying something about ""the best indicator"" as if the most attractive part of a person is their feet. Can someone provide a reference to such a study? "

2554,Why do we stress over the smallest things?,"I'm just curious to know: why do people stress over the smallest of issues? Not only is it common to almost everyone I know, but it is something that can drive people crazy.   For example, getting really stressed when you can't get something to work (even if it's a simple as a new program on your computer), or stressed when you misplace your keys at home and immediately blame your partner.   These rather simple things cause a great deal of stress (even for myself). While looking at my friends or family, stress over them cause me to realise how petty they are. Hasn't there got to be some cognitive reason for this?  I was having a discussion with my friend two days ago, when he told me these small stresses were a good thing, in that they make us forget about the big problems like recent job losses or events such as global warming.  Do we encapsulate ourselves in these petty matters as a means of protecting ourselves, or are we just selfish and ignorant? "
2555,Evidence for a 2-component framework of visual attention distribution,"As part of my bachelor thesis on eyetracking-based gaze guidance, I've done quite a bit of reading (again) on visual attention and visual attention distribution. What caught my attention (haha) earlier this morning is a section about a two-part framework for visual attention distribution.  Ref. to the article:     Laurent Itti, Christof Koch (2000). A saliency-based search mechanism   for overt and covert shifts of visual attention.   Page 2, left column, second paragraph from the top, it states:     Much evidence has accumulated in favor of a two component framework for   the control of where in a visual scene attention is deployed   [References here]: a bottom-up, fast, primitive mechanism that biases   the observer towards selecting stimuli based on their saliency (most   likely encoded in terms of center-surround mechanisms) and a second   slower, top-down mechanism with variable selection criteria, which   directs the ‘spotlight of attention’ under cognitive, volitional   control. Whether visual consciousness can be reached by either   saliency-based or top-down attentional selection or by both remains   controversial.   With this article being from 2000 and pretty much every reference to support this dated between 1980 and 1998, is there any current work (2000+) to support this model, or has it even been refuted?  There are quite a lot of visual attention distribution models centering around saliency as the core parameter that seem to fit pretty well, but what about the second component of the framework that is suggested here?  Looking forward to some interesting answers. I can provide additional references if needed. "

2558,Would a patient benefit from continuing cognitive therapy even after solving his pathology?,"According to this question: Would most people benefit from psychotherapy? most people would benefit from psychotherapy.  I'm trying to narrow that question to only the people who have experienced some psychopathology and went into a cognitive therapy.  Wikipedia explains that the differences between psychotherapy and counseling can be summarized in the following sentence:     Unlike the patient in psychotherapy, the client in counseling does not   need to be cured or helped to overcome a psychological suffering, but draws on the skills of the counselor as an aid skills they already possess in order to achieve the goals you want, in the ways and in the times that are responsive.   Does the evidence support the idea that most people affected by psychopathology would strongly benefit from continuing cognitive psychotherapy / counseling after the main problems disappear? "
2559,"How is ""mislabeling"" cognitive distortion different from ""labeling""?","David Burns in his book Feeling Good describes ""labeling and mislabeling"" cognitive distortions:     Personal labeling means creating a completely negative self-image based on your errors. It is an extreme form of overgeneralization. The philosophy behind it is ""The measure of a man is the mistakes he makes."" There is a good chance you are involved in a personal labeling whenever you describe your mistakes with sentences beginning with ""I'm a..."" For example, when you miss your putt on the eighteenth hole, you might say, ""I'm a born loser"" instead of ""I goofed up on my putt."" Similarly, when the stock you invested in goes down instead of up, you might think, ""I'm a failure"" instead of ""I made a mistake.""      Labeling yourself is not only self-defeating, it is irrational. Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river than a statue. Stop trying to define yourself with negative labels—they are overly simplistic and wrong. Would you think of yourself exclusively as an ""eater"" just because you eat, or a ""breather"" just because you breathe? This is nonsense, but such nonsense becomes painful when you label yourself out of a sense of your own inadequacies.      When you label other people, you will invariably generate hostility. A common example is the boss who sees his occasionally irritable secretary as ""an uncooperative bitch."" Because of this label, he resents her and jumps at every chance to criticize her. She, in turn, labels him an ""insensitive chauvinist"" and complains about him at every opportunity. So, around and around they go at each other's throats, focusing on every weakness or imperfection as proof of the other's worthlessness.      Mislabeling involves describing an event with words that are inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded. For example, a woman on a diet ate a dish of ice cream and thought, ""How disgusting and repulsive of me. I'm a pig."" These thoughts made her so upset she ate the whole quart of ice cream!    But labeling and mislabeling seem equivalent. I see no difference between, ""She's irritated by me, therefore she's an uncooperative bitch,"" and, ""I ate a dish, therefore I'm a pig"". How does David Burns differentiate between these cognitive distortions? How do other cognitive therapists differentiate? "
2560,"Is Allen Carr's ""easy way to stop smoking"" a form of cognitive therapy?","David Burns is a cognitive therapist, who in his Feeling Good describes how to overcome depression. He states that depression is a logical result of irrational negative thoughts, which can be generalized to a finite set of thought patterns called cognitive distortions. For example, one such cognitive distortion is over-generalization, an example of a negative irrational thought matching this pattern is ""this girl rejected my advances outright, i'll probably never have success with  a girl"". In general, cognitive therapy states that our thoughts determine emotions, feelings, moods, habits and behaviors. Thoughts here not only mean thought-phrases, but also perceptions, interpretations, attitudes and beliefs.  Allen Carr was a smoking cessation expert, who wrote Easy Way to Stop Smoking. In short, his method revolves around changing your perception of smoking and quitting, and if you succeed, you will quit easily, painlessly and instantly, as if you were never a smoker. First, Carr deconstructs every single argument for smoking, such as concentration, relaxation, stress coping aid, taste, hobby and so on, showing that they are just incorrect rationalizations of an addicted mind. Then he explains the mechanism of addiction — you smoke to relieve the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, your mind associates sense of relief with the cigarette, therefore cigarette deprivation is so painful, even though it itself doesn't bring pleasure, only returns you to the state, in which non-smokers always are. Finally, he goes through the fears of quitting and deconstructs them by showing that physical withdrawal symptoms are mild, and the cravings are creatures of the deluded mind, that quitting is not a sacrifice and a chore, and the only obstacle was fear.  Carr meticulously describes every facet of smoking, therefore his book doesn't propose written exercises and ideally takes only one reading through to quit smoking. Burns's approach, in contrast, is generic and gradual, he gives you some tools, namely, list of cognitive distortions and a vast amount of written exercises, and asks you to manually apply them in everyday situations. His therapy course lasts for several weeks.  My question is, can Carr's method viewed as a kind of cognitive therapy? What is its relation to a vast ontology of cognitive-behavioral therapy variants, what is the same and what is different? Do mainstream cognitive therapy academics acknowledge Carr's method and his similarities with their approach? "
2561,Is it possible to permanently improve long-term memory?,"Many similar questions here ask either about working or short-term memory, or about various tricks and techniques to efficiently remember information. My question is, is it possible to improve the capability for remembering long-term itself? So that learning/memorizing something would take less time or repetition, and the acquired knowledge/information will be stored for longer and with less distortions.  The effect might not be permanent, but it should be prolonged and substantial. To illustrate my point, let's assume for argument's sake that learning poems has the effect of improving long-term memory. This would mean that, after regularly memorizing new poems for several weeks, i find that i'm able to memorize new poems spending less time, the poems retain remembered for longer. I'm also able to remember content of non-fiction and fiction texts better too, so that i can recall tricky facts and logical inferences, which before memorizing poems i tended to forget. So, is there a method to improve the general efficiency of your long-term memory? In other words, ability to retain more information for longer periods with less effort? "

There are really many fields of applied psychology. However, it seems to me that there is no official Seduction psychology.

This was tested in a working memory experiment involving the   recall of previously presented numbers; in fact, his performance was   no worse than that of control subjects (Smith &amp; Kosslyn, 2007).   If distractions were avoided, how long could HM focus and remember the present or task at hand?  How long could he talk to researcher before forgetting ever meeting him?   I hear that he was tested for hours. During those tests, did he had to be reminded at some time interval about the test procedure? "
2567,What brain regions are activated when a dream is remembered?,"Some people remember dreams, others don't. The same person can wake up with dream recall one day and without on other days. I know that the association between REM sleep and dreaming was initially established by awakening test subjects during REM and asking them what they remember.  My question is about the dream recall phenomenon – imagine a person is woken up from a dream while his brain is being scanned. What is the difference in brain region activations shortly before awakening between the case where a dream is recalled and a dream is not recalled? In both cases polysomnographic readings would conclude that REM is experienced and probability of dreaming is high.  I'm asking this question in relation to this question about working memory of the memory recall patient HM. As I heard about his case, I could not help but think that his ""living in the present"" seems very similar to the experience of dreaming. While dreaming, one does not have a clear memory of the past events, or any desire to even access this memory. I'm trying to understand: can the difference in dream recall for the same test subject be localized to some inhibition of hippocampus or another brain structure, similar to what HM had surgically removed?  Dreams are prone to be ""episodic"", where a continuous dream of say 20 minutes may contain several very distinct scenes (2–5 minutes each) that have no relation to each other. I'm interested if such dream changes involve the same mechanism that HM experienced when he was distracted. "
2568,Terminology for when a person starts to like something they previously didn't like due to exposure from a friend,"What is the term for when a person starts to like something they previously didn't like due to exposure from a friend? What is the term for such phenomenon in social psychology?   For example, I don't like soccer, but since my friend likes and watches a lot of soccer, I also start to like it.  "
2569,"Is the book ""The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance"" worth reading?","I do not know whether this is the most appropriate place to post this question, but since the book is related to psychology, I will post it here.  If there is a more appropriate place to ask this question, please direct me to it.  I'm wondering whether or not the book ""The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance"" is the best in its category (study of expertise) and is worth reading. If not, can you recommend me better books?  Another thing I want to ask is, judging from the table of contents, the book does not seems to cover the domain of expertise on Visual Arts (such as drawing, painting, sculpting, etc.). Is it true? If so what is the reason of the exclusion?  Thanks. "
2570,Why do people suddenly look back if you look at them for a while?,"You possibly are familiar with the following situation, I do not know if this is a researched phenomena or not however.  You look straight at somebody for some time and suddenly, even though he or she does not consciously know that you are looking at him or her, he or she suddenly starts to look back at you.  I am wondering why and how this is happening?  How are people unconsciously recognizing other people looking at them and what makes them look back to them? "
2571,Where to obtain full set of IPIP items on the internet?,I heard that IPIP project consists of 2600 public domain questions. Where I can find download those questions? Is there any web address? 
2572,Are there lying or social desirability items in IPIP pool?,Are there any lie or social desirable questions in the IPIP pool of 2600 question?  Can I construct psychometrically such a scale if it does not exists by default? 
2573,What is the relationship between topographic maps and sensory memory?,"Sensory maps are defined functionally: they exist for a certain time window, are overwritten quickly, are generally inaccessible to introspective control.  Topographic maps are defined biologically: neurons within the map are organized spatially, so that nearby neurons store subtly different information.  Has the relationship between the two been studied in much detail?  Wikipedia tells me that the basis of, say, visual persistence iconic memory is neural persistence.  The kind of question I want an answer to: how adequately can the properties of various retinotopic maps explain known features of visual persistence iconic memory? "
2574,How exactly do we construct perceived IQ by facial features?,"There are claims that humans can recognize others' IQ.   What's the difference between the below images that shows men's IQ?    Personally, I can ""feel"" that the guy with high perceived intelligence (on the right) does indeed look the most intelligent.  However, what is the reason behind this gut feeling? The nose being wider? Is it  the slanting eyes? I found the associated grid drawings, but I still can't seem to figure it out. "
2575,Is it possible to devise a scientifically valid model for personality preferences or tendencies?,"I have been interested in preferences, personality types and related topics for about two years, mainly as a by-product of a personal introspection process. For a long while, I have been quite enthusiastic about Myers-Briggs types, and saw the whole typology thing as an interesting model that can provide insights about ourselves. Nevertheless, I have now realized many of its pitfalls, like the often too categorical classifications and bogus descriptions, and more importantly the lack of scientific testability. I have studied some alternatives like enneagram, but these models seem to fall within the same class of funny, interesting but probably not very scientific toys.  So, my question: is it possible to devise a scientifically valid, testeable model for personality preferences or tendencies? Does something like ""personality"" exist or is just mumbo-jumbo? "
2576,Full list of the capabilities of human brain,"I am studying the concept of multi-tasking. The premise upon which I am asking this question is my belief that multi-tasking is a myth(as discussed in a few books on the same topic) and that the brain processes its tasks/brain requests sequentially, one by one. The moment we try doing two tasks, that interfere with each other in terms of the areas of brain that are activated while doing those tasks, we hit an efficiency bottleneck; our efficiency of brain resource usage goes down.   The same belief now led me to think that an efficient way of performing any task is to schedule the task in the brain in such a way that its adjacent tasks have no chance to interfere with the current task in terms of their usage of brain's resources. So, what are those different brain resources that together accomplish an activity? Can anybody give me a full list of the abilities of the brain as per the latest scientific results available?  In the process I tried to list down the various activities that we enjoy doing while we are able to give our full attention/concentration to them and then tried to see what are the varieties of things that a brain can actually do, so that we can quickly identify the activity and classify it in terms of its effect on brain's usage.  A few significant things brains beautifully do are:  calculations(math) = counting  Literature = imagination + verbal  music skills = counting + aesthetic  learning new language = memory + verbal usage + pattern detection  falling in love = reproductive + courting  imagery and sexual fantasy = reproductive + visual imagination + aesthetics  poetry = verbal + counting(metre) etc  traveling = recall + curiosity  adventure = same as above  sports = strategy + motor skills etc etc etc  The above list includes the types of creative activities that brain does, but does not list the basic, elementary set of abilities that together accomplish these activities. So my question here is, what are those various distinct faculties that a brain uses to accomplish a task? You may provide a list of all the faculties(RHS of the above ""so called"" equations :)), or map the different parts of brain with unique abilities, or provide a totally different way of looking at the brain altogether...  For more clarity:  As an analogy with a computer system which has processing units and related resources like ALUs, Memory, etc what are the different processing unit and resources in the brain which together accomplish a task. I am looking for that list basically "
2577,What do the weights of an artificial neural network represent in biological neurons?,"In artificial neural networks the connections between neurons are a assigned numbers called ""weights"" or ""parameters"". As new data is fed into the neural net, these weights change. This is how the neural net ""learns"".  I'm trying to understand what these weights might correspond to in a real  brain. The idea occurred to me that it might represent the strength of the myelination on the connections between real neurons.  Is this a correct understanding?  Does the degree of myelineation along an axon vary over time as the neural net processes more experiences? "
2578,Can rationalization be objectively recognized?,"   In psychology and logic, rationalization or rationalisation (also known as making excuses[1]) is a defense mechanism in which controversial behaviors or feelings are justified and explained in a seemingly rational or logical manner to avoid the true explanation, and are made consciously tolerable – or even admirable and superior – by plausible means.[2] It is also an informal fallacy of reasoning.[3] - [website]Is it possible to objectively recognize that someone is rationalizing?  Is it possible to make an individual realize that s\he is rationalizing when it happens?  Is it possible to assess an individual's tendency to rationalize? "
2579,Do subjects with a missing cerebellum have a superior ability to verbalize motion sequences?,"Since the function of the cerebellum in patients with cerebellar hypoplasia needs to be taken over by other brain components such as the motor cortex, and since the cortex is the source of language, is it easier for these patients to verbalize their movements, i.e. are all their movements voluntary? Or does the brain stem rather replace the cerebellum's function? "
2580,Moral Foundations Theory and trigger word combinations,"Moral foundations theory splits morality into six categories. In his book, The Righteous Mind, Haidt mentioned that looking at church sermons of southern baptist vs less conservative christian Church sermons showed strong moral splits into ""Conservative"" and ""Liberal"" mindsets, defined by subsets of the six foundations, in particular those that triggered more often in the texts. Specifically, this was done using a predefined list such as this one and then doing a word count for each category, thereby binning the sermon into one of the two mindsets. Lets call such words ""trigger words.""   My question is the following: has there been any work done on looking at combinations of these trigger words from different categories? Let me be more specific. Lets take the sentence:  ""Hurting a dog is one of the worst things a person can do.""   One such trigger word here is ""hurting"" which is a vice of the Care foundation. This is something that appeals to the Care foundation and will, statistically speaking, be highly agreed with by the Liberal mindset. Also there will generally be less agreement with this from the Conservative mindset. Now, what if we write the sentence as:  ""We must respect dogs.""  Here, ""respect"" is a trigger word for the Conservative mindset. Moreover, consider the sentence:  ""Hurting dogs is one of the worst things a person can do. We must respect all animals and those who harm them are evil, wicked and sick.""   I've purposely overloaded the last sentence with Sanctity and Respect trigger words.  Question 1: If one overloads sentences as done above, will it trigger more positive reactions from the Conservative mindset?  Question 2: When asked to explain the above overloaded sentences, will both Liberal and Conservative mindsets agree on a similar meaning (""don't hurt dogs"")?  Question 3: In other words, is there evidence for the ability to trigger low-priority foundations by invoking high-priority ones for a given mindset? I'm am relying here on the notion that words are generally ambiguous and context-dependent. As well, I am assuming reactions and parsing of meaning is instantaneous and the subject is not given time to reflect and analyze, i.e. intuition.  I'm grossly oversimplifying things here but I hope the general theme of these questions will lead to a nice discussion. "
2581,What's the optimal way to space out rewards in order to maximise motivation?,"I'm working on an educational product, and we're thinking of introducing some gamified aspects to motivate students to use the product. One of these will be the concept of 'levels' - when a student does enough lessons in a particular topic, their 'level' in that topic will increase.   Is there any kind of research on how to best space these 'levels' out in order to maximise motivation? If students can progress through levels too quickly then leveling up will be devalued, but if it takes too long to get through levels then they may be less motivated because the end won't be in sight. How long should we aim for students to take to get through a level? 1 week? 1 month? 1 year?   Any advice on how to approach this problem would be greatly appreciated. "
2582,Is the Flynn effect in conflict with other studies of intelligence heritablity?,"Studies comparing identical and fraternal twins, or occasionally identical twins reared apart have mostly concluded that there is a pretty high heritability of IQ. These studies, in particular the identical twins reared apart studies, imply that someone with the same genes but different environment would have a highly similar IQ.  The Flynn effect, though, shows that people's average IQ is increasing, around 15 points every 50 years. All the explanations I have encountered (like this one, from James Flynn himself) focus on environmental reasons for this, for example culture, education, perhaps better health. They seem to imply that someone with the same genes in a different environment might have a very different IQ.  Are these two in direct contradiction with each other, or is there some way of reconciling them? If they are mutually exclusive, with which does the scientific consensus lie? "
2583,Is it ethically appropriate for a client to buy their psychologist a gift?,"I have been having free psychology therapy in my school for almost one year. Now the therapeutic relationship is coming to end. I want to give a small gift to my therapist to show my gratitude when my therapy is over.    Are psychologists forbidden from  receiving gift from clients by their ethical code? Alternatively, under what circumstances would it be appropriate?   "
2584,Do introverted people have more emotional stress?,"Social support has several times been linked to psychological well-being and even physical health.  Some studies have also shown that shyness correlates stronger with introversion than with neuroticism.  This implies that less social people should score lower on physical health and mental well-being.  Note that I am not asking if introversion causes emotional stress, but rather if extroverts are better at coping with emotional stress because their extraversion give better odds for social support.  Is there any research on correlations between extraversion, physical and mental health?  References:   [website]Where in the Big5 does shyness belong?  "
2585,What explains involuntary imitation of behavior such as shrugging?,"Recently, I watched a discussion program on TV and one of the participants shrugged. I found that, not only did I do the same, but I seemed to do it in synchrony the speaker. I didn't want to do this, why would I?  It's easy to find popular discussions online about contagious yawning but I haven't found any about shrugs.  It occurs to me that there may be other such involuntary imitative movements - raising eyebrows for example.  Questions  Is there a technical name for this type of involuntary imitation? I have tried searching online but either I haven't found the right search terms or there is nothing to find.  What explanation can we give? In what way might this be adaptive behaviour? "
2586,Is fear in response to the sight of predators innate or acquired?,"Children of very small age have less knowledge. They have very limited knowledge about harm, fear, etc.  Can children feel fear with such little knowledge?  Let us assume a child is playing in the house and suddenly a lion comes into the house. Does the child feel fear upon seeing it?  The child does not know that the lion is harmful at all. Does the child's brain indicate that something bad is going to happen just by seeing the lion?  If the child feels fear in situations like that, does the brain have inbuilt knowledge related to such issues?  Note: The lion does not make any noise. It is just approaching the child slowly.  Is fear in response to the sight of predators innate or acquired? "
2587,How do hormones influence personality?,"I would like to see a specific type of answer to the question, namely, one that answers the following more specific questions: do hormones influence what people terminally value, that is, the things people as an end-in-itself? Or do hormones change people's emotional reactions to events, and since people are influenced by their emotions, this in turn influences their personality? Or do hormones bias people's world views, for example by making them think that being aggressive will be more or less successful at, say, getting someone to do what they want? Or do hormones affect a combination of these? Or do hormones affect something else entirely?  The material I have come across, for example this, describe what personality traits hormones influence, but not how they do so. "
2588,How do you analyse visual analogue scales with an ambiguous response?,"For example, I might ask participants to complete a visual analogue scale for pain. They would be given a line that is 100mm long, and one end says 0 (No pain) and the other end says 100 (worst possible pain). The participant is asked to make a mark on the line with a pencil or pen to rate their level of pain. I would then use a ruler to measure the distance from the origin. E.g. how many millimeters away it is from the start of the line (i.e. zero). The problem is that many times, people do not place a mark such as an x on the line, but they might circle a part of the line, or put a tick (check mark) there instead. I attach a picture of the standard response (participant 1) followed by 5 possible scenarios where the answer is ambiguous (participants 2 to 7), so I have left it as missing data/blank. Should these be excluded from the dataset (coded as missing data) or are some of them salvageable?      By way of explanation: In number 2) the line is very large so there isn’t one place that it intersects the horizontal line (usually it has to be accurate to the nearest mm). Participant 3) has placed a circle on the line so it is difficult to say where on the line they meant.  Participant number 4) has circled one of the numbers at the end. Can I be sure that they meant 0? Participant 7 is a variation on this. Participant 5) has placed a tick (check) mark underneath the line (or sometimes they place a tick on the line itself). Which part of the tick do I measure from? Participant 6) has placed a tick (check) mark on one of the numbers at the end of the scale. Can I be sure that they meant 100? What is the best way to minimize bias while maximizing the use of the available data? Any thoughts would be appreciated.  "
2589,How big is the psychological impact of having no friends?,"I've been a loner all my life. I've found that I'm scared of ""hanging out"" with people I don't know or making new friends. I don't want this question to be personalised as such, but I didn't know how else to ask it. I've been hurt as a very small child from other kids my age, bullied and never saw other resembling the teens close to my then age the same ever again.  Could a person that has had no friends ever hope to be a person worth being around? I really do not care if your answers do not apply to my situation, or if it is answers I interpret wrongly or apply incorrectly - I understand I've asked this on the internet and not seeked a professional for this. I just want opinions on this, as I do not have anyone to talk to and paying for it is financially overwhelming for my family at this stage.  I feel that people that has had no friends and have been sheltered in other ways as well has little chance of getting to know other people or becoming someone that other people would perceive as interesting. If ever someone would approach them to ask if they wouldn't want to hang out, they would not be sure whether it is pity or whether they would have ANYTHING in common - thus uncertainty and avoidance are what are usually chosen. I find it hard to believe that people that has had friends all their lives, have fit in all their lives, would ever be able to enjoy the same conversations they are used to having-( with other popular people, kids with money and hobbies, over mutual interests and bold, vibrant personalities) with someone that's never had friends, for whom that is like another planet.  We all know friends influence the person you are, and shape you into who you are. But what of the person that has never had that? Without any input from anyone near their age? Sheltered among the sheltered...  Could a person that has never had friends, make one? Or hope to overcome this psychological barrier that causes them to believe other people are other people, and they are them? Even if they did, that wouldn't erase the lack of social development, thus people wouldn't want them to be friends with themselves.  Also- what is the psychological impact of having no friends? I probably experienced it, but cannot see what it really is because I've never known what ""socially psychologically healthy"" to compare it to.   Thankyou very much! "
2590,What's the difference between short term memory and working memory?,What's the difference between short term memory and working memory? and how does the process work? 
2591,Does adult neurogenesis occur only in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus?,"The scholarpedia article on this subject says:     Adult neurogenesis is the process of generating new neurons which   integrate into existing circuits after fetal and early postnatal   development has ceased. In most mammalian species, adult neurogenesis   only appears to occur in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus.   The Scholarpedia entry is dated 2007. Has there any more recent evidence been uncovered showing adult neurogenesis in other parts of the brain? If it is linked to brain plasticity, surely it would be useful to many more areas? "
2592,What is the corresponding study about the effects of growing up without a mother?,"We know that deprivation of a father affects development of children - and leads to them being angrier and more depressed as an adult:     ‘This is the first time research findings have shown that paternal deprivation during development affects the neurobiology of the offspring.’ (Spencer, 2013)   The research article this was based on was:      Bambico, F. R., Lacoste, B., Hattan, P. R., &amp; Gobbi, G. (2013). Father absence in the monogamous California mouse impairs social behavior and modifies dopamine and glutamate synapses in the medial prefrontal cortex. Cerebral Cortex, 25(5), 1163-1175.   DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bht310   So there must be a corresponding study of development changes without a mother. What are the corresponding effects?  My question is: What is the corresponding study about the effects of growing up without a mother? "
2593,Are psychometrics used in the public sector?,"If it is used, how is it used? Where is it used? Which countries are using? "
2594,Can people act randomly?,Let's imagine an experiment. We will tell N normal people that they need to act randomly in the Rock–paper–scissors game (in this game Game Optimal Strategy is to choose an action with uniform probability 1/3).  Two question:   How close to uniformly randomness can we expect each person to act?  More important question. Will this be a stationary distribution or it will change over the time if there will be a lot of trials?   (People in the experiment can't use any kind of external random generators). 
2595,Can individuals with schizophrenia be talked out of their delusions?,"Are there any conversion tricks or strategies to talk an individual with schizophrenia out of their delusions?  Suppose one has a friend who is delusional, and the friend believes there is a conspiracy going on against him. Although the the extent e.g. people and time required to orchestrate such a conspiracy would be impossible, this person does not think of it as such. Complicating matters is the fact that this person declines to take antipsychotics, precisely because he believes this is what his enemies would like him to do.  How might one talk this person out of their delusions? "
2596,Best meditation techniques to overcome Behavioral Addictions?,"Meditation seems to be one of the top techniques recommended nowadays for self-development (e.g. McGonigal, K. 2011). For people who want to overcome behavioural addictions (i.e. any ""addiction that involves a compulsion to engage in a rewarding non-drug-related behavior – sometimes called a natural reward"", such as food, sex, masturbation, pornography, gambling, internet, video games, nail biting, compulsive skin picking, compulsive hair pulling, etc.):   Which meditation techniques (e.g. mindfulness, Vipassana, Yoga, Zazen, TM, Kundalini, etc.) are the most recommendable, according to state-of-the-art Psychology and Neuroscience? Additionally, given the fact that an average layman cannot afford going full-time monk, what would be a recommendable frequency of the practice (in terms of minutes/hours per day) to see palpable results in a reasonable time?   Furthermore:   Is a single meditation technique enough to overcome behavioral addictions? Or would it better to practice multiple meditation techniques at the same time? Or maybe different meditation techniques for different situations? For instance, are there any special meditation techniques to handle strong, compulsive urges in the presence of addiction cues/triggers?   Finally:   Is meditation as a whole enough, or would one need to complement it with other non-meditative practices or measures? For example, positive affirmations, hypnosis, or maybe going to a therapist, exercising, sleeping 8+ hours, etc. I'm just throwing some ideas around.   References  McGonigal, K.

2597,Are cycles possible in circuits of neurons?,"If we consider neurons nodes and connections between them edges, are cycles (from graph theory) are possible in the brain?  To put it another way, would the signal generated from neuron1 be able to travel around in a circuit of other neurons and come back to activate neuron1 again? Or is this generally not possible because neuron1 would still be recovering/re-potentiating?  If yes, as a programmer I would expect this to be the mechanism by which contiguous experience would be possible (ie. the main event loop of an application). Any studies/field/reseachers you could point me to for further research? "
2598,Word for naming your negative self-talk to overcome it,"I'm trying to find some research - or at least a professional analysis - on the concept of naming your negative self-talk so that you can ""take away its power"" - that is, separate it from yourself and dismiss it.  I've also heard this referred to as ""naming your fear.""  For example, an actor might name his negative self-talk ""the critic"" so that he can dismiss those thoughts as being ""just the critic running his mouth.""    Another example (and the one that I'm specifically curious about) is in software engineering, where there's a lot of talk about ""imposture syndrome,"" which in this context is just a fancy way of describing the common experience of feeling like you're underqualified for the job you're doing.  Giving it such a formal name has the added benefit of being ""proof"" that it's an irrational fear - that is, ""Even qualified people are afraid that they're underqualified, so me thinking that I'm  underqualified doesn't mean that it's true.""  The specific questions that I'm trying to answer are:    Is there a name for this kind of technique? Have there been any studies done on this technique? Specifically relating to the ""imposture syndrome"" example, how is this different from hypochondria?  And, Are there any related concepts that I might want to take a look at?  "
2599,What's the difference between cognitive distortions and logical fallacies?,"I'm doing some reading on said topics, but I struggle to really make a difference between them.  I've gathered that logical fallacies are flaws in reasoning, or arguments that serve poorly to arrive at the truth.  Cognitive distortions are our mind convincing us of something that isn't true.  So couldn't logical fallacies be said also to be convincing us of something that isn't true, in the case where they are unintentional? I can see several instances where there is no real difference. Take for example the distortion of emotional reasoning (I feel X, therefore X must be true). Why is this not a logical fallacy given the logical reasoning within the parentheses? "
2600,Should I look at the data of an experiment before the dataset is complete?,"For a research internship I am running psychological experiments online. As it takes a while until the experiment is done (meaning that enough people participated, so that a sufficient sample size is reached), I could already look at the data and run a few analyses with that incomplete data set. This way I could already see a trend in what the final result might be.  Are there any methodological reasons that would speak against that? For example, am I biasing myself in this way? Or is there any other reason this could be considered bad research practice? "
2601,What's a simple definition for reactive attachment disorder?,"I read an article on Reactive Attachment Disorder.  Here's what I know so far   Reactive means to react in response to something. Action = reaction. Attachment is the act of bonding or connecting with another human or object. Disorder, something that is not normal by way of what society thinks as normal.   Here's what I do not know. Does RAD mean that someone is too emotionally attached to someone or something, and when that person or thing is gone, they react, sort of like grief? Or, does it mean that the person cannot trust oneself to connect or bond with others for fear of something bad happening as a result of that? "
2602,What would be the Term for this Character Trait?,"This might be the wrong place or way to ask this question but I'll give it a shot. It could be more related to literature but it does deal with a form of character or personality.   In Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""Young Goodman Brown"", the ""protagonist"" wakes up from a dream (or vision, maybe even reality) of all his religious towns folk members taking part in blatant evil deeds. The next morning, his perception of everyone changes to the point he (not exactly) distrusts everyone because of what he saw and eventually dies lonely due to his callous nature. Nathaniel made this in order to warn against this type of action or character trait but what is a term for this, this trait? This callous behavior due to an imperfect/changed perspective? Is it a combination of terms? "
2603,Is it recommendable to put participants in different conditions across trials?,"In a pilot study we want to give participants 3 different problems. Those come in two versions, one (supposedly) easier than the other. Participants will randomly be assigned one version of the problems. The goal is to compare the performance on each version of each of the problems. What might be problematic however, is that if it is true that one version is easier, giving some participants three times the easy version and others three times the hard version might affect their motivation. The participants with the difficult problems might get more exhausted and demotivated and will possibly not try as hard on each problem that follows.  One solution would be to randomize the assignment for each problem independently, so that participants might receive two times the easy version and one time the harder one, or any other combination.   From a methodological standpoint, would that be recommendable? Could the observations still be considered independent when comparing the two conditions? Or is there any other way to circumvent that problem? "
2604,Can the mind be trained to equanimously observe compulsive urges/cravings (without giving in / acting out)?," Are there any practices or habits that one can employ, either frequently or on a daily basis, to train one's mind to equanimously observe (be aware of) compulsive urges or cravings, without giving in to them / acting them out? Can this skill be developed in a general sense, applicable to all types of urges/cravings, or does one need to train a different, tailored technique to handle each type of urge/craving individually?  "
2605,Why do people have different opinions about an object when they are given different information about that object?,"I'm studying about perception in psychology. My teacher has an example.  In an experiment, the researcher gives two groups a photo of one person. To Group 1, researcher says ""This is a scientist"", group 1 usually reacts ""He has a bright and intelligent face, great mind are shown on his eyes"". To group 2, researcher says ""This is a murder"", group 2 usually reacts ""He had a dangerous face, he seems angry all the time"".  How do you explain that using perception in psychology? does that experiment truly exist? Is there any real similar experiment?  Someone tells me it's because of ""Confirmation Bias"". It's the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. I doubt it. "
2606,Rat between two walls viewed as a product in a category,"I'm reading the book ""A New Foundation for Representation in Cognitive Brain Science -  Category Theory and the Hippocampus"" by Jaime Gómez-Ramirez (a terrible book, if you ask me).  On p. 164 the author introduces the product of two objects in a category. I.e. the product of two objects [tex] and [tex] in a category [tex] is another object [tex] equipped with two morphisms [tex] and [tex] such that for any pair of morphisms [tex] and [tex] there is a unique morphism [tex] making the figure commute.    The author goes on to say that the main characteristic of a product is that the constituents are retrievable via the projections. The following example is given: Let [tex] and [tex] be two walls that the delimit the maze a rat is moving in. After reaching both walls, the rat would develop the concept of a middle point [tex]. This middle point [tex] corresponds to the categorial product [tex].  I struggle to make sense of this. If the walls, or more generally, any location in the maze, are objects in a category, then what are the arrows (morphisms)? My first guess is: paths. Translated into the maze-world: There is a ""concept"" [tex] that gives me paths from each wall to the middle [tex]. And given any point [tex] in the maze there is a unique path [tex] from [tex] to [tex]. This interpretation doesn't make sense at all.  The second guess is that the walls [tex] are not actual locations in space, but the rat's concepts of these walls. But it is still unclear, what the arrows between concepts are supposed to be.  Is there a way to make sense of this? Specifically, what exactly is this ""maze-category""? Because to me, so far, this is just half-baked, abstract nonsense jibber jabber.  Any pointers to more substantial literature would be greatly appreciated! "
2607,Is getting trapped in an asylum a realistic scenario?,"In various movies, most recently Unsane (2018), a scenario is painted in which a healthy person gets committed and trapped in an insane asylum and the caretakers there are more or less indifferent to whether she is actually sane or not.  In the movie she ""voluntarily"" commits herself by signing a form, so presumably she will not be afforded the protections some states give to involuntarily committed people.  Is this scenario realistic in the United States? Can a person who ""voluntarily"" commits themself, be turned into a medicated prisoner with no recourse for freeing themself? "
2608,Diagnosis for consistently preceiving mild displeasure as personal threats?,"I'm aware the site does not accept self-help questions, but I think this one can be answered in a situation-independent way. So   Is it possible for someone to exaggerate mild displeasure (justfiable or unjustifiable through social norm) as personal threats?  And what does it mean?  "
2609,Is there a robust method to prove the existence of reincarnation?,"Is there a how-to to prove reincarnation?  And secondly, I would like to lessen bad action from the previous life. And how do I do that? "
2610,Is there a difference in time based goals and achievement goals?,Suppose I want to practice my calculus. Has a study been conducted which shows a difference between setting a goal like: 'I will study calculus for one hour' and 'I will study chapter 3 from my calculus textbook' in terms of completion?  Does one method have a higher failure rate than the other? Does one have a higher chance to begin the task? 
2611,What ways are there to think?,"When I think, I generally think in words (in English primarily, though sometimes in Russian). Essentially, I speak to myself in my mind, and ask questions and formulate plans. However, sometimes I think without words; I am still thinking with my conscious and not doing something out of instinct.   Example: I am being given a choice between two apples. I will usually think to myself, ""I think I have tasted this apple recently and it was horrible,"" and choose the other one. Or, I might take a moment to decide which one tastes better, but without talking to myself.   I am fairly confident that I have been told from some people that they never think in words. Is this possible?  What other ways are there to think? Do some people think in images? (With the apple example, they would maybe visualize a couple images of them biting into the apple, of a similar apple they have seen, etc.  Or, perhaps, do some people think in scents? I do not imagine how this would work, because when I attempt to recall a scent or taste, I cannot recall it exactly; rather I think about whether it is good or bad, about when I enjoy it and with what, etc.   How would all this work on the neurological level? I am no professional in this area, but a suggestion is that thought in words happens in the section of the brain responsible for speech, and thought without words happens in the subconscious.   Sidenote: When I do math, I also think the names of the numbers or signs in my head, unless it is one I just invented. I know some people do not. This slows me down a lot in math, but also allows me to understand more.  Sidenote #2 (Edit): This question is asking about all the ways to think (this is the difference between it and the linked questions), and is looking primarily at personal experience-based answers. "
2612,Why does daylight-saving have such a big impact on us and weekends don't?,"Last weekend, at least in Germany, the clock got switched from 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM.  Today I found a few articles, that suggest, that the daylight-saving has a big impact on people. Judges punish harder and myocardial infarction rises after daylight saving. I've found those articles in here, which is a trustworthy German newspaper.  How is it, that just one hour of delay, has such a big impact on us? Me and most people I know, heavily change their sleeping habits on the weekends anyway. As for me, I stay up 2-4 hours later than usual, which is why I can't believe, that 1 hour makes such a difference.  Most people can sleep long on weekends anyways, so there shouldn't even be one hour of sleep missing.  Are those articles maybe drawing the wrong conclusions and connecting two things that might be correlated, but not linked?  This SE question is related, but rather holds the information that I already got from the linked newspaper article.  Sidenote: Since sleep mainly happens in our brain I posted this in psychology &amp; neuroscience, I hope this is correct. If it rather belongs in Biology please let me know. I also couldn't find any more tags than ""sleep"". If you can think of more feel free to tell me. "
2613,Preconditioning before asking a favor,"Suppose I want to borrow an item, such as a phone charger from someone.  Instead of directly asking them, ""Could I borrow a charger?""  I first ask this question: ""Do you have a charger?""  The act of asking a question of fact (whether they have the item or not) will make them more willing to lend you the item.  Is there a term or explanation for this?   Is this related or similar to the Ben Franklin effect and Anchoring effect? "
2614,"What is a ""norming experiment""?","I am a non-psychologist reading some papers from psychology. I keep seeing the term ""norming experiment"" (e.g. ""Normative Representation of Objects: Evidence for an Ecological Bias in Object Perception an d Memory"" by Konkle and Oliva). What do psychologists or neuroscientists mean by a ""norming experiment""? It seems like the idea is to see which presentations of a stimulus  are preferred to others? "
2615,How much pleasure can brain endure?,"As of 2018, is it possible to induce pleasure in humans by some intervention like sending electrical signals? I've read that it's been done on mice. If not, it's quite imaginable that it will become possible in the near future. What would be the neurological implications of such intervention, other than addiction? I mean what would happen to the brain if we force the brain to stay in an orgasm-like or ecstasy state for several minutes? What are the possible adverse effects or damages? Of course that we know very little yet, but I appreciate to get some insights on how pleasure works, and if there really are pleasure centers in the brain that can be easily manipulated.  "
2616,What is the name of the introvert-extravert concentration scale diagram?,"I heard Dr Brian Little stand up and give a great talk on personality types.   On one of his slides - he showed a 'concentration scale diagram' with introverts at the top, ambiverts in the middle, and extraverts at the bottom. He made the point that optimal concentration is in the middle of the diagram - where the ambiverts are.   (You can see it in the video here from a different presentation at 8:23)  His subsequent point was that the caffeine in coffee had an 'upward pushing effect' - which would lift an extravert into an optimal zone of concentration, but would have a negative effect on an introvert. (They would be lifted away from the optimal zone of concentration.   My question is: What is the name of the introvert-extravert concentration scale diagram? "
2617,Is there evidence to suggest that receiving angry emails increases stress levels?,"There are plenty of helpful descriptions of how to avoid angry emails. The reasoning is largely that it doesn't solve the problem. That is, sending an email whilst angry causes more problems for you than it solves.   But what about the recipient? Logically and analytically we know that people don't respond well to an emotive email. But is there statistical or experimental evidence of the changes in brain/body state (or behaviour) that occur when people receive emotive emails?  My question is: Is there evidence to suggest that receiving angry emails increases stress levels? "
2618,Testing earworms without ethical problems,"Earworms (or sometimes referred as sticky tunes, involuntary musical imagery, stuck songs) is a phenomenon that many people experience in their daily lives.  Although several studies suggest that they do not last more than several days, there is a case where the song was stuck in a man's head for over 33 years.  It seems to be ethically problematic to test which songs create earworms, because the melodies may be stuck in participants' heads, even if they knew about the aim and possible consequences of the study.  Is there any way to test which songs create earworms without any ethical troubles? I can only think of doing a descriptive research, asking ""Do you know this song? How sticky is this song?"" but making conclusions from this data would be quite difficult.  Or maybe I should add this question: Since mostly earworms last for a few days, it is not probable that the participant will have an earworm that negatively affects his/her life. So, can I do an experiment about earworms since an ethical problem is highly unlikely? "
2619,How do psychometric employee screening tests work and how can students tackle them?,"I've given several psychometric tests for various companies without giving it a second thought but now that I think about it, it seems quite deep and fascinating. I'd like to understand, if anyone care to explain, what do these tests try to measure, how can one create such a test to use in teams &amp; hiring processes and finally, can someone 'prepare' for a psychometric test to do better? if yes, how? (Both in advance as well as when only a few hours are remaining.)  Thanks! "
2620,How can fear paralysis be overcome?,"For a person with slight phobia of fear paralysis, (A fear that in critical situation when he will most need to react fast to save his (or loved ones) lives he will just be sitting there paralyzed watching his demise...)  This question answers on the mechanism that causes fear paralysis...  Is there any technique to 'snap out of it'?   I mean we had quite a few wars and cataclysms like tsunamis and earthquakes  so I would expect for some research done, at least by military...  How can fear paralysis be overcome? "
2621,How does fear paralysis occur?,(This question is in relation to this question here)  How does fear paralysis occur? What is the mechanism that makes this happen in brain? 
2622,Activation of brain reasoning areas during dreaming,"I would say that dreaming is like any conscious experience, except that objective reasoning is turned off. Do fMRI imaging studies indicate that the reasoning centers of the brain are inactive during REM sleep? Are other sensory sections, like the visual cortex active?  By reasoning centers of the brain, I am referring to area(s) specifically associated with logic. "
2623,Difference between reverse inference and decoding (e.g. MVPA) in fMRI,"Reverse inference, i.e. the use of brain activation (fMRI) data to infer the engagement of a certain mental function, is heavily criticised (e.g., Poldrack 2011, Neuron).   At the same time, decoding, the process of applying machine learning algorithms to such brain activation patterns in order to infer something about the mental function that elicited this response (e.g. to distinguish between two different conditions in an fMRI experiment), is extensively used and actively developed - multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) being just the most widespread of these techniques.   The two concepts appear, however, to be one and the same; or rather, that the second (decoding) is a special case of the first (reverse inference). Is there an additional nuance to their difference? Also, why is decoding not criticised in the same way as reverse inference? "
2624,What makes people like other people?,"Humans have this strange behavior: Some people like other people which are disliked by a third party of people. But there are also people that are generally disliked by most ofthe others.  Let me make an example:  Person A, B and C like Person D Person B, C and D like Person F, but A hates F Person A, C and D like Person G, but B hates G Person F and G get along well with C ...  How can you explane this strange behavior?  Some people can't get along with each other, but both have common friends, that get along with both of them. So it can't be like that they are so different from a cultural standpoint, because they have common friends that get along with both.  Do you get the point?  However there are people that are liked by most of the People and there are also people, that are commonly disliked by the majority of people.  What are they doing right/wrong?  If you say, ""people like those who are similar to them"", how can it be, that A and D don't get along, if both are similar to B, which can get along with both?  What are A and D doing wrong, so that they can't get along. Due to the fact, that B get's along with both, which means, that both aren't bad persons and people you can get along with.  Can you generally say what makes the difference in these groups of people? Where do these preferences come from and why do some not get along? The question is not, what makes someone likable (that is asked here What makes you like someone?), it's more on how to determine wheter two people like eachother or not, on what is this based and can you influence it.  Is maby, the way people get introduced, a factor? What are the big factors  Edit:  As mentioned below, the question might be rephrased to: ""How can you describe this behaviour""? (I don't wan't to boil it down to one factor (and it's probably impossible to list all of them), but I would like to get a general Idea, on how this works. "
2625,What makes you like someone?,"Everyone has some friends and some people, you can't get along with. But what makes them different?  Is it smell, the voice, attractiveness, the way they express themselves, their sence of humor?  I can try, as hard as I want, to like some people, but they appeal just not sympathic to me. I'ts not that they are bad people or mean and I can have a good conversation with them, but somehow, I just don't like them.  I know, liking someone is highly subjective, but this is exactely my question! Which factors decide upon, whether you like someone or not.   And how can it be that some people are generally liked and disliked? What is their factor?  This is not a duplicate of What makes people like other people?, which is asking for group behaviour. I would like to know, what makes an Individual likable or not.  I'd much rather have a list of factoras as an Answer than an explanation (the explanation is asked for in the previously mentioned question).  In other words, ""what makes someone likable""? "
2626,How does a person who wears prism glasses through which the world is perceived upside-down experience the transition back to normal?,"If someone wears prism glasses that turn the visual field upside down (see this video), this person will eventually adapt and see the world in its normal orientation again. Now my question is, how does the person wearing these glasses perceive the transition from upside-down back to normal after the prism glasses are taken off? "
2627,Do antidepressants provide a permanent solution for depression and anxiety?,"Antidepressants works temporarily (as long as you take them), and also affects the cognitive behaviour. Should they be seen as a permanent solution for depression? Shouldn't we find a solution at the psychosocial level, which actually works rather than suppressing the thoughts? "
2628,Study about how position of head influences thoughts,"I'm wondering if there are any studies on how (or if) the position of the head changes our thoughts or dreams. Mainly I mean when lying down, as I experienced it is hard to keep the thoughts that where there moments ago when I turn from one side to another in bed. I guess this can be explained by how the blood flows in our brains, that one side gets more blood than the other when lying on your side. But does that mean you could influence your dreams by your sleeping position? Would you react differently to outside influences depending on what your head position is?   I have to mention I have no knowledge at all in these kind of stuff and I'm just asking out of curiosity. Does anyone know about something like this?  "
2629,Do grammatical differences in language affect politics?,"I tried very hard to find references on this in Google Scholar and Web of Science, but I fear I don't have enough experience with this area.  My partner is great at Spanish, and informed me that in the Spanish language you don't say ""I lost the jacket,"" you say something like ""The jacket was lost to me.""  Could such grammatical differences lead to increases in collectivist culture or more tightly knit social fabrics in places like Mexico as opposed to individualist countries like the US?  Is this question too big? How would you find any relevant studies on this? Are there any other phenomena you are aware of where the structure of a language affects macro phenomena like culture? "
2630,Anti-depressant medicine and memory loss,"Can anti depressant medicine cause memory loss  ? Seen many suffering from cognitive problems after taking anti-depressants and for some , it went worse even after medicine was stopped.What can be the possible reasons? "
2631,Difference between the cingulate gyrus and the cingulate cortex,"I am doing an analysis of the brain of the Creature in Frankenstein by looking at its actions and experiences from a scientific perspective. For this, I was wondering:  What is the difference between the Cingulate Gyrus and the Cingulate Cortex? What is the function of these structures? "
2632,Does a true hallucination need to go away while plugging one's ears?,Can an auditory hallucination be true hallucination even if the person clàims that it doesnot reduces in volume when he plugs his ears. Similarly can a visual hallucination still be a true hallucination even when it doesn't disappear when person closes his eyes?? 
2633,What is the point of living a life if we're all going to eventually die?,"So I've had this question over the past week since New Years. I am currently 21 years old and yea, time flies so fast. New years just feels like one year closer to death. Can you believe it? The internet was founded around the years when I was born. Can you believe where we are today? Can you believe that it's 70% through the decade already? Yet 7 years ago, I was barely in high school and iPads were invented?  So at the start of New Years, I've started to get this feeling ""what is the point of living life if eventually we'll all die""? And furthermore, I got another question. If we die, doesn't everything come to an end? Don't you lose memory of absolutely everything you've done in life? So in other words, what's the point of doing things in life if we're all going to eventually die and never even remember what we've done? Maybe other people might but would you personally have remembered this upon your death? I'm talking in a non-religious point of view. From a scientific logical point of view, everything you've done in life comes to an end and you cannot even backtrack anything to trace your memories or whatnot. I don't believe that scientifically there is a such thing as ""afterlife"" or whatnot.   So really, I got extremely depressed over the past few days thinking about this question. I mean you can be the richest person in the world right now but in probably ~80 years, you'll completely forget about that. Or otherwise you can live in total misery and poverty but you'll forget about it maybe 50 years later.   So this question has struck my head really hard. I felt like I didn't want to do anything. What is the actual point of life if we're all going to die no matter what we have accomplished? "
2634,Exercise and physical activity questionnaire,"I'm wondering if there exists a validated questionnaire designed to assess the duration/intensity/type of physical activity someone has taken part in over the past 1-3 days?  I've seen many questionnaires (e.g. IPAQ, link to full questionnaire here) where the target time scale is 1 week, but I'm looking for something that captures exercise amount on a much shorter/recent time scale  Ideally it would also be short and quick to administer (for reference, I would consider both versions of the IPAQ too long)  I ask because I'm interested in people's recent levels of exercise and I've tried administering a short questionnaire where I ask things like ""how many minutes of aerobic exercise did you do yesterday?"" but when I looked at the the data it turns out that >70% of people report 0, so I end up with a zero-inflated variable.  This could be due to a poorly worded question, poor response format, or any number of reasons. Ideally, I would conduct a full survey design study and use factor analysis to create/validate a short form questionnaire, but at this point it might be easier to just use one that currently exists, if there is one  Does anything like this already exist?

2635,Does training affect the tactile oblique effect?,"In the visual sciences it is known that the oblique effect can be reduced by means of training. The oblique effect is observed when testing subjects psychophysically with a grating acuity task (e.g., the BaGa test). Visual acuity is better when horizontal or vertical gratings are tested than when diagonals are used. The performance in discerning diagonal gratings has been shown to improve after training subjects, although performance in the cardinal directions stays better than the oblique stimuli.   The oblique effect has been observed in the tactile sense too (the sense of touch). However, the amount of papers in the scientific literature is quite restricted in the tactile modality. I wasn't able to find evidence in the literature whether training can improve people's performance in tactile diagonal grating tasks.   Can training reduce the oblique effect in the tactile modality, comparable to that observed in visual grating tasks?     "
2636,Is it possible to tell the difference between schizophrenics and pathological liars using a brain scan?,"Someone says they hear voices. There are many explanations:   They are having auditory hallucinations that to them sound like another person. They are interpreting their inner monologue as an external voice. They are lying.   How can one tell the difference. And is the difference important? (To a behaviourist, would someone be classified as ""well"" as long as they stop telling people they are hearing voices?)  Let's suppose the treatment is electric shock therapy. Which has the following effect on the 3 cases:   It cures the auditory halluciantions It damages their brain so they can't exprience an internal monologue The person is so affraid of the electric shock they stop lying.   Or a fourth option is it doesn't cure anything but they again say they are ""well"" to avoid electric shocks.  This could well have been the situation before modern brain scans. Can modern brain scans show a difference between the three cases? And I wonder what percentages the three cases occur in? "
2637,What is the meaning of behaviorally oriented outside-in nature of therapy?,What is the meaning of behaviorally oriented outside-in nature of therapy? I am especially interested why this outside-in word was used but please provide me a wider context of this type of therapy. Especially as it is meant on the following page.  [website]Could you possibly give some resources such as scholarly articles or book chapters where this method is used? My problem is that I am a non-expert on psychotherapy but need a starting point on the above issue. Thank you. 
2638,How to chose which filter to design for EEG signal?,"I am currently working on the EEG Grasp Dataset from Kaggle. I am aware that I need to filter the EEG signal as it is visually noisy (is there any way to mathematically show it's noisy?). How do I choose what filter I should use from the vast number of types available. Also how do I make sure that the filter improves the SNR while not removing/damaging the information in the EEG signal?  From The kernels in kaggle, I have seen people use filters like discrete wavelet transform to get the frequency components and filter out unnecessary frequencies or they have used butterworth and notch filters, though one said that the notch filter ""distorts"" the signal and instead a high pass at 40Hz should be used. People have used different ones so, is there any procedure to determine which filter to use or should I start testing from the most basic filters then get into better frequency domain filters, then spatial filters and finally adaptive filters? "
2639,"Is there a list of large-scale, free datasets with psychological variables?","Psychologists are not using large, existing, free data to its potential. We don't know what exists, what it contains, or how to use it without a huge investment. Secondary analysis of large, open datasets can improve replicability and reproducibility over small new studies, e.g., through accessibility, high power, generalizability, and validated measures. Between-subjects moderation designs particularly lack power. However, these resources are underused in research and education. Student research often has low inference quality, and educators may lack access to use these tools for pedagogy.  Is there a list of large-scale, free datasets with psychological variables? Additionally, is there a list of other such lists?  Related: Psychological journal that focuses on publishing interesting psychological datasets "
2640,How strong is the evidence for the effectiveness of psychoanalysis in the treatment of depression?,"I often hear claims that psychoanalysis is ineffective, takes too long, is just pseudo-science, that other therapies such as cognitive-behavioural should be preferred or even that it should be entirely dismissed. In this talk however, the speaker seems to claim that psychoanalysis has quite a bit of empirical evidence going for it, which surprised and confused me.  How strong is the research on psychoanalysis as a treatment for depression?  I am not sure if this is too opinion based, so please help me make it better if it is (e.g. 'what is some of the best evidence on psychoanalysis as a treatment for depression?') "
2641,What can one do to permanently increase one's baseline happiness (subjective well-being)?,"According to the hedonic treadmill theory of subjective well-being each human has a hedonic set point. Positive or negative life events cause relatively short-term deviations to one's happiness before it returns to the baseline happiness level determined by the set point. The set point appears to be stable over the course of one's life. One's happiness, measured over time, looks something like this:    Question: What, if anything, has been demonstrated by research to cause long-term, significant upward shifts of the baseline happiness? And, if so, which of those interventions are accessible to an average person (in wealthy countries)?   "
2642,Is the hippocampus responsible for storing or creating memories?,"I've heard that severe damage to the hippocampus results in the inability to form new memories but still remember old ones. Am I mistaking something? Is the hippocampus responsible for storing memories, creating memories or both? "
2643,Is Autism associated with an increased drowning risk for adults?,"I have found several popular articles (e.g. ScienceDaily, The Globe and Mail, and WebMD) indicating that children with Autism have a significantly elevated risk of drowning. The general theory seems to be that the calming affect of water combines with a lack of situational awareness common in people with Autism to create a ""perfect storm"" situation in which the child is presented with highly appealing decision opportunities that they are not fully able to assess. A simple online search for ""autism and drowning"" turns up tons of articles and discussions about the risk of drowning in children with Autism.  Has a substantially elevated risk of drowning been shown to exist or not exist for adults with Autism? That is, is the risk of drowning for children simply more socially relevant today (e.g. drowning out any studies and warnings of potential linkages for adults), or is there substantial reason to believe that the maturity that comes with age does or does not reduce the risk of drowning to control group levels? "
2644,Can new emotions be created or discovered?,"Related: Are there emotions that only some people can feel?  Is there any known observed or theoretical process by which new emotions could be observed or discovered?  Although one may argue over the exact number of emotions that exist today or the exact criteria that differentiate one from another, there is broad agreement on the general types of emotions that exist (e.g. most psychologists would agree that happiness, sadness, envy, anxiety, excitement, anger, disgust, lust, pride, etc. are emotions while pecan, horseradish, choke, stupid, chair, delta, redshirt, appoiapgpadvap, asdf, and yooe caph garharheq are not emotions). Those minor disagreements/edge cases are not what I am talking about, but a brand new emotion. Hypothetically, I can imagine that one might result from novel stimuli (or patterns of stimuli) never before experienced by humans (and thus resulting in a never-before seen affect on the brain), but I am not aware of any actual cases of this occurring or any known (outside of science fiction) theory of what sort of stimuli patterns might accomplish this or what such an emotion might be like.  If it has been shown that one of the ""standard"" emotions today arose after the advent of anatomically-modern humans (e.g. Cro-Magnon), I would consider that an answer.  In response to a comment by Bryan Krause, I am aware that there is a linguistic argument here. I'm imagining this as similar to the linguistic/neurological divide in color taxonomy. Famously, Russian does not have a single word for ""blue"" (instead, dividing it up into two separate colors), while Japanese historically did not distinguish between what English speakers call blue and green, but I believe it is fairly well understood that these distinctions happen at a fairly high level in the brain, rather than representing truly distinct forms of cognitive evolution. The color equivalent to my question could be whether it is possible for the brain to evolve, or for novel stimuli to generate, an entirely new color that no one has ever seen before and that cannot be reasonably described as a variant or subtype of an existing color. Some science fiction authors, famously H. P. Lovecraft, have tried to imagine a ""new"" color, so the idea that new cognitive experiences could be found is certainly not new.  Another way to ask this is whether the process of coming up with new words to describe emotions represents enhancements in the understanding of current emotions or whether it represents truly new emotions never before experienced or observed. "
2645,Is there a neurological reason why women do not occupy top positions in the chess ranking?,"I want to turn arround this question posted on chess exchange where sociological arguments are given to explain why only two of the world's top 100 chess players are women.  Are there neurological evidences to assert, in equal conditions, women would still be worst at chess than men? "
2646,Creating a habit loop in humans via validation?,I've been reading about gamification and habit loops. Gamification is created by a set of requirements to satisfy a goal and a reward for meeting those requirements(which can be seen as a form of validation). I'm curious about the correlation between people who are incredibly successful at what they do by putting in long hours and how the habit of practicing long hours could be created via validation? Games as many people know are addicting and use rewards as a sense of validation and I personally know a world class dancer and saw his career since he began and did notice when he started he got more praise for being talented than other dancers at the same stage in their careers. I'm wondering if validation can be a key factor in creating long last habits and practices? 
2647,"Is Jordan Peterson correct when he states that ""as societies become more egalitarian, personality differences across genders maximize""?","There are many videos (for example, here, here, and here) where Jordan Peterson claims that as societies become more egalitarian, personality differences across genders increase. He is often stating that these results have been replicated over and over and published in the most leading scientific journals (such as Science) and claiming that this is an established fact.  On a quick search, I was not able to find any Science articles that debate this specific topic (only in other journals whose quality (as an outsider) I cannot judge (e.g. here)). Also, since in my own profession (economics) many famous professors tend to overstate that their view is the established one, how debated are these claims within the academic (not political or media!) landscape today?

2648,The strange shape of the temporal generalization map,"We are plotting the temporal generalization map (binary decoding) using EEG signal, but we obtained a strange result and don’t know how to interpret it.  First, after bandpass filter (8-12 Hz), we could obtain a normal result as below.    As shown in time-course, the classifying values (thick black lines) between red line (first condition) and blue line (second condition) are variable along the time, so that the values in the early time do not easily apply to the late time leading to the normal map of the temporal generalization.   However, using higher frequency band (12-30 Hz) we encountered a strange result   In this case, the classifying values between red line (first condition) and blue line (second condition) are somewhat constant along the time, so that the values in the early time easily apply to the late time leading to the high decoding accuracy all over the map. The point is that two parallel curves are easily divided by a simple mean (black thick line) between two curves as the classifier. If two curves are not parallel but mixed with each other, the decoding accuracies over the map of the temporal generalization should be low, and we can conclude that the high frequency do not contain decodable information.   Questions,  1.  Have you ever seen this type of time-courses of the high frequencies in our result and this strange map the temporal generalization and? 2.  We use the matlab function ‘filtfilt.m’ for bandpass filter, could you recommend other function for bandpass filter? "
2649,How could you define this variable?,"The procedure of one experiment includes the next sequence:   The anagram is presented for several seconds; The ""special word"" is presented for 90 ms; The same anagram is presented again; The anagram is solved by the participant.   It is predicted that the ""special word"" from the item №2 influences the probability  of solving the anagram successfully.   How is it better to define the ""special word""? It could be defined as prime, but priming per se implies that the stimulus precedes the target stimulus (e. g., anagram), and that is not the case here.  Any other ideas? "
2650,Is it possible for someone to have anorexia without body image issues?,"I've been reading about anorexia and as I understand it, it's an eating disorder where someone severely restricts their intake of food because of an intense fear of gaining weight, a distorted perception of weight, equating weight with self-worth, and things like that.  I was wondering, is it possible for someone to have anorexia without weight and body esteem issues? In other words, they severely restrict their food intake but not because of a fear of gaining weight or body esteem issues. I came across this Quora question, but the only answer there is an anecdotal one.  Or perhaps is there some eating disorder other than anorexia that matches this description? I came across this article, Does Everyone With an ED Have Body Dysmorphia?, but it didn't really help. "
2651,How happy are people relative to neutral (as measured by experience sampling)?,"Most studies on experience sampling are about whether some activity correlates with increased or decreased happiness/subjective well-being. However, it's often hard to tell from these studies what number corresponds a neutral point, where someone is neither unhappy or happy (or equally so), or is feeling an valence/affect equivalent to a nonconscious state. For instance Experience Sampling Method: Measuring the Quality of Everyday Life (2007) shows its results in terms of z-scores, which are defined relative to some average, but it's unclear whether that average would be higher or lower than a neutral point. As such, while we can say that these people are happier in this situation than another, it's hard to see whether they're overall happy or unhappy in that situation.  I'm not particularly interested in what activities or age or gender correlates with happiness, but just how happy people are relative to some clearly defined neutral point. Ideally, the study wouldn't just show some average among all study participants across all their experiences, but also what percentile corresponds to what happiness ratings, and the range of happiness scores and the frequency of different happiness ratings for each person. Is there a study that addresses this topic? "
2652,How does our brain allow us to commit suicide?,"How does our brain allow us to commit suicide? Our brain and everything in our body has developed to ensure our survival. At the prospect of a threat to our life, our brain does everything to save us with all those reflexes. In spite of this, some people are capable of committing suicide, how is this possible?  Lets consider a scenario,      A person commits suicide in anticipation of being insulted.   In this case, being insulted is clearly better than compromising our survival.Everything we do is primarily for our survival. While suiciding, one has to go against all of his instincts that were hard wired into him. Again, if one has the will power to commit suicide, one should be able to endure any other difficulty in life, this is also contradictory. Please explain. "
2653,Is HTM (Hierarchical Temporarl Model) accepted as credible?,"I ran across this article Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, a Theory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex, which leads to Wikipedia and HTM.  To my reading, this provides a credible theory of sensory encoding and neocortical processing, along with a mechanism for sequence memory. Seems too good to be true.  Am I being gullible? Is this research regarded as credible? Is it the subject of academic research by others quoting this work?    So what I'm really looking to do is to quantify and qualify the extent to which this work has influenced the work of others; the extent to which others have either built upon it or proposed alternatives or ignored it entirely. For example, is there any academic thought leader or highly-respected group that has reviewed this material and written in judgment? "
2654,Smoking and cognitive abilities,"How does smoking affect cognitive abilities?   Could it have a positive impact on alertness (like coffee)? Could it reduce our ability to concentrate? Could it lead to less oxygen in the brain, and some 'sluggishness' in thoughts?  I'm specially interested in the long term effect, present even when there's no nicotine in the body. "
2655,How to reliably measure working memory capacity?,"The capacity of human working memory is subject to individual differences. The number of items or chunks a person can retain in their memory may, have profound effects on a variety of other cognitive processes, such as problem solving.   I have come across a couple of ways to measure working memory such as the delayed match-to-sample task, Dual N-back task or the Wechsler Memory Scale. For the latter I have been unable to find out whether it offers an estimate of the number of items which can be held in working memory. This, however, is precisely what I am interested in. I know that the capacity measured using verbal stimuli is affected by a variety of features of the material.  Therefore, I'm wondering what are the most commonly used methods to measure an healthy individual's working memory capacity. Also, is there a reliable measure that can be easily used in online research? I am also interested in measures suitable for laboratory research, though. Finally, are abstract visual material and digits more ""pure"" measures than verbal ones?  I am especially interested in standardized procedures with known reliability measuring working memory and giving an estimate of the number of chunks an individual can retain. "
2656,What explains habitual or even occasional incidences of self-talk?,"What are the scientific reasons behind someone talking with him/herself? Is it a disorder of some kind? By ""talking"" I also mean writing to self.   By self-talk I mean a person (P) is talking with self in a Q&amp;A format. For example-  PQ: Hey, what happened?  PA: I'm not liking it here.  PQ: Why, what is it that you are not liking it?  PA: I don't like the attitudes of people around here. Everyone thinks he's very smart ...  PQ: But why is it affecting you?   and so on ..  The above kind of dialogue can either be spoken or written. Usually, one party asks another about their problems/feelings and suggests solutions / gives instructions to other party. "
2657,Can scary movies trigger fight or flight and why can a person enjoy this while another does not?,"Essentially, I understand the release of adrenaline can be addictive and that scary movies and events are a safe way of experiencing the drama without all the actual mess. but   However, if we are triggering our fight or flight response, then isn't suppressing it a separate chemical reaction, or at least an alternate one?   Is the release experienced more pleasurable for some people then others? Or is it a simple matter that staying in one's comfort zone is more enjoyable then the potential joy of a release?  "
2658,What causes laughter?,"I was looking at this video from VSauce: ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"", where several facts about this old joke are exposed and explained.  At some point, (6:59) Michael explains that there is a theory, based on the paper Computer Model of a ""Sense of Humour"" by I. M. Suslov, that says that laughter is the result of the released energy on the pre-judgement one makes about the result of the joke.  Still, this theory does not account for factors like being under the influence of drugs (on which it is generally easier to laugh at things), situations like tickling or other forced laughters like laughter gas itself.  So, which is the currently, widely accepted theory that explains what causes laughter? "
2659,What is the brain power devoted to vision and haptics?,"I heard a talk by Vincent Hayward on the sense of touch as a multi-modal system, where he claimed that the brain power devoted to haptics is at least as big as the one devoted to vision. I have found some answers with respect to vision, which claim the percentage to be between 25%-33% of the neo-cortex. The cortical homunculus shows a sensory map of the body, where I guess the eye depicted is more related to the haptic part of the eye region, rather than the vision.   Can you confirm the percentage for vision?  What is the percentage for haptics?    Quotable sources would be fantastic of-course, but just a rough number would also do. I am mostly interested in the rough relative relation between the two modalities. "
2660,Why is white on black considered higher contrast than black on white?,"While researching to answer Why are ""Inverted Colors"" considered an accessibility feature? I noticed the puzzling claim that ""White text on a black background is a higher contrast to the opposite, so the letterforms need to be wider apart, lighter in weight and have more space between the lines."" It's repeated a lot, particularly by design folks, but I couldn't find psychological research to support (or refute) it.  In terms of actual contrast ratio, inverting a black on white scheme won't change the contrast at all; the colors themselves are just as distant. Yet I see many claims that ""inverted colors"" is high contrast. The only real difference between the two I can think of is that the white background of black on white produces considerably more light than a black background. If this difference is enough to induce some level of ocular adaptation perhaps that could be a cause.  So is there a perceived difference in contrast between black on white vs white on black, assuming the same intensities for black/white? What causes it?  "
2661,'Model-free' learning in humans,"In reinforcement learning, there is a stark distinction between model-based and model-free learning algorithms, where model-free methods don't make use any explicit information about the dynamics of the environment.  It seems like this distinction would have some analog in human learning, but I'm having a very hard time finding any mention of it. Perhaps it would conditioning versus more cognitive forms of learning? I'd be overjoyed if someone could find an article using the term 'model-free' to refer to some aspect of human learning, or just reassure me of the term's correct human analog.  Does research on human learning featuring a model-free/model-based distinction exist? "
2662,How valid is Lumosity's Brain Performance Index and what normative information is available?,"Background  There is a test called Lumosity's Brain Performance Index.  A sample profile of scores might be:  Speed           680 Memory          707 Attention       277 Flexibility     304 Problem Solving 900 Overall BPI     573   I'm interested in how to interpret a profile of scores.  Questions   What validity information is available for the BPI? What normative information is available for BPI? In other words, how could the sample profile of scores be interpreted both absolutely and relative to other groups of people?  "
2663,Does Cognitive Tunneling apply to daydreaming as well?,"I've been reading a paper by Jarmasz J. (2005) on cognitive tunneling and am wondering if it applies to daydreaming?  For instance, if for some reason I'm already thinking about something that has no relation to any information coming in from any of my senses, just some random thought, will this cause any new information coming in from these senses to potentially not be processed?   This is kind of related to my understanding of HIP( human information processing ). I've recently seen a diagram of HIP where what is in working memory is either information from our senses that we are attending to and information from long term memory.   But where does random thoughts that we have through out the day come in? This has to be accounted for as well, I would think.   Jarmasz, J., Herdman, C.M. &amp; Johannsdottir, K.R. (2005). Object-based attention and cognitive tunneling. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 11, 3.  "
2664,Is there an open-source / free official Myers-Briggs assessment I can adopt?,"Background  I've got an idea for a web site that uses one's Myers-Briggs type as part of the value.   I've seen various web sites offer ""quick quizzes"" to assess one's MBTI, but I'm not sure how legitimate / effective / ethical it would be to utilize one of these ""knock-off"" assessment techniques. I haven't decided any of the business angles yet; for now it's just a cool idea, so I can't speak to whether it would be commercial, non-profit, etc.  Questions   Is there an official ""test of record"" or set of questions that I can use in my application that is reasonably open or inexpensive? I'd like to get results that are as accurate as possible but I'm just one guy on a shoestring budget. Could I run into legal trouble from the Myers-Briggs institute over this? How open are they with the methodology for this assessment? While I'm strapped for cash, I also have no desire to be a jerk; I'm admittedly ignorant on how this realm of science/industry views these matters. Is there any need for an official MBTI interpreter (other than privacy ethics, etc. which of course I would be respecting as the founder of said web site)?  How much accuracy does one lose in using a quiz that isn't ""personally reviewed""? That seems to be the main purpose of a ""licensed MBTI interpreter"" as far as I've been able to see with some quick research.  "
2665,What are the reliable and valid test to measure working memory?,   Possible Duplicate:   How to reliably measure working memory capacity?       I am currently doing my thesis on how different types of music affect the cognitive performance more specifically working memory in an individual.   Can anyone suggest reliable and valid test to measure working memory? 
2666,How to measure group differences incorporating reaction time / accuracy trade-off?,"In a psychological experiment I am measuring subjects' reaction time as well as their error rate. Now I would like to compare two groups (males &amp; females). There might be a bias in the sense that subjects who respond within a small reaction time might also commit more errors.    What would be an appropriate way to combine reaction time and error rate to create a measure that takes into consideration this trade-off between ""reacting fast"" and ""reacting correctly"".  E.g., could I just divide reaction time by error rate? Should I center or scale reaction time and error rate before I do this?  "
2667,"Is there any fMRI evidence for different ""states of mind""?","If you've seen a snickers commercial, it goes something like ""you are a different person when you are hungry"". I'm interested if the person's brain actually looks different when observed through fMRI if the person is tired/hungry, and the person's outlook on the world changes. For example things become more irritating.  Is there fMRI evidence to support that a person is capable of switching to a different ""state of mind"" based on the condition of the person's body or neuromodulator levels?   If there's a better term than ""States of mind"", could you suggest what it is? I'm thinking of an entrained state which changes the person's outlook on the past, present and the future, as well as influencing the choice of actions and behavior. Is there a good term I can google to find research on this topic?  Thank you for your input! "
2668,"Is there a better way to describe brain activity than EEG ""brain waves""","I've been reading about EEG brain waves, which are specific waveforms that are observed on the EEG output, and are usually scored by humans. This concept has been around for quite some time.  Is there anything ""newer"" or ""better"" than EEG brainwaves discovered in the recent years?   Given the rise in commercially available EEG sensors, has any company succeeded at putting forth a way to analyze or quantify the output of these sensors to give some useful information to researchers? I'm thinking of brainwave-processing algorithms. For example in Actigraphy, the study of human motion, there are algorithms like ""if 19 out of 20 minutes of activity are scored as sleep, then the sleep onset is known to happen at the start of the 20 minute window"". Is there something similar for brainwave or derived metrics?  "
2669,How does body temperature affect perception of time?,"Does raising or lowering one's body temperature lead to different perceptions of time? And does this then control the virtual length of positive or negative emotions?  For example, individuals might drink cold beverages while watching a horror movie or sip hot tea while coding or making a plane model.   Do people drink different temperature beverages while doing certain things just because of their preference or unconsciously because it helps to get more of that certain feeling they're after? "
2670,What is the scientific basis for long-term negative physiological effects of overstudying?,I am interested in long term negative physiological effects that some students experience following overstudying.    What is the scientific basis for overstudying? Is over studying correlated with long term decreases of cognitive ability?  
2671,"How are personality traits ""encoded"" in the brain?","How are personality traits – such as optimism, sensation seeking or need for cognition – ""encoded"" in the brain?  Do people with different levels of, say, extraversion have different neuronal structures? Or do they have different amounts of certain neurochemicals, different numbers of receptors, or other kinds of functional differences?  So if you want to change a trait, can you simply stimulate or supplement neuronal functionality, e.g. by administering the lacking neurochemicals, or do you have to ""destroy"" and ""rebuild"" the neuronal structure, e.g. through learning? "
2672,Morita therapy - does it have a western counterpart?,"I have recently read interesting article about Morita therapy.  I have a hard time finding articles,books or research on this subject, and how it works in the West since this therapy was developed and mostly applied in Japan.   What is interesting about it : this therapy (or just Morita's philosophy) doesn't try to change person's feelings of fear/anxiety. It teaches person to understand his/her feelings and live with them. Doing things that need to be done despite fear/anxiety.   Does Morita's idea have western counterpart? Any free reading on it ? (something I don't have to buy) And is there any research paper on it that is reliable and accessible?   Any idea of something similar is welcome. :) "
2673,What kinds of information can (and cannot) be extracted from connectome?,"Several scientific projects are trying to map the connectome, such as The Human Connectome Project. The connectomes of other organisms, such as C. elegans, have been mapped already.  Having an organism's connectome, what information can we extract from it? And, most importantly, what information will still be missing?  For example, can we extract the following functional information from the connectome:   Is the synapse connection excitatory or inhibitory? Which ions does the synaptic connection use? What is the strength of the synaptic connection?   For simplicity, let's assume that we're using the best imaging and data gathering techniques available (including combinations of techniques). "
2674,How does Classical Conditioning and Operant Conditioning really differ?,"I was taking a practice ap psychology test and was curious how operant and classical conditioning are different.  My test claims that the difference comes from the fact that Classical conditioning is based on an involuntary action and Operant Conditioning is based on voluntary action but obviously this is false since what may be involuntary/reflexive for some may not be the same for others.  An example they gave is how someone may move their hand away from an iron because of 'reflex' whereas they will attempt to do well on a test because they are aware of a reward, but what about someone that has a lot of experience with the given subject and simply does well on the test because they reflexively feel the need to do well. I know for me personally when given a math problem that I can't immediately solve or outline a heuristic for solving I tend to drop all external thoughts and work on it, often with a the same determination with which my dog chases after a squirrel.   This is of course because over time I have gained enough experience, practice, and interest in the field to do so. Thus for others attempting to solve problems will be a voluntary action, but for me personally I have an involuntary need to work on them.  But then again, when someone throws a ball at me, being that I don't have much experience with sports, I tend to first think ""theres a ball!"" before the reflex for catching initiates while for others that tends to fire off immediately.  So what is the actual difference between voluntary and involuntary actions besides familiarity with said action?  And if familiarity is the only difference then honestly how do Classical and Operant conditioning differ? "
2675,Early Alzheimer's and cognitive remediation programs,"Early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) includes the loss of short term memory including prospective memory.  On a physical level brain cells are being destroyed and that disrupts the neural pathways that form memory.    My interest is on cognitive remediation programs that use spaced repetition (spacing effect/spaced retrieval/gradual interval recall).   A Google scholar search [website]lists many papers that show a positive effect but I don't know how to search for what is happening at a physical level?  Can someone describe the effect at the physical level?    In the book ""The Foundations of Remembering: Essays in Honor of Henry L. Roediger, III"" page 95:     Camp and colleagues have argued that expanded retrieval training makes use of implicit memory, which is relatively spared even in the later stages of AD   What is implicit memory and why is it not affected by AD until late stages? "
2676,What can be inferred about the strength of the synapse from an electron microscope image?,"In the following EM image (1um scale), there are several synapses:  Image or HD Version  What information about the synaptic strengths can be extracted from this image?  Does vesicle count contain information? What about the cross sectional ""length"" of the synaptic cleft? If serial sections were used to reconstruct a 3D version of a synapse, would the surface area of the synapse reflect the strength of the synapse? "
2677,Inducing long term low latent inhibition,"From what I have gathered of low latent inhibition, it is an extreme increased level of dopamine in the brain.. dopamine is a neurotransmitter and hormone.   Increasing it has many advantages and a few nasty disadvantages.  While improving concentration, mood, energy, and libido for starters, too much can cause side effects such as addiction and a host of mental disorders. (schizophrenia and bipolar to name two)  I'm looking for those who might have more knowledge of the subject than I do: there is a lot of controversy over the internet and half of it can't be believed. So, for the question part:  1. Is increased dopamine levels the source (or at least main source) of LLI?  2.Is Dopamine increased more through direct supplements such as DHA which supposedly affect Dopamine levels directly, or supplements such as L-Dopa which claim to affect the precursors?  I've done my own research and am still looking for answers to the benefits, risks, and induction of such to lower latentcy... just looking for others' knowledge and/or experiences. "
2678,Is there any file format standard for EEG data?,"I have started to do some research on EEG analysis. One of the challenging things I have found is the variability on the formats for the EEG files.   What do you do when you receive data your software does not support? Is it reasonable to ask the collaborators to convert the data to another format? Do you modify your software to incorporate the details of the new format?  Is there any EEG format out there that is considered standard? Do the EEG manufacturers provide converters to that format in their software?  Thanks,  -drd   "
2679,Effectiveness of spaced learning when the data have personal meaning,"There is much study of spaced learning (expanded retrieval, spaced retrieval, spaced repetition system, gradual-interval recall, etc), and much of the discussion is about around the optimal distribution of the recall over time (often in comparison to equally spaced recall events or mass recall).     Instead of a focus on time, have studies considered the nature of the data to be remembered?     1) Have studies considered autobiographical data in comparison to non-autobiographical?  So, for example, if the data to be remembered are personal and relate to, say, family and friends, then will the use of spaced learning be more effective than, say, learning new vocabulary?   I am thinking about people with Alzheimer's or other diseases that impact memory.    Put another way: is spaced learning more effective when applied to personal facts vs. impersonal facts?  Or does it make no difference what the data are?  2) Is there any impact if the data are all related in some way?  For example, suppose the task is to learn vocabulary for parts of system (e.g. family, parent, child, sibling, etc or the parts of an automobile, ...)  in comparison to a set of unrelated words.    Does it make a difference if the set of concepts to be remembered have associations which the mind can use to link them together? "
2680,What is the metabolic load of the visual system?,The brain consumes energy at eight times the rate that would be predicted from mass alone (20% of total organismic load).  How much of this is drawn from the visual system? How does the metabolic load change among the blind? How about for people with their eyes closed? 
2681,"Relation between Nengo, SPA and NEF with respect to other Neural Models","I'm working through How to Build a Brain and I keep getting confused on the relation between Nengo, the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) and the Neurological Engineering Framework (NEF).  Are there general names and a general way to describe these components? I'm assuming the individual tasks they are performing are not unique, although I do believe that the result is unique. For example, I believe the role performed by SPA is similar to the one proposed by the Neural Blackboard Architecture, but I would really like to know if there is an equivalent to NEF and/or Nengo. Also, where does ACT-R fit into this whole thing? "
2682,Criterion for Asperger's Syndrome,"I realize that the diagnostic criteria for Asperger's Syndrome (AS) have changed with the latest version of the DSM, but there was a criterion in the DSM-IV for AS that I didn't understand: ""marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as ....gestures to regulate social interaction"". Can anyone please tell me what this means or give some common examples of behaviors that would qualify?    Also, when one evaluates ""empathy"", is one considering the internal state of the subject or his manifest behaviors? For example, I may not truly empathize with your situation, but from society, maybe I know that I should, so I ""act"" as if I do.  Thank you. "
2683,Does stress impair your short term memory?,"I have noticed frequently, when in a very stressful situation (particularly emotional stress), I will forget things very quickly. To give an example:  Recently, I got in a heated argument with a friend. During the fight, a third friend came in and tried to break it up. ""What is this about?"" he asked. I was about to answer, and then it occurred to me I didn't know. I was still angry, but the information had already escaped my mind.  I have noticed this happen more than once. I asked someone about it, and they said they had had similar experiences.   Is there some hard science to support the idea that stress negatively affects short term memory? "
2684,Time passing faster now as compared to 50 years (or 1000yrs) back ?,I asked 200 people (who include my friends and family members in age group of 15 to 70 years living in cities) how they feel about time ? Do they feel that the time is passing faster as compared to when they were child?  95% of those people say that now a days time is passing much faster than lets say 50 years back when they were younger.  Is this an established fact and can be explained using theory of relativity or any other law that time (may be on average) is passing faster now  as compared to lets say 50 yrs or may be 1000 yrs back? Or is it only a subjective experience?  
2685,Why is working memory so small?,"I know that the concept of working memory may be subject to discussion. Still, there is a storage capacity limit. This is a real mystery to me. Working memory is known to be positively correlated to various tests (IQ for example). Why did natural selection not grant us a better storage capacity?  Before asking this question, I read some hypotheses by Cowan: The Magical Mystery Four: How is Working Memory Capacity Limited, and Why? Two camps are presented: capacity-limit-as-weakness and capacity-limit-as-strength. Basically the first camp explains this weakness from a neuronal point of view, claiming that keeping many items active is greedy and can cause interference. The second camp pretends that the lesser the number of items accessible is the quicker the cognitive processes are (chunking, searching, etc.). Honestly I don't know what to think. More than that, I don't feel its very convincing. If our neural system has evolved toward some incredibly powerful processing modules and can't even keep 10 items active at the same time, there must be a reason. I am more inclined to think that the capacity limit is a kind of strength somewhere, but I don't feel very convinced by the examples provided in the short passage I mentioned.     Do you have any extra arguments for/against any of these theoretical positions? My preconception is that this limit constrains us to encode the real in the most powerful fashion. In short, we are always forced to learn more complex patterns. Is it relevant or not? Do you have any source which could challenge or back up this view? "
2686,Common components of other cognitive architectures and the Semantic Pointer Architecture,"In the papers I've read about it, the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) embodied in Spaun is said to be more biologically plausible than many other proposed architectures such as the Neural Blackboard Architecture, ACT-R and ICS. However, I was wondering if they had any shared attributes? If this is too broad of a question, which one can SPA considered most similar to?  I am currently reading ""How to Build a Brain"" by Chris Eliasmith to answer these questions and will post my own answer shortly, but I was hoping for other perspectives. "
2687,How to compare tasks completed by neural architectures objectively?,"When I first saw this video of Spaun and the tasks it can complete (solving the Towers of Hanoi problem, completing the Raven matrices), I was really impressed, but then I realized I didn't really know what other tasks were being completed by other neural architectures. Consequently, I almost asked a question here that was basically ""How does Spaun compare in terms of task complexity to other neural architectures?"". However, I realized that it would be better to if I could learn how to do this evaluation myself.  So, what metrics or heuristics can be used to evaluate the complexity of a task completed by a neural architecture? How can one evaluate the complexity of a problem/puzzle such at the Tower of Hanoi, to another problem, such as modelling how people solve algebraic equations, like ACT-R has accomplished?  "
2688,Why are the Big Five factors of personality correlated?,One of main characteristics of Five Factor Model is that factors are not orthogonal as in some other personality models.   Why it is tolerated that those factors are not independent? Is it possible to find biological basis if factors are not independent?  
2689,Does limiting mental activity during the day increase mental performance later in the day?,"Is there any scientific evidence to support the idea that you only have so much cognitive energy in a given day; and if so, would the mental abilities of someone who focuses on as little as possible all day be greater than someone who stays engaged all day long?  Can the brain experience fatigue?  In Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (1990), he says:     At this point in our scientific knowledge we are on the verge of being   able to estimate how much information the central nervous system is   capable of processing. It seems we can manage at most seven bits of   information - such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or   recognizable nuances of emotion of thought - at any one time, and that   the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and   another is about 1/18 of a second.   He goes on to infer that ""psychic energy"" should be invested and shouldn't be wasted. At least, this was my interpretation. "
2690,Is a person with a psychopathic disorder aware of it?,"A (former) friend of mine shows lots of symptoms of a psychopathic disorder.  Years later after we both met the last time, I'm still not sure whether he is/was aware of this disorder or not.  So my question:  Is a person with potentially psychopathic behaviour aware of why he behaves like he does or not?  Plus: If he is aware, do such persons usually suffer from that knowledge/disorder or like it? "
2691,How to apply different motivational theories to understand career orientation?,"""What motivates you towards choosing the career/job orientation you have chosen? Discuss and explain with reference to three of the motivational theories discussed during the course"".  I'm used to writing more scientific essays in the field of psychology, but I am finding some difficulty introducing and maintaining this assignment with a more subjective approach. We are expected to keep with APA rules and formatting and stick to a scientific method of writing. Yet if I am to write a theoretical paper, how am I to keep the focus on what motivates me personally? "
2692,What is the optimal combination of text and background color for EEG experiments?,"Most studies that I know of use yellow text on blue background (though with different hues).   This choice is mostly motivated by tradition (""We always did it like that. Never touch a running system""). But is this combination really the best one?   I have found a number of studies about color combinations and readability. Some suggest that black text on white background is the best, others say white on blue, etc.   I imagine that there are specific requirements for EEG studies as they are regularly run in dim lit rooms. So a completely bright white screen maybe not the best idea, I think.   It surely does make a difference if the task is dependent on, e.g., quick word recognition or reading a short story.   And what about flat screens vs. CRT screens? Are there different optimal color combinations for these screen types?  Is there any general optimal combination?  "
2693,What does it mean to say that mental illness is a modern-day leprosy?,"I was reading about mental illnesses and then thought one day that the uninformed regard mental illnesses the same way leprosy was regarded.  I looked up about leprosy and some papers and articles about how mental illness is a modern-day leprosy, but I can't seem to find as to what exactly is the relation, if they are even thinking the same thing I am.  So far I know, it is observed that the uninformed are not giving them the treatment they need. Specifically, why are the uninformed not giving them the treatment they need?  Is it accurate and precise to say that mental illness is regarded as modern-day leprosy since:   In ancient times (or Jesus's time), uninformed people believed people who had leprosy had leprosy because they committed a grave sin or sins In modern times, uninformed people believe people who have mental illnesses have mental illnesses because they committed gravely immoral actions (see how I avoid the non-secular word ""sin"") ?   Take for example a drug or gambling addict. Drug and gambling addictions are mental illnesses, but an uninformed person would look at a drug or gambling addict and say that the reason that they have these sicknesses is that they started taking drugs or gambling, the immoral action.  However maybe an informed person would say that the reverse is the case: the immoral actions of starting to take drugs or gamble is caused in part by the illness that the person had or the biological, psychological or environmental predispositions that the person had.  Other examples would include procrastination, overeating or hyperactivity.  Bottom line, is it accurate and precise to say that the term ""modern leprosy"" is in reference to thinking:     You're crazy because you did evil things   rather than     You did evil things because you're mentally ill ?   This question may not be very clear so please recommend how I can improve this question. "
2694,How to examine person's awareness of a certain topic?,"I am conducting a case study on the topic of refugees and asylum seekers. My particular interest is: How aware is my test subject of the reasons (political persecution, famine, war, ...) why these people are leaving their home country?  I would like to avoid asking explicit questions like ""How often do you think about the political situation in Syria?""  So, is there any standardized or way of investigating awareness (not knowledge) of a certain topic? "
2695,Are the physical sensations of an emotion due to neural activity strictly in the brain or also in the body?,"Symptoms of anxiety and anger are often described as some sort of energetic sensation in my chest and sometimes face or arms.  Are these sensations an 'illusion' from neural activity strictly in the brain which projects sensations on their body or is there also neural activity in my chest, face or arms that they're 'actually' sensing?  If so what is the nature of that activity. If not and the sensations are just an 'illusion' how is the brain creating that illusion.  Also why does stretching seem to calm or make this sensation more pleasant? "
2696,Is depression caused by life events?,"If we look at physical illnesses we could put them on a spectrum of 'Happened spontaneously/no choice in the matter' to 'Was clearly created by something that happened in their life'.   From less causal, to more causal I'd suggest a list like this.    Genetic disorders.   (Entirely genetic, from birth) Down syndrome. (Genetic, but age of parents plays a part) Cancers that happen 'randomly' (eg. breast cancer).  (Random, but some people have genetic disposition) Common cold. (Not sure where to put this on the spectrum, but caused by a cold, but some people are more susceptible than others).  Obesity. (Some people have a higher disposition to obesity) Smoking related illnesses. (Caused by smoking, but some people more susceptible than others).  HIV.  (Caused by a virus transferred by contaminated blood/unprotected sex) A broken leg. (Caused by physical trauma)   That is - the illnesses at the top of the spectrum have some kind of genetic cause, or we don't know enough about them to say how/why they occur, whereas the illnesses at the bottom of the spectrum are clearly caused by some life event.   With a mental illness like schizophrenia - it seems clear that this would fit at the top end of the spectrum - the schizophrenic was schizophrenic from birth, and there was nothing that 'caused it'.   However, it seems that depression is often the result of life events - stress, addiction, pregnancy, grief etc.   Is this a valid way of looking at depression? What terminology and research is there about it?  "
2697,What is this forward-looking Déjà Vu-like phenomenon?,"In the past I've always thought deja vu was a feeling of having done something before because you actually had done something quite like it before and the current environment is bringing that to mind but in the past few years, maybe longer, I've had a different deja vu-like case: It's a feeling at one point in time, that feels like deja vu, except that I particularly feel/know it hasn't happened before, which then, at a later time, actually comes about happening in the same place as I had thought about it earlier. In both the first and second events I am particularly aware of what I'm feeling as it has happened a few times. It doesn't feel like a trick of the mind like my explanation for regular deja vu would have me believe.  Is this a known or common deja vu-like phenomenon? Is there anything that would explain it like my explanation of regular deja vu? "
2698,"Handwriting analysis by profession (muscular control) - Athletes, musicians, etc","Is there any scientific study on handwriting by profession? In the whole world, the people with the most control of their muscles are athletes. Or pianists, who have extremely good control of their fingers. So perhaps their handwriting will be different from the average person? "
2699,Predictive Experiments on Neuroscience of Free Will,"It seems to be very interesting that we can use modern neuroscience and cognitive science research to inform us about the ages-old question of free-will vs. determinism. The standard experiment was done by Benjamin Libet in 1983 that demonstrated that electrode activity showed that in terms of using our left or right hands - electric signals showed a significant change in activity before the reported decision to make the movement was made. This is one of the founding experiments of the neuroscience of free-will.  However, it seems that this experiment informs us in a very limited temporal duration. Since I could not find any conclusive results myself, I wanted to ask if they were any neuroscience experiments that demonstrated long-term predictive behavior. An example would be if a person with a particular imaged localized area could be said pre-hand to have a certain behavioral reactions in response to stimuli. This would defend give a strong defense to the determinist philosophical position. Of course, I'm talking about conscious reactions (such as decision-making in social situations, since the idea is that people consciously think they make their own decisions). An experiment involving unconscious processes such as memory would not be very informative.   If so:  Which experiment(s) comments on this?  What is the degree of validity of the experiment? (Summary of Methods and Results)  Are the results controversial? Does it truly make a comment on the philosophy of free will?  If not, is it that Neuroscience is still not mature enough have predictive power like hard sciences such as biology, chemistry and physics. After all, the brain is a incredibly complex organ, and responding to complex multimodal stimuli (e.g. social situations) it would further complicate the possibility of any such study.

2700,Is thinking with language efficient?,"I wondered, whether it is efficient to think with language (of course it's efficient for communication). When I'm thinking with long words, it takes longer than thinking with short words. Maybe thinking without words would be even faster?  So, do babies, who didn't learn think faster because they don't immediately try to find words for their thoughts to tell someone about them?      For example, when we see 1 + 1 = 2, we think of every symbol as a   word one plus one equals two. I assume, someone, who lacks language(Babies for example), would think of this without these words, but instead with emotions(maybe). See the note at the end.   In our everyday life, we almost always need to talk to others about our thoughts. This leads to us thinking with these words instead of just thinking and then finding words for it. It's like writing a manuscript just from front to end instead of first brainstorming and collecting ideas.  Main question: Is it possible to think in a two-step process(and would it be more efficient)? First, thinking with emotions(or whatever you want to call it) and then finding words for that to spread your idea?     Note: I think the ""Problem"" here, is that, when we think of something, we simulate saying its name in our brain, to be prepared for a real conversation. Right?  "

2702,Where does action based on thought originate within the human brain?,"A rather basic question, but I don't see answer in Google, so here it goes: Humans have thoughts, sometimes these thoughts carry with them motivations to act, urges, cravings, etc. All these can make a person start moving to accomplish something.      For example: ""I'm rather bored, I think I will go get a snack"". What   happens the moment I cross the threshold from thinking to actually   getting up to get a snack?   What happens the moment the person starts to act based on a thought? Where in the human brain does a thought trigger action?  Update: In response to an answer suggesting that in many cases action comes first and rationalization for action comes second:  The kind of action that I'm talking about comes after a longer period deliberation, where the current state is being weighted against the benefit of the action to take.  For example in the situations below, a person can deliberate for minutes:   A person is in bed and is very close to sleep, being comfortable and relaxed. Loud noises from the outside disturb the person's attempt to fall asleep. In this case the person can experience conflict between staying in bed (comfortable but disturbed) or going to find earplugs / shut the windows (uncomfortable, but potentially lessening the disturbance) A person is trying to meditate, thus relaxing the body and unfocusing the mind. An itch on the foot is disturbing the meditation. Such person can either continue the current state while ignoring the discomfort or scratch the itch and potentially lose the meditative state.   In the examples above, two conflicting courses of action are evaluated by the brain. Due to the ongoing discomfort, it is possible to stay in this state of ""almost making a decision"" for quite some time.  At a certain point the scale can tip into taking action to resolve the discomfort. What is it that causes the person to take action as opposed to inaction? "
2703,What can clinical psychologists do that psychiatrists can't do?,"From Yahoo Answers:     For example, I know that psychiatrists can prescribe medicine and   psychologists CAN'T, but are there any things that clinical   psychologists are specialised in that psychiatrists aren't? If not,   then why do we have psychologists and not just psychiatrists? Sorry if   it sounds like a stupid question, I'm just a little confused lol.   Is it correct to say that people who don't or might not need drugs for their problems would go to psychologists instead psychiatrists because it is significantly cheaper?  There's an answer:     they are also able to provide meditation and breathing techniques for   things such as panic attacks.   So psychiatrists can't do that? The only thing I can see psychologists doing outside the academia is being a cheaper alternative to a psychiatrist. If clinical psychologists (is that the same as non-academic psychologists?) charged the same as psychiatrists, why doesn't everyone go to psychiatrists? "

2705,Which neurotransmitters can be measured in a living human brain?,"I'm interested in learning more about the modern techniques that are used for scientific studies of neurotransmitters in the living human brain. As far as I know, there are 4 neuromodulator systems within the human brain.  They are:  Noradrenaline system  Dopamine system  Serotonin system  Cholinergic system  As far as I understand, some of biosynthesis pathways of these systems are interconnected, with the level of one neurotransmitter affecting levels of others further down the line.  Can anyone comment on which ones of these neurotransmitter levels can the modern science (as of 2012) measure or at least estimate in the living human brain?  How close is modern science to understanding the cascading effects that these neurotransmitter systems may have on each other?  Update: The other similar question deals with the imaging techniques of neurotransmitters, and this paper describes the process that might be used in the future, after tests and approvals. Structure-Guided Directed Evolution of Highly Selective P450-Based Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sensors for Dopamine and Serotonin   What is not very clear to me from the other answer if all 4 neurotransmitter systems listed above can be measured in a living brain, or if some of them are out of reach of modern science. Can we measure Noradrenaline, Dopamine,Serotonin and Choline/Acetylcholine levels in a living brain using modern methods?   Thank you for your input! "
2706,How similar are human brains within the same haplogroup?,"I've read about neuroscience and listen to talks like this one Juan Enriquez: Will our kids be a different species, I'm starting to realize that humans are not all the same, and are instead quite different.  My question is: how ""different"" are humans from each other from a point of view of neuroscience and neurobiology?   One of the talks at TED.com gave a number that Homo Sapiens is 0.004% different from Neanderthal genetically. Another example given that olympic powerlifters have a certain genetic marker that the general population might not have.   To refine the question: just how different from the perspective of white matter tract anatomy or the distribution of receptors within our neuronal populations are humans of the same haplogroup from one another?  "
2707,What stimulus features determine the psychophysical power law exponent?,"Following the work of Stanley Stevens, psychophysical functions of stimulus intensity are commonly assumed to follow power laws, as illustrated below:   This appears to be true for a wide variety of different types of stimuli and sensations. A table that is often presented to illustrate this generality is from Stevens, 1975:    However, it is not obvious from perusing this table what kinds of stimuli tend to be associated with what kinds of power exponents -- in particular, what kinds of stimuli tend to be associated with positively accelerated psychophysical functions of intensity vs. negatively accelerated psychophysical functions of intensity. Indeed, the exponents in the table above appear to be distributed rather haphazardly to me, and I have not seen any mention of work suggesting it is otherwise in my admittedly limited literature search.  So my question is: Is anyone aware of research that attempts to characterize what kinds of stimuli tend to be associated with what kinds of psychophysical functions of stimulus intensity? If so, what is the basic summary from this research, and what are some suggested readings? As hinted above, I am particularly interested in stimulus features that predict positively vs. negatively accelerated psychophysical functions of stimulus intensity, but references to and descriptions of more specific research questions are also quite welcome.  Update: I thought it might help to say just a little bit more about exactly what I'm interested in finding out here, in as clear and concise a way as I know how. What I am looking for are any references to review papers and/or research articles that are about (or even that just mention) predicting the form of the psychophysical power law across a range of different stimuli, using stimulus-level predictors. It is hard to extract any general conclusions about this from Stevens's table above, given that the power law exponent appears to vary widely, sometimes being >1 and sometimes &lt;1, even for stimuli on the same psychological continuum, as in the cases of ""Taste"" and ""Warmth."" The point of the table (and indeed the body of research that it is based on) is just to show that these functions follow power laws of some kind or other -- while this is mildly interesting, what I really want to know is how well we can predict what kinds of power laws different stimuli will follow. Please let me know if I can offer any additional clarification. "
2708,Differences in willingness to correct errors made between human and computer interactions,"I have a design where I present participants with a series of decisions, and then ask them about some of these decisions later.  Similar work has found that even when the particular decision was made in error, and people 'should' realise this, participants carry on and attempt to justify the decisions anyway.  I presented similar decisions but with a computer program acting as 'the experimenter', providing text boxes for input.   Participants mentioned errors made in my study much more - they didn't carry on justifying an error.    This was an unexpected result. I suspect some of this may be due to participants not wanting to admit to making an error when they feel more identifiable, but I don't know where to start in terms of literature on the topic!  So essentially - what are the differences in peoples willingness to admit and correct their own, or even others, errors, between social and computer interactions? and further, what causes these differences?

2710,Why do people regret actions they didn't take when looking back on their lives?," Is it true that individuals often regret recent actions (i.e., last few months) but when they look back on their lives, they tend to regret things that they have not done (or lack of actions) ? If so, what causes this?  "
2711,"Is there any ""predictive"" component to positive/negative affect in Seasonal Affective Disorder and Bipolar Disorder?","I'm wondering if the human brain ""predicts"" how certain weeks of the year should feel?   For example, a child who is going to school may have a more positive affect in anticipation of summer holidays, and may feel more negatively towards the end of the summer, as he/she knows that freedom and fun are about to end.   Another example may be siblings' or parents' birthdays, where the anticipation of the birthday increases positive affect.  I'm wondering if year after year of such patterns (in childhood, the teenage years and maybe young adolescence) can create an association in the brain between positive/negative affect and the specific time of the year, or specific photoperiod duration (day length). What I'm trying to understand is, if a pattern of such ups and downs that may have been established in the childhood persists throughout adulthood?  Have there been any studies that looked at the previous life history and incidence of mania/depression episodes in bipolar disorder, or the onset of depression in Seasonal Affective Disorder(SAD), and correlated them with holidays, birthdays, etc? I've read that SAD may manifest a depression in any season, not just winter, which got me thinking of the possible causes.  "
2712,Origin of the SEEV Model of visual attention distribution,What's the original source of the SEEV (Salience Effort Expectancy Value) Model for predicting the distribution of visual attention? I've seen it mentioned in many papers and presentations but everyone of them lacks a reference to the source of this model.  Does anyone have a valid reference? 
2713,Attention Theory: is it impossible to avoid distraction?,"I remember reading at some point in the literature that humans are unable to avoid distraction from a certain primary task if this task isn't using up close to all available 'resources' - basically meaning that everytime the human brain has cognitive resources left, they'll be allocated to one thing or another.  Is that right? If not, at what point is my understanding wrong? Can you give a relevant reference concerning this question?  Edit: I'm referring to distraction in the context of traffic from the perspective of the individual driver.   See Hancock, P. A., Mouloua, M., &amp; Senders, J. W. (2009). On the philosophical foundations of the distracted driver and driving distraction. "
2714,"How long can a person stay happy, excited and motivated about something new?","I'm interested in learning more about studies or experiments that determine how long a typical person can stay excited about something new:  New job new project new relationship new idea new purchase/toy   Is there any evidence to support the hypothesis that humans are excited by new things/prospects, but only for a short time? If so, how short? Is it days, weeks or a ""honey moon""?   A while ago I've heard a talk on TED.com that happy people are up to 30% more productive (Does happiness affect productivity?), and I'm wondering if this is applicable to ""being excited about something new"" - i.e: are people more effective/smart when they are taking on new project, new job or a new relationship? Are people more excited, energized and engaged when they conceive new ideas?   It would also help if I get to learn what the search term for ""being excited about something new"" is.   Update: Looking into happiness and productivity produced two terms: ""Happiness economics"" and Hedonic Adaptation. The article on hedonic adaptation says that happiness is homeostatic in nature      a system that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain   a stable, relatively constant condition of [its] properties   Reading that happiness regulates itself (as in negative feedback) sounds very reasonable to me, and I recall reading about antidepressants and Serotonin, which also mentioned that Serotonin production uses negative feedback, where more Serotonin released now inhibits release of more Serotonin, thus antidepressants dont work immediately and require a couple weeks to take effect[looking for a link].   I'm wondering if the process of being excited about something new is also homeostatic in nature? "
2715,The effect of lifestyle photography on sales conversion rates,"I work for a large UK-based clothing retailer. After some initial customer testing with our product details page (on our website) there has been some debate on the following question:  Do customers react better to lifestyle-based product photography or shots of clothing on a mannequin?  My personal guess is that the majority of users will favour the lifestyle type images and distance themselves from the rather bland mannequin style. The mannequin style strikes me as somewhat cold in an business that tried to instill a sense of fashion (which by definition is creative).   However I like to think I'm a practical fellow and so I'm seeking any established research that would support - or discredit - my theory. Can sales conversion rates be improved (increased) with the use of lifestyle imagery (showing live models interacting/wearing) the products, as opposed to person-less mannequin based photographs?  Thank you to anyone who can point me in the right directions of any such research. "
2716,How can I test whether Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) activity at night is related to variations in mood?,"I'm reading this paper, which discusses Serotonin activity in the Dorsal Ralphe Nucleus(DRN), and even includes some mathematical models of how serotonin is released and reabsorbed. The paper states that depressed patients show significant decreases in serotonin both in DRN and outside. The thing that impressed me about this paper is that it gives examples of the serotonin concentration in DRN in normal person, compared to depressed patient, and the difference is about 80%  Bursts and the Efficacy of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors  The paper above referenced this excellent paper on how DRN is involved in the regulation of motor activity, and even includes some references to how DRN is involved in the sleep/wake cycle.   5-HT and motor control: a hypothesis  Here's an example of a graph from the article above. It shows how the firing rate of the DRN increases in response to cat's grooming, compared to quiet wakefulness. DRN firing pattern changes in response to movement. Can I reverse this statement to say that movement indicates DRN activity?     The hypothesis that I have is that if less Serotonin is available in the DRN as a result of depression, the activity of the DRN as related to motion at night would be different from the normal person. I hypothesize that by observing the motion of human in bed at night, it may be possible to quantify the activity of DRN, potentially using this information to predict mood fluctuations.   Here's my train of thought - DRN fires differently in response to motion, and motion is accompanied by DRN firing, while muscle atonia is accompanied by total lack of firing. An actigraph has shown that a person (myself and others) moves over the course of the night, in bursts with episodes of total stillness and episodes of burst activity. People move differently in different sleep stages. In cats without atonia (see figure below), DRN gets activated when Rapid Eye Movement(REM) sleep is detected, in response to the cat's actions within the dream, similar to the waking state.. Normally, DRN shows absolutely no firing pattern during REM sleep. I would like to examine the pattern of movement over night and compare it to the feeling of well being in subsequent days, where depression can be linked to decreased levels of Serotonin in DRN cells.    If I understand the Bursts and the Efficacy of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors paper correctly, bursts of electrical activity within the DRN alter Serotonin concentrations for some time after the burst. As such, it seems to me that bursts of electrical activity associated with motion (a typical motion at night is 3-10 seconds) with a large motion observed every 2-3 minutes over the 20 or so minute period that preceedes awakening would have an impact on the Serotonin concentration in the DRN.      I'm trying to understand if activation of Dorsal Raphe Nucleus during Rapid Eye Movement sleep can be detected with an iPhone actigraph, and if this activation can be quantified, measured and correlated to behavior in the preceeding and subsequent few days. I'm looking to correlate activation of DRN or lack of thereof with the normal, elevated or depressed moods and activity patterns.   An iPhone actigraph measures gross motor activity, which I guess would roughly compare to the EMG from the images above. In this case, the plot is logarithmic, with taller redder bars being orders of magnitude bigger than the baseline ""noise"" observed by the device.    Over the past year I've been working on an iPhone actigraph - an app that analyzes user's motion and can be used for sleep studies. On that actigraph, I'm seeing spikes in motion (my sleep) at different sleep phases. The device allows marking of events over night - midnight awakenings, and dream awakenings.   Here's an example of a sleep cycle graph that is drawn based on the observed motion at night. In this case, the deeper the graph, the more still the person is. Red circles indicate insomnia, green circles indicate subsequent dream awakenings.    The device also allows the user to track moods over the course of the day with a very cool Pick A Mood scale and add different events, such as meals, exercise and over 80 other types of events.   Since I'm only an amateur at science and sleep studies, what are your thoughts on the train of thought above? Is there any merit to the hypothesis? How would I go about testing it with the technology I outlined?  Thank you for your input! "
2717,Analysis of parameter estimates from Ratcliff diffusion model,"I would like to analyze a dataset in which subjects' reaction time and error rate have been recorded. In order to account for potential speed-accuracy trade-off I am planning to make use of the Ratcliff's diffusion model. My data is a within-subject repeated-measures design with two sessions per subject (drug &amp; placebo) with multiple measurements in each session (around 80).  While reading some papers regarding this topic I found a nice report by Wenzlaff et al. (2011). First they fit the diffusion model for every subject and then take the estimated parameters to an ANOVA. However I was confused by their approach: it seems they select the best fitting model for every subject and in this way are fitting models with different parameters for the subjects. My understanding was that it is not a valid approach to put together estimates from models with different parameters?  My questions are:   Would it be a valid approach to first fit the diffusion model separately for every subject and then take the estimated parameters to a group-level analysis (e.g. repeated-measures ANOVA)? Prior to ANOVA of parameter estimates: is it - in the above context - better to fit the same model to all subjects or to select the best fitting model for every subject?

2718,Why is Asperger Syndrome poorly recognised in France?,"Asperger Syndrome is quite well-known in psychiatric circles, as well as (to a lesser degree) the general public, in many countries the western world. However, in France, Asperger Syndrome is virtually unknown to the general public. From what I have read in various sources, French psychiatry denies the existence of Asperger Syndrome, instead using alternative diagnoses and alternative treatments, some of which can be very harmful. This is not the case in other Francophone areas; the situation in Belgium, Quebec and Switzerland is better.   Below I quote the French Wikipedia article on Asperger Syndrome and I attempt to provide a translation:     Le syndrome eut du mal à être reconnu et ne l'est pas encore totalement. Il peut être ignoré par les professionnels, parfois réticents à annoncer le diagnostic à cause d'orientations théoriques personnelles ; le syndrome d'Asperger n'existe pas en tant qu'entité distincte dans les précédentes versions de la CFTMEA et n'y a été individualisé que dans la dernière version (année 2000). Notons que les termes « disharmonie de développement », « disharmonie d'évolution », « disharmonie évolutive », « disharmonie psychotique », « Trouble Complexe et Multiple du Développement (MCDD Multiple-complex Developpemental Disorder) » sont souvent utilisés en France pour décrire les troubles autistiques. Ces termes ne figurent pas dans la nomenclature internationale CIM1014 et ne devraient plus être utilisés, selon les recommandations. De fait, depuis quelques années, certaines associations dénoncent des diagnostics de « dépression infantile » qui sont de plus en plus souvent prononcés à tort, en lieu et place des anciennes « disharmonies »15[réf. insuffisante].      L'approche française se défait néanmoins progressivement d'une imprégnation psychanalytique qui propose une prise en charge singulière du diagnostic et de la prise en charge de ce syndrome.   My rough translation attempt (a native speaker is encouraged to improve):     The syndrome was difficult to be recognized and is still not fully. It can be ignored by professionals who may be reluctant to perform an Asperger diagnosis diagnosis because of personal theoretical opinions; Asperger syndrome does not exist as a separate entity in previous versions of the CFTMEA and was taken up as a separate entity only in the latest version (2000). Note that the terms ""disharmonic development,"" ""disharmony of evolution"", ""progressive disharmony"", ""psychotic disharmony"", ""Disorder and Multiple Complex Development (TSLS Multiple-complex Developmental Disorder)"" are often used in France to describe autistic disorder. These terms are not included in the international nomenclature CIM1014 and should not be used as recommended. In fact, in recent years, some associations decry diagnostics of ""childhood depression"" that is increasingly often given erroneously, instead of the former ""disharmony"".      The French approach however defeats slowly a psychoanalytic penetration that proposes to take a unique diagnosis approach to take care of the syndrome.     Why is Asperger Syndrome so poorly recognised in France? Are there political reasons behind this (we don't want this ""American"" thing), does it reflect a wider culture in French psychiatry, or is there no clear cause for this? "
2719,Abstract idealized mental visualization improves motor task performance,"I practice martial arts (Aikido), which involves a lot of rotation.  When practicing, I find that holding an abstract image in my head, instead of thinking about the actual technique, improves my performance of the technique.  For example, when rotation is required, my mental image is essentially a vertical spiral pulled tight in the middle (as if constrained by a belt), in that one comes in to the axis of rotation and must stay on it before moving off into the rest of the technique.  The question, then is: What explains why an abstract mental image can improve adherence to an ideal set of movements?    And, can this be explained neuro-biologically and, if yes, how?  (I suspect that the two questions have similar, if not the same, answers - hence why I've included both instead of separating them)  If you prefer to not answer those questions, believe that I should be answering these myself, or believe that this is not high-enough quality for CogSci (I apologize for any improper terminology), please offer a direction in which I can start my research into this phenomena, as at the moment I am at a loss for where to begin.

2721,Criteria for evaluating cognitive systems,"In the first chapter of the book ""How to Build a Brain"", Chris Eliasmith quickly establishes some criteria which he will use to evaluate Spaun, the cognitive system described in the book. He describes them in great detail in Chapter 8, but below is my attempt at summarizing them.    1. Representational Structure  Systematicity  The system should connect concepts in an inter-connected way and understand there are classes of concepts, since human thought is systematic. For example, given blue ball and red square, it should be possible for the system to reason about the concept of blue square.  Compositionality  Concepts should be created off of the combination of concepts to the degree supported by real cognitive systems. For example, given the concepts of pet and fish, it should be possible to reason about the novel concept pet fish.  Productivity  The system should be able to create many representation based off of a few basic representations to the degree supported by real cognitive systems.  The Massive Binding Problem  The system should identify a binding operation that scales well.  2. Performance Concerns  Syntactic generalization  Ability to exploit the structure of language regardless of content.  Robustness  Losing a few neurons or being exposed to noise shouldn't break the system.  Adaptability  You should be able to use a single system for multiple task.  Memory  The system should be able to show the relation to the various types of memory (working, long-term).  Scalability  Large portions of the brain should be modeled and able to complete a wide variety of tasks.  3. Scientific merit  Triangulation  Contact with the most sources of experimental data as possible.  Compactness  Good theories can be stated compactly and without ad-hoc additions.    He explains in the chapter that this is actually a synthesis of various other criteria proposed by various authors. Although the scientific merit seems rather straightforward to me and has been elaborated upon on great length, the other criteria I am less certain about in terms of completeness and acceptance. Have attempts at unified criteria been made before? Are there more complete criteria? Are these criteria at odds with any other ideas about what a cognitive system should embody? "
2722,"Can anxiety cause a heart attack, black-out or insanity?","David Burns in his self-help book about overcoming depression, anxiety and interpersonal problems called The Feeling Good Handbook¹ states:     ...neurotic anxiety results from distorted thoughts that have little to no basis in reality. If you are having a panic attack, you may believe that something terrible will happen if you let your anxiety get out of hand. You might think you'll pass out from a stroke or have a heart attack or go crazy. Although these fears seem legitimate, they're quite unrealistic because: (1) Anxiety never causes strokes or heart attacks. (2) Most people who are afraid of passing out during a panic attack have never once passed out when in a state of panic. In fact, you cannot pass out during a panic attack because your heart is beating rapidly and pumping extra blood to the brain. (3) Panic attacks never lead to insanity or loss of control. You are worrying about something that's blatantly unrealistic.   This is a revelation to me. Is it true that it is impossible for a panic attack to cause heart attacks? black-outs? insanity? If there are exceptions, how are they explained? Does this extend to all forms of anxiety, fears and phobias, not only panic attacks?  ¹ Part III “Feeling confident: how to conquer anxiety, fears, and phobias”, Chapter 11: “Understanding anxiety”, page 212.

2723,Is there any treatment for cognitive difficulties of patients with Parkinson's disease?,"I've read some articles and science papers about Parkinson's disease and found out that many patients often have cognitive difficulties, if not all of them. For memory difficulty, medications to treat Alzheimer's are used, but is there something for other cognitive difficulties, e.g., for focus and executive dysfunction? No medication was mentioned in some papers I've read, so I wonder if there is any medication that helps with those problems at the moment?  Also, what is the actual damage in the brain after having Parkinson's for about 15 years? Is memory irreversibly damaged, i.e., can't be retrieved with medications? "

2726,How to read a neuron tuning curve graph?,"I'm working through the tutorial of section 2.4 of ""How to Build a Brain"" and I've encountered this graph of a neuron tuning curve.    I understand the Y axis is the firing rate of the neuron, that each curve is the response of a single neuron (there are 100 neurons represented here) and that this plot shows a variety of ""on"" and ""off"" neurons, but what does the X axis represent? Is it the action potential input? Is X the value that the neuron represents by firing at that rate?  Please allow me to give some context around the tutorial. You first create a population of 100 neurons to represent an input that will vary from -1 to 1. You notice that this works well, but that the representation degrades when you exceed this range falls apart and you cannot represent anything the range past -2 to 2.  You then use a new population of neurons to build upon this newly acquired knowledge of how neurons can represent functions, to make them represent a 2-dimensional vector similar to the monkey-arm motor experiment performed by Georgopolous.  I could take the leap of faith here and just take for granted that neurons can represent functions and that the more neurons you have, the better approximation of the function you can get, but I feel like understanding these fundamental concepts are important.

2727,Can changing attitude cure depression?,"There's a proverb: ""everything's decided in mind"" - changing attitude of thing may help going through things.  Does it also mean that if someone is depressed then there'd be enough to change how he sees the world to cure his/her depression? Or is it a deeper problem? "
2728,Is it possible to develop curiosity?,"I know that curiosity is developed kinda on it's own. You don't know when you'll become curious. But is it possible to train one's mind to become curious about certain subject? I've seen titles and tips on ""how"" to become curious, but I don't think those ""X steps"" will make someone's mind budge.    Is it possible to sort of prime oneself to become curious? Mind priming seams powerful for certain things, and it's only thing that I thought could work. Again, priming mind that knows it's gonna be primed sounds rather tricky.   Note: I know the question is messy,so please,do correct me and tag appropriately if needed . :) "
2729,What exactly is the neurobiological mechanism behind the functioning of the human muscle?,"From what I have read, its been given that muscle functioning and coordination involves two processes: frequency summation and muscle recruitment. What I want to know is that, do these two processes work simultaneously or are these two stages separate? As in, both frequency summation and muscle recruitment contributes to modulating the amount of force which makes me wonder why two processes are required to satisfy the same purpose?  The conclusion I could come to was that, frequency summation applies to only a single muscle fiber and when the fiber saturates and no more force can be recruited more muscles are recruited to increase the amount of force applied. An example scenario of this occurring would be a person is lifting a very heavy object. I want to know whether my inference is right or wrong? If wrong I would like someone to explain to me the exact mechanism.  "
2730,Efficiency drop when joining and splitting teams,"What will happen when a team is either split or joined with another team? After reading about Tuckman's stages of group development, I understand that the new team will probably start at the beginning or go back a few stages depending on how much they know each other and how much they have worked together before.  My questions are:   Has there has been done any research on why you should or should not join or merge teams in short time periods? By how much will the efficiency drop by on average? How long does it take on average to become as efficient as before?   EDIT: To read more about tuckman's stages of group development you can go to this site.

2733,Theoretical grounding for Agile/Scrum methodologies in software development,"Agile and Scrum methodologies are well known and often studied and written about in software development. But these methodologies are about managing the activities and the workplace itself.  Are there psychologic or sociologic theories (like those studied in Industrial and organizational psychology) that could explain the effectiveness, or lack of it, of Agile / Scrum methodologies?  I am aware of experimental work on the topic, like that by Elizabeth Whitworth. However, I am not interested in empirical studies about the effectiveness of using Agile / Scrum. I am interested in theoretical justifications for why we would expect Agile/Scrum to be effective or ineffective based on what we know about social and io-psychology. Are there existing psychological or sociological theories that explain the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of Agile/Scrum?

2734,Does the Minnesota 12 steps model really produce an effective change in the treatment of drugs addictions?,"The Minnesota 12 steps model claims to cure drug addiction, but doesn't deeply deal with the personality structure underlying addiction. We know today how addiction is a problem with an enormous range of factors causing it, being personality or/and psychopathology and coping strategies some of the most important.   The method uses 12 steps to free individuals from drugs, but it doesn't use any deep approach to their personalities and its duration is also too short to do it (""The primary care program was intended to last up to 60 days in a residential setting"", "" ""insurance companies then set 28 days as a reimbursement guideline in order to ensure sufficient coverage""(1). There is even little evidence that this model is effective, and it received criticisms.    Hence my questions:   Is it really producing changes, or only temporary changes which can collapse every time that personality is challenged? Can it be realistically expected that the individuals treated by this method have their personalities really transformed and would never feel the necessity of consuming drugs, or have other type of addictive behaviours?

They just don't care about not talking with people who don't want to wait and listen to their thoughts. Is that arrogance? low self-esteem? severely anti-social?  (2) Is Apraxia of speech degenerative? Without treatment, speaking will become more, and more, difficult?  (3) Is it socially unacceptable to speak slowly with a monotone pronunciation? "
2736,Kahneman's add one / three exercise,"In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman describes a mental exercise which he calls Add One:     To start, make up several strings of 4 digits, all different, and write each string on an index card. Place a blank card on top of the deck. The task you will perform is called Add-1. Here is how it goes:       Start beating a steady rhythm. Remove the blank card and read the four digits aloud. Wait for two beats, then report a string in which each of the original digits is incremented by 1. If the digits on the card are 5294, the correct response is 6305. Keeping the rhythm is important.   This description is a bit vague and I'm wondering how the exercise is supposed to work exactly. He does not mention to cover up the card before reporting the modified digits. This would allow to perform the transformations on-the-fly digit by digit. This does not sound challenging at all and does not fit to Kahneman's following statements of loading the working memory, in particular:     Few people can cope with more than four digits in the Add-1 task.     My assumption was that he means something like that:   Beat 1: Uncover card Beat 2: Read aloud first digit Beat 3: Read aloud second digit Beat 4: Read aloud third digit Beat 5: Read aloud fourth digit Beat 6: Wait + cover card Beat 7: Wait Beat 8: Say first digit + 1 Beat 9: Say second digit + 1 Beat 10: Say third digit + 1 Beat 11: Say fourth digit + 1     However, a quick Google search reveals a few implementations, for instance:   This blog post resulting in a YouTube video of the exercise. An Android app slow thinking trainer.   To my surprise both attempts use the dull version of reporting the transformed digits while seeing them.  My question: Is there a better description of the exercise which was originally used in the scientific studies? "

2738,Anorexia nervosa as an anxiety management tool,"Talking to people with anorexia nervosa, I noticed that some of them have actually much bigger problems than their aforementioned condition.   In some cases it looked as if the person was spending daily an insane amount of time on food, having no time left to deal with other more serious issues in his life. Removing his anorexia, would leave him ""helpless"" against his real fear, so why would he want that? He would rather keep postponing facing his fear... indefinitely.     Question:     Are there any studies related to the above conditions being used by a person, as a way to divert his attention away from other events that are actually even more stressful?     Note: I'm not implying that distraction is always the only (or even the main) reason these conditions appear; I'm simply wondering if they are sometimes used subconsciously as another anxiety management tool.  "
2739,Do the results of psychological studies change our behaviour?,"This is a question that has been bugging me for a very long time.  Let me illustrate with a silly example. Suppose that a study finds out that the majority of the population associate the number 1 with the colour blue (again, this is is a very silly example). Suppose this study becomes very popular and the result comes to be known to most people. How will this knowledge of the experiment change behaviour? Will the result still be the same after the study is known to the entire population?  EDIT : I am not talking about the kind of results where we do not have influence on our behaviours, like our heart rate during a tense situation or how we react when our life is threatened. I am talking about experiments where we can make a conscious choice and is apparently ""inconsequential"" (so, nothing that poses harm to us).  EDIT 2: //New Example// The use of canned laughter in sitcoms -- Many of us by now have realised that laugh tracks are used in sitcoms to direct how the audience should react and make them think that what they are watching is funnier than it actually is (Example of Social Proof, which is nicely explained by Robert Cialdini). After I knew this, I actually found TV shows employing the technique to be less funny and in some cases, even annoying. (I assume that many people reacted the same way after finding out about it). So the study of this particular behaviour actually made me react in the opposite way that the TV show producers intended and how the study says I should be behaving. Thus, changing the results of the study.  Are there other studies like this? How do we design experiments that are tolerant to this? "
2740,Paper showing that completing most psychological studies is less distressing than daily life,"I once read a study that compared the level of distress of completing a psychological study to other activities in daily life (e.g., commuting to work; interacting with colleagues; watching tv; or something like that).  The paper is a good reference when you are applying for ethics approval.  Does anyone know the reference? Or perhaps there are a few such articles? "
2741,Do mirror neurons fire during visualization?,"It is known that mirror neurons fire when watching another person performing the same activity.

2742,"Statistically, what are the determinants of which particular religion someone will follow?","I can look at data on smokers and recent ex-smokers to identify what variables correlate with success in quitting, or relapse. I can adjust for covariates, or leave the analysis unadjusted. I did a spot of Googling and coudldn't find analogues findings from the psychology of religion at the level of different denominations, although there were studies about religious behaviour, non-specific to particular faiths. Has this work been done, and if so, what are the determinants? If the work hasn't been done, which datasets are best suited for that? "
2743,Negative emotions in individuals spreading to others,"I am aware of the effect of positive emotions on others, but I am wondering about negative emotions.  I am not talking about insults leading to negative emotions.  I am talking about emotions like anger, frustration etc. in some leading to anger, frustration etc. in others.  Are there any studies which suggest that there is the ability for emotions such as anger and frustration to transfer and spread amongst others or lead to other emotions in others?  For example, can a group of people seeing one or more people getting frustrated about something lead to some or all in the observing group suffer from frustration or annoyance or other negative emotions?  **Update**  I have found the answer to this question which was interesting, talking about negative priors (Beck, 1979; Huys, Daw, &amp; Dayan, 2015) shaping your predictions about the world leading to more negative emotions.  What I am interested in is the possibility of negative emotions spreading amongst otherwise psychologically healthy people, just as positive emotions do.

2748,Are psychologists more immune to psychological problems?,"Does knowledge of a psychological problem prevent (or enable one to better defend) the development of psychological issues?

Are there statistics about the ratio of mental health problems among psychologists and therapists vs the general public? "
2749,Quantifying the Dunning-Kruger Effect,"The Dunning-Kruger effect states that people unexperienced in a certain field or subject generally perceive themselves as having greater aptitude than in reality they do. Dunning and Kruger were able to quantify this using test-scores in their original paper, but popular expositions typically generalize this in a way consistent with the following plot:    As a layman, this form is more interesting to me because it is more generally applicable, but it also suffers from some drawbacks:   How should experience/confidence be gauged or measured? Is there a general way to do this which doesn't rely on test scores? Suppose experience is measured in hours spent on the subject. Is there an approximate number of hours at which the peak is reached? The minimum? If so what are these numbers?   If an answer to either (but especially 2) is possible or available, it will help conscientious newcomers to any subject estimate the amount of time needed before trusting a self-evaluation of their competency. "
2750,How long does it take to decide for an multiple choice option with increasing number of choices?,"I am trying to estimate the duration of an empirical experiment. In that experiment, the participant has to progress through as many trials as possible, and every trial is a simple multiple choice question like Which color do you like more? Red, Blue or Green. The experiment should last 30 minutes, and one goal is that the participant has given as much feedback as possible. Feedback is every choice that has been displayed, not only those choices the participant decided for in every particular trial.  Obviously, the participant should evaluate every choice available in a trial, and therefore time to answer should increase. However, I assume that this is not linearly correlated.   I.e. is there some heuristic available that enables me to extrapolate from time needed to answer a question with two choices to time needed to answer a question with 20 choices?  "
2751,Human memory - remembering sequences of letters vs numbers,"There are 10 digits and 26 letters. In computer science you'd need 4 bits to store a digit value and 5 bits do store a letter value.  Does the same apply to human brain? Is a statistical person able to remember more digits than letters, or is there no difference? Or maybe it varies from person to person? "
2752,Calculate criterion values for each confidence level (within SDT),"Take a 2AFC task, where people also give a measure of confidence.  In the framework of signal detection theory, the criterion values for each confidence level are simply additional criteria, placed on the same internal response axis as the (first order task) decision criterion.   Can I estimate the values of these additional confidence criteria from the data of a subject? If so, how? Would I simply take all trials with (say) confidence = 3, and calculate the criterion based on those trials alone? "
2753,Is it better to study multiple subjects simultaneously or focus on one subject intensely at a time?,"Since I will soon have a bit of free time, I thought I'd use it to enhance my knowledge pool. I chose four subjects that always interested me (but that are not related) and thought I'd dive in a bit more seriously.  However, now I have a question - Assuming I wish to make the most of my time (one month, four hours each day) and learn the most in the small time-frame I have, I can think of two approaches:  One: Study one subject intensely, say four hours a day, for a full week, before completely switching to another subject.  Two: Study all subjects simultaneously, say one hour each per day, for the full month.  My question is: Are there studies which show which of these two paths will lead to greater retention of the material studied in the given time-frame? In other words, which is better if you wish to study diverse subjects: Focus on one at a time or spread out equally? "
2754,Can humans keep track of two unrelated rhythms?,"Let's do an experiment. With your left hand start tapping out a regular (evenly-spaced) beat - say, 2 beats per second. With your right hand attempt to tap our a different regular beat, but tap at a rate that is ""as unrelated as possible"" to the first beat - something like 3.14159 beats per second. (Here ""as unrelated as possible"" is weakly defined. Basically, I mean to keep two rhythms that are both regular but will never be in sync.)  My question is this: Is it possible for a human to actually keep accurate track of both rhythms? Or will they interfere with one another so that the rhythm of one or both hands is lost?  My own (admittedly unjustified) model of neuronal behavior is that rhythmic action of the left hand must correspond to rhythmic patterns of neural activity in the brain with the same frequency. And similarly, rhythmic action of the right hand must correspond to rhythmic patterns with that frequency. Since, I suspect, the task of tapping out a rhythm requires coordination across several areas of the brain, then it seems that the a-periodic neuronal firing would likely interefere and cause one rhythm or the other to become dominant - or both rhythms to be lost entirely.  (Oh... and for the sake of this question, assume the corpus callosum is intact. Missing CC is cheating here.) "
2755,What are 'gap junctions' (electrical synapses) for?,"I was reading this and I found the following sentences:     Apart from chemical synapses neurons can also be coupled by electrical synapses, so-called gap junctions. Specialized membrane proteins make a direct electrical connection between the two neurons. Not very much is known about the functional aspects of gap junctions, but they are thought to be involved in the synchronization of neurons.   Do we really know very little about the functional aspects of gap junctions? And how are they involved the 'synchronization' of neurons? "
2756,Why do some people react verbally to intrusive thoughts and/or embarrassing memories?,"It seems to me that there are two kinds of intrusive thoughts. The first consists of those thoughts that didn't actually occur in real life, but are nonetheless intrusive and embarrassing and disturbing to the individual (i.e. thoughts of harming someone else, or unwanted sexual thoughts directed towards individuals). The seconds consists of past memories of embarrassing moments, particularly from childhood.  I've noticed that many people will respond to these thoughts in some way. I've had many friends tell me that if I hear them 'talking gibberish' or 'making strange noises', it is because they are having a bad thought. I myself have noticed now that I will talk out loud when I remember an embarrassing thought -- but I won't speak of the thought, I will say random things, like ""Okay, okay, okay"" or ""I love you"". Usually, I will repeat a phrase over and over under my breath, until I catch myself doing it.  I've also noticed certain individuals will use verbal gestures to show that they are thinking of something negative. My father will scratch his head and blow out of his mouth for several minutes at a time when he is having intrusive thoughts, or 'conversations'.  Is there an explanation for this phenomena? Why is it that externalizing our thoughts seems to 'rid' our head of them? "
2757,Is it possible to be clinically obsessed with school?,"I was wondering if it is possible for someone to have a clinical obsession with higher education. For example, the person who has this disorder constantly talks to others about things such as college to the point where something seems very wrong. Does a disorder like this exist? Or can it be a form of another disorder? I'm asking because I'm writing a research paper on various obsessions and would like to gain some insight on the matter. "
2758,"What is ""perceptual competence""?",I have no idea what perceptual competence is? Does anyone know about it? I found no information about it on the web. 
2759,Are all conscious experiences stored as memories?,"There are people with supermemories, called highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM), i.e., the detailed recollection of events that occurred in the distant past. Although the recollection of, say the weather on this day 15 years ago may not be entirely accurate (errors occur) and may contain gaps (maybe an hour of sunshine on a predominantly rainy day is not recollected), their memories are clearly superior nonetheless.   I have heard these statements that all memories are stored in the brain and that the reason why we forget is because those memories are simply not accessible anymore. This would metaphorically be like the workings of a hard drive, where deletion of a file removes the flag, but the information is physically still stored, it is just invisible to the user and difficult to access. Following this reasoning, everyone would have HSAM in a way, barred that normally the memories can't readily be accessed.   Hypnosis seems to be capable of enhancing the recollection of memories in people without HSAM, and hence hypnosis is said to improve memory, indirectly indicating that memory storage indeed may generally be higher than apparent in everyday life, but that the brain needs a hand in retrieving those memories.  My question is:   Are all conscious1 memories stored, but access is permitted only when its regularly accessed, or enhanced through hypnosis or other means? In other words, does everyone have super memory like HSAM, but do people without HSAM simply lack an efficient way to access those distant memories?    1 With all conscious memories I mean memories of life events that were experienced while being awake and vigilant. For the sake of question focus, I suggest disregarding life events occurring during sleep, coma, anesthesia or other periods of reduced consciousness. "
2760,Are there any conditions or disorders not related to intelligence that might prevent an adult human from possessing a theory of mind?,"I am familiar with studies in which children are tested for theory of mind.  In one such experiment, a story is told:  Betty is playing with her doll in the bedroom.  Then she has to go to school, so she leaves the doll on her bed.  While she is at school, her mom takes the doll and puts it on the kitchen counter.  When Betty gets home, where will she look for the doll?    The correct answer is obviously ""On the bed"", because that's where she last saw the doll.  But if the child says ""On the kitchen counter"", he or she does not yet possess a theory of mind - he or she doesn't understand that Betty doesn't know everything that her mother knows, and has no way of knowing that the doll was moved while Betty was at school.  If I'm not mistaken, children normally develop theory of mind around the age of 4 or 5.  But are there any conditions or disorders unrelated to intelligence that might prevent an adult from possessing a ""normal"" theory of mind? "
2761,How common is it for twins conjoined at the head to share thoughts and visual stimuli?,"I've always been interested in the possibility of a pair of conjoined twins, joined at the head, being able to read each other's thoughts, react to stimuli that one of them can't see/hear/feel, and being unable to keep secrets from one another.  Until recently, every pair of conjoined twins I learned about said that they are very much two different people with different personalities and emotions.    Then I read a wikipedia article about Krista and Tatiana Hogan.  It was a newspaper article, unfortunately, rather than a piece in a scientific journal, but the description of the girls is exactly what I had been thinking of:  If one girl is blindfolded, she can see what her sister sees.  They share thoughts.  They can't keep secrets from one another.  If one of the girls hurts a limb that she controls, the other girl feels the pain as well as the girl who actually hurt herself.    I'm curious as to whether this phenomenon has been observed before.  How common is it for conjoined twins to share thoughts, see through each other's eyes, hear through each other's ears, and be incapable of keeping secrets from one another?  Has it ever been observed before this pair of twins? "
2762,What happens in the brain upon a subsequent exposure to a desired stimulus within a short time?,"I'm trying to understand what happens within a person's brain when a focus on an object of desire is temporarily disrupted by an outside event. In particular, what happens when the person focuses on the object of desire for the second time.   This question is best illustrated by an example:   A person has a delicious cake and is ready to eat it in a common cafeteria A coworker interrupts the person with some work related talk A coworker leaves, and a person resumes focus on the cake.   What happens the moment the outside distraction is gone and the reward circuitry focuses on the object of desire again? Does the reward circuitry resume from a temporary suspension of activity, or does it reboot and start from scratch?  By restart I mean that if activity is measured, it would be very similar to the first time the cake is encountered, as if the brain is restarting the activity.  By resumption I mean that the activity is temporarily suspended and does not go through the same initial priming process as before.  "
2763,Has fiction or the study of fiction ever made meaningful contributions to Psychology?,"Those who study fiction often make certain claims, such as fiction allowing us to ""gain depth into the human experience"" and such. Psychology is the academic field which studies human behavior, and by proxy, the human mind and experience.  My question is, has a fictional work or the study fiction (literary analysis) ever made a meaningful contribution to the field of psychology? Like, has a literary analyzer written a paper on friendship of fictional characters, which ended up making a contribution to some psychological theory of friendship. Or are the claims that fiction gives insight into human experience empty? "

2765,What is the definition of song in the speech to song illusion?,"I have been looking at Diana Deutsch's ""speech-to-song"" illusion and I don't understand what she means by song. I have written a lot of music and I don't hear anything that sounds like a song in her samples.   [website]Can someone clarify what exactly she means by ""song""? I read through a related paper by here that seemed like it would have such a definition but didn't find one.  "
2766,What's the difference between perseveration and hyperfocus?,Dr. Russell Barkley says hyperfocus goes with autism while perseveration goes with ADHD.  I read that perseveration is the same as hyperfocus or that hyperfocus goes with ADHD.  So what's the difference? Is Dr. Russell Barkley right? 
2767,What is the mechanism behind recurring or looping thoughts?,"I'm interested in what is the mechanism that explains the recurrence or looping of thoughts within a person's mind. Unless very strongly distracted, such thoughts can creep up back or mutate slightly while maintaining the same overall theme - action is required.   From my understanding both positive and negative thoughts can loop, although thoughts with the themes of fear, anxiety, compulsion or desire can be more disturbing when looping.   What is the mechanism behind looping or recurring thoughts? In particular I'm interested if such thoughts are chemically induced through a release of some kind of neuromodulator (like fight or flight response is based on Adrenaline).  A few examples, where rational thought is used to counter irrational fear or anxiety thought:   Did I forget to do X?  I really have to go to Y, but what if I did not do X? [Imagination a horrible scenario when X is not done] I better go check on X. Check on X reassures the person, resulting in no new thoughts creeping in.   What interests me is what happens when the person either cannot go and check or will incur significant cost for doing so (ex: being late to work) or will try to resist the urge to check. In this case recurring thoughts can eventually reemerge and start to invade one's awareness:   Did I forget to turn the stove off? I really have to go to work. But the house can burn down  I believe that nothing bad will come out of it You can't know that The stove has a pilot light - gas will just keep burning But the cat can jump on a stove and get burnt Cat is smarter than that But the house can burn down You can become homeless Do you have fire insurance?

2768,"How can reaction times be measured, and what affects it?","I was playing pinball the other day, and I wasn't doing very well - my reactions were far too slow it seemed.

I imagine alcohol impairment and sleep deprivation affects them - are there other common factors? Is there anything that increases reactivity?  "
2769,How does listening to music decrease stress?,"I'm interested in how listening to different types of music (such as jazz, classical, etc.) can help some people calm down.  More specifically, how does the brain form a link between music heard and processed to the stress system? Is it some cortical association area or a direct circuit? "
2770,A definition of hatred towards your own nation,"There are such things as xenophobia, nationalism, etc. In other words, various forms of hating and diminishing the foreign and the foreigners.   My question is, is there a term meaning hatred and disparagement towards your own people or culture? Some kind of your-own-nation-phobia?   I don't mean xenophilia, because that's affection towards foreign, it doesn't mean hatred towards your own. I mean exactly hatred towards your own people/nation/culture/etc.  EDIT1: Just one of the examples of how this phenomena may work. An international conference. A person from, say, Russia, talks to a group people from various countries. Suddenly, another Russian joins the group. Our hero realizes that (either he knew that that person was a Russian beforehand or reads that on their badge) and an anger and disgust start boiling within him. He starts to be prejudiced and a bit aggressive towards his compatriot because that person is his compatriot. "

2772,Does schizophrenia cause a loss of intelligence?,"Does having schizophrenia cause a loss of intelligence (as measured by IQ tests)? How does present research comment on this connection, if it exists?  Furthermore, is it possible to recover from this decline in IQ? If so, under what conditions? "
2773,Can adhd and ocd coexist? Is it in the same way mania and depression can coexist (in bipolar disorder)?,"Is it really possible for someone to have both ADHD and OCD?  I was thinking that ADHD is the opposite of OCD: 1 2  from 1:     alexThePotato:      With ADHD you may be forgetful, distracted, make careless mistakes,   daydream, etc. With OCD, my impression is that you'd be very focused   on details, a bit perfectionist, and generally meticulous. So how do   they coexist, and what kind of behaviors do you attribute to each?      kukienboks:      Seems to me that OCD is about putting a lot of focus and energy into   unimportant things, something which Adhd-ers also can tend to do. The   main difference is probably that OCD-ers are driven by anxiety rather   than suffering from inability to prioritize tasks.   from 2:     There are also those who believe that OCD and ADHD often occur   together. This site on ADHD states, “It is not uncommon for someone to   have both ADHD and OCD.” I find this statement baffling, as the basic   symptoms of ADHD (listed below), in my opinion, seem to be in direct   contrast to those of OCD:      Inattention: Having a short attention span and easily distracted.   (Most people with OCD would love to be able to not pay attention to   their thoughts.)      Impulsivity: Causes a person to do dangerous or   unwise things without thinking about the consequences. (Those with OCD   do the exact opposite. They play it safe and obsess about the   consequences.)      Hyperactivity: Inappropriate or excessive activity.   (Those with OCD often go out of their way to do what they feel is   appropriate. Also, in Dan’s case, he often had very low energy as he   was “wiped out” from struggling with his OCD.)   However I read here that:     Some research has suggested that OCD and Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum   Disorders fall upon a compulsive-impulsive continuum. In other words   there exists a gradient of disorders ranging from behavioral   impulsivity to compulsivity. OCD appears to lie at one end of this   spectrum, while ADHD exists at the other.   That reminds of this picture (taken from here):    Does this then mean that ADHD and OCD together is like mania and depression together? Is there a term for the former just like the latter has bipolar disorder?    There's someone in 1 who says  ""ADHD makes my mind wander but then my OCD latches onto things I get so focused that nothing else exists.""  and someone else who says  ""The OCD part of is killing me on the inside on how messy my room is. I hate messy rooms."",  but there seem to be contesting comments such as  ""Actual clinical OCD is so very far from the perfectionism you're describing.""  and  ""You are confusing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder...I don't know if OCPD and be comorbid with ADHD, but I agree that intuitively they don't seem compatible. OCD on the other hand is sometimes misdiagnosed as ADHD (and vice versa) as they both involve problems with impulse control.""  There's another comment which might explain how ADHD and OCD are not opposites, but I'm not quite sure I understand (assuming it is right):     they aren't opposites. OCD is when you have strong anxious compulsions   that you can't resist. ADHD is when you are unable to resist even weak   impulses. They harm the patient in a devilishly sinergistic manner -   let's take someone who already has difficulty resisting impulses, and   give her compulsions to do useless things!   Is it right? What exactly does that mean? "
2774,Are ADHD and OCD under some type of mental illness?,"Related to question.  Mania, hypomania, depression and bipolar are mood disorders, from what I understand.  Are ADHD and OCD under some category as well? From what I understand, the are opposite ends of some impulsive-compulsive spectrum?  OCD is an anxiety disorder (same link as earlier), from what I understand, but what about ADHD? Is there another description of OCD that also applies to ADHD? "
2775,Are emotions needed to make decisions?,"Oprah.com says:     It turns out, though, that for most people there is no such thing as a purely rational self. Decision making is intrinsically linked to our emotions, so much so that when a person suffers damage to her orbitofrontal cortex—a part of the brain just behind the eyes that's strongly involved in processing emotions—she can lose her decision-making ability entirely. (We're talking any decision, like which day to schedule a doctor's appointment or whether to use a blue or black pen.) ""If it weren't for our emotions,"" says science writer Jonah Lehrer, author of How We Decide, ""reason wouldn't exist at all.""   Is this really so? Lab experiments on humans on this would certainly be unethical, so I suspect Lehrer might be talking about some nature-did-the-experiment-for-us case (Phineas Gage style). Is anyone familiar with the details, e.g. from Lehrer's book or elsewhere? "
2776,Why do brains prefer internal consistency?,"I need to preface this by saying I know next to nothing about this topic, so if the question is built on wrong premises, feel free to address that in an answer.  From and related to: What is the psychological term for disregarding correct but unwanted information?     (...) people strive for internal consistency even at the expense of truth.   My question is why?  Are there mechanisms on the neuron-level that resist the rewiring of the brain? By rewiring I mean avoiding a certain cost to changes in the thought-process or to the acquiring of new information.  And from an evolutionary perspective, how helpful is the 'internal consistency' if thought of as a built-in protection of sorts? "
2777,What does 'Taxonimize' mean here?,"I was reading a news article about increasing IQ and one psychologist wrote     Many of the changes in IQ are correlated to changes in schooling.

2780,Is there any negative social or psychological implication of the current “slime” preoccupation of teenagers (mostly girls)?,"This may not be the right place for this question.  If you think it belongs on another forum, please point me there.  My daughter has been into the “slime” craze for the past two years or so (she is now 14).  She makes several batches of slime a month.  She loves to play with slime.  She loves to watch YouTube videos of people playing with slime.  She sends pictures of her slime to her friends.  She wants me to touch her slime (I don’t like to because it is cold and slimy, ha, and it sticks to me, because she says I don’t know how to handle it).  I just started to wonder, the other day, why so many people, mostly young teen girls, are so infatuated with slime.  Is there some weird, psychological implication here?  Sexual, maybe?  Am I not touching her enough?  Or is it nothing? "
2781,Does female attractiveness correlate with age progression?,"I'm interested in Evolutionary Psychology and the male perception of female beauty. One of the ideas I'm trying to investigate is the correlation between female fertility and her attractiveness. A figure I heard several times is that at around age 25 females are the most fertile and thus most attractive.   I'm trying to verify this experimentally. It seems to me like a simple experiment would be to present an observer with a lineup of photos of the same woman at different ages. Everyone has photos at different ages, but I'm looking for the one where the posture and facial expressions are controlled, as to reduce variation due to factors other than age.   My question is - Are there posture controlled lineups of the photos of age progression from 15 to 50 that I can use for such experiment?  This image is from a video of a woman aging, but it has no age indication. I'm looking for something with shorter age gaps (15-16-17-18-...50). It seems one of the relevant search terms is ""age progression"" are there others?  "

2784,"What does it mean for someone to ""join narratives to explain their experiences""?","Describing the Blue Whale Challenge, an online phenomenon where participants perform tasks with the final task being suicide, we have the following:     Dr Achal Bhagat, a psychiatrist in Delhi, told the BBC he had not encountered a single Blue Whale case, although he speaks to young people every day.       ""People join narratives to explain their experiences,"" said Dr Bhagat, adding that is possibly why some children have said they participated in the rumoured challenge despite there being no proof of its existence.   Aparna Alluri, Why is 'Blue Whale' hysteria gripping India?, BBC News, Delhi, 2017   I don't understand what ""people join narratives to explain their experiences"" means, and how its relevant to the context.  It seems to imply that people are making up they've participated in a Blue Whale Challenge (i.e., they join the narrative) because of some (unstated) events in their lives.  The quote also indicates it holds more generally, i.e., it's not only true for the Blue Whale Challenge.  Question: What does it mean for someone to ""join narratives to explain their experiences""?

2785,Are cognitive functions strictly divided in the left and right hemispheres?,"  I often see this kind of picture, claiming the strict lateralization of brain functions. Is this valid?

Lastly, I thought that analytical skills reside mostly in the prefrontal cortex, irrespective whether it's left or right. "

2787,Negative correlation between AQ score and EFT score,"   E-S theory explains the social and communication issues seen in autism and Asperger syndrome in connection, on the one hand, to delays and deficits in empathizing . The strengths in assimilating narrow areas of interest, on the other hand, involve an intact or even superior skill in systemizing (Baron-Cohen, 2002 , 2008 , 2009 ; Lawson, Baron-Cohen, &amp; Wheelwright, 2004 ).    Pathological Altruism (Page 346). Oxford University Press.   Therefore, people with high AQ (Autism Spectrum Quotient) should perform well in EFT (Embedded Figures Test) test 1.  Yet, a study (Valla et al., 2010) has revealed that, the intercorrelation coefficient between AQ and EFT is negative (-0.192 for women, -0.093 for men). Same goes for the relation between RMET and EFT (-0.011 for women, -0.167 for men). Further meta-analysis found similarly incoherent results (Jolliffe &amp; Baron‐Cohen, 1997).  I have seen educators making the assumption that people with high social intelligence are not supposed to be good at spatial tasks. Even Simon Baron-Cohen indicates that figuring out embedded patterns is a systemizing skill.     Empathizers are more interested in people — what they feel and why they think what they think. Systemizers are people who like to figure out the rules embedded in systems such as car engines, train time-tables, dance routines, or stamp collections.    Pathological Altruism (Page 347). Oxford University Press.   Do we treat Valla's experiment as an anomaly or a proof that social skills (or lack of it thereof) do not necessarily dictate systemizing or spatial abilities?   Valla, J.

2789,Do major historic events have a lasting impact on humankind's objective happiness?,"In his book ""Sapiens - a Brief History of Humankind"", Harari argues that the biochemistry of ""happiness"" in any person can only move within bounds, dictated by genetics.  He also argues that happiness only improves momentarily when objective circumstances improve, and only e.g. a degenerative disease or permanent physical pain can result in lasting change. This seems to be widely accepted and is backed by numerous studies.  I could not, however, find any studies supporting his statement that events such as the agricultural revolution had no lasting impact on humankind's objective happiness.  Are there any scientific studies on the biochemistry of happiness of generations that lived before and after major historic events like the cure of a disease that affected large parts of the studied community?  Whats psychology's take on human happiness throughout history?  Please suggest edits, as I am no expert on any of this. "
2790,Is there an explanation for concepts or situations that are repeated within a short amount of time?,"I know that the title is not really clear. That's because I don't know what i'm searching for, unfortunately. Let me explain with an example: Yesterday i was watching a youtube video , more precisely a lecture from MIT. Looking through the comments i found out that the professor from that lecture studied computer science at the University of Waterloo. I have never heard about the University of Waterloo before (until yesterday).  Today, while checking my emails i was surprised to see that i got a suggestion to read an answer to a question : ""How valuable is the University of Waterloo's computer science program? "" I know that with computers may not be so mysterious since they know what content we see on the internet and may use it for making suggestions. The thing is that these kind of situations occur really often even without technological ""help"".  For example: Some time ago my sister told me about neutron stars. It was fascinating. The next day, during a lecture, my physics professor used neutron stars as an example for a problem.  I had never heard about neutron stars before my sister told me about them and i was shocked to hear my professor that day. I haven't heard about those stars since then.  Or even everyday things: there is a song you didn't listen to for a very long time. Let's say a year. One day you think about that song. Some hours later you hear it playing randomly in a tv show you are watching.  My question is : do these situations have a name ?  It happens so often that i already gave it a name but i would like to know if there is some official version  Do they have an explanation from a psychological point of view or they are just fortunate coincidences?

Is there an equilibrium at which a subject may start to believe what is being said, or that X number of reports strongly indicates a probability an event took place.  "
2792,How is the g-factor of intelligence calculated?,"I am currently reading Dr. Richard Haier's book The Neuroscience of Intelligence and I am a little confused about the g-factor. Note that I have no education in psychology outside of general ed courses at university.  I have two questions regarding the g-factor.  What confuses me is for one, he does not go into technical detail about how the g-factor is calculated.  He does include this illustration:    Here we see that 15 mental tests are taken in groups of 3, where each group is correlated to a certain factor. So tests 1-3 are for reasoning, 4-6 for spatial ability, and so on.  These factors then correlate to the g-factor.  I am wondering what is the methodology used to find the correlations between the tests and factors/factors and the g-factor? For example, I don't quite understand how they measure the correlation between the test and the factor given that the factor is abstract (ie. reasoning). I hope what I am asking makes sense. I am not asking how to perform linear regression or calculate Pearson's r.   My second question is about the statement in the book:   ""Different mental abilities are not independent. They are all related to each other and the correlations among mental tests are always positive.... It strongly implies that all the factors derived from individual tests have something in common, and this common factor is called the general factor of intelligence.""  Wouldn't this imply that all of the factors are multicollinear and make it difficult to distinguish which factors are most significant?  "
2793,Timing mental arithmetic training for specific event,"A test will take place in two months time. It will take place on 12:00 PM, and the test takes one hour. One has to perform tasks such as a basic IQ test, mental arithmetic and solving a sudoku. These types of tasks are known in advance.  Someone wants to train for this event by performing the tasks on a regular basis. What would be a good training schedule? Would it be best to train every day for an hour at exactly 12:00 PM, to condition the brain, or would it be better to train at random times to improve the brain's flexibility? Also, would it be better to take days off to have the brain rest, like you would do when training your body? "
2794,Post alcoholic depression and mental health,"We all might have experienced a post-alcoholic hangover after heavy drinking.

Specifically, I'm wondering whether occasional binge-drinking can lead to a permanent depressive state in the brain? "
2795,"William James ""Principles of Psychology"" and Brain Plasticity","I am reading William James' ""Principles of Psychology"".  It is clear in his research that he was acutely aware of brain plasticity and the limited capacity for a precise ""schema"" (ie. static brain map) to represent brain function.  Seeing that this text is well over 100 years old and cites much research even older, how is it that I see so much information (primarily in the press and lay neurology texts) that brain plasticity is a new perspective recently discovered by academics and researchers?  Without question the earliest modern neuroscientists knew about brain plasticity.  It was an undeniable characteristic of their research.  (As a side note, it is interesting that creatures with less intelligence have greater plasticity, with the level of intelligence being inversely proportional to plasticity.  A fact I've never seen discussed.)  I feel I should mention that I am not a psychologist or neuro-scientist.  I have a doctorate in Statistics. I did search academic papers and there are many papers that credit William James with describing plasticity under the heading ""habit"".  So to my original question, why is it that plasticity is just being ""discovered?""

2796,What does this writer mean?,"I hope I am asking this question in the right place. In her reading of Duras's Hiroshima mon amour, Julia Kristeva, the analyst and philosopher, refers to Duras as a melancholic. Anne Juranville, also an analyst and a professor of literature, however, believes, in Kelly Oliver's words, that ""     Duras is too depressed to be melancholic Oliver, 2001, 152   Can anyone explain what she means by this? Isn't the melancholic, in the last analysis, the same as the depressed?   What does she mean by saying that     the melancholic “subject,” and in particular the feminine one,   maintains an immediate, traumatic relation to the real qua maternal   Thing. Ibid   Here's part of the paragraph cited from Kelly Oliver's Psychoanalysis, Aesthetics, and Politics in the Work of Kristeva (2009):     Anne Juranville, also an analyst and professor of literature,   disagrees with Kristeva’s clinical diagnosis, arguing that Duras is   too depressed to be melancholic, but does agree that the melancholic   “subject,” and in particular the feminine one, maintains an   immediate, traumatic relation to the real qua maternal Thing. This   nostalgic denial of individuation, as for Kristeva, positions the   melancholic beyond the pale of symbolic intervention, unable to access   in any way the historical reality of the social: “Stupefied,   horrified, [the melancholic] fixes himself in an inhuman zone beyond   death where, lacking the least symbolic recourse, he is condemned to   remain eternally and passively concentrated on this gaping wound that   he himself is” (1993, 54). ibid  "
2797,Modelling the Human Brain as a directed graph,"A mathematician on the MathOverflow, Hans-Peter Stricker, recently(2016) considered the possibility that human brains may be modelled as directed graphs with neurons as nodes and synapses as edges. I think this makes sense as neurons are mostly unidirectional.   Now, what I am curious about is whether there are ever errors in the developmental process such that there are 'collisions' between two neurons. I can imagine this occurring in two ways:   Is it possible for dendrites to connect to other dendrites?    Alternatively, can axon terminals connect to other axon terminals?   If so, are there publications that estimate the natural frequency of such errors in a human brain?   References:   Edward T. Bullmore and Danielle S. Bassett.

2799,what is the difference between mindfulness meditations and focusing on other things?,"For example: While I'm studying(or doing anything in my life), my brain wanders around(daydreams, stresses, remembers unpleasant memories and thinks negatively about the future) so I notice that and then bring it back to focus again in studying. Isn't that the same thing as mindfulness meditation? in both things, we focus on or attend to something and when the brain wanders around, we bring it back. I read articles before 1 2  that say the difference is that in mindfulness, you let things(that you attended to) go after you finish without thinking about it again. Does that mean that I can call studying a mindfulness meditation if I stopped thinking about it after finishing? "
2800,Is Carl Jung synchronicity scientific theory?,Do you know about synchronicity theory (Carl Jung) and what scientific work has been done and is it proven? (what common references)  Is it possible that it could be related to the collective subconscious if it is real? (Scientific  common references)  Thanks. 
2801,How to determine which scale to use: Nominal vs Interval?,"I am currently working on immersion and how it can be quantified. One of the problems I have run into is how to determine which scale to use?  I have performed a literature review but have not obtained any insight. Since I do not know if immersion is a binary or graded experience, how should I decide on which scale to use?   Can I use an interval scale and then obtain nominal values from that? If yes, which methods are available?   I highly appreciate your help! "
2802,"If people recall a specific word earlier among 10 words in free recall, what does it mean?","Lets assume a case of free recall tests that 10 words are presented at the same time"" and subjects are asked to recall them later. The words are presented in two different conditions (A and B).   If subjects recall a specific word earlier in A condition than B condition, what does it mean?   Can we say something with recall order?  "
2803,Recovery of memory especially working memory after depression,The impact of depression on memory and working memory has been discussed extensively in the thread below.  I can't seem to find information about rehabilitation and recovery of memory after depression.  Has there been any studies looking at memory improvement after depression?   What effect can depression have on memory? 
2804,Does selfishness increase in periods of extreme anxiety,"Does an individual going through a period of extreme anxiety, show increased levels of selfishness during that period ?   When this period ends, does the individual returns back to normal levels of selfishness ?  The following extract is from this  article, which describes the personal experience of a person with anxiety/depression.     When we’re anxious, we become lost in our own thoughts, waging a   battle so distracting in its intensity that it makes it nearly   impossible to notice the outside world. It’s not that we don’t care,   but rather that we’re so distracted by our discomfort that it is only   with great effort that we’re able to look out and truly see others.   This somehow verifies my intuition, that extreme anxiety increases selfshiness. There is so much anxiety related activity in the head, that other aspects like other people, are neglected.  This is just a personal report though, I need more solid research data. "
2805,"The same neuron sometimes released different neurotransmitters, so how does this affect our interpretation of computational models?","Most studies I see compare firing rate with some observed variable (stimuli or behavior). However, they treat all spikes the same. But neurons sometimes release different neurotransmitters depending on the situation, meaning not all spikes are the same. Does this affect our interpretation of these studies? Are there models that account for this? Do spikes vary in any other way?   For example, knowing when a neuron is acting as excitatory versus inhibitory may vastly change our interpretation of it's role.   Additionally this may become even more of an issue when we attempt to model or predict from multiple channels as we are potentially missing out on a crucial piece of information. Without that, do we even have the ability to fully understand the area?  On a slightly different note: Are there other aspects of a neuron output that are important in it's computational role in the circuit? Why don't we take into account it's amplitude over-time for example?  My primary worry is that we are averaging away, or outright throwing away, a lot of information that which could be insightful.  "
2806,"What happens neurobiologically when people ""think fast""?","This question is related to this one: How long can a person stay happy, excited and motivated about something new?  I found a couple of references to research that links ""thinking fast"" to mood lift: Speed of thinking and mood lift From what I've read so far on how the body/brain works, there are several examples of ""negative feedback"" to maintain homeostasis. This is the first example of something that can be considered ""positive feedback"", and it intrigues me.    I'm wondering what are the parts of a brain or neurotransmitters that are involved in ""thinking fast""?   -EDIT-  To clarify the question - by thinking fast I mean engaging in a train of thought that is self-reinforcing, self sustained and directed. For example, thinking of a project at work, then of all the people who you can involve, then of all the improvements that can be made, of the outcome that can take place, of success, what you can do next, etc.   This kind of thinking pattern introduces numerous related targets for attention, and attention can quickly switch between trains of thought. At the same time, the majority of attention is occupied by a single idea or project that has multiple branching trains of thought associated with it. In poetic terms, the brain is weaving a pattern or a web of thought.  This creates a state where the brain cannot process the entire idea/project/concept at the same time, forcing it to ""think faster"", and do more switching between related branched trains of thought. "
2807,Is happiness a result of cognitive or a side effect of neurobiological processes?,"This morning I've heard this talk on Ted.com:  Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment  The presenter is discussing an iPhone app used to track happiness, and seems to draw a conclusion that ""mind wandering"" is a related to much unhappiness, and that mind wandering is pervasive in 47% of his respondents. He also suggests that ""being in the present"" is tied to feeling happier.  His methods and graphs aside, I'm interested in this question:  Is ""mind wandering"" a thought pattern that arises naturally as a cognitive process, regardless of the brain biology? Or is it a biological marker, indicating the change of state of the persons biological homeostatic state? By Biological homeostatic state I mean neurotransmitter levels/binding, endocrine system state, etc.  For example, if a person is intoxicated with alcohol, then the person cannot help, but feel different, because of the foreign substance. I'm interested if there's any research indicating if different mental states, for example mind wandering, are caused by something that changes within the brain?   Because mind wandering is a rather vague subject, here's another thought process that has a very definitive effect on happiness: suicidal ideation. If a person is thinking of suicide, there's at least a chance that the person will follow through with the ideation, and from the quotes below, it seems that at least some victims were studied  (Serotonin receptors on wikipedia):     Deceased suicidal and otherwise depressed patients have had more   5-HT2A receptors than normal patients. These findings suggest that   post-synaptic 5-HT2A overdensity is involved in the pathogenesis of   depression.[4]   And another one:      Many human polymorphisms have been identified influencing the   expression of 5-HT2C. Significant correlations are suggested,   specifically in relation to psychiatric disorders such as depression,   OCD, and anxiety-related conditions. Polymorphisms also correlate with   susceptibility to a number of conditions including drug abuse and   obesity.   Reading this, it seems plausible that suicidal ideation, as a thought process, is at least partially related to the Serotonin(5HT) receptors 2A and 2C. As such, is it plausible to say that suicidal ideation is a biological marker of depression, just as mind wandering may be a biological marker of unhappiness?  Thank you for your input! "
2808,What is the difference between confidence and overconfidence?,People say there is a very small difference between confidence and overconfidence.    How can knowledge of psychology help someone know whether they are are confident or overconfident?  What is the state of mind when someone is overconfident?     
2809,"Does introducing an element of play, hunt, or competition make feeding more rewarding?","I have limited experience feeding wildlife, and while it's fun to watch and I'm sure fun for the wildlife too, I'm interested in just how much fun.  Is there's any noticeable difference in the following scenarios?   Scenario A: a bird is given a ""pile"" of food, and can eat it at any pace. Scenario B: an element of play or competition is introduced. The bird has to seek out seeds that are scattered on the ground, or has to compete with other birds. Alternatively, a challenging bird feeder is used.   The end result is that there's enough food to satiate the bird in either case. It seems that in scenario B, it would take longer for the bird to get full. In scenario B, the bird has to hop from one cluster of seeds to the next, picking out the ones that the bird wants. There may be additional birds, also competing for the tastiest seeds. Alternatively, the bird has to balance on the birdfeeder, and coordinate precise movements to retrieve a seed from the feeder.  If the bird is observed over the next X minutes or hours following the feeding, is there any noticeable difference in the overall demeanor, activity pattern, etc., between the two scenarios?  UPDATE: I originally thought that this question does not apply to humans - we all sit at a table and eat meals from dishes, etc. I couldn't ask a question about kids throwing pie, which is what I thought of when I think ""play with food"". But this evening, as I was deseeding a pomegranate, I realized that humans may like ""Playing"" with difficult fruit too    Pomegranate Citrus (oranges/grapefruit) Pineapple     Getting to the best parts of these fruit can be turned into a game too. For example, deseeding pomegranate can be done with the minimum amount of juice splashing, while an orange peel can be removed in many ways as well.  The scenarios above can be modified to be easily applicable to humans too:   Scenario A: Given unlimited supply of whole pomegranates to deseed Scenario B: Given an unlimited supply of pomegranate seeds on a plate   Which person will leave the table feeling better?   To get a sense of how people may play with the fruits above, search google for ""Peel an orange"", and you will find very varying screenshots.    "
2810,How does the mind build a model of reality?,"I'm interested if there has been any research or experiments that deal with how the human mind creates and perpetuates the idea of knowing something.  I'm struggling to concisely express the question, so a roundabout explanation is in order. I'm thinking of the succession of frameworks that explained how the world works to a layman:   ancient pagan religions, which explained the reality in terms of the complicated interaction of spirits and forces of nature. Then came monotheistic religions which once again have attempted to explain the world.  Somewhere in between there have been many forms of philosophy Then came a myriad of scientific models which are erected in all domains of science:from biology to psychology, etc.   Each one of these frameworks attempts to explain the world. Each one has been at the cutting edge of thought at the time.  Yet it seems to me that even the most accomplished physicist(the pinnacle of modern knowledge?) may still live with a patchwork of a world model, because said physicist may not be as well versed in neurobiology or some other ""arcane"" domain of science.  It seems to me that in this chain of succession, because knowledge is preserved, most of the successive models incorporate at least bits and pieces of the previous models. Do individuals build their own models of reality from whatever knowledge is available to their minds?     In the example above (from Nous on wikipedia), the model is neatly created from the understanding that was available to the medieval mind. I'm interested if this kind of tendency to ""fill in the holes"" and present a finite understanding of a infinitely(?) complex reality as complete is a natural part of how the human mind works.  For example, would the contemporary physicist's model of reality be primarily shaped by the knowledge of physics, with other knowledge ""filling in the holes""?  I know that there are such things as cognitive biases and follies of thought, are these the mechanisms by which the model of the world is shaped?  Thank you for your feedback! This question is rather broad, and I would appreciate if you suggest keywords or names of articles that I can investigate further.  "
2811,How does language change the understanding of a complex concept?,"For example, does breaking down a complex concept, initially described with scientific and uncommon terms, into less complex language degrade the understanding of the concept or can it maintain all it's relations and objects? How does using simple language change the understanding or perception of a complex concept?   Another way to look at the question is can certain thoughts exist without specific words to wrap them in, or are some thoughts dependent on the vocabulary/language?   If so, does this imply that new words can lead to new concepts that have never been produced and shared by others? For example, in George Orwell's novel ""1984"" the government introduces a new language called ""Newspeak"" that must be spoken by all citizens. This new language does not have any words for the concept of freedom, liberty, etc - so that these ideas would be very difficult to expand into reliaty (keeping the government in control of course).  The complete Wikipedia article on language and specifically ""Semantics"" has a lot of insight but did not lead to any answers.  Thank You. "
2812,How does appreciation for music change over time for the same person?,"I know that there's a concept of acquired taste, where a child may find certain tastes, like peppers and beer unappealing until certain age or frequency of exposure.   Is there something similar to acquired taste in music?  How does perception of the ""beauty"" of the same musical track vary for the same individual over a lifetime?   There has been an episode of the popular TV show ""South Park"" that deals with taste in music, although in a satirical way.  "
2813,Is a safe driving record correlated with any psychometric test scores?,"A few years ago I was interviewing for a position with a subdivision of a large company in New York City. One of the things that hit me as odd about this interview was that the recruiter was interested in my driving record and wanted to know if I have any traffic violations.  Is there any connection between a safe driving record and personality traits or other psychometric test scores? Can anything about a person's personality (e.g., agreeableness, neuroticism, or ""lawfulness"") be understood by looking at the person's driving record?  In this context, ""safe driving record"" only refers to the absence of recorded infringements. For example, a person who engages in unsafe driving but for whatever reason does not get caught, would still have a ""safe driving record"". "
2814,Why a person may have a temptation to do something unrelated when doing especially important thing?,"I would like to know, why a person may have a temptation to do something unrelated (or slightly related to his current task) when doing particularly important job?   Like, when preparing for an important math test under a time pressure, to spend time on consulting grammar book on why some sentence were constructed in that particular way and what are the rules for constructing the sentences of this kind, then finding some question while studying this and switch to stydying the new question and so on. As a result spending much more time on ""unrelated"" things rather than on the important one?  What mechanisms lie behind this behaviour? Is there a scientific description of this phenomenon?  I'll rephrase the initial question: Why a person may have a strong subconscious temptation to distract oneself from doing very important job? "
2815,How can pain sensations appear to originate within the person's skull?,"I've read that humans have some sort of a kinesthetic model of their body and muscles. This internal representation of the body is used to control and coordinate locomotion. I don't remember if feeling of pain is related to the same model.  I've checked the articles below in hopes of recalling what the correct term for the kinestetic model was, but was unable to find it. Sensory Homunculus concept seems close, but doesn't ring the bell.  Can someone suggest what the correct term for the internal representation used to coordinate motion is?  Phantom Pain  Phantom Limb  I'm interested in learning how people can feel various sensations that appear to originate within their skulls? For example, sometimes I feel headache and can say that it is in the left side, or I feel something in the back of the head. From what I understand, the brain does not have pain receptors, and there are no voluntary muscles to contract within the brain. This makes it hard for me to imagine how such positioning system can develop or what its purpose is.  With this in mind, I'm puzzled by how the location of a sensation can be determined within the skull.    Is this an extension of the kinestetic model of the body Or is it a side effect of other pain (ex: teeth, thyroid) being mis-mapped or just a side effect of a headache(ex: hallucination/synestesia)?  "
2816,A psychological theory that explains why people remember only the outcome?,"I've read somewhere about a psychological theory that people often remember the end results or the outcome of a certain situation/discussion/conversation/etc, but not the details of it.  In other words, the theory postulates that people often forget about things like who invented the solution, or how this happened, or who should be doing this task. Rather, people tend to just remember what the solution was, what happened, and what task had to be done.  I don't remember exactly in what context I read about this theory. It could have been part of some other theory.  Does such a theory exist? If so, what is the name of that theory? "
2817,Does the person's walking say anything about the person's cognition?,"This afternoon I've been observing people at a local park and came up with some observations that lead me to this question:  Can the person's gait (manner of walking) say something about the person's internal experience at that moment? I'm thinking of arousal and cognition.  For example: Have you ever seen a businessman or an office worker walk? They walk with a purpose, quite energetically with the body slightly inclined forward. Is it feasible to say that when such walk is observed, the person is going somewhere, and may be tense?  A child may be running around with arms in the air, along an irregular path. Can it be said that such child is energetic and excited at that moment?  Two elderly people may walk very differently. One couple walks at a regular pace of 3-4mph, while another couple may push one foot in front of the other at 0.5 mph. Can this tell us anything about the differences in the mental activity that takes place within these people?  A person may be strolling slowly at &lt;1mph, observing the environment. Can it be said that such person is calm?  It appears to me that in the examples above, the person's mood/demeanor and  motion are connected.   I'm interested if there's really any correlation between how a person appears outwardly and how the person feels? In other words, if one is tense and feels pressed for time, would one start to ""walk with a purpose"", as opposed to strolling casually?  Thank you for your input. "
2818,Brain structures related to risk-taking behavior,"I did a preliminary research on brain structures in which activity might underlie risk-taking behavior. I came to two research that described right prefrontal cortex (Knoch et al., 2006), or orbitofrontal cortex in relation to accumbens (Galvan et al., 2006) as the structures that might be involved. What are other brain structures that might be related to this kind of behavior ? And is there any integrated theories about the structures involved ?  References  Galvan, A., Hare, T. A., Parra, C. E., Penn, J., Voss, H., Glover, G., &amp; Casey, B. J. (2006). Earlier development of the accumbens relative to orbitofrontal cortex might underlie risk-taking behavior in adolescents.

2819,Food sharing and mutual aid among the homeless,"Since the time of Peter Kropotkin, it's been observed and theorized that cooperation and mutual aid are more common in austere environments. A classic biological example would be slime mold spore-making (Starssman &amp; Queller, 2011), and anecdotal example would be people coming together to face a natural disaster. I am interested in more systematic studies of this in modern human society under more extended time-frames than reactions to disaster.  In monkeys, apes, and primitive human societies, a typical measure of cooperation and mutual aid is food sharing (Jaeggi &amp; Gurven, 2013). I am interested in seeing studies like this that use naturalistic measures like this, instead of artificial games like dictator or ultimatum (even though these do provide interesting economic and anthropological results at times; Henrich et al., 2001).  One of the few truly austere environments remaining in Western society is the plight of the homeless. For example, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (1999) has found that 28% of homeless people nationwide sometimes or often do not get enough to eat (compared with 12% for the poor), 20% eat one meal a day or less, and 40% reported that they went one or more days in the last 30 days without anything to eat (compared to 3% for the poor).   Yet, consistent with the Kropotkin's views, anecdotal evidence (i.e. what I hear from friends that have been run aways, and from the occasional homeless that I have a chance to talk to) suggests that food sharing is common among the homeless. As a highlight, here is an anecdote I encountered recently of reddit (empasis added by me):     This is why I, as a homeless person, gets offered more food from other homeless people than from wealthier people I come in contact with. This holds even though there is no pity parties among the homeless, and many food sharers will stab your back in a heartbeat if they perceive longer term gains. Or, in some cases, when more primal needs are at stake.   This brings me to my questions:    How common is food sharing among the homeless? Is it primarily driven by empathy/egalitarianism, reciprocity, tolerated theft, or other mechanisms? How does it compare to rates of food sharing in modern hunter-gatherer societies?    I am more interested in anthropological studies done in western populations and developed countries, especially big urban centers, but comparisons to homeless populations in developing countries is of interest as well. I also prefer academic studies instead of governmental/activist ones, since the latter tend to have a policy bias; but I'll take what I can get!  References  Jaeggi, A. V., &amp; Gurven, M. (2013).

2820,Can a person's susceptibility to hypnosis be altered?,"It is commonly quoted in popular literature that 10% of people are ""highly hypnotizable"". Given a set of 10 suggestions, such people would have 7 or more suggestions become active. On the other end of the spectrum, there are people who are very hard to hypnotize and will have 0 out of 10 suggestions become active. Everyone else falls somewhere in between.  I'm interested if the person's susceptibility to hypnosis can be altered? Can a person who would previously respond to 7/10 suggestions be made to respond to 1/10, thus becoming hard to hypnotize (or vice versa)?  If so, what is the mechanism behind such change - is it localized to some brain area?  "
2821,How fast is the visual system?,"I've heard that the visual system is one of our slowest sensory systems.  How fast is the visual system, and how does it compare to other sensory systems (auditory, mechanosensory, pain, etc.)? For example, how long does it typically take for a visual stimulus from the external world to cause a neuron to fire in the V1 region of the cortex? "
2822,"What theory discusses modes of ""Being"" vs. that of ""Happening""?","Is there a theory (Perhaps Freudian) concerning that of ""Being"" and that of ""Happening""? I vaguely recall learning about it many years ago in H.S. Psych, but of course any search for either of these keywords results in non-relevant returns as both being and happening are common words.  The question is, if there is a theory concerning these concepts - what is the gist? But as importantly, what are keywords that I could use to find useful results? "
2823,Which is more likely to cause a person to devalue some other person?,Scenario: Mary and John are in a relationship. Elen is Mary's best friend.  What will make Mary devalue Elen more? Hearing that Elen likes John (romantically) or hearing that John likes Elen?  Let's assume that Mary and John have been dating for a few months. Mary is a dependent person with low self-esteem who would go to great lengths not to lose her boyfriend. All three of them are around 20 years old. 
2824,Where does instinctual knowledge come from?,"From Wikipedia:     Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living   organism towards a particular complex behavior.   The example that I find is the easiest to touch upon is the spider and how it knows how to spin it's web. What are the current theories about the origin of this knowledge without learning in the traditional sense? I understand that all knowledge is encoded somehow within neurons in the brain, but where does this encoding come from? "
2825,Can someone move into cognitive science from a linguistic or philosophical background?,"Unfortunately the school I'm starting at this coming fall doesn't offer a cognitive science degree (note: I've just read that they do have a cognitive science lab in the psychology department), but seeing as cognitive science is a multidisciplinary field, I was wondering whether or not it would be unwise to focus on one particular sub-field (say, philosophy or computer science) and try to work my way into cognitive science from there.  The problem is that I have a very strong background in computer science, and I'm up in the air about whether I want to study philosophy or linguistics.  Based on my understanding, all of these fall under the umbrella of cognitive science, am I correct?  Is it unheard of for someone to move into cognitive science from a linguistic or philosophical background?  What do you suggest I do? "
2826,Is there a limit to how many skills a person can master?,"Given that the different parts of our brain are constantly competing for brain real estate and learning requires brain real estate, is it the case that we can only master x amount of skills due to the limit of our brain size? If we train hard enough at something is it possible that that skill can remain with us forever? If so, how much training is required before a skill can become a permanent feature in our brain? "
2827,How to design an experiment to measure coffee preferences?,"Imagine a population of people in an office environment.  There is a small war going on about whether this brand of coffee machine is better than that one.  How would you go about testing which coffee maker is truly most preferred?  My current plan is to take 10 people out of that population and make them each drink two cups of coffee, one made by each machine.  People will be given the choice of preparation styles for their individual trial, black, milk, sugar, or both.  Both cups will be made in the exact same way for that individual trial.  Whether a given cup will have coffee from machine ""A"" or ""B"" will be randomized to avoid people's preference for their first taste being taken into account.  Neither the participants, nor the administrator of the test will know which cup was made with which machine, to avoid unconscious biases.  Lastly, each participant will be independent of each other to avoid a bias forming from everyone else choosing a particular cup.  (Though the randomized nature of the study should make this a moot issue, but still.)  Is there anything I'm forgetting to make this a more perfect study?  I would love to have a larger sample than 10, but alas, that's not an option.  Also, I'm worried that allowing people to choose how their coffee will be prepared will skew the results, but as long as both cups within a trial are made the same way, it shouldn't be a problem, right? "
2828,How does excess of dopamine affect one's mental health?,"If a person takes dopamine increasing medication for some illness, what effect will it have on his/her mental health considering that medication doesn't target just one area of the brain ?  In Parkinson's disease, dopamine is lacking in the brain area responsible for motor functions i.e. muscle movement hence creating  spasms in muscles.  Dopamine medication corrects this but it doesn't target just that area of the brain.   I'm curious what happens with all the dopamine roaming in other parts of the brain, and how it affects mental health?   EDIT: I've made some changes, I hope it's more understandable now.  "
2829,What analogy can a teacher use to teach a child about neuroplasticity?,"What analogy can a teacher use to teach a child about neuroplasticity? It'd be easier to explain this to an adult, but a child probably doesn't know enough to understand neuroplasticity. Do you know or have you heard of an analogy that explains neuroplasticity? "
2830,Psychology test stimuli recommended shapes,"Is there any list of or a research of recommended 2D (or eventually 3D) shapes that should be used in psychology test stimuli? For example, circle, square, triangle, star, oval, rectangle etc.  For example, I would like to create a cognitive test with multiple elements. I will pick a circle, a square, a triangle and an oval. However, an oval has some properties similar to the circle and that can possibly lead to some distortion in the data. Do you know of any research that has addressed this issue? Or do you know of any list of recommended shapes? "
2831,"Alternatives to ""Honest Signals"" theory of non-semantic communication","Intro  In ""Honest Signals: How They Shape Our World"" and the related publications ""Understanding 'Honest Signals' in Business"" and ""Social Dynamics: Signals and Behavior"", Alex Petland puts forth the idea that non-semantic communication (communication we do without explicitly representing thoughts using words/drawings, such as our gestures or aspects of our voice) falls into the following four types.  Types of Non-Semantic Communication  1. Consistency/Variance/Stress/Emphasis  Jerky, uneven motions indicate many different thoughts indicating openness to influence. Consistent emphasis and timing indicates mental focus.  2. Mimicry/Mirroring/Imitation  How much the social patterns of each participant match. Correlates with trust. Verbally this is measured by sub-second utterances (""Uh-huh"") and exchanges built on these utterances (""OK?"", ""OK!"", ""Done?"", ""Yup."").  3. Engagement/Influence  The amount one forces or cedes their social patterns to another. Could also be considered as who's driving the conversation.  4. Activity level  Describes how much energy in general is being expended in the interaction. Verbally, this can be considered by the ratio of silence to exclamations.  He then applies these four concepts to analyse various scenarios (speed dating, negotiation) and demonstrates their predictive power.  Question  Do other theories or frameworks exist with an alternative interpretation of non-semantic communication while still having the same predictive power?  "
2832,What is the difference between attractor and recurrent network?,How are attractor and recurrent networks related? Is attractor network is private case of recurrent? Is there a mathematical formalism that defines both rigorously as graphs?  
2833,Are there any approaches to measuring “physical”/“neurophysiological” aspects of one's intellectual tone/state of fluid intelligence?,"Is it possible to measure/approximate/estimate intelligence with a physiological metric? What I mean is, if I put it correctly: to measure/estimate short-term memory capacity/long-term memory efficiency, speed of information transmission through brain cells/speed of new connections formation between cells etc.  For example, what can be deduced/assessed/assumed from the electroencephalogram results? Is there some activity pattern that may be related to forgetting or the like? "
2834,What experiment in a simple decision task should we run to obtain one million trials?,"Context: Models of cognitive processes require very large datasets to be fitted. Sadly, it is difficult for a single laboratory to achieve this alone. I propose that we work collectively and collaboratively in realizing a 1 million RT experiment. This initiative is described on my ResearchGate page, www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Cousineau.   Beyond model fitting, such a dataset will be beneficial for other purposes. Examples: Are parameters describing performances normally distributed across subjects? Does training effect --resulting in faster RT-- imply that the parameters are all evolving in one direction? Does Bayesian estimation more apt than Maximum Likelihood at characterizing the parameters? How can we estimate non-decision times? What is the shape of the RT distributions and how training effect alter its shape? In Bayes again, after how many trials does priors have no longer an impact on the estimates? etc.  Task Requirements: The task must be behavioral only (response times and response choices) as it is not possible to move EEG or fMRI material all around the world. The precise task used is not a critical constraint because the current models of cognition (sampling models such as LBA or Diffusion) are very flexible; they aim at predicting performance in a wide variety of situations.    The tasks proposed will be evaluated based on the following criteria criteria:    small number of response alternatives few conditions low error rates stimuli that can be characterized for modeling purposes possibility of extended training on that task.    Possible candidate tasks could include: A redundant target detection task (Miller, 1982) or a same-different task (e.g., Bamber, 1969). These tasks are simple and accuracy is typically high (above 90% correct); they are possibly performed using some form of parallel processing; response times are generally well below 700 ms.  So in summary:  What task and experimental design would be most suitable given the above constraints?  Please let's see what are the possible tasks, comment on others' proposals, and if you find the perfect task, upvote it. Have your colleagues make comments or propose new tasks. "
2835,Is love from families a necessity for children to form nornal relationship?,"Some human skills need specific input during childhood to develop, such as language skills. Is the ability to love one of them? I.e., does the formulation of intimate relationship with partner (or any other relationship, like with kids or friends) require the input of love from family members during childhood?  Related research can be, like, can victims of domestic violence form normal and long-lasting relationships when they grow up? Or any dataset/survey/study on similar focus? "

I wont feel emotions until they're all gone, correct? "
2837,Pros and Cons of PsychoPy for designing psychological experiments?,"What are the advantages of using PsychoPy for making an experiment (beyond the fact that it is free and open source)? I do not use psychophysics stimuli (no Gabor for instance); my stimuli are static images or text. Compared to E-Prime for example, how easy is it to set up a basic RT experiment? "
2838,Timing accuracies for displaying frames and recording response times?,"There are a few open-sources tools available to run psychology experiments. However, some are working in a browser. Do we know how precisely they can record response times? Also, can we present a visual frame for a precise amount of time? Considering refresh rates and wait_top signals, this  is not trivial. The few tools I have in mind are the following, but the answer may include other platforms as well:   jsPsych (browser-based) PsychoPy OpenSesame PEBL   If good reviews of these software have been published, please share reference.

2839,Syncing up CPT device with EEG recording,"I'm working on setting up an EEG experiment that will be going through a battery of various cognitive tasks. One of the tests is a Continuous Performance Task and to conduct that we'll be using a dedicated device(QikTest) that runs the test while disconnected from the stimulus computer, then is connected to get results. From there the program does an automatic analysis based on the performance and EEG results.  Since there is no means of automatically marking the task onset in our EEG recording at the time of the trial, the current plan is to use a video recording that contains the beginning of both EEG recording and CPT task to align the proper start time based on audio/visual cues of both for analysis. Our camera operates at 60fps so frame-to-frame is about 17ms, is this going to be a sufficiently small window to sync the data properly to capture the relevant ERP data in the EEG recording? If not would an audio recording at a higher sampling rate be sufficient(both starts have well identifiable audio cues)?  Edit(In response to Robin's comment below): Based on previous research we'll likely be looking for ERPs in the 200-500ms window for this and the other tasks. "
2840,Labeling and discrimination,"I recently saw a video (unfortunately can't remember where), where someone claimed that the use of labels to identify social groups produced or increased prejudice. So the labels of nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc. influence the perception of such groups by others, and result in segregation and discrimination rather than a desired effect of acceptance or unification.   I believe the context is described as ""identity politics"", where social groups label themselves, or are labeled, in an attempt to promote awareness of their social status / plight / cause, etc.  My impression was that the labels promote an ""us vs. them"" mindset, potentially by reinforcing differences rather than shared traits. (Tribalism?)  Does this theory regarding the 'negative' consequences of the use of labels have a name?   Are there studies demonstrating such behavior?    I found the term ""labels"" used in the context of symbolic interactionism, but the articles I've found so far seem to describe that as the tendency of a person to act in a way that conforms to the label (e.g. a person labeled as ""deviant"" will adopt behavior to meet the definition of the term).  I'm interested in how the self-adoption of a label by a group may produce a negative perception or separation / isolation of the group, such as producing discrimination that might not otherwise occur.  UPDATE: I saw this discussion of ingroup / outgroup behavior, which sounds relevant. Are labels one mechanism by which ingroup / outgroup associations developed?  Is the discrimination a reliable / consistent result of identifying people as outgroup?  What is the primary mechanism behind nationalism, sports-team-ism, product-ism etc.? "
2841,What makes someone an introvert or an extrovert?,"While I can understand that this may not be all black and white - i.e. there are also definitive ambiverts - I'd just been wondering for a while now, what are the possible factors that help in defining and forming the introvert and extrovert personality features in an individual?   Specifically, to what extent does someone's childhood and upbringing contribute to their preferred mode of operation? "
2842,What is considered an error in the sustained attention to response task (SART)?,"The traditional SART task requires key presses to all digits appearing on the screen. However, the key press should be withheld if the digit is a 3  When aggregating the collected data, what is considered an error?  Is it simply the number of times the key was pressed when a 3 is on the screen? Or does it also include incorrectly withheld key presses (i.e. when the digit is anything other than 3)? "
2843,How does timing of pleasure / dopamine / reward influence the formation of positive association?,"Suppose the following idealized experiment:  Setup:   A pill/medication which simply induces pleasure. Perhaps something like a perfect dopamine antagonist with no side-effects. Call it P A task which is to be trained. Call it T. (Assume that  T is not intrinsically pleasurable or unpleasant, and has no unpleasant associations for the subject)   Goal: The subject of the experiment is to be introduced to T in such a way that reinforces the ""enjoyment"" of  T and the desire to again do task  T.   Variables: P can be administered any time -- before during or after -- task T.   Question:    a. Is there an optimal time to introduce P to facilitate the development of the desire/interest/motivation to do task T? b. Is this even possible if the subject knows that P induces the pleasure? c. Even if pleasure and T are then linked, is it only under the assumption that T leads to pleasure, and thus if P is no longer present, the interest in T will wane?  "
2844,Can we truly random choose which finger to raise by counting to 10 in your mind?,"If a test person is asked to raise one of his 10 fingers at a given signal, is the choice truly random if he counts in his mind from 1 to 10 and associates with each number one of his fingers? The 1 he associates with the left pink, the 2 with his left ring finger, 3 with his left middle finger, etc. So the test person starts to count, the experimenter gives him a signal, after which the test person raises the finger associated with the number he arrived at while counting. Let's suppose the signal is given at a random moment. Is the choice ""in sync"" with the random signal given?  In other words, if the experimenter records which finger is raised after each of a 1000 signals are given to a single person, will the experimenter see that each finger is raised the same number of times (more or less, because the number of signals given is finite; the more signals, the better you're getting at the real distribution)? So in the case of 1000 signals given to a test person will the experimenter record that each finger is raised about 100 times?  Or does the test person not make a choice at all? "
2845,How does the brain use old information to make new connections?,"I assume that if my brain forms a new connection (registers a new information), it can't really know ""where does the new element stand in the system of things"". Nonetheless, it is being said that information is useful even if you forget it.  Let's say I would learn how photosynthesis works (not the words itself) when I'm 5 years old and forgot it (at least the conversation about it) since. Is it possible that the brain somehow brings the knowledge up when I'll hear about it in school ten years later?  I think I need to learn about the basic ""remembering algorithm"" brain generally used. It seems weird to me that the brain would automatically find the exact same neurons where the information had been stored before.  In other words: How does the basic architecture of the brain work so that the ""consciously forgotten"" information (in the sense that we cannot consciously recall the information) still be useful? "
2846,After how much time should we review a particular study material after once studying it thoroughly so as to retain it longer?,"I am having some doubts regarding my study regime; I am wondering if psychology could help?  So,I studied this one chapter thoroughly and due to shortage of time, I didn't review it for another 2-3 weeks. When I sat down to solve the related problems after 2-3 weeks, I didn't have that confidence anymore and I faced difficulty in attempting the problems that I was very comfortable with 2-3 weeks ago.This happened many times and it is spoiling all my hard work and is affecting my grades.   Is there a specific time interval after which you must review things after first learning them so that you can retain them longer?  How many times should I review it before I could remember it for an extended period of times(at least 5-6 months) ?  What percentage of a particular study material could I forget after not reviewing it for 2-3 weeks?   How much time does our brain take to forget things?  I know that it is always easier to learn a material second time than it is to learn for the very first time. It is because every bit of that information is somewhere stored in our subconscious memory. But, still how much time it should take for me to gain the same amount of confidence about that chapter as I had a couple of weeks ago? "
2847,What does it mean statistically for there to be significant differences in average IQ scores between racial groups?,"Charles Murray (in his book, ""The Bell Curve"") reported that there are real differences between the mean IQ scores of different racial groups. He also points out that IQ variation within said groups is greater than the variation between the groups. I'm struggling to reconcile these two statements.  If by ""real differences"", he means statistically significant differences between group averages--doesn't that entail the variation is greater between groups than within them?  That is, isn't the statistical test for inter-group mean differences (e.g. ANOVA) based on a comparison of the variances within vs between groups?--(if the inter-group variance is comparatively large enough, this constitutes a statistically significant difference between the groups?)  If not, then what does it mean to say that the groups are significantly different from eachother?  "

2849,Bias of finding others guilty of own shortcomings,"I haven't been in cognitive sciences for long, but in my work I have noticed a curious pattern: Individuals who overwhelmingly attribute the responsibility of their own actions to external causes, accuse others of behavioral patterns that represent the same patterns that they themselves do not accept to be guilty of.  Or maybe it's the other causal direction; they see others being guilty of certain behavioral patterns and subconsciously start behaving in the same ways.  For example: A patient who sees sexual predators in most men, sometimes in very subtle behavioral traits, accuses her partners of not respecting her decisions, of reversal of guilt, etc. However in the process of the accusation, she is unable to accept her partners' decisions (""He doesn't want to continue the relationship, but he doesn't care that I want to""), is uncompromising (Does not accept to establish a basis of communication) and blames them for her lack of communication (""I should not have to always be able to show you what I don't want, it is your responsibility to know."").   What I am interested in is; is there science on this that confirms my observation, or even a name or field of research for it? If yes, are there explanations on why this paradoxical attribution of responsibility happens? "
2850,Visualization of ICA (Independent component analysis) results to the brain spatial regions,"In Calhoun et al, 2002, on the application of ICA to fMRI on page 4, ICA data is mapped to the different regions in the brain.  Brain Activation Maps    Question  My specific question here is that when we have got results of ICA in the form of spatially Independent components, then how are those data mapped to the brain activation region?  Also using visualization How do we know that which component is task related that is there must be some default component for a particular activity. For example If a person is doing some activity like seeing a picture and his/her fMRI is being done then how based on ICA when we got say 30 component we would see that which component is related to that activity?  My Understanding  Those template brain regions have spatial locations like x,y coordinates so these ICA components would be somehow transformed to coordinate system.   Calhoun, V. D., Pekar, J. J., McGinty, V. B., Adali, T., Watson, T. D., &amp; Pearlson, G. D. (2002). Different activation dynamics in multiple neural systems during simulated driving. Human brain mapping, 16(3), 158-167.  "
2851,Establishing personality from shape AND color preferences,"There are many resources on the web that discuss correlations between the personality of an individual and their preferred shapes or colors.  To give just one example of each   [website][website]My questions here are:   The second of the two links above is from an academic source.  Are there extended experimental, peer-reviewed, studies that establish the validity of such correlations? From my own empirical observations I know that such correlations do indeed work though they are not not quite as clear cut as these articles make them out to be.  Are there any studies that look at both color and shape preferences at the same time?     I have found that one very good use to combine shape + color preferences is to weed out deliberately misleading responses.  Take the following example   We have the shapes - square, circle, triangle and squiggle we have the colors - red, yellow, orange, green, blue, white and black   Interpolating between the ideas proposed in the two links I have quoted above a ""Triangle"" personality is far more likely to be a ""Red"", ""Orange"" or ""Yellow"" personality than say a ""Blue"" one.  This could be used to assign a weighting to user responses in order to reduce the likelihood of invalid conclusions being drawn from deliberately misleading responses to the ""my favorite shape"" question.  Sounds plausible but once again I would like to know if there is any published research on the subject. "
2852,Benefits of social eating outside of family units,"The benefits of eating dinners with your family are documented in ""Correlations between family meals and psychosocial well-being among adolescents"" by Eisenberg et al.

2853,How many items in a list can a human create without repetition?,"Consider the question ""Name as many animals as you can.""  An average person could no doubt list off about 20-30 animals without repetition.  This is odd seeing as we have a 7-9 item maximum short term memory.  The theory would suggest that as soon as we got to animal 10 we would start repeating the same animals without realising it. Whereas of this is plainly not what a person does. We sort of know ""I've already said that one"". Even though we wouldn't be able to repeat the whole list back.  Is there a limit to this kind of memory? How many animals can a human list off until they forget whether or not they have named a certain animal? Is it time based or number based?   It feels like we're marking off different neurons in the brain when we say them. So we don't say them again. "
2854,"What does it mean to ""control for differences in factors"" when looking at gun ownership and homicide rates?","What does it mean ""with control for differences in factors"" in the sentence :  ""Several studies used cross-sectional analyses to detect a positive relationship between the prevalence of gun ownership at the neighbourhood, county, regional or state level and homicide rates, with control for differences in factors associated with homicide (e.g., urbanization, race/ethnicity, unemployment, poverty, crime, and alcohol use).""  What did they do to those factors when they ""control"" them ?   The full report can be found here, if that helps for context: [website]Does that mean that they took in consideration all those factors (urbanization, race/ethnicity, poverty, etc.)  in the method to minimize the impact those factors have in the results of the factor that matters the most to homicide rates in  this study, in this case gun ownership? If so, how can it be done? An illustrative example is enough. "
2855,"With psychological projection originating in psychoanalysis, is the concept currently considered valid?","In a recent accepted and highly up voted answer by one of our respected users, psychological projection as a defense mechanism was brought forward as the relevant terminology/explanation of what the OP was looking for.  According to wikipedia, the concept of psychological projection seems to have originated from psychoanalysis.  Within research, much of Freud's work is now considered pseudoscience, to the degree that we even had a discussion on whether or not questions on psychoanalysis should be allowed on this site.   Since Freud, has the concept of psychological projection carried over into modern science? Does additional evidence obtained by modern science mostly support or oppose this concept?  "
2856,"How do Terence Tao's ""three stages of rigorousness"" relate to cognitive science?","This is an excerpt from There’s more to mathematics than rigour and proofs of Terrence Tao:        The “pre-rigorous” stage, in which mathematics is taught in an informal, intuitive manner, based on examples, fuzzy notions, and hand-waving. The emphasis is more on computation than on theory. This stage generally lasts until the early undergraduate years.   The “rigorous” stage, in which one is now taught that in order to do maths “properly”, one needs to work and think in a much more precise and formal manner. The emphasis is now primarily on theory; and one is expected to be able to comfortably manipulate abstract mathematical objects without focusing too much on what such objects actually “mean”. This stage usually occupies the later undergraduate and early graduate years.   The “post-rigorous” stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all the rigorous foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit and refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous theory. The emphasis is now on applications, intuition, and the “big picture”. This stage usually occupies the late graduate years and beyond.      Does this have any stance in the context of cognitive science? A comment in Mathematics Education says that this idea can't be broaden in other fields/jobs in any level of academic, since:     Tao is using the word rigor in a way that's fairly narrow and specific to math. Namely, rigor means proving every statement one makes or uses, in full detail, from some list of axioms. One cannot rigorously work on cars, any more than one can rigorously eat one's dinner. It also does not make sense to talk about ""post-rigorous"" in the context of solving geometry exercises, because ""rigorous"" doesn't mean being good at something.   But I still don't understand this. Sure, it does not make sense to say ""eat dinner rigorously"", but it is possible for a good cook to know the hidden ingredients, the recipe or the taste of it by just looking and smelling the food, and I think this is equivalent to ""proving every statement one makes or uses, in full detail, from some list of axioms"".  So how is this phenomenon described rigorously in cognitive science? "
2857,Resources for learning how best to learn fine motor skills,"I am interested in learning how best to learn a fine motor skill, in this case, playing a musical instrument. Presumably there are more or less effective ways to go about it.   Possible factors that I can think of include:   Practice schedule. e.g. how often? how long? time of day? how long does it take for the neural changes to occur? does it happen during rest? Practice structure. e.g. include breaks? how long between breaks? how long should each break be? how many breaks? Practice speed. e.g do something slowly first? how slowly? for how long? when to increase speed? Practise focus. Are there things that are worth specifically directing attention to? Non practise elements. Are there things that can be done outside of practising that help, e.g. visualisation? other exercises?   I appreciate that this is many questions rolled up into one, but my main point is how do I go about learning how best to learn fine motor skills, ideally outside of a teaching institution. Is there a good book on the subject? What even is the name of this subject? "

2859,How neurons and mind can be related?,"As we know neurons are matter . But mind is not matter .You can see a brain but can't see a mind . Why from outside brain is full neurons , but when it's inside you , it starts to create mind, visions, hearing etc etc.How neurons also know that a fire is hot and an ice is cold? How it process information? We know about how our sensory organs , muscles, stomach , heart work .What is their physical structure etc. But when they are inside our body, we don't even know they exist. For example, we know objectively how sound travels from outer ear to our brain and brain interprets ,which results into our sound perception .But as a subject, we don't even know about their existence let alone their functions .Why same thing which is perceived from outside is so different from when that very thing is inside you ? These are two different worlds ,one is objective (from outside) another is subjective (from inside or first hand experience) . Between these two which is true?  Scientists can say you are hearing because of all that neurons firing and all. But a common person who never heard about neurons , will not trust those words of the scientists . Because from their point of view , they will say , they are having a sound perception through ear and mind . So in this case, he is also right that only mind exists but no neurons exist .Please clear this confusion . I think this should be the base of biological sciences .But they never mentioned this anywhere in the books . "
2860,Do mass shooters tend to have been bullied as kids?,"The media frequently claims that mass shooters are or were bullied as children. Does the scientific evidence back up this claim?

2861,Could human decision making have evolved from food finding?,"One of the things human's do (and possibly other animals) is consider various options, imagine what they would be like, and then make a choice. This is called a ""tree search"". For example, ""should I take the job offer A or B""?  Now, I wonder if this abstract decision making, may have evolved from food finding. And what is the smallest animal that does this sort of thing?  For example, imagine a small monkey or squirrel climbing a tree. When it gets to a branch it has a choice of taking the left branch or the right branch. It has to guess which branch is likely to lead to the best crop of fruit.  Once it has got fruit from one branch it may have to retrace its steps to get to the next branch.   So I would suggest that this sort of ""tree search"" would probably have evolved in mammals brain before humans repurposed these brain pathways to do more abstract decision making involving language.  I am trying to think of other animals that this would apply to. For example a rabbit may have a choice between branching tunnels.  A bear might have a choice of paths up a mountain and so on.   Rats are good maze finder so they must have this ability to make choices.  I wonder what other animals do this sort of thing? Rather than making a choice at random? It would have to be an animal at least as advanced enough to have a memory. "
2862,Understanding the 'Wiring Catastrophe',"Introduction:  In 'Wiring optimization in the brain'(2000), Dmitri Chklovskii and Charles Stevens analyse the dependence of the complexity of cortical circuits on the number of synapses per neuron using virtual perturbations. The authors clarify what they mean by a perturbation in their introduction:      To calculate the optimal wire fraction, we start with a real cortical region containing a fixed   number of neurons, a mm cube, for example, and imagine perturbing it by adding or subtracting synapses and the axons and dendrites needed to support them. The rules for perturbing the cortical cube require that the existing circuit connections and function remain   intact (except for what may have been removed in the perturbation), that no holes are created, and that all added (or subtracted) synapses are typical of those present; as wire volume   is added, the volume of the cube of course increases.     Starting from a reasonable set of physiological relationships approximated as algebraic equations they derive a formula for [tex], the ratio of the number of synapses per neuron in the perturbed cortex to that of the real cortex as a function of [tex], the volume fraction of the perturbed cortical region made up of wires(synapses + dendrites), and [tex], a constant that multiplies the length of wire associated with each synapse:   \begin{equation} \theta(\phi) = \frac{1}{\lambda^5} \cdot \Big(\frac{1-\phi}{1-\phi_0}\Big)^{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \frac{\phi}{\phi_0} \tag{1} \end{equation}  In the paper, [tex] is assumed to be equal to [tex] and I must say that the authors explain the derivation clearly. It doesn't require more than highschool algebra and each assumption is carefully justified. By calculating [tex] you may then find that ,if [tex], [tex] is maximal when [tex]. This much makes sense to me but the authors then try to rationalise this value in a manner that appears to lack careful justification:      Why does complexity reach a maximum value at a particular wire fraction? When wire and   synapses are added, a series of consequences can lead to a runaway situation we call the   wiring catastrophe...At this point(phi=0.6), adding wire becomes impossible without decreasing complexity or making   other changes - like decreasing axon diameters - that alter cortical function. The physical   cause of the catastrophe is a slow growth of conduction velocity and dendritic cable length   with diameter combined with the requirement that the conduction times between synapses   (and dendrite cable lengths) be unchanged in the perturbed cortex.    Question:  The kind of justification that appears necessary to me concerns data on brain development. I understand that significant synaptic pruning occurs during adolescence so [tex] should vary and I think this poses a significant challenge to the account given by Chklovskii and Stevens. More precisely, this variation isn't accounted for by variations in [tex] in their model so I have doubts concerning the temporal and causal validity of their model.    To quantify the variation in [tex] we may use numbers from 'Synaptic Pruning Mechanisms in Learning' by Deborah Sandoval:     At infancy, each neuron averages around 2,500 synapses and at the peak   of exuberant synaptogenesis (around 2-3 years of age) the number   increases to around 15,000 (The University of Maine, 2001).   I must add that I have spent some time googling 'Wiring Catastrophe' but this doesn't return anything besides the original paper by D. Chklovskii and C. Stevens.   These observations lead me to the following questions:   If equation (1) is not an exact relationship, how can the extremization(i.e. differentiation) procedure be justified within the context of applied mathematics?  Is there any biological evidence of runaway wiring catastrophes occurring in real brains?    Discussion:  To clarify how synaptic pruning fits into the discussion we may associate a perturbation with a temporal variation in the number of synapses per neuron in the brain as follows:  \begin{equation} \theta(i \rightarrow f) = \frac{\langle \text{synapses}_{t=f}/\text{neuron}_{t=f} \rangle}{\langle \text{synapses}_{t=i}/\text{neuron}_{t=i} \rangle} \approx \frac{\sum \text{synapses}_{t=f}}{\sum \text{synapses}_{t=i}} \tag{2} \end{equation}  since the number of neurons in the brain is approximately constant. My argument is essentially that significant variations in [tex] aren't explained by the variations in [tex] which stands in contrast to the authors' assertion in their introduction that the relation between relative complexity [tex] and wire volume fraction [tex] is given by equation (1).  Addendum:  I just received a pretty comprehensive reply from Charles Stevens via email. In particular, he advised me to read the final version of their paper: Chklovskii, D.M., Schikorski, T., and Stevens, C.F. (2002) Wiring optimization in cortical circuits. Neuron 34:341- 347.

How does the cell identify the subsequently actioned neurons? How do the two find their ways to connect with each other?  Do they already need to be very close to each other, or even have already some synapses formed? In this case, do synaptogenesis forms randomly and spontaneously between adjacent cells? "
2865,Do animals know about choices?,"A mouse goes through a maze and gets to a T-junction. Does it ""know"" there is a choice to be made between left and right or does it just continue following it's nose? Perhaps using some heuristics?  An ape is given a choice of toys to play with. Does it know there is a choice and consider each in turn? Or just grab one on instinct?  A human gets to a T-junction in a maze. And you can garuntee that he or she will stop there for a while considering their options and imagining the best route forward.  So I wonder if ""choice"" is a thing that only humans (and maybe apes and crows) understand because they are the only ones who can make use of this by considering the future events?  Also, apart from the artificial example of a T-junction in a maze, what other examples of ""choices"" exist in the wild. "
2866,Why are trans-women more common than trans-men?,"Before I begin, note I have no animosity nor prejudice against anyone. Please keep the answers scientifically motivated.    Various surveys on trans populations have shown male to female transitions are 2-4x more likely than female to male (see here).  This is clearly statistically significant and not some anomaly.  I can only think of 2 possible solutions ... either a difference in psychological predisposition between the sexes (but if so what), or some genetic component.  That being said, what is the most likely reason for this?  Does the large discrepancy in numbers suggest such a genetic component?  For context, here is one of the stats I am basing the question on(the stats are similar for all countries for which there is data):  ""The American Psychiatric Association, using GID criteria, suggested that MTFs had a 1 in 30,000 (.0077%) prevalence rate, while FTMs were 1 in 100,000 (.0029%)"" "
2867,"Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Cognitive Function and Causing someone to Learn","Children may elicit, either through active engagement or some feature of their personality or appearance, a response from their environment that might protect them from deprivation-related risk either by reducing their exposure to risk factors or altering their impact once they have been exposed.  Could childern be caused by parenting, schooling and/or close social rings to learn neurodevelopmental disorders?  i.e Are parenting, schooling and/or close social rings able to cause someone young(Before the Age of 7) previously not suffering from the Neurodevelopmental Disorders or exacerbate them in those already suffering from them to learn those disorders by example or experience? Like one would learn table manners.  A parent with Neurodevelopmental Disorders will probably tolerate somethings that others would find problematic while being incommoded by something trivial to others. They will also focus on verbal communication. Speak verbosly, have trouble interpreting non-verbal communication.  If ones' parents have poor social interactions the offspring might not be that welcome. And thence develop their cognitive function accordingly.  If schools fail to notice early signs the disorder might progress further. Both due to lack of help and because teachers and classmates will drift away, bully, prank, hit, abuse. "
2868,Comorbidity of Neurodevelopmental Disorders between them and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder,"[website]OCD being an anxiety disorder and OCPD being a personality disorder it is entirely possible that these two can be present on the same patient.  Autism, e.g Aspergers Syndrome and ADHD have some similarities but are distinct disorders.  We learn at university that people with Aspergers are frequently obsessive.  Based on Occam's Razor ""Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate"" Psychiatrists and Neuropsychologists are intently parsimonious in diagnosing a patient with multiple disorders even if the examinee meets the criteria, is indeed experiencing the symptom, has the equivalent behaviour. And we are taught at university just that.  Is there any case in which the behaviour of the examinee undoubtedly suggests comorbidity of OCD,OCPD, ASD and ADHD mixed type maybe even along with an entirely distinct disorder like dysthimia? How exactly are these examinees' behaviours? As a medicine student professors do not answer these questions in their lectures ( one reason I am most probably converting to Law since they are slightly more open there). "

2870,"What is the name for this form of ""influence""?","I have found that people are often ""roused to action,"" activism and even zealotry by attributing either extreme of ""nobleness"" or ""despicability"" to their self or group identity.  I don't know if there is a name for this phenomena.  I'll give two examples to help pin this down.  Attribution of Despicability  For example, Fred is an evangelical who has an axe to grind with Catholicism.  Fred encounters an apathetic Catholic named Phil, who neither knows or cares anything about his alleged Catholic faith, and yet Fred proceeds to blast Phil verbally (under the appellation ""you Catholics"") for how despicable and anti-biblical their beliefs are.    Phil becomes very unsettled and defensive from this encounter, and subsequently chooses not just to learn his faith - but to defend it as well. Ironically Phil grows into a zealot for his Catholic faith due to Fred's negative outburst.  It could be said that Phil has (subconsciously?) resolved to prove Fred wrong or perhaps to attain a form of revenge?  Attribution of Nobleness  Jake, a young man, is an athletic but wayward soul.  He encounters a decorated army veteran named Gabe who says ""I've been watching you for several days now lad, and I can tell you that in you is a greatness that is meant to be released.""  The subsequent conversation inspires Jake to join the military and, indeed, Jake subsequently has a stellar military career that proves Gabe was right!  Wrapping Up  I realize that not every dynamic has a specific name in psychology, but it troubles me that the overall phenomena I'm outlining isn't represented in public dialogue, particularly when it comes to politics.  I believe the nation is becoming increasingly polarized and hostile because ""attribution of despicability"" is counter-productively generating the wrong kind of zealotry and thus ever-deepening unproductive contrasts.    ""You leftists just want to destroy democracy"".  Well, the ""leftist"" did not have an opinion about democracy before the accusation, but due to the judgmental accusation...the leftist began to study and embrace arguments of why democracy is evil. ""You rightists just want to subjugate minorities"".  Well the ""rightest"" who had no particular sentiment before now adopts a passive-aggressive attitude about those who claim to support minorities and perhaps against minorities as well.   In short, both positive and negative accusation(s) have a catalytic or causal power.  Seen this way, in the case of negative accusations which we use to judge and condemn, the reality is that ""we have met the enemy, and it is ourselves.""    I wouldn't be surprised if psychology has two names which treat both the ""attribution of nobleness"" and the ""attribution of despicability"" as two different things, even though I see them as flip-sides of the same coin.  Any ideas? "
2871,"Is it possible for a ""false positive"" medical diagnosis to be voided or expunged later?","In general, if a diagnosing clinician makes a grave error in diagnosis, is it possible to later invalidate the diagnosis on the basis of insufficiency, lack of evidence, poor judgment, or other similar reason?  For example, if someone accidentally ended up in a situation where he/she was diagnosed with a mental disorder according to the DSM, but the symptoms according to the DSM do not correspond at all to reality (For example, at least the main symptoms are missing, the study admission was less then the official time needed to diagnose someone with a specific disorder, or a similar reason), can the diagnosis be fully expunged from their medical record upon a sufficient showing of such insufficiency?  I'm not asking about getting a second opinion, refusing treatment, or getting a discharge from treatment - I'm asking about fully eradicating or expunging a diagnosis to the point where it never really ""existed"" at all in a medical or medicolegal sense. In the practice of law, a legal judgment, order, or document can often be ""voided"", ""vacated"", ""quashed"", ""overturned"" or ""invalidated"" by a court if it is shown to have been issued in error. Is there any similar thing in the practice of medicine?  This sort of question is, perhaps, not very interesting or relevant for the majority of patients, but it can be very relevant for persons who must undergo formal ""fitness for duty"" evaluations or must ""pass"" medical background checks. For example, someone aspiring to become a pilot who has a history of treatment for schizophrenia, but is currently ""ok"", must normally undergo a grueling, time consuming, and expensive evaluation process. If such a person could get some sort of medical evaluation stating that they never really ""had"" schizophrenia to begin with, that could allow them to answer ""no"" on the applicable medical background check forms and obtain licensure that much more easily. This question may also be relevant to victims of gaslighting - if a person was given a clinical ""label"" as a result of abuse inflicted upon them, removing the ""stigma"" of having the ""label"" may be a valuable form of healing even if the person doesn't have any pressing legal need to have the diagnosis formally removed.

2874,Constraints on dataset size for AI-assisted connectome reconstruction,"From an exchange with Dr. Seung, an expert on connectomics, I learned that one of his former PhD students Viren Jain is leading the Connectomic effort at Google using supervised learning methods. Now, supervised deep learning methods usually require large amounts of data to succeed. (I know this based on experience in industry as well as the deep learning literature.) However, due to the time and effort of human annotation the datasets for circuit reconstruction are really small:     It takes about six months for humans to annotate 1 cubic millimeter of brain volume.   In fact, Dr. Seung informed me that the following dataset from a circuit reconstruction competition in 2016 which is less than five gigabytes in total is basically state of the art.   Given that augmenting training data with synthetic data is frequently used for computer vision problems, I am led to the following questions:    Might it theoretically be possible to augment human-annotated training data with morphologically similar synthetic data?  What methods in the near future might allow us to significantly increase the size of human-annotated training data?   References:   Michał Januszewski, Jörgen Kornfeld, Peter H.

2875,"From psychological point of view, how easy can public opinion be manipulated by politicians and media?","We have seen the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 (wikipedia). While I agree that stronger regulations on the use of personal data should be enforced, but from a psychological point of view:   How strongly can a person's political position be manipulated by a company like this (or combined with biased media)? What kind of manipulation is possible and can be done? Can they completely reverse one's political position?  "
2876,Is there an actionable branch of cognitive science?,"I'm not sure what is the name of a branch of cognitive science that deals with the application of cognitive science to the real world.  I know that in Biology, there are fields like genetic engineering or biomedical engineering, where the principles of science of Biology are applied to development of products.  In physics there's mechanical and electrical engineering.   I did a search and found that there are several applied cognitive science labs at various psychology departments in the US.   Is there some branch of cognitive science that is focused on using the knowledge to create products or services? Am I thinking of the applied cognitive science, psychology, psychiatry or something else?  Thank you! "
2877,What regulates the strength of motor signals?,"I've seen cognitive and robot models where the input signals from the sensors are directly used as the signal for outgoing motor control.   This doesn't make much sense, because obviously we're able to do heavy work with our muscles quite independently from the strength of incoming signals from our sensor systems. However when I consulted several books on general cognition, I wasn't able to discover the source of these arbitrarily strong signals - I'd suspect the thalamus.   I wonder how you could perform a task, e.g. playing a piano, by applying weak or strong force. Both the plan (how to move the fingers) and the feedback (how it sounds) signal would remain the same.  So where does the signal for motor behavior originate, and more importantly what (or who) regulates its strength? Where does the extra energy come from? "
2878,How repeatable are cognitive science findings within the same individual?,"Thanks to this website, I've seen a number of papers and scholarly articles that deal with cognition. I'm interested in how repeatable the findings are that are discovered as a result of experiments.  For example, when a mechanical system is tested, it is tested to work the same way every single time:   A lock opens and closes when a key is turned. A car door opens up to the maximum degree allowed by design.   How much is a cognitive system like a mechanical system? Will it work the same way every time?  For example, I'm thinking about the design of an experiment I've been reading about: The Ikea Effect Experiment. Volunteers are asked to assemble Ikea boxes and bid on the box after assembly. The experiment shows that people value things they built themselves more than things that are just offered to them.  Now if the machine-like definition of repeatability is applied to this experiment: Would test subjects value boxes they built themselves next time they do an experiment? How about next month? What about in 3 years? Would people in the 1940's have the same response?  Have there been any studies that deal with this ""repeatability"" question? For example, studies that used the same test subjects doing the same experiment multiple times? "
2879,Are there professional cognitive science test subjects?,"I'm interested in how cognitive science experiments are designed and executed. Up until now, all of the papers I've seen dealing with cognition use availability of test subjects as one of the major factors of recruitment for experiments. For example, students are recruited for an experiment, and because the group is so diverse, they are tested on general skills that the entire group would possess, like reading or math.   For example, consider this experiment: ""Happiness economics"" in reverse: Does happiness affect productivity? There were 276 university students and faculty involved. The students are tested with a math task.  Math and reading comprehension are general skills, and I can think of few people who earn their living with those skills, aside from SAT tutors.  I'm interested if there have been other types of cognitive experiments tried, where the skills used to evaluate experiment are at a ""professional"" level. For example professional athletes, soldiers or pilots come to mind.   Experiments that use scoring percentage as a metric for basketball players Experiments that use marksmanship grouping as a metric Professional video game players   Are there any groups of people, whose professional skills are consistently tested as metric of cognitive performance?   Thank you for your input! "
2880,Is there any chromatic analogue of the Shepard tone?,"Is there any chromatic analogue of the Shepard tone?  I am imagining that each pure tone would correspond to a pure wavelength of light, transformed in such a way that the middle of three consecutive octaves would correspond to the peak sensitivity of the R, G, and B cones respectively.  Would the light have the corresponding description of ""always getting bluer (redder)""?  If, say, one had been spending a long time immersed in a game like this, would it create the illusion of accelerating toward (away) without actually moving?  Any references to similar ideas? "
2881,Do action video games have an effect on spatial skills?,"I've just watched a TED talk by Daphne Bavelier, who seems to be a major researcher on plasticity and video games. In it she presents results from a controlled lab study in which participants needed to perform mental rotations (around 14 minutes into the video), before and after having played 10 hours of action video games over a period of 2 weeks. She demonstrates results which show an improvement up to 5 months after having gotten the 'training'.    I'm interested in finding out more about this research and the methodologies it followed. So my first question is whether somebody could link me to the original research.   Did they take into account learning effects? Did they use a control group?   My skepticism comes from a previous question on video games in which D. Bavelier is mentioned often. It has gotten some concerned responses involving methodological flaws. "
2882,Can Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) present symptoms from very particular stimuli?,"Sensory processing disorder can cause over or under reactions to sensory input, like loud sound. Can those afflicted with this disorder be okay from a particular sound played at a particular volume but react to a different sound played at the same volume? How can this disorder be differentiated from a phobia or various other disorders? "
2883,What's the name of the quantifying preference for visual stimulus by varying size or distance as compared to a reference task?,"Say that you enjoy looking at two beautiful paintings (A and B). But you really can't tell which one you like more, and you want to (quantitatively).   So, you compare them both to your favorite painting (C), which you know you really like to look at (adjusting for novelty).   In order to do this, you vary the size of your favorite painting C on a computer screen (or its distance from you in real life), and find the point at which C is so much smaller that you'd rather look at A. You do the same for painting B.   You then attempt to quantify how much you prefer A to B by asking: for which painting (A or B) was C larger when you first preferred to look at that painting rather than C? This is the one that you prefer more, and the distance between the C ""breakpoints"" gives some measure of your relative preference.   Of course this difference will be at best an interval measurement, not a ratio one, but that's usually better than no measurement.    Here is my question: what is this procedure (or some variant of it) called? This seems like a basic enough test that it must already be in use, and I am curious to hear more about it.   Related question: How is the size of a video related to its perceived quality? "
2884,"Why people choose ""boring"" colors for new cars?","I've been interested in this question for a few years, sorry if this is not the right place to ask it.  As I've been driving around the US for the last few years, I noticed that some community parking lots ""lack color"" - the vehicles can be defined as colorless - they are white, black, various shades of gray or beige. Yet I've seen several new car catalogs and see that most cars come in several colors.  I was surprised to see this ""lack of color"" again and again, so I googled it, and found that the trend is not just in America, but worldwide:     2009 Top 10 world car colors  This is interesting, because I've never ever heard of white, silver or black being called people's favorite color. Most search results point to ""blue"" being the favorite color (at least in the United States) for English search results.  This begs the question: Why do people go for boring/conservate exterior car colors, like white or silver when buying a new car, instead of choosing their favorite color?  Here are my wild guesses, and it would be great to debunk them:   Is this due to conformity, resale value, or an attempt to stand out less on a highway? Is this because a car is big enough to be seen with rods in the eye? Or do people see their cars as just another ""appliance"", like a toaster, microwave or a fridge, and pick a color similar to what they see in their kitchen?   I appreciate your input!  PS. This article is especially interesting, because it predicts orange/brown becoming the ""new color"" of expensive cars, while most color psychology results I've seen list people naming orange as ""cheap"" color, and advise to avoid it.   America's favorite car colors for 2012 are ... boring "
2885,What reasoning processes underlie the Logima Strictica 36 and Logicaus Strictimanus 24?,I am conducting research in creating an AI with high IQ.

What reasoning processes underly these test items?  
2886,Does adopting personal routines accelerate cognitive decline?,"Many people tend to automate many mundane daily tasks by adhering to a proven routine that works and that can be equivalent to a computer script with the person implementing it being equivalent to a computer.  There are many benefits for that in that, just like there are benefits to computing automation, most notably it allows us to live efficiently and spare our mental energies for tasks that cannot be or have not yet been automated yet.  But I am curious if there are cognitive studies that associate adherence to routine to cognitive decline.  I can imaging that, if you were doing a lot of daily tasks in the same way over and over again, you may lose your cognitive processing edge.  This is just an unconfirmed observation so I am reaching out to the community of experts (of whom I am not one) to see if there are studies about it.    On the other hand, I can also see how personal routines and daily automation are an earmark of highly intelligent people who are capable of seeing patterns between two separate instances of a similar task.  But can a side effect (automation) of that initial favorable cognitive state (IQ) lead to lowered cognition as a matter of lessened daily mental workout?  In other words, can you become dull if you do things more routinely? "

(ie. not believing that she's really not attracted to him).   My question is:   How well studied is this? What methods of study do they use? How prevalent is it amongst men? (Are all men subject it it?) How strong is the bias? By how much do men overvalue their attractiveness?  How does this compare with women?   "
2889,"Is cortical magnification in the visual system related to synaptic pruning, or is it a separate developmental or learning process?","I'm primarily interested in learning about current computational models that explain cortical magnification in the visual system.  With this in mind, my specific questions are: (1) Is this phenomenon a result of the synaptic pruning that takes place in the early years of development? (2) If not, is it a separate ""learning"" process along the lines of the hippocampus enlargement in London cab drivers?  I would personally like it if the answers were (1) NO (2) YES, but I'd like to know what the latest science says. "
2890,Can we use a scale even if one of the answer levels was not added?,"I have a set of 20 participants for a study who were given a 7-point Likert scale that was made incorrectly by a graduate student. The student accidentally did not add the 6th answer level. The scale for these 20 participants arguably has no validity now. However, I am hoping there is a way to use it for a pilot or preliminary poster. The study will continue for a couple years and is proposed to have 300 participants. But I would like to use these 20 participants for a small pilot or preliminary poster. Is there a way for me to still use that scale (missing the 6th answer option) and the 20 participants?   I don't know if I can impute it because the data is not MCAR, the answer level was not added to the scale as it should have been. But can I weight the low and high-ends of it or something still? I would like to see if the measured construct from that scale relates to either another variable (such as Engagement) or the outcome variable. It is a longitudinal study, they come in once a week for three weeks. Each time they come in to the lab and use the online intervention they take the scale three times (i.e., Baseline, after first half of website, and then after second half of website), which means we have each participants using the scale 9 times.  "
2891,"Why do we have so much neurological research on and treatment designed for dyslexia, yet less so for dyscalculia?","I know next to nothing about intervention methods designed for dyscalculia, or 'dyslexia with numbers', as I have heard it colloquially referred to (considering how obscure the term seems to be compared to its language-related twin). I have also read that dyslexia and dyscalculia often occur in conjunction, and both seem to affect the population at equal rates. Yet I can find far more literature and neurological research on dyslexia than on dyscalculia.  Is there a reason for this? And what do we know about dyscalculia from a neurological standpoint, as well as a treatment standpoint? (By 'neurological standpoint', I mean what do we know about neurological causes and/or areas of the brain that appear to be affected in those with dyscalculia) "
2892,How can Bayesian inference improve upon logistic regression in incorporating psychometric data?,"In order to estimate probability of default, banks and other financial institutions have often used logistic regression based on data involving credit history.  Suppose an entrepreneur or borrower with little credit or business history goes to a bank or some financial institution to borrow money.  Banks can use, as an alternative to a credit or business history, 'psychometric' or 'behavioural' tests. Hence, the bank will use some psychometric data, instead or with credit history data when using logistic regression to estimate probability of default.  How can Bayesian inference improve upon such logistic regression wherein psychometric data is used?  I previously asked about the Bayesian logit model and psychometrics.  So far, all I found are these EFL papers: 1 2  Anyone know any other literature out there? "
2893,What skills or mental proceses improve understanding of longer written sentences?,"This question concerns only written sentences, and presumes that longer sentences are more difficult to understand, a presumption which consists with the formula behind the Flesch–Kincaid readability tests (which I discovered from the first paragraph hereof).    What specific  capabilities, knowledge, or skills are needed to ameliorate understanding of longer sentences (which were more common in the past  in English and the Romance languages)?  What empowered olden people to communicate  comfortably with longer sentences?  Why do we today find them more difficult?    For example, despite not having studied linguistics separately, did learning Latin and Greek impart the olden people with some linguistics that cultivated their fluency with longer sentences?  "

2896,Neurophysiological mappings of empathy,"What biologically plausible models are there of empathy?  I know there has been a significant amount of work in defining emotion on a neurophysiological basis using models (I'm currently reading ""Emotions as semantic pointers: Constructive neural mechanisms"" by Thaghard et al. about using the Semantic Pointer Architecture as a basis for emotions). However, I'm having a hard time finding models that define emotions on a neurophysiological basis in relation to other social agents. Do they exist?  When I'm discussing empathy, I'm referring to the phenomena's of affective empathy, cognitive empathy and emotional contagion. "
2897,How are real life events translated into dream symbolism?,"I'm interested in how significant events from daily life get encoded or translated into dream content. A personal observation can help clarify my question:     I've observed that for me, ""significant, futile mental effort""   translates into dreams of me being in a classroom in my old middle   school. The kind of mental effort dictated which classroom I will see   - history, language or math.   It took me years to make the connection, as the frequency of the dream was rather high while attending school and college. It is only after I started working that I noticed dreams of classrooms were gone and only reappeared following intense, but perceived as pointless mental effort to learn or grasp or produce something.   I'm familiar with the Freud's theories on how wish fulfillment and repressed sexual desires show up in dreams. On the other hand I'm aware of the much discredited concept of ""dream interpretation"" with dictionaries of dream symbols.  Have there been studies that lay in between the two extremes listed above and attempted to elicit connections between daily events and how they appear in dreams? Maybe attempts to create personal dream dictionaries, like the one I described in the example? "
2898,"Is there a standard definition of a ""hallucination""?","As far as I understand, there is a compelling sense of reality to sensory hallucinations. Do hallucinations (as, e.g. in the DSM) substitute for the sense and experience of a real reality?

2899,How do we know bipolar is one illness rather than two comorbid illnesses?,"Based on my previous question about ADHD and OCD.  Essentially, ADHD and OCD are kind of opposites in the sense that ADHD people (always? sometimes?) have dopamine deficiency and OCD people (always? sometimes?) have excess dopamine.  I know this may be a stupid question or based on incorrect understanding of bipolar, but how do psychologists know that bipolar is one disorder rather than a comorbidity of mania and depression? "
2900,is it true that people who code think differently?,"I code websites and I believe the way I think is totally different from most of the others. Not that I think in a better way(a possibility though) but I'm only saying ""differently"". Do you think it's true? if yes, why? "
2901,Where to publish a short (mathematical) neuroscience article?,"I am writing an article about a computational method, which is relatively widely used in a small subfield of neuroscience (it is easy to identify ~20 recent articles that used it in 2013-2015).  The results I have are a set of small improvements but interesting anyway (at least in my opinion), so the paper will be a short one, perhaps around 2000 words (+ 1 or 2 figures and about 30 references). The results are purely mathematical; no data was collected.  Where could I publish my findings? I feel the upper-tier journals (with impact factors > 5 or so) might not be interested since the paper is so short (their typical paper lengths are 10+ pages). The top journals (e.g Nat Neurosci) of course publish brief reports but my findings are probably not that important.  Any suggestions where to submit? "
2902,Why do many people play Candy Crush without ever buying anything while some spend all their money on it?,"I'm trying to understand how free-to-play games like Candy Crush Saga use existing knowledge of the human brain to keep people engaged and how they convince players to pay money for in-game goods. Some of their game mechanics remind me of the Skinner box. Interestingly, some sources claim that a very small percentage of players contribute 50% of their revenue. I'm assuming this is because not everyone is as susceptible to their monetization tricks. Some addicted players dump all their money into the game, which puts pressure on game developers to protect vulnerable customers from themselves.  Research on big spenders in free-to-play games seems to be scarce, but are there any parallels with existing research (e.g. on gambling) that explain why many people will never spend a dime on these games while others are struggling not to spend their life savings on it? For example, is there a significant difference in how individuals respond to conditioning? "
2903,How to measure change in emotional responses when pre and post tests use different measures?,"My research is to evaluate change of emotional responses of participants, after performing two types of game activities. Two groups of participants, Group A and Group B, will be assigned to Activity A and Activity B respectively. The research design does not cater for a control group.  I plan to measure the baseline emotions (using the Mood Questionnaire) [1] of all the participants. The arousal and valence components will be measured using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) questionnaire [2]  So now, I have pre-test responses from Mood Questionnaire (baseline emotional responses), and the post-test responses from SAM.  I am not sure how to proceed with the data from each instrument. For instance, how do I obtain a change in emotional responses from each subject? How do we normalize the baseline emotions in this case?  Mood Questionnaire available at [1] [website]SAM questionnaire available at [2] [website]"
2904,Folding (wrinkles) in cortex: Why is surface area more important than volume?,"When we look at the cortex of the brain, it has a folded structure. It is said that this is because this enables a greater number of neurons to exist, which is obviously advantageous.   However, we could pack in the same amount of 'volume' into a smaller space without any folding, sacrificing that surface area it results in. Why does this lead to fewer neurons? Can neurons only exist near surfaces?  "
2905,"Are the lobes of the brain anatomically distinct, or is the distinction between them not as well-defined?","If I had a brain in front of me, would I be able to find some kind of crevasse or something separately each lobe from the next? I guess what I'm asking is, are lobes more arbitrarily-defined regions of the brain, or is there a definite distinction between them anatomically?   "
2906,"For binary (spike train) signals, take FFT of signal or autocorrelation of signal?","I want to characterize a binary time-series signal x (derived from neuron action potential data) in the frequency domain.   Should I use the FFT of the original signal x, or the power spectrum (FFT of the autocorrelation of x, which is defined as [tex] )?  Also, does anyone know any literature which explicitly talks about this, or at least took sides? "
2907,Distortion of faces presented serially in peripheral vision,"I've kind of already answered this question for myself, but I can't resist sharing it anyway. Please feel welcome to add anything you can in another answer.  Stare at the cross in the middle and try to resist moving your eyes.        What the devil is going on here? Is this proof that They Live? I'm not even wearing sunglasses! Are you? "
2908,What is the most readable screen font?,"Fonts (i.e. letters) that facilitate reading in print don't always read well on a computer screen. New fonts such as Verdana have been developed especially for screen presentation of text.  There is some research that compares the readability of those fonts that are available across most operating systems: Times, Arial, Helvetica and Arial. For example, this study found that Times New Roman can be read faster than Verdana.  But there are thousands of other fonts, and maybe one font not commonly shipped with any OS would be even more easily readable, or at smaller sizes. Of course no empirical research can include all fonts that exist, but maybe there is some research that goes beyond the common websafe fonts.  Have there been attempts to create the most readable screen font that were supported by empirical tests? Or is there empirical research into screen font readability including non-websafe fonts? "
2909,About the left and right side of the brain,"If you are right-handed person, does it mean that you often use left brain (the left part that contain analysis, language etc.)?  If you often use right leg being crossed over left leg, what part of the brain do you use? Maybe left brain? "
2910,Is there any evolutionary theory for self-destructive behavior?,"Self-destructive behavior is usually related to the stress response.  Given that the world is a big source of stress and stress usually is also a source of evolution (since we must adapt to survive), is there any evolutionary theory that explains (or try to explain) the self destructive behavior under stress?  I mean, if the idea is to survive, wouldn't make more sense if, under stress, we could just try harder instead of giving up? "
2911,Do workers retain information from audio lectures when working in a physically demanding job?,"If I were to start listening to lectures instead of music will I retain the information?   I've attempted to do this myself once with Assembly Language but I worked in a loud environment (sand blasting and concrete mixing) so couldn't really hear the  audio most of the time and programming makes for a bad audio book. At my current job it's also loud but the management doesn't care if we use ear plug headphones just don't want to pay the money for them if I wont retain much information.   Anyone have any experience with this or links to studies done?  If it matters I plan to listen to lectures on computer science, quantum physics, psychology, neurology, and medical basics (anatomy, physiology, etc) and maybe various other sciences. "
2912,How do we explain that some humans require far more evidence for some claims than others?,"Tell people that God says something and they believe.  Tell people that the paint is wet and they have to touch to believe.  If I ask people if God really made [website]If I ask people if God really made the bible or send prophets, many will stone me for even asking their sacred beliefs.  Why?  Is fear of authority or instincts to obey the authority, or lack of personal cost of being false makes people easily believe things?  The bible and quran, for example, carries tons of authority and tend to support status quo. People would at least have incentive to pretend they believe. A wet paint doesn't. Or what?  What are the explanations? "
2913,Factors affecting leniency of an evaluator (judge),"I am interested in psychology evidence on determinants of leniency of an evaluator. The evaluator will assess a service that is directly related to them (for example, customer satisfaction, or student's teaching evaluation).  There are some papers on Accounting and Business research (like Moers, 2005) suggesting determinants of biased subjective performance evaluations. But I would be more interested in psychological evidence.   Will older evaluators be more lenient? Will married evaluators be more lenient? I have some feelings that these may be true, but could not find any academic evidence.  Are there any other systematic differences in characteristics of the more lenient evaluators?  "
2914,"Is it assumed that human beings ""think"" the same way? Is there good reason for this assumption?","In this video at 1:43 and at 5:07  [website]Richard Feynman describes the possibility that all humans think very differently during simple processes like counting. And the seeming uniformity is only in external behaviors.  Is there any evidence with regards to this? For example, take a disorder like dyslexia... is it possible that a young child with dyslexia at a very young naturally develops a different way of thinking that achieves the same results so that externally he doesn't appear to have any disorder at all...   I'm curious about research in this regard, as it seems it would be very difficult to test for something like this. "
2915,Does having wrong answers available while studying distract the mind from the correct answer?,"I am studying for a big exam which will include 100 out of the 300 questions I was given as material for the exam. They are the exact questions that will be used on the exam, including answer choices.  While I am reviewing, should I make the incorrect answers available to myself, so that when I am taking the test I see the questions and answers I have been reviewing, or should I make no answers available to myself except the correct answer on the other side of a flash card?  Which is the best way to learn the correct answer? "
2916,Is post traumatic stress disorder preventable?,"Victims of abuse, people exposed to violent situations repeatedly, and people in war zones can develop post traumatic stress disorder as a result. Post traumatic stress disorder is very common and has lifelong effects on affected individuals.   Can people exposed to trauma be treated before ptsd develops? And would this treatment totally prevent post traumatic stress disorder from developing?  "
2917,Grit — is it distinct from correlates of success?,"There's been quite a splash in the field of psychology around the  concept of grit introduced around 2007 (Wikipedia article). For example, the associated TED talk has been viewed more than 10 million times.  Intuitively, the ideas make a lot of sense based on my own experience. While, based on the 1500+ citations in Google Scholar, it's a new idea in the field of psychology too, not just a phenomenon in the realm of public understanding of science.  However, what I don't quite understand is which one of the following two things this development represents:   Either a new shorthand word (""grit"") has been introduced for ""correlates of success"", Or, grit is distinct from correlates of success, and represents a new, standalone, awareness.   Having a new word for an old thing can actually be quite important, as it gives a sort of a visual mnemonic to summarise the major components of the correlates of success. (If someone is ""gritty"", that says more to non-psychologists than saying that the person ""demonstrates traits correlated with success"".)  However, it would be even more important if this wasn't just a linguistic advance, but a conceptual one. But for that, it would be necessary to show that grit is a concept distinct to correlates of success. Well, at least it should be possible in principle to conduct a falsifiable experiment to study the distinction. For example, if under certain circumstances grit could in principle be shown to be significantly negatively correlated with success, consistently, whenever such circumstances arise, that would establish it as a distinct concept.  So, what would be a scenario, under which, hypothetically, grit would be anticorrelated with success? (I can't think of any: in my understanding, whatever is not correlated with success cannot be called ""grit"". Is this the accepted understanding of grit?) "
2918,Denial against truth,"I do not wish to be controversial but this is the only place I feel I can ask the question. This question was asked on the history site but I am now trying to understand the psychological cause and effects of the following:  I was recently shocked to hear about a certain group of people denying the Holocaust, especially on Holocaust day a few weeks ago.  As I was listening to the arguments put forward, it seemed very clear to me that the people arguing totally believed it was a ""hoax"".   I also understand a film has been made about this after a very controversial court case who went all the way to the high court.  Can anyone explain why someone can be in total denial of a fact that can be proven.  Do they live in an alternate consciousness? Is it an illness? Can these people be turned back to see the facts... or dare I say the truth? "
2919,What qualitative studies are there into mindfulness?,"What qualitative studies, e.g. open ended interviews, are there into mindfulness therapy?  I've been skeptical about its use, wondered if it was kinda faddy. But it occurs to me that a lot of despair type emotions may have their root in being unable to relax and enjoy life. Surely meditation is linked with that? "
2920,Why do I perform better at rhythm games after a long period of not playing?,"Every once in a while I decide to play Phase Shift (very similar to Guitar Hero). I might go weeks or months between plays, but when I return, I often break a high score within the first few songs I play, even on songs I've played tens of times before. After about half an hour of play, my skill seems to drop off and I get average to low scores.  To me it appears that practice in the distant past (> 1 week) increases skill, while practice in the immediate past (&lt; 1 hour) decreases skill.  Is there any proposed explanation for this effect? Are there studies that measure it, and if so, what activities were used?  I don't play any musical instruments, so I'm also curious if this happens for real music as well. "
2921,How does the brain generate answers to questions?,"Firstly, I would say that this question is probably beyond current knowledge.  But I would like to hear the latest theories.  Given an input ""Can you name as many animals as you can until I say 'stop'?"" to a human.  If the person giving the question is seen as an authority or someone we want to please (or not displease) then we would decide to comply and answer the question.  Then we would somehow have to convert it into a small program such as the pseudo-code:  DO:   $X = FIND Z WHERE Z IS OF_TYPE ""ANIMAL""   IF CHECK $X IS_TYPE ""ANIMAL"":      SAY $X   IF HEAR ""STOP"" THEN STOP LOOP   But I assume we don't really run programs like this in our brains. So what exactly does happen?   When I do the experiment on myself. I hear these animal names popping into my conscious as if from no-where.   It's as if the simple desire to answer the question together with hearing the question (or perhaps saying it to one's self) is enough to trigger the answers to be recalled from long-term memory.  I don't consciously have to convert the question into any kind of ""brain programming language"". So if my brain is doing this, it's doing it automatically. (And perhaps sometimes wrongly, hence why something not an animal might pop into the brain.)   Do the current theories say that the English sentence itself is the sort of scripting language of the brain or does it translate it into something else (maybe non-linear)? "
2922,Are there universal facial expressions for asking questions?,"""Dog."" ""Dog!"" ""Dog?"" We know the first is a statement. The second a warning maybe. And the third a question.  Like facial expressions for emotions. Are there universal human facial expressions or voice modulations that show when we are asking a question? Or naming something. Or giving a warning. I imagine being able to distinguish these 3 things would be quite important for our ape-like ancestors.  In fact, do we share these with apes? When we try and teach apes words do we use things like pointing and intonation? Can they understand this? "
2923,Voxel wise comparison (Voxel Based Morphometry or VBM) across subjects in fMRI studies,"I am new to fMRI field. In many fMRI studies like This Study a voxel wise comparison is made across subjects and controls . As we know that  dataset in fMRI in the form of 3D matrix like Subjects  x TimePoints  x Voxels   that is on each person we have bunch of time points and on each time points we have voxel values as voxel is unit of measurement in bold signal in the brain that is brain is divided into small cubicle voxels.  My specific question No.1 is that if we have a dataset consisting of 20 control and 15 subjects  with 5000 voxels and 200 time points on all persons then we will have two 3D matrices in following form  For Subjects:   15 x 200 x 5000  For controls:     20 x 200 x 5000  Now how voxel wise comparison would be made between two subjects as these datasets are not balanced in persons or first dimension.  My specific question No.2 is that how regions are compared between those two group like this has been done on page 2(13).   My Understanding  For question No.1 my understanding is that a single matrix is made for each group by reducing the person(subject/control) dimension that is we will have two 200 x500 matrices average over individuals in each matrix and then the voxel wise comparison will be made using t test in any two voxel as each voxel will have 200 time points.  For question No.2 my understanding is that for a typical brain area like ""Right thalamus"" A group of voxel called cluster like 147 as used in the paper is organized and then voxel vectors are formed for both groups averaged over individuals like out of 147 voxel vector a typical voxel vector will have 200 values and that will be compared.  lastly some times the volumes are reported in the specific brain region like ""Right thalamus"" in cc and again my question is that how theses volumes are computed?  So I am totally messed up here and need guidance here in my understanding ? "
2924,Predicting the landing site of a saccade while the saccade is still in progress,"A brief look through the literature didn't reveal any algorithms that have been directly applied to the online prediction of saccade landing sites while a saccade is in progress.  While there would surely be considerable noise in any such estimate, the direction vector, velocity and acceleration profiles should contain sufficient information to make a reasonable guess. Is anyone aware of any papers which have attempted such an approach?  Also, how good an estimate of landing site could be derived, and how early prior to landing could this estimate be made. What methods would be suggested for making such an estimate?  "
2925,How does personality moderate or mediate the relationship between stress and burnout?,My research is on work related stress and burnout amongst healthcare professionals and the role that personality play in either reducing or increasing levels of stress and burnout. I'm using the big five personality factors to research how each of these factors affect the relationship between stress and burnout.    How does personality affect levels of stress in individuals?  Can a person's personality be a mediating or moderating factor?  
2926,How do SSRIs work?,"I've found a reasonable explanation on Wikipedia...     SSRIs are believed to increase the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by inhibiting its reuptake into the presynaptic cell, increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor.   But I'm confused about one thing. The whole point of reuptake is that after serotonin (or any other neurotransmitter) binds to the postsynaptic receptors, it has to vacate the receptor so that other signals can be conveyed. If SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, it remains in the synaptic cleft... but then what happens?  Do the serotonin molecules bind to the receptors multiple times, since they keep on ending up in the synaptic cleft? If so, when would this end, and how would it affect the signal across two neurons? "
2927,"What's the difference between a ""mental disorder"" and a bad personality trait?","Most people are held accountable for their actions. If diagnosed with a ""mental disorder"" however, they are often forgiven/treated more leniently and exempted from punishment.   The same thing couldn't be said about a bad personality trait however. No one is exempted from murder for say ""not being very compassionate"" or ""being an asshole"".  Mental disorders however only seem to be a term of describe a set of bad personality traits that are displayed concurrently though. So why the special treatment?  What's the difference between a mental disorder and a bad personality trait? "
2928,Neural robots vs conventional robots,"My friend is working on a robot that can be mind controlled.   He basically wears a headset, and that headset translate brain signal into control signal to move a robot. [website]What could be the potential advantage of these kind of robots versus robots controlled by remotes (99.99% of all robots nowadays)? "
2929,What does double dissociation really tell us?,"In psychological research, a single dissociation is when a manipulation leaves one cognitive function (say, A) intact whilst severing another (say, B). This indicates the functions A and B are at least partially independent. A double dissociation is when there exists, in addition, a manipulation that does the reverse (i.e. leave B intact whilst severing A). On the Wikipedia page for dissociation in neuropsychology/cognitive neuroscience (I'm assuming the ""manipulation"" is a brain lesion now) it says that ""establishing a single dissociation between two functions provides limited and potentially misleading information, whereas a double dissociation can conclusively demonstrate that the two functions are localized in different areas of the brain."" This can't really be true, can it? Consider the following Venn diagram, where the (necessary) neural substrate of A and B are represented, including their intersection:     A double dissociation could consist of a manipulation in A \ B and another in B \ A. The functions would still be partially dependent, however, and not localized in completely different areas of the brain. So, in effect, the only thing a single dissociation proves is that the circles for A and B are not identical, and the only thing a double dissociation proves (in addition to the fact that they're not identical) is that one is not a subset of the other. Is that about right?  "
2930,Has there been any serious research on subliminal messaging?,"I certainly don't question the existence of subliminal perception which has been demonstrated many times in priming studies like those of Daniel Schacter and many others, nor do I reject the notion of the cognitive unconscious introduced by Kihlstrom (I definitely have my doubts on the psychodynamic unconscious however).  My question is about certain big claims like those of Bryan Wilson Key on subliminal messages with sexual content and consumer behaviour, those about subliminal self-help tapes or those even more suspicious that are about subliminal messages detering shoplifters to steal. Other than null results or junk science I haven't seen any convincing study supporting these claims.  On the other hand, studies by Vockey and Read (1985) challenged the effect of subliminal messages in songs and a meta-analysis carried out by Charles Trappey (1996) showed a negligible effect on consumer behavior. Also, what I get from most psychology textbooks is that the general consensus is that subliminal messaging has a poor and temporary effect (Schacter, Gilbert and Wegner, 2009).  Of course, one has to consider if subliminal perception is qualitatively and quantitatively different depending on the modality of the stimuli but then again I am unconvinced of a considerable effect of subliminal messaging on behaviour.  Any thoughts on that?    References  Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T. &amp; Wegner, D. M. (2009). Psychology. New York, NY: Worth Publishers  Trappey, C. (1996).

2931,How many action potentials from presynaptic neurons would be required to make a postsynaptic neuron fire?,"I am looking for a rough estimation of the number of action potentials from other neurons required to cause a neuron to fire?  I read here that a potential of ~ -55mv must be reached before an action potential is fired in a neuron, my thought is how many action potentials from other cells would (roughly) be required to reach this - and in what required time (if it matters)?  I am not a neuroscientist and suspect this question is unanswerable but though this was the place to ask! "
2932,Are there any fMRI decoding papers examining the relationship between attentional cueing and activity in V1?,"I'm interested in reading on the influence of exogenous attention on cortical representations in early visual areas, but so far my google-fu seems to be failing me.  There seems to be some literature involving endogenous attention (Kamitani &amp; Tong 2006, for instance), but nothing involving cueing, for instance.  Does anybody know of any papers demonstrating either of the following?   fMRI decoding of the effects of attentional cueing on V1? fMRI decoding of (cued) attentional effects on V1 activity using at-threshold stimuli?   Thanks very much in advance!  Edit:  Okay, so I found two that hit the topic center-mass:   Kok et al., 2011  Less Is More: Expectation Sharpens Representations in the Primary Visual Cortex Kok et al., 2012  Attention Reverses the Effect of Prediction in Silencing Sensory Signals   Anything else?

2933,Is there a standard list of Default Answers which are used in Likert 'type' Scales,"I have always had some trouble deciding what to use as the default answers when using Likert 'type' scales.  Is there a default list of accepted answers to particular types of questions which are used by survey designers? e.g. ""Level of effect"", ""Amount you agree with"",  ""Make you act"" ""Level of Awareness"" type questions.  I accept that there is a huge range of types of questions but if there was some sort of semi standardised list of 5, 6 and 7 point answers it would be very handy. In many cases I have difficulty thinking of just one of the answers or the correct terminology or syntax which should be used to ensure that each of the answers are 'appropriately distributed'... if that makes sense  For many types of questions there are existing examples online e.g.     What most clearly reflects your political leaning?          Strong Democrat    Not so strong Democrat    Independent leaning Democrat   Independent    Independent leaning Republican    Not so strong Republican   Strong Republican    Other    Don't know      Or     The county is on the right economic path         Strongly agree    Agree    Neither or N/A    Disagree    Strongly Disagree      However in other instances it is more difficult to figure out what answers should be used     In your opinion, does a perceptible level of bias in a particular news   story affect the overall level of credibility the story has?           Yes, most definitely    Yes, to some degree    Yes, a slight effect    No, ????    No,not really     No, not at all      Any help or links to resources would be seriously appreciated. Thanks "
2934,Why does a neuron choose to connect to another?,"I have been reading about neuron creation, guidance cues and all sorts of highly complex mechanisms used to allow one neuron axon to extend or connect - but to what end?  Why does one neuron end up connecting to another? (instead of all the others) "
2935,Annoyance in animals,"When my dog (an English Cocker Spaniel, for what its worth) is behind some glass (e.g. a glass door or a car window) and someone taps on the glass, even just a little bit, she gets into a fit of rage. She has always been treated quite well, so I can't imagine what causes her to behave like this.  The first thing that came to my mind is that she perceives whoever is tapping the glass as teasing her, and she feels disrespected, or something like that. This sounds far fetched, but could there be any merit to this theory? If not, what else would cause her to do this?  I believe we know that monkeys interpret teasing correctly (I don't know this for a fact). That is, they know when they are being teased and they (correctly) interpret it as being disrespected. Could the same thing be true for less intelligent animals like dogs? "
2936,How do I choose what I think?,"Where do my thoughts come from? What allows me to choose them at all? Regardless of whether free will is an illusion or not, what makes a thought happen? (This is a mix of a philosophical question and a biological one)   "
2937,Do cognitive distortions not exist at all in non-depressed people?,"Cognitive distortions like All-or-nothing thinking, Fortune Teller Error; do they exist in non-depressed people with a low intensity as well or they do not have these things at all? In other way, having cognitive distortions is the root cause of depression or having those distortions with high intensity is actually the root cause of depression? "
2938,"Why am I more ""musically"" creative in the last 30 seconds before falling asleep?","I am a music producer and often my ""best"" pieces always came to my mind shortly before I fell asleep. Sometimes I actually grab a recorder, hum the melody and finish the idea on the very next day.  My question is now: how can this be possible? In a state where my brain is supposed to shut down (and pretty much does) it is literally exploding out of ideas. I also feel a huge increase in euphoria in these very moments but I can't really tell whether this happens before or after I get the idea for a certain sound/melody.  Might it be that my creativity is ""blocked"" all day until my brain finally drops all obstacles which then makes way for my creative flow? Or is it that no new input needs to be processed as I lay in total darkness and silence and therefore new ""material"" to process isn't coming in which leads my brain to ""invent"" something?  This doesn't happen every time but most often when I am very tired and don't need longer than 15 minutes to fall asleep - usually this is a matter of hours for me, hours in which I am not productive at all.  "
2939,Why doesn't the brain get into infinite loops when being queried?,"In computer programming, when algorithms are using loops/recursion without an exit condition, the algorithm will never end or get out of resources.  How does the brain work around getting into endless loops/recursions due to interconnected nets, i.e. when there are circularities in the nets? For example, neuron A activates neuron B which activates C which activates A, and so on. Or are there no circularities in the brain structure? "
2940,"How much our visual limitations are instrument(eye)-based, and how much are they brain-based?","Are the limitations to our vision like the field of view and singular focus entirely based on the limitations of the eye?  It seems like it's possible to feed an artificial signal into the brain through the optic nerve.  What would happen if you fed a 360 video through such interface?  What kinds of differences in experience would this provide, regarding the ability to focus on particular object for example? Seems like moving the eye would not be substantial anymore (no need for optical focusing), which introduces another curious situation on it's own. Would the brain be able to adapt to operate with multiple (mental-visual) focus points in such setting? "
2941,What personality disorders is schema therapy successfully used for?,"Schema therapy is a cognitive therapy based on people developing so-called ""schemas"" (as far as I understand, patterns of cognition and behavior) early in their lives and then using these schemas to their detriment later. Schema therapy is based on identifying these schemas and leading the patient to develop different mechanisms of dealing with these situations. (if any of that is very incorrect, I'd be happy to be corrected)   What personality disorders is this technique successfully used for? Are there any where it is recommended against?  "
2942,Re-arrangement of brain's functions,"In a neuroscience class, I was told that if some part of the brain gets damaged somehow and it's early enough, the functionalities of that part of the brain are rearranged to another part of the brain. This was used to prove that all parts of the brain utilize the same general mechanism.   Now my questions are:   1. How does the brain get assigned these locations initially? Is it genetics? 2. If the functionality is reassigned, won't it affect the place where it is now put?  3. How does the brain decide where to put it? Is the brain self aware?  "
2943,Paradoxical senses of scale: Are they common or is it just me?,"It doesn't happen anymore, but when I was younger I would often get strange sensations regarding scale that I never heard anyone else report.  There were two different flavors. One felt like the room and everything in it were both small and large at the same time. If I were to ask myself, ""Do I feel like I'm small in a small room, or huge in a huge room?"" I would say, ""both, at the same time"".  The other happened only in my mind. Roughly speaking, it was a kind of tactile sensation. It felt like I was sort of... ""handling"" an object, perhaps pencil-shaped, that was skinny and fat at the same time.  It happened most often when I was about to fall asleep, but it sometimes occurred in the middle of the day.  Is this sort of thing known and documented? Is there any sense to be made of it? I tried to search online but had no luck. What would I even search for? "
2944,Is there an emotional equivalent of Somatoparaphrenia?,"I've recently became aware of the Somatoparaphrenia delusion, where a person thinks that a part of their body belongs to someone else. No amount of logic or evidence would persuade that person otherwise. For example:     This is not my leg, this is my fathers leg.   This makes me ask - is there an emotional equivalent of Somatoparaphrenia, where a person pathologically projects some emotions into others and is unable to realize it is their own emotion?  I'm aware of disorders like Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which has a tendency of projecting negative feelings into the world. But are there more severe cases? "
2945,How to import images used to analysis in SPM to FreeSurfer,"FreeSurfer uses the recon-all command to semi-automatically generate its statistics. This tool implies a certain directory structure in which the files with the images for the samples should be organized into. In FreeSurfer tutorial they call this specific directory structure the FSFAST structure.  I need to analyse images that were previously worked on in SPM, and it has the following directory structure for the patients:  /experiment/patients/A.o/   and for controls:  /experiment/controls/A.o/   Within each directory there are .hdr, .img, .mat and .mask files for each observation, which was obtained in two different times. So the naming of the files have the following order:   experiment_subjectnumber_time1.img   and for the second acquisition reads:  experiment_subjectnumber_time2.img   The same with all the before mentioned extensions (hdr, mat, mask).  It seems that in the FreeSurfer workflow the command unpacksdcmdir is used to extract data from the nii and dicon types and organize them in the FSFAST structure. Can it be used on directory structures like the one I have? "
2946,Can our auditory perception be used to trick our visual perception?,"""Our consciousness lags 80 milliseconds behind actual events...The 80-millisecond rule plays all sorts of perceptual tricks on us. As long as a hand-clapper is less than 30 meters away, you hear and see the clap happen together. But beyond this distance, the sound arrives more than 80 milliseconds later than the light, and the brain no longer matches sight and sound. What is weird is that the transition is abrupt: by taking a single step away from you, the hand-clapper goes from in sync to out of sync."" source  This made me curious - say we have the following experiment based on the above:   A subject (listening subject) wears headphones synchronized with the hand-clapper the hand-clapper starts from 5 meters away and slowly moves to 60 meters away  during this time, the listening subject would hear a clapping sound as they would naturally hear the sound based on the distance of the hand-clapper    If, once the hand-clapper reaches 60 meters, the audio is tweaked such that the listening subject would hear the hand-clapping sound as if the hand-clapper were only 5 meters away:      Would your typical listening subject visually perceive the   hand-clapper as having suddenly moved closer (similar to the concept of how we perceive the moon as being ""larger"" when it's closer   to the horizon)?      In other words -- under what circumstances, if any, can sound influence   our visual perception of depth/proximity?  "
2947,Finding consciousness through EEG,"I've read an article about the consciousness in vegetative patients. Adrian Owen is one of the neuroscientist making research on this field. The article published on ""Le scienze"" was about the usage of fMRI before and EEG later, to check the presence of a consciousness.  Do you know of similar group of research in Italy?  Is their work consolidated enough to be applied in the clinical practice by another neurologist? "
2948,Difference between forms of Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT) scale 3,"I would really like to know what are the differences between the form A and form B of Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test scale 3?  To my knowledge (reading the ""methods"" section in the scientific literature) they seem to have the same number of problems and subsets. Do they differ in the time allowed to solve them?  Sometimes the researchers use both forms together (A+B) sometimes they only use one. Why? Less administration time?  Or are they alternative versions which exist to be able to test the subjects twice? Are there reasons to prefer one over the other (MENSA only uses form A)? "
2949,Reconciling one-dimensional valence with distinct mechanisms for reward/punishment,"It is a widespread notion in psychology that there are two dimensions to emotion: valence (aversiveness or attractiveness of some entity) and intensity. However, recent experimental studies in neuropsychology (e.g. those listed below) have given strong evidence for two distinct pathways which process reward and punishment associated with some input. This in turn compellingly suggests that valence is in fact made up of two independent dimensions, and I'm guessing there are behavioral studies reaching similar conclusions (i.e. that persons are able to have ""mixed feelings""). How do we reconcile these views? Are we forced to reject one-dimensional valence on the basis of the evidence?  Distinct pathways for reward/punishment:   Paton, Joseph J., and Kenway Louie.

2950,How to interpret a BBC news article on the effect of race on intelligence?,"   In spring 1998, Robert Plomin claimed to have discovered a gene linked with intelligence. More recently, the Human Genome Project was cautious when approaching areas implying racial differences since research actually shows greater genetic differences within races than between races. However, not all individuals are endowed with the same intelligence and many believe this must have something to do with our genes and the way they interact with the environment. Identical twins are more likely to obtain the same score in an IQ test than twins from two separate eggs that have a different genetic make- up.      It is important to remember that genes work by interacting with the environment, so social factors will also infl uence intelligence. Intelligence tests may be more of an assessment of social factors, such as your educational background. Black children adopted into white middle-class families score signifi cantly higher on average than those in working-class families – implying a cultural slant to tests.   My classmate thinks that this article suggests that race is suggested as determining intelligence, because race is mentioned several times in the article as being linked to intelligence, whether genetically or through social factors.   I want to check this before confronting her, but I think not. Who's right?   In my view, the first bolded sentence dismisses race as a determinant, because there are 'greater  genetic differences within' each race than between different races.   The second bolded sentence also rejects race, because it only shows a cultural slant to tests and the first sentence of the last para states 'social factors will also infl uence intelligence.'

2951,Is there a name for having an obsessive interest in new topics for short periods of time?,"I have the tendency to get obsessively interested in a subject for 2 weeks, get bored, and then move on to something else.  For instance I have just started learning about chess and find myself extremely interested in it at the moment but know it will most likely pass soon.  In the last year I have looked at window farms, cooking, entrepreneurship (I started a muse business), tea, classic books (such as huckleberry Finn and Waldon), graphic novels... you get the idea!    The point is that most the time I do not find myself repeating the same topics again or express much interest towards them.  It might be more that I enjoy learning the topics but not going in depth.  I was wondering, is there a name for this tendency?  Is this a trait found more often in men than women?  I don't really find it a problem, if anything it is beneficial because it pushes me to learn new things.  But nonetheless I am curious if there is a name for this behaviour. "
2952,Evolutionary motivation for the existence of pleasure?,"It seems like pleasure goes beyond needs. What is its purpose? Is it supposed to make you not do anything, because of how good you feel? Are there animals that don't feel pleasure, but only have needs to satisfy, and how would their CNS differ from human/primate CNS?  My main question: What is the motivation for there being some sort of pleasure, as opposed to simply the absence of a certain need? In the case of an orgasm, why exactly does a person feel very good for a while - why doesn't he just go directly into a state of neutrality, with there no longer being a need for sex? If a person defecates, why is there a momentary pleasant feeling - why doesn't the person simply go into a 'no longer have the need to defecate' state?  It really seems that there is an unnecessarily large amount of pleasure, as opposed to a mere lack of need.  It seems like there are 2 mechanisms that motivate action - the need to satisfy an unfulfilled need, and the need to achieve a reward. Is this the case? If yes, what is useful about this? It seems like a the 'need to satisfy an unfulfilled need' by itself should be good enough.  EDIT:  For example, we have an instinctive need to not feel like starving, or to not feel extremely tired - we simply don't want to feel that way. However with some things, it seems like there's more than just a need - with sex, there is a 'need' to have sex - a male who hasn't had sex for long enough, will simply want to have sex, so that he gets rid of the feeling of wanting sex - but there is also the motivation of expected pleasure from the orgasm. Similarly, I'd say that there is some sort of pleasure from food.  I think this is true (that there are 2 motivating factors, not just one), and I think that it's quite weird in some sense. Why isn't there just a need - why doesn't a male after sex simply stop having the need to have sex? I think I've read something about the pleasure having something to do with encouraging certain types of behavior, but I really don't know. "
2953,The psychology of nymphomania,"So this is a question that requires maturity and discretion.  I present it as an authentic point of research for a class I am taking.  I understand the basic principles of mania, psychomania, and manic episodes.  However one thing that pops into question are possible explanations for nymphomania.  To the scientific community I ask:   Is the condition of nymphomania coupled as a symptom of mania?   Or is it some kind of hormonal/biochemical imbalance that presents itself as it's own issue?   Or is it just some addiction to the hormones released via copulation?   I am not referring to women or men with high sex drive, clearly nymphomania is in it's own class.  I personally have postulated to my class that it is something that is coupled together with mania, or as a symptom of bipolar/mood disorder in patients that are not well controlled on their medications.  My professor then instructed me to post it up here to gather knowledge and present it to my class at some point.  Any thoughts and/or opinions must be clean and professional, any nasty/vulgar language will be reported. "
2954,Why do we wake up when we die in our dreams?,"A lot of people had some experience with dying in their dreams. They all confirm they remember the whole story until the precise moment of death and it is the death itself what woke them up - not being nervous, scared or shocked (I remember myself dying peacefully in bed in one of my dreams, no fighting or falling involved).  I have never met anyone who continued dreaming after dying - although some religious people should be deeply convinced that the death is not the end of their story. It also quite a common plot of novels or movies: the main character dies and appears in some kind of ""afterworld"" - I have never met anyone with this experience, though.  Is it caused by the fact that our brain just does not know what happens next when it is all over?  Or is the moment of death such a ""low-level"" shock for our minds, that it just ""reboots""? "
2955,Does the brain have a 'debugging mode'?,"In computer programming we have a debugger that we can use to execute a program step by step. In that mode, the program can be suspended and we can analyze the state of the hardware, modify the state and control the flow of the program to experiment.  Now, the question: Does the brain have something similar? Like a ""debugger mode"" in which it can reflect about or analyze its internal structures? I think this is the mode that therapists use to analyze behavior, isn't it? "
2956,Discovery of “Functions of Brain”,"As far as I know, Physical Experimentation of Human Brain is not possible. So how does people come up with the idea that different parts of brain is associated with different specific functions? and Who found it?  Example:   Cerebrum for memory, speech etc.. Cerebellum for motor, sensory etc..  "
2957,Any ideas about the neural mechanism underlying the ASMR sensation?,"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is described as a pleasurable, tingly sensation in the (back of the) head. The sensation can be triggered by a vast variety of stimuli (auditory, visual, olfactory etc) but seems dependent on attention. It seems not everyone can get this sensation and among those people that do, stimuli that trigger the sensation vary considerably. See also: [website]But what could be the physical origin of this sensation? And how come only a select group of people seem able to experience it? In [website]Does anyone know more about this phenomenon, or have another theory about the mechanism behind it? "
2958,"Does sleep = consciousness, unconsciousness or something else?","Among the various definitions of the word consciousness is awareness, with wakefulness a general synonym.  If someone hits you over the head, knocking you unconsciousness (though still alive), then you're said to be unconscious. But are you also considered to be unconscious when you're sleeping?  One of the key differences (for me) is that a sleeping person can typically react to an alarm clock, whereas a person who has been rendered unconscious through an injury is effectively dead to the world.  If sleep is NOT a form of unconsciousness, what is it? Is a sleeping person still conscious, or is there another term to describe it? "
2959,Is there terminology for perceptual illusions at the moment that figure-ground reversal occurs?,"I'm looking for a term in the perception / cognition area of research.    I recently saw this visual illusion that 'flips' what is negative-space and what is positive-space.  This is known in the arts as ""figure-ground reversal""  I am looking for a word / term that addresses when the thing we are observing changes, such that the parts that signify the 'figure' and 'ground' are themselves switched.  Is there a word for this?  Does Ecological Psychology have a way that it organizes such stimuli?    I would think there may be a term that address when our perception 'flips' the perception of a static image, and afterward we are biased to perceive the 'ground' differently.  This happens when we see a vase instead of faces.    But I don't know that word, nor do I know if it applies to the occurrence of when a thing/image/perceptual-field changes, in order to action the figure-ground reversal.   "
2960,Research on Distribution of Enneagram Types in a Given Profession,"I was in a conversation with an Enneagram scholar who claimed that certain Enneagram types are more likely to hold certain specific positions or have certain professions.   Is there any data or has there been any research published that has studied the Enneagram type distribution of fields or titles thought to be Enneagram-type-personality-specific?   Examples:   If we were to give the Enneagram test to ten-thousand nurses, would we find that a statistically significant number of them are Twos?  If we were to give the Enneagram test to ten-thousand career scientists, would we find that a statistically significant number of them are Fives? "
2961,Do psychiatrists have educational requirements other than an MD?,"Most pre-medical students take psychology, biology, chemistry or something science-related, in addition to the classes needed as prerequisites for medical school, for their undergraduate degree or even for a master's, but is there any particular degree besides an MD that someone who wants to be a psychiatrist needs to take?  For example, is a business, philosophy, english or political science major who has taken the required classes of medical school who later finishes medical school eligible to train to become a psychiatrist? I'm curious as to how such a person would get the psychology-related training and knowledge. Is it in the training after medical school? Is it related to medical school electives? "
2962,What is the name of the phobia of dams?,"I have a friend who has a terrible fear of dams, water reservoirs, jetties or bridges with big blocks on water; in general, a fear of large buildings on water.  He often tells me that he imagines a dam near the gates and has ""anxiety attacks"" and becomes very afraid. However, he is not afraid of swimming, or common places with water, like the ocean, pools and so on. On the contrary, he loves to swim.  While he is not afraid of pools, he is very afraid of the wells of the pools where the water enters or where is filtered.     His psychologist doesn't know the name of such a phobia and, after a while, his diagnosis was hydrophobia. The problem is that he is not afraid of water, only these large structures over the water, whose purpose is to control water flow.  How can I get information about this phobia; is there a specific name? And how can be treated? "
2963,What if he hates me for telling?,Why do people sometimes not understand that there are other ways of dealing with depression? I have done everything I know that I can do for this person. I've helped a few of my friends stop their cutting and stuff and I love listening and helping them and helping them figure out other soulutions for dealing with their emotions but I'm having trouble with this one  Do you think I should tell my friend's parents now?  
2964,"What is definition of ""excessive correlation"" is Michael Persinger using?","I'm trying to parse the significance of Michael Persinger's work. From what I can understand, he uses toroids to create magnetic fields which can change the PH of spring water and change photon emission in brain tissue. He then applies this to two human brains separated by great distances.  Are his results significant? If so, what predictions are they making? All I can make out from these papers is that when brains are exposed to similar to conditions they exhibit similar brain waves. Why don't they compare to a baseline of those not exposed to these magnetic signals? And why do they only show the correlation between paired individuals, instead of showing correlation between paired and non-paired individuals? "
2965,Where can I find good references about the neuronal connections in various areas in the cortex?,"As an example, I would like to know which Brodmann areas innervate the layer IV of area 10 in the brain.  To which degree are these connections known? What are good books or other kinds of resources that provide information about this, perhaps in a tabular form? "
2966,What correlation is there between breath control and personal self confidence?,"In yoga, the instructor mentioned that controlled deep breathing can increase self-confidence. (Next time, I will ask him why he believes that but I doubt he has any references...)   Furthermore, there are certain times when I do notice increased levels of self confidence after controlled deep breathing.  Note: This is different than using deep breathing to prevent or calm down from a panic or anxiety attack.   The scope of the question is focused on a natural baseline level of confidence, increased via controlled deep breathing.  Some reference in general turned up as well:     For example, controlled breathing can be used to increase   self-confidence,...   [website]Are there any studies that prove this and if so, why? Any point in the right direction is greatly appreciated. Thank you. "
2967,Why different responses to target and distractor in three-stimulus oddball procedure?,"In the three-stimulus oddball procedure, there is an infrequent target in a background of frequently occurring standard stimuli and infrequently occurring distracter stimuli. My question is, since the target and the distracter are both infrequent, how do we make the difference between them? Why do we expect different responses to them? Since I am not allowed to answer my question I post here: I assume that the difference is done in the instruction done to the participant. "
2968,Do eyes accommodate to color?,"I've heard that our eyes accommodate between colors too far from each other in the visible spectrum. I imagine it's not a true focal point accommodation, but rather linked with how brain processes the information. Is this true?  What I'm trying to find out is, whether using color for emphasis, for example both blue and yellow (which are fairly far from each other in the spectrum), for text underlining, doesn't make the brain focus only at one color at once.   Like when you're looking for some object on your messy table, thinking it's of blue color and not noticing it's right in front of your eyes, because it was red.  Another example would be a document with some emphasized words in blue, some in yellow - and let's say the author wanted to make sure both colors are regarded as important (just in different context). Now question is, can the eye/brain focus on both colors at once? I don't mean if we can do it deliberately by trying hard, but rather if it's more likely for the brain to focus only at one color at a time, unconsciously.  By what I've heard, if I understand it correctly. If we want to use two different colors for emphasis, we should use colors that are close to each other in the EM spectrum (while still making sure, they are high contrast in regard to the background)  Refer to the two paragraphs taken from wikipedia I stylized.  I'd summarize the question like this. Is there difference in how we regard those two paragraphs? Are we more likely to skip some words when they are highlighted with colors too far away from each other in the EM spectrum, therefore, is it better to use colors closer to each other?  EDIT: I changed the luminance of the colors to be the same for all of them (70%, used HSL Color Picker). As pointed by John, the different luminance might have played a part in the perception.

2969,How much can users hold in their short term memory,"I recently undertook a questionnaire and was asked a question about short term memory. One that I just can't find an answer to at all as it seems to be so contradictory.   This got me curious. How much can a user generally remember when viewing a website? There are various research papers on this including Heyer and Barrett (1974) and Shulman (1970).  The question was:  Research has shown that short-term memory is fragile. Which of the statements below is more accurate in describing how much information we can remember and for how long?   The amount you can remember is equal to about what you can say in 20 seconds, you will be able to hold this remembered amount in short-term memory for about 40 seconds.  The amount you can remember is equal to about what you can say in 30 seconds, you will be able to hold this remembered amount in short-term memory for about 20 seconds.  The amount you can remember is equal to about what you can say in 20 seconds, you will be able to hold this remembered amount in short-term memory for about 10 seconds.  The amount you can remember is equal to about what you can say in 20 seconds, you will be able to hold this remembered amount in short-term memory for about 20 seconds.    Does anybody know the definitive answer to this or, like me,  "
2970,Psychometric scale with items in sets where responses imply a rank order of items,"My question is related to psychometry. One survey is measured in this way:  Question 1 Claim 1     0 1 2 3 4 5 M Claim 2     0 1 2 3 4 5 M Claim 3     0 1 2 3 4 5 M Claim 4     0 1 2 3 4 5 M   There are 25 questions of this kind. Participants should choose one '0' and one 'M' and one number for every of the claims, but numbers shouldn't be the same. Results are 2 independent factors, which  combined produce 4 types in profile. The theory is that those factors are independent.  My questions are:   Is there any literature which will explain this type of measurement? How to measure alphas for this questionnaire or conduct factor analysis Is there a way to see/count Pearson coefficients (or any other type of correlation)  for this survey and some other which are measured in traditional way with Likert scale?   Edit: ie.   Question1: I am calm and organized      0 1 2 3 4 5 M (My options are all of them, i choose 0) I like to go to Gardaland    X 1 2 3 4 5 M (My options are all except 0, i choose 5) Everyone is paranoic         X 1 2 3 4 X M (My options are 1, 2 3 4 and M, i choose 3) My mother was a good person  X 1 2 X 4 X M (My option is M because 0 and M are mandatory)   after that there is question 2 to question 25 which follow the same format.

2971,How can schemas be applied to website design?,"If a ""schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information. Schemas can be useful because they allow us to take shortcuts in interpreting the vast amount of information that is available in our environment."" then how can we best apply this to user experience design for websites?   Specifically I'm after the answer to the following question, but that's not to say that my question about how schemes can be applied to website design in general is still not pertinent.   Which of the following statements regarding schema is true?   When two neurons have activated the connections between them are momentarily interrupted Approximately 10 million neurons in the human brain are used to store information Some nodes and links are so strong that they can be retrieved as a unit Memories that are reconstructed incorrectly are called schema  "
2972,Are there neurological conditions that can be worsened by B group vitamins?,"I know that vitamins B6 and B12 are very important for the brain function, and both are involved in metabolism of homocysteine. Buildup of homocysteine has been associated with cognitive impairment. There may be dozens of other metabolic pathways that use these vitamins.  I'm interested if there are any medical/psychiatric conditions for which B vitamin supplementation is actually harmful or not advised? could such supplementation overload/deplete the intrinsic factors for these vitamins, making them temporarily unavailable to the brain?

2973,"How well can a human-generated ""random number"" be predicted?","For example, if i ask an individual to write a 20-number-long sequence of random numbers from 0 to 10. How well can I predict the 20th number from the initial 19?  More generally,    How well can subsequent numbers in a sequence be predicted from previous numbers? How well can humans generate random sequences of numbers?  "
2974,Prevalence of mental health problems in medical professionals caused by exposure to death?,"Some medical professionals work in areas where they are exposed to death often (say, E.R, O.R, Cancer Treatment, etc.), specifically in an area where they bond with the patient and the patients' families over a long period of time, such as cancer treatment.    Does such exposure sometimes cause psycopathic/sociopathic behavior, shizophrenia, apathy, and other mental and emotional scarring? Does such exposure cause changes to thoughts on death significantly? In an attempt to numb this pain, would the subjects be more likely to believe excessively and obsessively in religion and the afterlife? (Please don't take offense if you are religious.)   Of course I'm not saying that all subjects in this situation would display these symptoms, but depending on pre-existing conditions I wonder whether some are more susceptible to emotional trauma than others.  "
2975,How are Raven's Matrices scores converted into age adjusted IQ?,"There are IQ tests based only on Raven's matrices. I wonder how a raw score on such a test  ""scaled"" to an IQ result. As we all know, IQ results depend on the age of individual tested. So I was looking for any data about IQ results and standard deviations in diffrent age groups and I didn't find anything except truisms. But there must be a table with multipliers for every age group, by which a raw test score is multiplied to evaluate the IQ result.   How are raw Raven's scores converted into age adjusted IQ? Where can one find age norms for Raven's?  "
2976,What is the mechanism behind unihemispheric sleep in animals?,"It is known that dolphins have the ability to sleep with only one half of their brain at a time.  According to this popular science source:     Dolphins sleep by resting one half of their brain at a time. This is called unihemispheric sleep. The brain waves of captive dolphins that are sleeping show that one side of the dolphin's brain ""awake"" while the other in a deep sleep (""slow-wave sleep""). Also, during this time, one eye is open (the eye opposite the sleeping half of the brain) while the other is closed.    Given that the dolphin probably depends on bilateral brainstem mechanisms for respiration, my assumption is that this ""shutting down"" mainly involves the cortex.     Is this true, or are areas like the thalamus also suppressed unilaterally? How is this ""switching"" (from hemisphere to hemisphere) managed?  Is it accomplished at the level of the thalamus, or within the brainstem? Were a dolphin to be dominant in one hemisphere (surely Flipper was ""right-finned""?), how is the representation of the dominant side of the body managed when the opposite cortex is suppressed?  "
2977,"What is the null hypothesis, when there is no research hypothesis?","(a) Apples grow to different sizes, from small to average and large. Farmers want large apples.  (b) There is this rare bug, the apple bark bug, which lives in the bark of apple trees. Due to its rarity, the apple bark bug is not well understood.  (c) Agronomists are divided about the effect the apple bark bug has on the size of apples. Some believe that apples from trees that have been infested with colonies of this bug are smaller than on trees without such an infestation; others believe that in fact they are larger.  The ministry for agriculture has commissioned a study on the effects of the apple bark bug on apple size. Based on the results of this study they want to either exterminate the apple bark bug, ignore it, or cultivate it. There is no scientific literature on the matter, there is no reliable data, and the research institute commissioned with this study now wonders:  What should be the null hypothesis?  As natural scientists they know they cannot present their limited observations as general fact, but only falsify a hypothesis. But what should it be?  The third semester student apprentice from the nearby university, who has just finished a course in the theory of measurement, suggests:  H0 : Applebug = Appleno bug  H1 : Applebug ≠ Appleno bug  His friend, who has heard the same lecture, rolls her eyes and suggests:  H0 : Applebug ≤ Appleno bug  H1 : Applebug > Appleno bug  The research group leader smiles and compliments them on their attentiveness.  What does he suggest?  This is, of course, an example, illustrating a question relating to psychological research: How do we define the null hypothesis, if we have no presupposition about the effects of an intervention? "
2978,Are there useful applications for three channel consumer EEG?,"I stumbled upon the consumer EEG Melon (at Kickstarter). It has three electrodes and is advertised as measuring how ""focused"" you are. In the FAQ it says:     The Melon headband has three electrodes. Our primary electrode is on the forehead region known as FP1, where Melon can monitor brainwave activity from the prefrontal cortex.   I wonder: What can I measure with such an EEG? What applications would be unlikely?   How can ""focus"" be quantified? Would it be possible to identify (different) states of sleep? Could it be possible to control a cursor/game (left/right movements)?  "
2979,How to create a course that will give you synesthesia?,"I'm thinking of creating a Memrise course that will include numbers and letters with corresponding colors, personality and sounds with aim of trying to develop some synesthesia in myself and anyone who's interested.  Is it possible to induce synesthesia by doing such a course?  If so, how can it best be done:   Should I use sound, light spectrum, some other gradients, pick by random or look up some statistics in order to color the numbers? Should composite numbers include colors of their factors or digits? Should letters be colored as they appear in the alphabet or by it's frequency in the language? Are there some other ways?  "
2980,How many samples are there when test subjects come through different recruitment strategies?,"Let's assume I want to conduct a survey. To find test subjects, I post an ad in a local newspaper, one on a locally relevant website, distribute flyers in front of the train station, and have managed to get one complete class from a local school to partake.  Due to the different recruitment methods, each will probably have drawn quite different samples from the population: the local newspaper is mostly read by older people with medium to high education; the institute website is mostly visited by students and researchers; the flyer is given to commuters; then there is that group of pupils, all of the same age and education level.  In my test, I ask my test subjects to specify how they knew of the test:   ad in newspaper ad on website flyer they were tested in class   So I can group my data according to the recruitment method, if I want to.  Is this all one sample? Or have I drawn four samples?  And if this is one sample, how then do you draw two or more samples? "
2981,Do we need a pre-test to compare the effectiveness of two treatments?,"Assume, I want to evaluate how effective two teachers are in teaching English to German children. Both teachers have been teaching at the same high school for twenty years, and both use a distinctly different pedagogical methodology. In fact a small competition has arisen between them: they have published and discussed their ideas and practise in journals relevant to their profession, and they have now called in a data analyst (you) to conduct this evaluation which, so they hope, will decide their contest and reconcile the former friends.  The school, where they both work, is the only school for its small town. When pupils enter this school, they are randomly assigned classes: one half of the children are assigned to one class (and one maths teacher), the other half to the other class (and the other maths teacher).  The two teachers are tired of not knowing which method is best. In the interest of their pupils they want to finally decide on the better one and both use this from now on. They hope, that you don't need to test one cohort of children when they finish elementary school, have them taught for the 8 years from 5th grade until they graduate from high school, and then measure their mathematical ability again, to come to a conclusion. Therefore they ask you:  Is it enough to compare the levels of the dependent variable post-intervention? Or do you need to measure it pre-intervention as well? Why? "
2982,What makes someone attractive psychologically?," What makes a person particularly attractive to another person, specifically the opposite sex?  Why would the brain evolve this trait to target specific genes (that make someone look pretty), and exclude others (that make someone look ugly)?   This seems to differ from the accepted idea that ancient female humans were attracted to stronger, more able bodied men due to survival instinct. Facial features seem to have nothing to do with survival or natural selection.   So, why are facial features significant to assessing beauty? Also, how does the brain process physical features as good or bad?  "
2983,"Are there any legitimate, and reasonable circumstances, where self-delusion is acceptable and/or required?","Can anyone point out a situation, based in real world events, or an entirely hypothetical situation, where it would be ok/right for someone to delude themselves into believing something false?  For instance, the psychosomatic effect of placebos can lead to people actually feeling better, and in some cases, actually recovering from illness. However, reliance on the placebo effect to cure people is not good medicine, and is even malpractice. Saying crystal therapy will cure someones cancer may make them feel more confident, lowering the mental and physical stress they feel, thereby increasing their bodies ability to fight the tumor/s. However, again, the placebo effect decreasing their stress levels may not be enough to effectively combat the cancer, ad so it would be wrong of a doctor to not ensure they clearly drive home the fact that their patient should not rely on the ""alternative treatment"".     Is there any valid situation anyone can think of where it's perfectly acceptable, or even necessary for people to delude themselves into believing a falsehood? I am not solely looking for examples that are related to physical health by the way. "
2984,Universal Mind? Nature or Nurture?,"I have been reading a book entitled ""The Geography of Thought"" by Richard Nisbett. He talks about how easterners and westerners think differently. I am not all the way through it, but I agree with a lot of his points, because he stresses no true biological differences between the two groups but instead suggests that the difference in cognitive processes takes place over time as a result of cultural factors or ""nurture"" rather than ""nature."" I am reading this book as a part of a class I am taking entitled ""perspectives on knowledge"".   To accompany this book, we are watching a video series entitled ""Brain Sex"" which talks about the effects of hormones on the developing brain and supports the hypotheses that Males and Females have different cognitive processes. (More specifically male and female BRAINS, as you can have a male brain in a female body or have a brain that is actually more like a hybrid between the two due to hormonal abnormalities) This would be a difference of nature that is accentuated through out life through nurture.  The problem is that this video series is a VHS and is over 20 years old.   I am wondering what science's view is on the universality of mind is today. My question can actually be summed up by a question my professor asked us to think about in class:    ""Do different people think differently, or is the mind universal. If people think differently, is this difference due primarily to nature or nurture?""  EDIT:  I have been developing my argument and I am going to defend my long term belief that people think differently, but after much thought I am torn as to where the primary cause for this difference could lie.   Here is the first half of my argument which sets up the first major premise, which is that people think differently:   The physiology of our brain can be mapped directly to our psychological “mind” regardless of the absence of a proven causal relationship.  Our brains undergo a large amount of physiological change throughout life due to  their plastic nature People think differently as a result.   Premise 4 is where I am torn.  Both cultural factors and physical ones have a huge effect on our brains. non-physical cultural factors and physical ones, like hormones, both effect the way our brains are wired.   The amount of cultural priming throughout our life heavily outweighs our physical priming, but our physical priming takes place earlier in life, even pre-birth. presumably to me, this would make it a primary factor, because of a compound effect, making these developments more significant.  but I have no evidence to support either view point, so i'm looking for actual references that I can look at that address the significance of these factors as well as critiques of my argument in case I am operating off of some fallacy I am unaware of because of my limited perspective here.   I understand this question is subjective. I am honestly just looking for references related to my argument because it can be hard me to find good scientific references.... but the opinions of others would be awesome as well! Thank you in advance!  UPDATE  I just stumbled across this again, and I actually wrote a paper on the matter which specifically answers the question. You can read it here.   My conclusion is that the mind is not universal and nature is the primary cause. My explanation is somewhat nuanced, but very strictly logical in nature and I trace out the premises in the first page.  "
2985,"What is the source and real meaning of ""provisional living "" concept and is there an equivalent term?","I found in this blog post the following definition :     Psychologists have a concept they call “provisional living.” That’s   the insistence, so often heard from people whose lives are stuck on a   dysfunctional merry-go-round of self-inflicted crisis, that everything   they don’t like about their lives will change just as soon as   something else happens: as soon as they lose twenty pounds, get a   divorce, quit their lousy job, or what have you. Of course the weight   never goes away, the divorce papers never get filed, and so on,   because the point of the exercise is to allow daydreams of an   imaginary life in which they get everything they think they want take   the place of the hard work and hard choices inseparable from personal   change in the real world.   Searching on the web or in Google Books I didn't find a definition of provisional living.  I found on a blog a similar definition as the above in this blog post:     Psychologists sometimes call this ‘provisional living’, whereby you   tell yourself that you’ll truly come alive, truly be fulfilled and   optimally creative when you’ve moved, married, divorced, retired or   whatever. So much of our culture is based on it, it’s hard to resist.   When the mortgage is paid then you’ll really be free, when you move to   the country, when you no longer have to earn a living, when, when,   when…and then of course you die.   I found a reference of provisional living linking it with the passage ritual also in the book Close Relationships : Family, Friendship, Marriage Studies in Jungian Psychology By Jungian Analysts by Bertine, Eleanor:     To overcome the father and the mother is to take up the   responsibilities of adulthood, to sacrifice provisional living. Then   life will surely become harder and more problematic, but potentially   more meaningful. It is a momentous step, so much so that primitive   peoples, who are close to the unconscious and its eternal laws,   celebrate the transition by the always serious and sometimes rather   grim rites of initiation.   I was not able to find a definition in a psychology dictionary or anywhere.   What is the source of this concept? Is it used in psychology and is there a equivalent term that is more used?  "
2986,What is the concept that schema is opposed to,"From [website]  In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or   schemas) describes an organized pattern of thought or behavior that   organizes categories of information and the relationships among   them.[1] It can also be described as a mental structure of   preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world,   or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.[2] Schemata   influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are   more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while   re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or   distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged,   even in the face of contradictory information. Schemata can help in   understanding the world and the rapidly changing environment.[3]   People can organize new perceptions into schemata quickly as most   situations do not require complex thought when using schema, since   automatic thought is all that is required. [3]      People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a   framework for future understanding. Examples of schemata include   academic rubrics, social schemas, stereotypes, social roles, scripts,   worldviews, and archetypes. In Piaget's theory of development,   children adopt a series of schemata to understand the world.   I wonder what the opposite concept to schema?  Btw, I guess the schema in database theory is related to the one in psychology. How is it related, if any?  thanks. "
2987,About the Turing test and a Robot's psychology,"If an A.I. system ( 'housed' in a Robotic exterior) actually passed the Turing test and was therefore 'functionally similar to the human 'mind-brain' would it also have the potential for information processing instability analogous to 'mental' problems in the mind-brain. ( Where the instabilities are not just because of information or important-definitions mismanagement but are also from info.-processing mismanagement.) Could one A.I system test another with the Turing Test and regard the other as an 'unstable', human , if the responses were sufficiently 'unstable' sounding? Could an A.I. system pretend through the Turing Test to be 'stupid' to another A.I. system? "
2988,"Is the mind's adaptation to increased traveling speeds, physical or psychological?","When a motor vehicle increases in speed, we soon adjust to the faster pace of movement; seemingly by processing incoming information faster.  Is this purely psychological, with the brain ""dropping"" peripheral information to catch up with the flow of new information? Or does the brain actually put more physical energy (kilojoules) into the task, like muscles using more energy during exercise?  Or put another away - do we simply think we are processing more information or are we actually doing so?  I imagine this distinction would be relevant for fighter pilots and competitive racers. "
2989,"Does the brain burn more calories when ""thinking quickly""?","If a person intentionally ""thinks quickly"" would this affect how much glucose the brain consumes? Or would it not be very significant? "
2990,How cognitive science explain the stylistic convention in text writing?,"Some researchers and writers published books about this topic: how the psychology influence the taste of the readers.  It's very intuitive that the word choice matters when we want to be persuasive, capture the listener's attention or simply avoid to hurt him. The importance of the presentation is clear to the human kind since thousand of years, but only with the psychological studies we have clearer some influences of a speech which are counterintuitive.  To better clarify the topic: trying to help someone may hurt his self-esteem if he interpret our attempt like a statement of superiority.   Now I was looking at this revision, which I put also here for easyness: [website]The last part which was deleted contained an opinion which was slightly critical. Another user deleted it. We may some reasons to agree with his behavior but this is the point. Why do we agree on his revision? Why human being living in different countries developed the same beliefs about focusing the discussion on xxx and rejecting yyy.  Pscychology somehow teached us that beliefs are not absolute as everyone would think of his one. So, if every convention was caused by something. The convention related to the definition of rethoric and dialectic should be deep into the human brain structure.  NLP is not a science, however are there serious books to study about communication seen in a scientific way?   Why are that kind of sentences (the one expressing polemical opinions) rejected by most of people? "

2992,Brain after (electrical) blackout,"I was wondering what happens if we lose all electrical impulses in our nervous system for a minimum amount of time. So first of all it is obvious that we will break together, as we are dead while we are in black out state, but I am interesting in the ""afterwards"". I could also put it this way:  Is our brain like a RAM or a Harddrive?  So, if we have a complete elec. blackout, is our memory erased? Or is our consciousness based soly on the synapsis in our brain and does not care about the electrical state?  "
2993,What are the underlying mechanisms for optimism bias?,"I have asked a question before about how does smoker's decision react to new personal health information. Link here.  How do people estimate smoking&#39;s impact on their mortality?  Now I have a follow up question. Psychologists have termed smokers's over confidence about their chance of not being hurt by smoking as optimism bias. My question is: has there been any neuroscience, medical or psychology research about the mechanisms of optimism bias? "
2994,Why do people try to make themselves feel better by treating others poorly?,"I'm looking for an explanation for why people will try to make themselves feel better by treating others poorly.  For example, imagine a group of girls are sitting in a cafe. Within that group are two girls in particular, Sally and Anne. Sally is beautiful, intelligent, and popular. Sally knows she's blessed, but she doesn't like to highlight that fact. She shies from attention and deflects most compliments. Anne on the other hand, is normal, at least she thinks of herself as normal. Anne doesn't often receive compliments like Sally does. As the group of girls sit in the cafe sipping latte's and chatting, the conversation makes its way to Sally's recent success at school. Sally scored top of the class in the last bout of exams. This angers Anne, she herself didn't do so well on her exams. She feels ashamed. Suddenly she blurts ""Oh Sally its great that you did well on your exams, I'm surprised you had so much time to study, I thought you'd be too busy with Jack?"". Jack was Sally's fiance, they recently split up when Sally caught Jack with another woman. At this, Sally cowers like a wounded animal. She quickly mumbles something and excuses herself from the table. The conversation falls flat. Everyone at the table knew what happened between Sally and Jack. The other girls stare awkwardly at their mugs, shooting furtive looks at Anne. Anne knows what she did was wrong, evil even. But hurting Sally felt good, real good.  To rephrase the question in the context of the scene: Is there a name for Anne's behaviour at the cafe?  I'm not just looking for a word that would describe Anne's behaviour. Depending on how you interpret the story, Anne's behaviour can be described with many words (bullying, jealousy, spitefulness etc.). What I'm looking for is an explanation of Anne's behaviour in terms of psychoanalytic theory. "
2995,"What happens inside our body, when we experience betrayal and infidelity?","I guess many of us have experienced it. The moment that you understand that ""the person you love, in whom you've trusted, is now with someone else, enjoying every moment with him/her"".  It's so widespread that it might not be inaccurate that if we say that more than half of the people on Earth would experience it, and it's a universal feeling which is not dependent on race, culture and education.  However, apart from those presumptions, what I've felt during those moments was:   Great pain (maybe not even pain, an instability) in the stomach, below the diaphragm The feeling of insecurity, as if everything is frightening No interest in anything, and I mean ANYTHING at all. No interest in food, in entertainments, music, even sex, nothing. Coldness in my extremities   I wonder if cognitive sciences have ever conducted a research on this subject or not. For example, which neurotransmitters are active in creating this feeling? What hormones are in action? Which part of the brain is responsible for the feelings related to infidelity? How can we treat it using medications, or other scientific methods, not fatherly advices. "
2996,"What is the best short (i.e., roughly 20 item) measure of Big Five personality?","What is the best short set of 20 questions that can give meaningful information about a person's big five personality?

2997,Is cortisol an effective measure of stress for pre and post task performance?,"I have a teleoperation system and I want to see how much stress a person is under before during and after operating it. I thought cortisol would be a correlate of stress. Can I measure levels rapidly, say over minutes, and detect an appreciable difference?  Is there a better way? How?  "
2998,Is there anything in Freudian psychoanalytic theory that is scientifically sound?,"I guess this question is quite context dependent, and here in Sweden there is a general movement for more evidence-based psychology. I think one of our biggest medical universities recently abandoned psychodynamics in favour of a more empirical approach to the field. In this general context it feels like it often happens that Freud and his work gets ridiculed and seen as pseudo-science by a lot of people.  I have only a basic knowledge and overview in the field, but I have to confess that I currently subscribe to the pseudo-science view of Freud's work as well. Is there anything he proposed or accomplished that actually has a sound scientific basis? Have there been any studies providing empirical support for freudian psychoanalytic concepts that I can use to form a critical view of his work which is more balanced and fact-dependent?  "
2999,Pupillometry: how long needs the pupil to respond towards an cognitive stimuli?,"I would like to know if somebody could give me some references on the latency of the pupil response after a cognitive stimulus.  I know that the light reflex is quite fast compared to cognitive stimulation, but I could not find more information than this. Does anyone know how long it takes the pupil to react toward a cognitive task? Or a good reference where I could read it on my own? "
3000,Does the heart play a role in the occurrence of emotions?,"It is a common belief that the heart is somehow related to emotions. When we are nervous,our heartbeat is effected (increased heart rate) and when we are happy, another pattern in heart function can be observed.  My question is the following. Does the heart have a significant role in the occurence of emotions, or is it that the heart is just an organ that pumps blood and these physiological changes are merely a by-product of processes relevant to emotion? Is the heart's function of interest to any cognitive scientific field of study?  "

3004,What is the best way to turn EEG scans in to 3D images?,"I'm looking for the best way to turn standard EEG scans into 3D images of activity in the brain over the time of scanning, for example like the Glass Brain images or even connectome-style images.  I have experience of collecting EEG data and basic experience of EEG analysis using the SPM package for MATLAB, but this didn't include creating a 3D image.  Is there capability to create this using SPM or perhaps another add on or even other software entirely that I can access? Alternatively, does anyone know of any service which would do this for me? I work for for a technology company, not as part of a testing lab or affiliated to a university, so don't have access to these sorts of labs and expertise. "
3005,How do mammals estimate the speed of moving objects?,"Has there been any research on how mammals predict the speed of moving objects? In particular, how do they integrate top-down information?

3006,Finding the anterior comissure to set origin in a SPECT image using SPM/ISAS,"I am learning how to use SPM and ISAS to analyze ictal and interictal SPECT. However I am stuck at a point of their tutorial.   In the item 1.2 one has to set the origin for the SPECT image. That is, to pinpoint the anterior commissure. This is a fairly easy task in a MRI, but very hard to do in a SPECT. How am I to find a tiny anatomical area in such a blurry image (like the one below)?    Are there any anatomical references that I should be using in order to find the approximate area for the anterior commissure?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
3007,Is there any way to calculate the cumulative width of synaptic clefts?,"It's my understanding there are 150 trillion synapses in the human brain (give or take). Is there a way to calculate the cumulative width of all synaptic clefts associated with the synapses? I would expect that some would be shared by several synapses. At 20-40nm per synaptic cleft, 150 trillion of them would add up to a sizeable distance, which seems implausible, given the size of the brain's surface.  Anyone have any suggestions on the best way to calculate this -- if there is one? "
3008,"Is there a name for ""loopback teaching"" technique (explaining something to yourself to learn it)?","Here's the description of a process which I call ""loopback teaching"":   First, I learn something the ""normal"" way, e.g. by reading or watching. I imagine a person or multiple people which I think may be interested in the topic. If there are no such people I know of, I just imagine I'm reading a lecture to some abstract audience. I explain the topic in a way I would do that in real life. I can imagine some kind of presentation (with slides or on a whiteboard), which I go through in a sequence, mostly without skipping. I use my internal speech in mostly the same way I do that when speaking out loud in real life in similar situations.   I noticed I started doing this back when I was at school, and much later I found out that other people use different forms of this technique, or something very similar.  There are multiple related things I know of:   Rubber duck debugging, or generally explaining something to inanimate object Learning by teaching, or generally explaining something you wish to learn to another people   My questions are:   Is there a name for this study technique? Is this related to speech internalization? If so, how? Is there any studies on that subject? In the example above I internalize a dialogue instead of a monologue, and this seems similar to how children internalize their private monologue at the age of 7 years (if I'm not mistaken).  "
3009,How useful are neural circuits in psychology?,"We can identify many kinds of patterns of how neurons connect such as lateral inhibition, negative/positive feedback, convergence, divergence, and facilitation.

In which context is neural circuitry useful? "
3010,"Interpretation of results on the studies of ""Moral Hypocrisy""","Hello right now I am dealing with the studies of C.Daniel Batson, who provided several studies and experiments to reveal moral hypocrisy. I think that I understand the basic idea of his theory, however I am not really able to interpret his statistic outcomes.   I do not know if some of you have access to the full text, but the study is listed under the title:   In a very different voice: Unmasking moral hypocrisy. Batson, C. Daniel; Kobrynowicz, Diane; Dinnerstein, Jessica L.; Kampf, Hannah C.; Wilson, Angela D. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 72(6), Jun 1997, 1335-1348  However, I will provide some relevant excerpts in the form of pictures for better comprehension towards my question.   First excerpts:    In this part Batson et. al. presents his results and compare them through the previously measured responsibility measures indexes. The confusing part starts from the yellow lined part. I do not really understand what does he mean by coding?  Furthermore, he mentions that only one of this applied measures correlated with the results and provides the result r(18)=0,39, p&lt; 0,05 (blue lined). This is the core of my real problem. First of all I do not really understand what does the r(18) mean? I think it has something to do with a normal distribution right? Moreover, I have no idea how to read the 0,39 in a clear way. Does it mean that 39% of the results actually are coherent with the previously applied measurement indexes of moral responsibility? In the end I also struggle to interpret the p-vale of 0,05. Does it mean that the value (0,39) would be theoretically rejected, if it would be below 0,05?  To demonstrate the full results I also provide you the second excerpt:    I really struggling to understand this notations. The worst thing is that it is not explained in the whole text, how these numbers have to be interpret. I also read several other psychological texts, which have very similar expressions.   I hope that my question is somehow understandable, because it is very difficult to ask this question, if nobody has an access to the full text. I would be extremely grateful, if someone could help me.  Best Regards. "
3011,How can you learn to engage in highly focused thinking for a sustained period of time?,"Is there some research on how to engage in highly-focused thinking for more than a few hours at a time?

3014,Is there a neural network model of Pavlovian Learning?,"I am trying to find a computer simulation of Pavlovian learning. i.e. an action such as salivation in response to a stimulus such as a bell ringing.   Most neural network models I've seen seem to be more about trying to recognise things such as handwriting or speech rather than the stimulus-response model. And they don't usually incorporate the temporal nature of Pavlovian learning. e.g. Ring a bell, wait a bit, give dog food.  Are there any computer simulations of this? (Do they have a name?) Is there a connected neuron model of this?  "
3015,What do depressants treat? Are they used in bipolar to treat mania?,"I don't understand the Wikipedia article on depressants.  This is what I have gathered:   Depression and anxiety disorders are treated by antidepressants. Narcolepsy, ADHD, obesity, smoking addiction, lethargy are treated by stimulants. The opposite class drug of a depressant is a stimulant not an antidepressant.   So what do depressants treat? Bipolar? Mania? Impulse control disorders? I couldn't find any articles on treating bipolar with depressants. What I have found are Lithium and mood stabilisers.  The Wikipedia article said depressants can treat OCD, anxiety or depression. Why? This seems a little odd for terminology. Depression is treated with a depressant? "
3016,Is self-infallibility a mental disorder?,"I realize all people have various and complex biases, and that we all get into arguments from time to time. However, I've known one or two people who seemed abnormally resistant to suggestions that they might be mistaken. Their tendancy to distrust and argue seemed to impair them socially, to the point where they struggled to maintain relationships. This makes me wonder if ""self-infallability"" is ever actually a mental disorder.  Is there a mental disorder associated with being severely argumentative or otherwise ""self-infallible""? Especially if it impairs one's social or academic skills? "

3022,Can hate to same gender parent cause homosexualism?,"I know a girl who is (or claims to be) lesbian. I also know that big part of her childhood (12-now years) she hated her mother. Her father left family when she was infant (1-2 years). I dont know what she thinks about her father. She is 17 now.  I wonder, is it possible that by not-accepting her mother, she does not accept her own gender? Or is it more likely that not having a father, influenced her sexual orientation? Was any documented research conducted, that would confirm/reject that? Any other thoughts on that?  EDIT  I should have mention about it earlier but somehow I forgot about that. I know that she had experiance when she got home earlier one day, and saw her mother with her lover having sex. She told it my sister. More or less after that, she started to dress like a man and (I think) she lost this 'little girl/child' identity. She become more serious and her marks at school rised very high. She is the best in class now but before that experience she was one of the worst.  I dont know if this is relevant, but she consider herself as a loner and watches a lot of anime now. I think this is all what I know about her.  I feel confused. I always thought that only small percent of people are really homosexual (because of chromosome mutation), and the rest just believes (because many possible reasons) that they are. "
3023,Do synapses have special types?,"I assume synapses/dendrites/axons are relations which connect one entity/neuron to another, for example:   a car is a vehicle: ""is"" relation Bob has a sister: ""has"" relation etc.   I would just imagine that when car is fired it would activate the connected neuron vehicle. But how does the brain differentiate between the relation types? What makes it ""know"" that a car ""is"" a vehicle and not ""has"" a vehicle? "
3024,Are a lot of highly logical people (such as mathematicians) prone to depression?,"In my math and physics classes, half the students are seeing or have seen psychologists because of depression.   Based on my experiences I feel that there is a huge correlation between logical people doing, maths, physics, informatics, programming, computer game making and depression.  Is this just a personal opinion or is it more widespread? Does anybody have an explanation for this?  "
3025,Is gambling hereditary?,I heard that gambling tendencies may be inherited from parents. I am not sure about that so I posted this question. Is that true? Has any researches been done on that? 
3026,Do we pick partner most similar to opposite-sex parent?,"Do we pick partner most similar to opposite-sex parent? Do men pick life partner who is similar to their mother? Does it apply to women too? By similar, I mean mostly character/mental features. I dont consider appearance, but It would be interesting to know if that matters.  If yes, is it possible that man (for example) would look for/pick a partner who has character opposite to his mother? What could be scientific reason for that?  "
3027,Increasing pitch perception of the same auditory stimuli,"I was trying to work up a small clip of repeating beep sounds I recorded from a mobile game. This series of sounds, when played, gave an unmistakable perception of increasing pitch with every rendition of the beep. I recorded the sound and plotted a spectrogram of the sound, and also a frequency spectra of the first and the last rendition in a series of 10 repetitions (which should apparently have the largest difference in the pitch perception). What was surprising, is that, visibly, on the spectrogram, and also on the frequency spectra, they were exactly the same. Using an enhanced autocorrelation function too, the two repetitions hardly had any gross differences.    Since this is primarily based on visual differences in the plots, there could be subtle shifts which would not be visibly apparent. But in listening, there is a very noticeable rise in pitch, which seems less probable to be a consequence of subtle shifts of the autocorrelation-maxima. Why then does this seem to be the case? Is it only a subtle shift that I am unable to appreciate or is it something more higher-order than that?     The pictures contain the spectrogram of the sound in question, the autocorrelation plots (which I understand to be more neurally relevant then the freq spectra) for the highlighted window (the plot with the blue heading) and a similarly placed window around the last repetition (the plot with the white heading). Do let me know if any further information is required. I don't know how can I get the sound uploaded in here.          I am unsure if the provided spectra are rendered non-informative due to ambient noise, for the recording has been done in a noisy environment using a laptop mic. All analysis via Audacity.   "
3028,How do we learn to count syllables?,"When I was young, I was told that to count syllables in a word, you could clap them. One clap for each syllable.  You would say it aloud like this: cu-shion.  I was not taught rules about how to pick out each syllable from a word. I just figured it out.  The funky thing with this is that syllables have no defined length, and some words are only one syllable while others are a few.  Learning how to count syllables is unlike math because in math, one can't do something until they have learned all the rules for how it should be done properly. I was never taught rules like this for counting syllables, I just figured it out.  My question: how do humans learn this skill without being taught? Is it like learning to walk? "
3029,Does every human brain have the same shape?,"Apart from the general structure (6 layer cortex, same areas, etc.) does every brain have the exact same number and arrangement of sulci, gyri, etc?  Do these elements have the same shape? "
3030,Does a person's brain still contain a record of daily events?,"Does a person's brain have a record of every event that happened during a person's lifetime? Is it possible to recall any of those events and is it possible to recall those events in detail?  For example, I almost drowned when I was a child. I know this happened and can remember bits of the event but I don't remember all the details. Is that complete memory still stored? "
3031,What is it about the nature of slow-wave sleep that makes it difficult to awaken the sleeper?,"In humans, delta wave sleep (""slow wave"" sleep, stages III and IV by AASM criteria) is more common in children and becomes only a small percentage of total sleep time in adults.  Cortical EEG waves have notably low frequencies (sometimes as low as 1Hz) during these stages.  I've always modeled this in my own understanding as the brain ""polling"" the environment at a lower rate, but why do stimuli that coincide directly with the peaks of the cortical waves still not seem to arouse or awaken the person sleeping?  Clearly there are some physiological ""shunts"" occurring in the brainstem and cortex to dampen the effects of external stimuli, but why see any activity at all, then? "
3032,Is there a function between loss of memory and time?,"I have 2 related questions with regards to memory capabilities and time:   ""Is there a function (e.g. [tex]) with regards to memory loss?"" Everyone is bound to forget over time. Is there a function that describes this decay? ""Is there a function between time spent looking at something and remembering it?"" The more the time I spend trying to remember something, the better I will be at it. Is there any correlation between the two?  "
3033,What is the difference between drug withdrawal and sleep deprivation effects?,"Personal sleep-deprivation study: Recently, I posed a question that I'm sure many people find tough already: ""Do I really need to sleep?"", and so I tested myself, I spent two days without sleeping.  The result was:    I just can't handle this  anymore, gonna sleep;  Eyes and hand trembling;  Random muscle contraction;   High blood pressure;  Headaches;  Head overheat;  Pain, pain everywhere;   Theorising: The symptoms of sleep deprivation seemed similar to symptoms of withdrawal associated with drug addiction. Thus, What if sleep is simply just another addiction? What if we are too used to sleeping since we were born, and in the reality we don't need to ?  What is the reason for sleeping?- If the main reason is the brain heating, wouldn't a brain cooler or some refreshment system do the job? It is known that sleeping state is different from simply lying down, still that does not prove that sleep isn't an addiction, am I right?  Questions   Is sleep truly necessary? Are the effects of sleep deprivation analagous to withdrawal symptoms following drug addiction? Can we learn to function without sleep? (i.e., after the withdrawal symptoms disappear)  "
3034,"Does personality imply an inclination to be an expert in one field or average in ""all"" fields?","The question of whether it is better to be an expert in one domain or average in many is too vague.  However, instead, I'd like to focus on the following:   Are individuals born to prefer being an expert in one domain or average in many domains?  Is there any serious research on this?    For example I'd very like to be an expert in swimming but after some time of hard training this activity becomes boring for me. I need to run, I need to play ball team games etc. Conversely, Michael Phelps, world swimmer, incline to be an expert in one branch.     We can talk about branch of study, hobbies, sport, social interactions, languages, etc. "
3035,Where to find historical dream activity data?,"Is it just me, or are we dreaming less? Maybe it's the computer screens in our face all day. Maybe that's just what happens when we get older.  I'm wondering if there's a resource of some kind to determine historical dream activity. Might it be possible to use Google Trends to determine dream activity (similar to how Google Flu tracks illness via search queries).   Or is Google too novel a tool, and are dreamers searching too randomly to track any meaningful delta in dream activity? If so, is there another resource that might provide meaningful dream data? "
3036,"Just because masturbation doesn't interfere with everyday life, why aren't higher rates considered an addiction?","The common theme in most studies/articles about masturbation is that as long as the act does not interfere with everyday life, it's not considered a problem.  However, just because it doesn't interfere with everyday life, why is frequent NOT considered an addiction?  (For example, some people are addicted to marijuana or cocaine but are still functional, however, it is still an addiction.)     This depends on the age, health, and personal needs of a guy. For   instance, a survey on a popular masturbation site found that the   average 13-year-old masturbates three times a day with over 10 percent   masturbating over 6 times!   It sounds pretty clear that there is a strong, overpowering urge (regardless of reason) that has the individual repeating the act, in some cases many times a day.   So just because they can still get to work or turn in assignments at school/college, why is this not an addiction?  Ref. [website]"
3037,"Does psychology have a name for the ""click"" experienced in mathematics?","To understand what I mean, for three days I stared at a formula that looked Greek. Its semantics of relationship was unknown. The mathematics was just one long blur without logic and making no sense. I came back and forth to it. Then one day it was like a veil was lifted over my head and everything ""clicked"" and made sense.  I remember some of the best mathematics advice I received was ""sometimes things click with repeated exposure and this happens a lot in mathematics."" I never paid attention to this until I learned to appreciate this ""click"" phenomenon which I would like study in a more scientific manner but don't know the term(s) I should be looking for.  Thus why I'm here:  is there even a name for this ""click"" experience in mathematics?  There is a name for Déjà vu which even is studied, but what about the ""click""?  "
3038,Can general intelligence be understood as pattern analysis?,"I have been thinking for a while about general intelligence (i.e.,not specific abilities used for particular tasks such as chess). I think that the essence of general intelligence is pattern analysis. I.e., the brain of any animal is a pattern analysis machine. The brain analyses patterns of sounds, lights, pressure, chemicals (in the nose and the tongue). More than that, it also analyse patterns of actions (body language, pattern in doing daily activities, etc etc).   To what extent can intelligence be understood as pattern analysis? Do any existing researchers conceptualise intelligence as pattern analysis? What evidence is there to support conceptualising intelligence as pattern analysis?  "
3039,Why neural architecture is not hardwired for N-dimensional vision but hardwired for abstract math?,"In The Theoretical Minimum, in lecture 1, Leonard Susskind says that you can only visualize 3 dimentional images. (see yourself). Therefore, he says, in order to deal with N dimensions, you need to deal with abstract algebra. I wonder why the brain is hardwired for abstract algebra.   It might be worth to note that mnemotechnicians remind us that your mind thinks in pictures, and remembers pictures, not words or abstract thoughts? "
3040,Is there a psychological explanation for people being 'overcome by the Holy Spirit'?,"I am a scientist by nature, and I don't believe at all in God or any form of spirituality or the Holy Spirit (of course).  However, it does confuse me as to how some people genuinely do seem to be overcome by 'spirit' in certain more extreme churches.  [website]As well as this, my dad once began crying for no reason in a Church or Mosque or something at the altar.  Are there any scientifically/theoretical psychological explanations as to why this could be possible without the need for any sort of spirituality? "
3041,Is multitasking a myth?,"Often, the term 'multitasking' is applied to very busy and 'wired' people.  There is an adage that women multitask better than men.  My question is, do we actually multitask?  If so, what are the cognitive processes that allow this?  Or, is it a case that we momentarily put a task on hold to do another and it has more to do with a well organised short term memory of tasks? "
3042,Reference request in Circuit and Signals for Computational Neuroscience,"In the area of computational neuroscience, there are basic theories from electric circuits and signal processing to be applied. For background study, which reference will be more suitable ?  Personally, I don't have any background knowledge in circuit, or signals.  (Cited by Dayan's book in Theoretical Neuroscience)  ""Circuits, Signals and Systems"" , William M. Siebert  This book seems contains both electric circuits and signal processing, but maybe not from the ground.  Or combination or following two books  ""Signals and System"", Oppenheim  ""Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits"", Agarwal  These two are much heavier than Siebert's, they are good ones, but is it necessary to thoroughly read these two complete detailed books for computational neuroscience ?

3043,How long do dreams last?,What is the relationship between time perceived in a dream and time in the external world?  Is time running in  dreams always faster than the time running in the real world? Is it  ratio of real time and dream's time? 
3044,What's the relation between BCM and Oja's learning rule?,"A software I'm using has implemented two unsupervised learning algorithms, Oja's and Bienenstock, Cooper, Munro's (BCM) learning rule. I understand that they are two very different algorithms for adjusting a neuron's connection weight, but I was wondering what is the relation between them. Do they both have the same plausibility? Can they be used together or are they mutually exclusive? "
3045,Are some facial features more important than others in human facial recognition?,"I'm often surprised by the human ability to correctly identify other individuals despite significant modifications due to ageing, hairstyle, injury etc. But, sometimes the addition of a beard and a hat can radically increase the identification error.   Are all facial regions  equally important when we try to recognise human faces?  Do we focus more on some regions than others?   "
3046,So why might people post seemingly excessive concerns regarding the danger in their neighbourhood?,"Background: The reason for this post is that I have noticed that many people have a desire to make that which is pretty safe seem dangerous.  It is very perplexing to me.  Despite holding a master's degree my psychology education is limited to 101, yet I am still curious about a trend I am seeing.    My neighborhood facebook page, which can be very helpful, is also scattered with posts from a subset of people who want to make the neighborhood seem dangerous.  It is a bit large, 1300, homes and really very safe.  There was some vehicle ""break-ins"", which was really change and loose items being taken from cars that were unlocked.  My family locked our three cars and never had a problem.  That is really the extend of the crime.  One person recently posted:  ""Large box truck pulling a trailer on Xxx Pkwy. No company name. Anyone expecting home builder maintenance?"".  The street in question services all the homes an an elementary school.  About 5% of residents are actually on the facebook page.  It is a public street, not gated.  How would one reasonably expect this to get any ""traction"".  Turns out it was a crew painting fire hydrants.    Another example:  Guy posts a picture of a car stopped in front of his house.  ""What are you doing in front of my house at 1:12 pm.  Be warned I will not be robbed.""  Again this was just after lunch on a side street, but still public.  One person points out that the house across from him is for sale.  They were probably checking it out.  To my knowledge there have been no reported break ins, other then abandoned houses, in the last 8 years.  Question  So why might people post seemingly excessive concerns regarding the danger in their neighbourhood?    It seems counterproductive as it would tend to drive down property values. My thought is that this behavior fulfils a particular need, but perhaps I am thinking about it wrong. "
3047,Name for compulsive need to mimic another's symptoms of illness?,"I'm trying to research a particular issue that arises as a side effect of anxiety and depression. I'm finding it tricky to get information, mostly because I'm not sure what it's technically called (if it has a term, or if it is documented at all).  The subject has a compulsive need to appear to be experiencing the same symptoms of illness of an important loved one, in particular symptoms that are difficult to disprove (e.g. pain, soreness). For example if the subject's partner has a cold and complains of a sore throat, the subject will immediately claim to also have a sore throat. The subject will also have a compulsive need to take the same medication or treatments as the loved one. The subject will claim all of this fiercely, and will take great to offence to mistrust.  It seems strikes a similar chord with Münchausen syndrome, but the subject does not specifically want care from medical professionals and it only occurs to mirror a key loved one's symptoms. I'm not entirely sure if it is issue of attention seeking, due to attention being cast on their loved one instead; or if it's fear of severe illness and death of another, and by both being ill makes it easier to cope somehow?  The overall cause is not especially relevant, and probably impossible to reckon without further counselling. But the overall compulsion to mimic symptoms of illness - is this a documented disorder? This is a fact finding mission, so any information would be greatly appreciated. "
3048,How to work on a research problem while sleeping?,"Put it more formally, how to let your mind subconsciously work on a research problem when you are not actively thinking about it, e.g., during sleep, dinner, walking, or shower?   Often I hear stories where a person gets stuck on a problem for months, only waking up and finding the problem works itself out in the shower. There are many great researchers echoing this ability , such as ""creativity comes out of your subconscious"" by Richard Hamming . Also, many professors I know seem to master such skill, including my advisor. Having seen some occasional discussions like here at SE, I am wondering if this ability is innate or can be learned. If the latter, what are the techniques to help cultivate this ability? "
3049,Can SSRI make things worse in the long term or cause delayed depression?,"I found two articles that mention that taking SSRI for depression can actually make the depression worse.   ""Now Antidepressant-Induced Chronic Depression Has a Name: Tardive Dysphoria"" on Psychology Today. ""Antidepressants Make Things Worse in the Long Term"" on the Behaviorism and Mental Health blog.   Is this true? Can Tardive Dysphoria (delayed depression) be caused by SSRI?  They seem pretty convincing and I can't find anything against it but if it's true, it basically means that depression treatment is going back to the 60's before SSRI were invented. "
3050,Are recent affordable EEG devices any good?,"I'm looking to do some research about flow and optimal experience with EEG.  I don't have access to a lab and I was wondering if the new devices that are available to the public (i.e. Melon, Muse, iFocust,...) are any good to conduct research? Is it all just a marketing gimmick? "
3051,Clarification on the definition of sublimation?,"I'm reading the wikipedia article on sublimation. The article says:     In psychology, sublimation is a mature type of defense mechanism where socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are consciously transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse.   But it's not clear to me how these impulses are transformed. Are these impulses transformed inside the mind of the one who do them or are they transformed in a social level (via persuasion)?  Rephrasing the question: Does him argue with himself and make himself believe that the unacceptable behavior is actually a good thing or succeeds to persuade others to believe that behavior is a good thing? "
3052,How well are neurotransmitters used in SPA?,"How much does the SPAUN and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) that was used to build it take neurotransmitters into account? In the book How to Build a Brain, various inhibitory and excitatory connections are mentioned as supplying a biological foundation for implementing the Basal Ganglia. Additionally, it's mentioned that the learning rule that the SPA uses, hPES, uses dopamine to modulate learning. However, I'm still a bit confused on the details of all this. How do neurotransmitters fit into Nengo? How much detail does Nengo go into in regards to neurotransmitters? Does it take into account the neurotransmitter distribution and consumption as observed in the brain?  Note: For more information on the relation between Nengo, SPA and SPAUN, please see my previous question. "
3053,How does neurotransmitter distribution and usage vary thought the brain?,"I understand that neurotransmitters are used to send signals between neurons in the brain and that some are used for rather specific functions. However, is the exact distribution/concentration/consumption and tolerances of neurotransmitters in various areas of the brain known?  Related and considered:  Which neurotransmitters can be measured in a living human brain?  Neurotransmitter based imaging techniques "
3054,How is memory accounted for in the NEF?,"The Neurological Engineering Framework can be used to create systems that use memory in interesting ways. One system (Spaun) is able to memorize (and forget) lists much in the same way as humans do. Another system can learn tasks and apply the knowledge to subtasks using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Both of these tasks involve memory, but how is memory contained within the Neurological Engineering Framework? "

3056,Measurement of phase difference between two signals using cross correlation vs. fourier transform,"I am studying eeg signals with the aim of distinguishing between preictal and interictal epilepsy states based on the eeg signal. I have read some papers and one of the metrics used to distinguish between the states has to do with measuring the phase synchronization between eeg samples from multiple electrodes. In this regard, I thought the most straightforward way to measure phase difference between two signals would be to compute the cross correlation function, and find the time [tex] at which the cross correlation function reaches a maximum - call this Method 1. However, in practice what is usually done is to fourier transform the signals and measure phase difference of the complex fourier transform (and possibly average it over a frequency band of interest). Details are explained e.g., here - see the section on phase synchronization. Call this Method 2.  So my question is: what is wrong with Method 1? It seems more intuitive, direct and computationally easier to me. Could someone explain this to me?  EDIT: thinking about this even further, it seems the method employed in practice and described at [website][tex] = [tex] and this averaged over [tex] will give phase difference as [tex].   But what would Method 3 give? Is there a difference between phase difference and phase synchronization of two signals?  "

3059,aftereffects of auditory adaptation,"Adaptation is a very robust feature of sensory processing: when a stimulus is displayed for a prolonged period, or repeatedly, the neural response to it will diminish. This process creates a local change in cortical sensitivity, which is behaviorally evident through worse sensory discrimination of subsequent stimuli which are similar to the adaptor stimulus, but better discrimination of dissimilar ones.  In the visual domain, there is also the concept of an afterimage. If one looks at a green patch for a long time, then a white wall will appear red. If one looks at a curved line for a long time, a straight line will appear to curve the other way. The landscape next to a waterfall will look like its traveling upwards, etc.  Does anything similar exist in the auditory domain? Can adaptation lead to illusory percepts in audition? And if not, why do you think this would be?   I'm particularly interested in the neural level of explanation, and would be very happy to hear all speculations, however far out they are.  "
3060,Is there an explanation of why some colors seem to move forward/backward on a 2D plane?,"I am a painter and digital artist working with color and colorimetry. Recently I noticed HUGE ""illusions"" (impressions of depths) in a print  composed of very saturated colors, that I programmed to have the highest  chroma my printer could achieve.  Unfortunately this is undisplayable on screen (out of gamut), but the picture can give you an idea...    In the transition between Black and light Grey-ish that passes from Red to Green to Blue-Greyish, one can see on the print very abrupt ""3D effects"" or in other words ""impressions of several groups of different depth"", like a ""staircase"" with 3 or 4 steps. We sometimes see similar so-called ""optical illusions"" occuring between fields of colours. If I remember well, dark-blue often seems ""further away"" than yellow for example.      I have searched on internet for an explanation but I can only find some quite old non-quantitative theories that explain poorly the phenomenon with a theory of ""warm"" and ""cold"" colors... That's far from being a satisfactory explanation...   I am wondering if:   the impression of depth has anything to do with the eye's optics (like the different colors are not diffracted equally) what is the cause of the illusion from the viewpoint of the retina's structure? can it be described in mathematical terms with the help of colorimetry? has it been completely described, can it be simulated, can we actually predict for which colors it's gonna happen?   Thanks "
3061,Does exercise substantially affect bloodflow to brain,"The benefits of exercise on the psyche are well documented, encompassing catharsis, endorphin release, mental health improvements and self esteem.  There is also evidence that it increases cognitive function short and long term.   It would seem that these benefits are from more BDNF, blood with higher oxygen content, and more bloodflow to the brain. I would think the blood effects would cause the short term benefits, while aiding in the increased neurogenesis long term.   I just went for a run.  I assumed the immediate(within the hour of exercise) clarity I felt to be attributable to the mood-altering affects(catharsis, stress relief, endorphins, etc). Quick searches show websites like ScientificAmerican and brainblogger et al confirm that more bloodflow to the brain contributes to state and structural changes in the brain.   However, in The Brain; A Very Short Introduction by Michael O'Shea, it mentions; [On the topic of areas of the brain requiring more glucose and oxygen] ""A simple solution to this problem would be to pump more blood into the active region, much in the same way that a muscle is supplied with more blood when exercised vigorously. However unlike a muscle, which becomes engorged with blood and swells when exercised, the brain is confined by the skull and cannot be allowed to swell significantly. The solution to this tricky problem is to maintain a constant overall blood volume in the brain and to arrange for blood to be diverted preferentially to active regions."".  I'm skeptical of the bloodflow explanation, since there is the counter evidence from the book I cited.  This raises a related question concerning blood though. ""Would breathing air with higher oxygen content be beneficial to brain function?""(I'm aware too high and there isn't enough carbonic acid, no?).  "
3062,Provable ROI for call center rest periods?,"Think you can help make life better for a nation of call center workers?  At a large insurance company, I used to work in the call center for both Auto Claims and then Homeowner Claims, before I was promoted on to other things.  It's a complicated and stressful position, where customers are already upset because they have just gotten in a car accident or their house just burned down.    Call volume varies, but tends to be constant during many busy periods. As soon as you're done with one call, sometimes there's a lull, but usually another call is waiting.  The problem is that this leads to people taking a breather during ""After Call Work,"" purposefully inflating their call time in order to catch a break from the stressful calls.  A potential solution, I've always wondered, is to pre-program an automatic break of no calls for X minutes after Y calls. (e.g. a 1 minute break after every 3 calls.)  My question is, would there be any scientific basis that could help justify a Return On Investment? Is a rest period worth the drain on phone coverage?  Or is it more beneficial to leave it up to the workers, to sacrifice their Average Handling Time at will to decompress at their own pace? "
3063,relation of substantive/verb to declarative/procedural memory,"Is there a relation between ""declarative vs. procedural memory"" and ""substantive vs. verb""? For example, are substantives (as a kind of information entities) stored in the declarative memory whereas verbs define capabilities/behavior and hence stored in the procedural memory?  Example:  Tree: a substantive, can directly be stored in declarative memory  to climb: a verb, defines a capability/behavior and can be stored in the procedural memory "
3064,Why does learning new mental skills lead to headaches?,"Why is deliberate practice uncomfortable? For example, during learning college math and playing the piano. Why do we get headaches after long hours of practice?  According to this question, learning is about connecting distant neural networks; in forming these synapses resources are recruited such as calcium and glucose.  Now since the brain has no pain receptors, the discomfort must be coming from the surrounding nerves in the skull and neck. Possibilities:  a) Requiring greater resources is straining our blood system and hence the pain.  b) Forming many connections continuously creates excess of neurotransmitters such as glutamine that strain and literally swell brain areas, which in turn hit against our skull nerves.  Please feel free to correct me.  This topic is closely connected with the cellurar mechanism of mental fatigue. "
3065,What is it about Ken Reid's style of drawing lumps on surfaces [shown here] that makes our visual system so easily interpret it?,"Ken Reid was an artist who drew for the Beano and other comics, and was known for strips such as Frankie Stein and Queen of the Seas. And for The Nervs, about the little men who run our brains, but that's not why I'm asking this. He had a rather grotesque way of drawing faces, which made protrusions such as chins and Adam's apples stand out using very few lines. There are examples of his work on Lew Stringer's blog and this copy of The Nervs strip. What interests me is why the lines he drew are so effective. What is the visual system interpreting them as?  To demonstrate, here are three images from the above-linked strip. I've marked the parts of interest with an arrow:        In the second image, the back of the knee, there's an upward-curving line above a short vertical above two downward-curving lines. The higher downward-curving line is presumably the contour of the lower leg. But it's less obvious what the downward-curving line below it is. Nevertheless, it certainly helps in giving a sense of three-dimensional form.   Similarly, in the third image, some of the three upward-curving lines could be folds where the chin presses back against itself. But is the visual system interpreting them all as folds? I don't know, but again, they readily give a sense of form. If there's anyone here who is working on perception of shape, I'd like to know how you think these lines are being interpreted.   By the way, I and other readers have noticed that Reid's drawings seem very ""intense"". As one reader commented in a blog, ""they seem to enter the subconscious and stick there for the rest of your life"". I'd be interested in any ideas on why, and how this relates to what I've asked above. "
3066,Why are people so attached to their possessions?,"Why do people ""set great store"" by their things? If for example photos are lost or damaged, why is this a big deal? It seems to me that relationships are the only really important thing, and because we never know if the person will come home from work alive, all we can do is deal with ""the person standing in front of us at the time."" "
3067,Could one use priming (from realistic images to drawings thereof) to help teach the conventions of line drawing?,"Line drawing is a very stylised form of art. There are no lines in nature, and artists have to learn the conventions to be used when drawing in line. I am interested in whether one could help them learn by repeated priming of associations from realistic images to line drawings of those images.  First, here is an example, a drawing of a boy from the children's annual Sunshine Stories, published probably in the 1930s. The top of the chin has been omitted, because it catches the light. The upper lip is shown dark, and the lower lip is omitted, being indicated only by a shadow under it:    This is a very common convention. The link points at an excerpt from an instructional book that was very popular in its time, Simple Sketching in Line by L. A. Doust. For some reason, the visual system seems to pay too much attention to bottom lips that are outlined or dark, so artists have discovered that it's often best only to draw the shadow under them.  Faces are not the only subject that gets conventionalised. For example, at this page and subsequent pages, I show some of the conventions used in indicating texture. These slides, by the way, are from a talk I gave on the semantics of line in drawing, showing the different purposes for which artists use line.  So, imagine that we ask a skilled illustrator to take 500 (say) photos and make a drawing of each, using a common and consistent style. We then use the photos paired with their drawings as priming stimuli. Is there any evidence for or against my hypothesis that this would help novices learn the mapping from realistic images to drawings thereof? In a sense, it's analogous to teaching musicians to sight-read.  A hi-tech alternative to photos and drawings would be mediated-reality glasses. In Oxford, Stephen Hicks is developing Smart Spex, which help people with poor vision to see. The third image on that page shows a scene, labelled ""a"", and the specs' renderings of it. Rendering ""c"" is similar to a line drawing. If a subject were to wear these glasses in ""line drawing"" mode continuously, would they absorb its rendering conventions? If so, it could be a very useful way to teach drawing. "
3068,Does nlp have a dependency on a subject having strong visualisation skills?,"I have read a few books on Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) and, it seems that a corner stone of NLP is strong inner visualisation skills.  Is there any research that looks at the correlation between visualisation ability and the effectiveness of NLP?  Are there any scientifically proven techniques for measuring and improving visualisation skills? "
3069,Are axons in the brain weighted?,"Is it known whether the connection strength of synapses is important to the functioning of the brain or does just the binary existence of a synapse matter? Also, how widely do the strengths of synapses change, if any? "
3070,Can two neurons in the brain be connected more than once?,"Can two given neurons in the human brain can be directly connected more than once, either mutually or in the same or direction? Also, can the same neuron have transitive connections to itself (in order to amplify itself for example)? "
3071,What is known about the information that's passed upwards within the neocortex?,"The neocortex is likely to process sparse representations in a hierarchy with information close to the raw sensor input appearing in lower levels and abstract concepts being appearing in higher levels. However, I'm interested in the exact nature of information being passed upwards.   There are some gating mechanisms in the neocortex. I could imagine that they prevent obvious information from being passed up. For example, since it was already reported and didn't changed. Much like workers within corporate hierarchies only report the same status once. Similarly, it would make sense to pass up information that a lower layer doesn't understand and can't handle itself. This would also be comparable to workers at a company who ask their managers for decision they can't make. If planning happens within the hierarchy of the neocortex, higher layers might hand down high levels options for the lower levels to unroll and simulate. In that case, the result might be passed up afterwards. Encoding continuous input streams, attractor patterns are likely to emerge within levels of the hierarchy. I could imagine that the type of information send upwards changes when a level settles in a stable pattern.   Is there any evidence for or against these guesses? What else know about the nature of information that's passed up within the neocortex? "
3072,Why do pupils dilate in response to emotional state?,"I just came across an article on the internet stating that,     Pupils dilate when we find someone or something attractive.   So, as far as I know, this kind of dilation doesn't seem to have any effect on attractiveness of subject, does it?  For example:  Suppose if a one person A in love with person B, and pupils of A tend to dilate when seeing B, What effect does it have on B? Any psychological effect perhaps?  P.S. I'm not sure if this should be on Cog.Sci "
3073,What is the psychology behind addictive video games?,"Is the psychology the same as in casino games? where the person is addicted because winning is so unpredictable?  Are RPG games addictive by Gestalt theory, where players mind likes to see things organized and being whole and completed as opposed to being fractioned and incomplete? "
3074,Cognitive Models of learning Working Memory usage,"Recently in deep learning, there's been a surge in learning how to use memories as part of the optimisation process (i.e. LSTM's and Stacks). However, these aren't really analogous to how a cognitive systems learns how to use it's working memory.  Are there models of how working memory modules (where a saved value decays over time) can be learned to be optimally leveraged? Either via reinforcement learning or supervised learning? "
3075,Conducting brain stimulation at home,"Given articles like this, and their associated research {1}, I am developing an interest in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and other forms of brain stimulation as they appear like they may have. I might be interested in trying it at home.  As a result I would like ask for evidence to help me answer one or more of the following questions:    What is the best headset for brain stimulation that a normal person can buy or build? I am aware of these, but would like the opinion of an expert. What are the best online communities, or sources of information for conducting brain stimulation at home? How should I engage in brain stimulation at home? A guide, or link to one would be appreciated Is it safe to conduction brain stimulation at home? If there is evidence that one type of brain stimulation, and/or headset is safe then please provide evidence of this.   Reference  {1} Santarnecchi, E., et al. (2016).

3076,Do school teachers demand more from their children than other students?,"Lets assume that there is a group of students and one teacher (typical school situation).   Child of the teacher is in that group.  Is there any evidence, that school teachers demand more from their children than other children?  Is there any evidence, that children who are taught by parent-teacher achieve better/worse results than other students in same group? "
3077,How to foster an environment for appreciation,"I'm a teacher at a highschool and currently we've been working on projects that are supposed to make the kids appreciate those around them especially the other teachers and workers at the school. During an advisory time earlier this year, we had the students write a letter of appreciation to someone who works at the school. Another project that we're going to start up is a student voted ""employee of the month"" and that teacher/worker will be somehow celebrated -we haven't worked out the details-. The problem with both of these ideas is that they're ineffective and the students all just wrote letters begrudgingly and I think this upcoming project won't make them feel appreciation for those who help them either.   Are there general steps, for either creating an environment for students to appreciate teachers and other workers? Or are there general ways that appreciation works in the mind so that we can come up with projects that will truly help them? "
3078,What is the effectiveness of self-prescribed marijuana for depression?,How common is it for patients diagnosed with depression to self-prescribe themselves marijuana after trying prescription anti-depressants? Is there any evidence that this self-treatment is effective or satisfies some need that is not filled with typical prescription medication? 
3079,Toolbox for modelling visual search performance,I'm looking for a toolbox to model visual search performance in a singleton search task based on line orientations (you need to find a line that is most different from all others in it's orientation).   The desirable features would be:   Feature-detectors that resemble real neurons. Memory for distribution of distractors in feature space during previous trials.   Is there something like that? I also know that sometimes similar tasks are studied in texture discrimination. Maybe there is something close to what I need in that domain? 
3080,Understanding neuronal firing in the context of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity,"When discussing Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity in neurons, when we say that a neuron fires do we mean it fires only one spike? Or do we still say ""the neuron has fired"" when a train of n spikes was actually fired?   I find this detail a little confusing when we learn spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP), for example. If the neuron fires only one spike, then the time of firing is precise enough for relative timing between input and output signals to be well defined, and then the theory makes sense. Otherwise, one should give an approximation of the duration of the firing train of spikes and compare it with the duration of depolarization process in the dendrite that triggered this firing. But I can't find any of these anywhere.  "
3081,Can suggestion change memories?,"I came up with this question because of my personal experience. I think it may help you understand my question better, so I will describe it briefly.  Piece of metal  When I was a kid, I (accidentally) watched a horror movie. There was a scene, in which one of characters was using a fork to take out small piece of metal from his body. It scared me very much.  After 15 years, I watched this horror again (and again - accidentally). I was very surprised that, when watching above scene, the small piece of metal was much, much smaller then I remembered. I estimate, that in reality it was about 3x smaller.  Conclusion  Until this experience, I though that memory is somehow 'fixed' since remembered. Was there any research conducted that would prove that memories are not fixed, not constant? It seems like feeling of fear somehow scaled up the source of fear (piece of metal) in my memory image, or some parts of memorised image grew with me. It was like my memory was 'updated'.  If memories are indid 'mutable' by experiences, the obvious question comes to mind - can suggestion influence or even change memories? "
3082,Can adults adapt to less sleep?,"I am asking whether adults, especially in circumstances like a monastery or Zen center, can become able long-term to sleep only about 4 to 5 hours a night? So, that would mean: no children to care for, no heavy labor, lots of time spent meditating and doing other things that the body would find restful and undemanding...  Can the mind get along on much less hours of sleep than the usual adult? I am not asking about the absolute numbers, only if it can be reduced and sustained over years, or permanently? "
3083,What is the location of the center-surround receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells?,"I have read wikipedia article about receptive fields of visual system and it states the following:     The receptive field is often identified as the region of the retina where the action of light alters the firing of the neuron. In retinal ganglion cells (see below), this area of the retina would encompass all the photoreceptors, all the rods and cones from one eye.     I understand the part where it says that the neurons firing increases as we put light on the center of the receptive (for the ON center type) and etc.  What I'm not sure about is the location of this circle, in other words, where is this circle that we put light on?  What I think is that the circle is the area of retina where we have the rod and cone shaped photoreceptors. Does this means that for every ganglion cell the photoreceptors connected to it are always shaped like a circle ?   "

3086,What is the relationship between Big 5 personality and the theory of planned behaviour?,"The theory of planned behaviour is a popular model of human behaviour. I.e., Broadly the model suggests that intentions to act are a function of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. And behaviour is a function of intentions and actual ability to act which is reflected typically in perceptions of control. The theory of planned behaviour has been applied to many domains (e.g., smoking, exercise, gambling, etc.).  I was curious whether any researchers have attempted to integrate modes of trait personality, and the Big 5 personality in particular with the theory of planned behaviour. I assume that any such integration would be somewhat domain dependent.   What theories have been proposed relating Big 5 personality factors with theory of planned behaviour? What relationships have been obtained in empirical studies between Big 5 personality and theory of planned behaviour?  "
3087,Is there evidence of suppression of the frontal cortex during herding behavior?,"Phenomena such as large-scale stock market sell-offs and financial panic in general are often explained in terms of herding behaviors.    At how primitive of a level does one actually ""follow the herd""?  In other words, does this behavior elicit a strong response at the brainstem level (particularly in the tectum, i.e., the colliculi) at some cost to frontal cortical processing?  Obviously, it's a difficult task to run an EEG or have a subject in for an MRI during a real panic, so results based on simulations are certainly acceptable. "
3088,How to analyze auditory steady state responses?,How does one usually go about analyzing the auditory steady state response (ASSR)? I have data where speech was amplitude modulated to a 40 Hz sine tone. There's 3.5 minutes of data; should I just take the FFT or do some averaging first? What is the usual process? The data has been already preprocessed. 
3089,Are people less bothered by problems they create for themselves?,"I notice that I am more annoyed by problems when I am not the one that created them.  Two examples would be   Cleaning up someone else's mess is much more annoying than cleaning up my own When spelling autocorrect ""fixes"" a word that I typed in correctly fixing it annoys me much more than fixing words that I misspelled.   My second example alludes to the fact that this is a very important phenomenon to consider when automating a process.  A user could be much more annoyed by fixing a mistake caused by the automation than they would have been doing the whole thing themselves.    I have been unable to find a name for this phenomenon or any research relating to it.  Is it true in general? Is there a name for it that would point me towards some research? "
3090,Possibility of using the effects of sleep to induce a virtual environment?,"I'm not sure what this guy is trying to say, or why his question got closed, but I think I can build upon it and form a solid question. When the brain enters REM Sleep, all sensory input to reality is eliminated or dulled. The person will begin dreaming as the brain creates random impulses and sends them through the brain. Through the techniques of Lucid Dreaming, the subject can learn to control the false dream reality completely. These conditions provide everything necessary for a virtual environment except they are isolated to the individual's brain.  If we were able to induce the physiological conditions of sleep (which should be a simple injection of hormones), and generate these impulses artificially(connecting the brain to a high-end computer program), then we should be able to immerse the person in a virtual environment. Lucidity could be achieved easily by programming the system to leave clues for the subject. The ramifications of this are enormous. For example, a man in China and a man in Russia could go bowling together, without leaving their own homes.  (I'm not sure if this theory already exists, but I definitely reached these conclusions myself.)    My main questions are:    What are the hormones necessary to induce sleep in this way? Is this a safe and reliable way to immerse a subject in a virtual environment?   "
3091,"Why prefer ""99% fat free"" to ""1% fat""?","In my experience I tend to find low-fat products labelled as ""99% fat free"" much more often than the equivalent ""1% fat"".*  Why is this so? To me it seems counter-intuitive, because it reminds me of psychological pricing, where retailers price things slightly less than round numbers, partly so that consumers under-perceive the price. If that same effect is happening with the ""99% fat free"" labeling, consumers would over-perceive the amount of fat.  Is it because the psychological pricing phenomenon doesn't apply in this case for whatever reason? Perhaps other phenomena are at play? Or perhaps it's something that doesn't have to do with the numbers?  *: I can't find a source for this unfortunately, and I'm aware that in some circumstances the ""1% fat"" form is the norm, for example with low-fat milk. "
3092,"As for future mind control/reading technology, can humans fight it?","As of recent times, rats have communicated through wireless brain implants, from across the globe. Also, recent fMRI technologies have allowed prediction of movements (or intention), and the visualization of brain waves (or 'seeing' your thoughts, images, etc.)  Rats have been used for testing, and some advances allowed scientists to predict intention, induce and/or subdue emotions and thoughts.  Reading or controlling the mind requires modifying/reading neural oscillations on neurons, and doing so on certain parts of the brain. Since the neural oscillations are the base of thought and cognition itself, how can we fight our own oscillations? This question stems from the possibility of mind control/reading in humans.  If the technology directly modifies our thoughts.. how can we fight that very structure? In science fiction, people ""fight"" against implants and control, but in reality, is that even possible? Can we fight our own oscillations?  For example, your mind is being read for a thought that you consciously know, like a password, and can you fight this attack? Another example, your mind is being controlled, you are being coerced, and since neural oscillations are thought itself, you can't have objections.  Can we have objections? Can we fight our neural oscillations if they are hijacked? "
3093,Is it possible to think in a second language?,"Those who have learned a second language are guaranteed to consciously think of words and their corresponding meaning in your native language or vice versa.  This is common with more ""complex"" sentences, like ""My favorite color is green."", rather than ""Hi"" or ""Hello, how are you?"" (The latter being a common phrase, so it needs no thinking in most languages.).    Is it possible to stop the conscious act of translating your native language to your second language or vice versa? Is it possible to fully ""think"" in your second language?   Clarification: When you speak your native language you rarely think about the grammar and structure and it comes right out, I'm asking if that's possible with people who learned multiple languages.. can you think as if that language was native to you?  Further clarification: You know how a beginner of a foreign language usually cannot speak rapid-fire and has to think through every word and it's syntax, instead of making a flow of words automatically, you have to 'think' and fill in each word accordingly.  Example: When a person who natively speaks English  talks, they can talk without having to think of word meanings as it is already implicitly processed by your sub-conscious.. but this flow usually stops when you..   Another example: Person A doesn't use the word ""condescending"" a lot, and has to return to the definition in her memory. She usually doesn't meet condescending people. She has met a person who has this attribute. In an argument she says ""You're so --pause--, umm, hmm.."", and in her mind she goes through a list of words (Mean, (I had to pause here to find a word for the example..) Defiant, Rude, etc.) until she reaches condescending.  That is the feeling of ""thinking"" I'm describing. A new learner of a second language has to ""think"" through everything, and my question is: Can you ""think"" in a second language without having to find and link words in your native language? Excluding young people exposed to both, but people who took classes and moved to a country to learn. "
3094,What is the effect of studying logic or mathematics on general thinking skills?,"I frequently hear comments from people to the effect that ""Studies have shown that students who take (intro) logic courses don't show any signs of improvement in logical/rational/critical thinking."" Yet, as an undergrad, I got the opposite impression: I felt that studying logic (and mathematics) in more depth sharpened those skills. My initial Google search on the issue didn't really turn up much.  So, I have some questions regarding the psychology of logic and mathematics.     Question: What studies have been done regarding the effects/benefits to cognitive thinking skills from taking intro logic courses? What about studying probability theory, or even mathematics more generally? How conclusive are they?   Any references would be extremely helpful. I now teach intro logic as a grad student, and if there's something that students consistently miss out on, I would like to know about it so that I can (hopefully) make improvements. Also, any resources in the relation between mathematics and psychology more generally would be beneficial.  (I posted this on the MathSE, but was told this would be a better place for this question. If this needs retagging, let me know. I see that this question is similarly related, but I'm particularly interested in intro formal logic courses). "

3097,Comprehensive list of cognitive techniques in CBT,"I'm not a cognitive science student, but I'm interested in CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) and I'm using it to overcome some of the problems I have.   However, I have difficulty in finding resources online for it. AMAIK CBT has a list of cognitive errors, which I prefer to call dysfunctional mental sceneries. You can simply Google for common cognitive errors and you end up with like 20 good results.   To overcome those errors, people are encouraged to use some techniques like reality testing for example. But I can't find a good comprehensive list of techniques used in CBT. Here are the links to sites I've found:  [website][website][website]However they barely provide more than 5 techniques. In comparison to the lists of cognitive errors, it seems that there are not enough cognitive techniques proposed by cognitive psychologists. I've heard somewhere that we have more than 100 cognitive techniques, and I can't find more than 5 on the Internet.  Is it that I've misunderstood techniques part of CBT? Or is it that techniques are not free to be published online? Can anyone clarify me here, or show me a comprehensive list of cognitive techniques? "
3098,What are the effects of negative self image on cognition and brain function?,"All other things considered equal, what are the effects of a negative self image, on cognition and brain function?  Are there any studies that would have specific data supporting cognitive outcomes (concentration times, memory, mind body awareness) rather than just pointing to self-esteem?  In addition, what cognitive effect does positive self image have on cognition and brain function? Are there qualities in either of them that are not inverses of the other? "

Blind Prisoner: How can you move faster than possible, fight longer                  than possible without the most powerful impulse of the                  spirit: the fear of death. Bruce Wayne:    I do fear death. I fear dying in here, while my city burns,                  and there's no one there to save it. Blind Prisoner: Then make the climb. Bruce Wayne:    How? Blind Prisoner: As the child did. Without the rope.                  Then fear will find you again.   Questions:   How can this dialogue be interpreted in scientific terms?

I've been trying to find information on which heart rate monitor to buy, but it's unclear to me which heart rate monitors allow exporting data to PC, and how open the data is. Can I only analyse the data through the software provided by the vendor, or is it common practice to be able to export it as e.g. CSV?   Are there any 'common' heartrate sensors used in the community? Should I look for monitors which support a certain protocol/format?

3106,To what degree does environment govern the severity of symptoms in schizophrenia?,"From what I understand about the physiology of schizophrenia it is thought to be caused by chemical imbalances resulting from genetic factors, fueled by environmental factors. I've garnered that environmental factors can play a large role in how a person reacts to the disease.  As an example: a person with a genetic predisposition towards schizophrenia is raised in an abusive household with his parents yelling everyday, they will definitely become angry and more stressed out, which one might assume would lead to their eventual psychotic break. Is this 100% correct? Another person who might be less stressed out, probably raised in a normal family, could potentially experience troubling symptoms before a complete psychotic break. Is this a valid assumption or observed pattern in those who suffer from the disease?  So, if environmental factors can contribute to the onset of schizophrenia, could the removal of these factors lessen the symptoms? Take for example Jared Loughner, he will be spending life in prison. With time away from society, with the stresses of life removed, and (given the correct medication), could incarcerated schizophrenia patients' symptoms be ameliorated by this change in social situation?    Any info on this? "
3107,Phase locking value (PLV) between $x(t)$ and $x(t-T)$,"I have been trying to calculate PLV using the hilbert transform (reference).

I would expect PLV between [tex] and [tex] to be 1. In above graph shift is a normalized quantity such that [tex]  EDIT: thinking about this some more. Let us first define what PLV is. If we define PLV as the phase locking between instantaneous phases of two signals [tex] and [tex] where instantaneous phase is defined according to the analytic signal, then I am not able to derive a mathematical relationship asserting that [tex].

3108,Survey Questionnaire design - What are the alternatives to Likert scale in measuring attitudes?,"I work in Social Science Research (Management)  In my school, Likert Scale is extensively used to measure attitudes.(Strongly disagree to Strongly agree). So, I kind of assumed that it's an absolute standard.  But recently, while I was reading material on designing surveys, I came across the argument that highly criticized this format of response categories, owing to a tendency called ""acquiescence response set"".  I'm working on my questionnaire and have drafted several questions that measure the attitude of respondents related to an information system. Ex: The system provides accurate information. (strongly agree, Agree, Neither, Disagree, Strongly disagree)  My question is - what are the alternative scales I can use to measure the attitudes of the respondents? what is the more reliable way to measure attitudes? "
3109,Connections between different theories of personality,"There are a several theories on personality: the Big Five personality traits, Watson en Clark's extraversion en neuroticism, Grey's Behavioural Inhibition &amp; Behavioural Activation (BIS/BAS), Eysecks Psychotocism, Extraversion and Neuroticism (PEN) model, the Socionics &amp; Information Metabolism theory discussed in this related question, the list goes on.  But are there any theories proposing 'translations' from a personality described according to one theory, to the same personality described according to one of the others?   I would expect that this translation would be mediated through latent variables.  However i have not found any research that does this, while there are papers on the relatioships between test-results. That is, there is empirical research that describes the correlations between the scores on questionnaires that are designed to measure personality according to different theories.  For example: From BIS/BAS to the big five - Smits and Boeck - European Journal of Personality Vol 20, no 4, 255–270  The reason i ask, is because i have a dataset of some 460 subjects who took several personality questionnaires (big 5 as well as BIS/BAS), in addition they completed the Adjective Check List (ACL). Test subjects also did tests which measure impulsiveness: a Response Inhibition task, a Reversal Learning task and the Balloon Analogue Risk Task.  I think it would be interesting to compare a model based on literature to the correlations found in this dataset.  Specifically i would try to predict certain approach/avoidance measurements (test-subjects also completed an approach-avoidance task) from the rest of the test data and the theoretical connections between the different factors that are supposed to underlie the measurements.  Other related questions:  What is the support for a global personality factor?  What is understood about interactions between personality types or traits? "
3110,What is the fear/paralysis that occurs before doing an irreversible action?,"I often experience paralysis in the face of an irreversible decision or action. What is the term for this or what is it that I'm looking for to describe it and/or research it?  Some examples of this feeling:   Leaving for a trip: if I forgot something, once I'm at the airport it'll be too late to go back Throwing a garbage bag in a dumpster: if I dropped my phone in the garbage at some point, I'm never getting it back Dropping a bundle of letters into a mailbox: if I got someone's address wrong, I can't just reach in and pull the letters back out Buying something without a return policy: if I don't like it, I'm never getting that money back About to jump out of a plane (e.g., skydiving): if I don't like the feeling, I can't just hop back on the plane immediately   I was listening to a podcast in which this was referred to as the ""call of the void"". However, the (not) ever-reliable Urban Dictionary describes the call of the void as the ""what if I jumped"" thought, which seems different somehow.  This question is related to (but I think not a duplicate of) the Paradox of Choice, which, as I understand it, states that when people are given more choices, they tend to have difficulty making the decision and are often dissatisfied with the choice they made. It seems this anxiety I'm describing has more to do with the irreversible nature of the decision or action. "
3111,Do Kahneman–Tversky results hold for longer periods and aggregate behavior?,"Kahneman and Tversky (1979) show findings that can be summarized in this plot:    They show that humans dislike losses ""more"" than they like comparable nominal gains. The results come from a series of brief experiments.  Can these results be valid in the following situations?   A loss or gain is a one-time event, but the impact (negative or positive disutility) persists and affects decisions over days, weeks? Losses or gains across multiple individuals lead to a decrease or increase in (hypothetical) aggregate utility, without cancelling each other.   That is, if workers become unemployed in a recession, can we apply the Kahneman–Tversky framework to explain, say, their likely protests (and it's not enough to restore their incomes because the loss is overweighted)?  Or from the point of psychology, a wage loss looks differently? To clarify the latter, a wage loss leads to a series of negative events, each of which has a negative impact. But does this chain still yield the effect similar to the depicted one, as we sum up the impacts?  Alternatively, how often does the reference point tend to refresh itself, so that we could treat the next event as happening at (0, 0) in the plot and not just as an add on to the previous event?  The framework is not so literal, anyway; but maybe the question still makes sense at the given level of abstraction.

3112,Attitude to judge and avoid efforts,"I've opened a question trying to point out every doubt I had on a language of development: I thought it could be constructive.  I'm pretty proud of the formulation of this question since it gives almost nothing as understood. While I was studying math at university many books were giving many concept as known.  At the moment in which I'm writing 5 persons downvoted the question saying: ""How about learning something about 1) JavaScript objects ({}), 2) jQuery callbacks 3) jQuery plugins?""  Actually there is a cognitive error in this sentence. He thinks (opinion) that I've lacked of effort, but actually I've studied Javascript at the university (fact). I've also tried to google for it (fact), but without the exact knowledge of what to look for I could not find an explanation. I'm making an assumption interpreting his sentence.  Another guy simply answered in a constructive way.  I think that this cognitive error is pretty diffuse. How is it called? Is it an attribution error? Can it be motivated by the need for feeding self-esteem while putting no effort in making something constructive? "
3113,How do features of the work environment such as type of pen or color of paper influence productivity and workplace well-being?,"Background: Recently I have been doing mathematics a whole lot,and I have noticed that my output varies wildly from many external factors,but mostly it is the enviorment I am working in. Namely one of the most unexpected things is that most my output depends on the quality of pen I am using and kind of notebook I am writing in. Last day I went to buy new notebooks and I laid my eyes upon one with especially distinguishing blue-white color scheme,and in my mind it was already set that it will be notebook I will write abstract algebra into,and truly while using that notebook I feel really motivated, it feels like the color of it and the subject of abstract algebra are intertwined in my brain.  Questions:   What is the phenomena called where features of the work environment such as type of pen or color of paper influence productivity or workplace well-being?  How can such features be used to improve productivity?  "

In other words, I'm wondering if there's a language learning advantage to growing up in a bilingual home. If that is the case, what about for families that speak 3 languages or more? "
3115,How to study the effect of sustained exercise and sport on well-being?,"I´d like to make a little case study about the impact of including regular weight training in life. I know one man who is going to start to excercise regularly and I have an opportunity to talk with him regularly (for example every month) for about six months, maybe longer. Is there any other option of making this research than via regular interview with direct questions about his view of the impact of sports in his life (for example question: What do you think you´ve learned from training?)?  I mean - If I will watch for example self-esteem and it will grow, how can i know it grew thanks to sports and not because of any other change in his life? How to relate any watched cathegory to the regular training? "
3116,Have the effects of MRIs and other electromagnetic devices on human psychology been studied?,"What are the effects of MRIs and other electromagnetic devices on the human brain? Naturally they could move metals to or through the brain cell's membrane. I can also see the experience of being in a strange position, meditating, and attempting to be as still as possible for an hour and a half, might cause some long term effect. Have the effects of MRIs and other electromagnetic devices been studied comparatively on human psychology or neurology? Could you also mention the mental health aspects? "
3117,How do we localize pain?,"I know that different points of the brain correspond to different point of the body. But how a sensory information reaches its correct corresponding area?  For example, let say I put a pencil's extremity on position A of the thumb tip and then on position B always of the thumb tip.  How do I discriminate between A and B? Does these electrical activities travel trough two completely different pathways? "
3118,"Is being ""hyper""-offended, no matter the cause, an indicator that someone might be a socio-/psychopath?","Suppose I make the following statement: ""There should be no quota for women or minorities in any sort of company, people should be hired based on their capabilities, regardless of their gender or skin color"".  There are people who are going to disagree with that. There could be a discussion about it and things could be learned from said discussion, while people respect each other's rights to have a different opinion.  And then there are going to be people who not only disagree, but claim to be offended by it in such a way that they feel it necessary to try and ruin people's lives for adhering to said opinion. Who will try to find your personal information and post it online in the hopes that someone attacks you for sharing said opinion. This is a practice known as ""doxxing"". They will send anonymous death threats and go to sites like reddit or forums which have a userbase which they agree with, share the URL in which you stated this opinion, in an attempt to get as many people as possible in on trying to destroy your life.  These people seem to believe this vigilante behavior is somehow justified and necessary. That instead of discussion and education and even questioning their own beliefs, the way to achieve your goals is by eradicating all opposition.  So my question is: is this system of going after someone because they have an opinion you don't like, a indicator of a psychological disorder? If so, which one?  And finally, where do people learn that this is acceptable behavior? "
3119,Influence of antidepressant drugs upon personality,"How do antidepressant drugs influence someone's personality?  Do they induce a major change in an individual's personality, or do they just negate the influence of depression?  Basically, is the personality of someone taking depressants the same as it would be if they were not subject to the causes of depression in the first place? "
3120,Dynamical systems theory as a metaphor in psychology: is it useful or not?,"Dynamical systems theory as it is used in the context of developmental psychology, and by some psychoanalysts as in this article or in this video by the first speaker can be described as an attempt to introduce mathematical concepts in the study of psychological phenomena. Unlike other applications of dynamical systems theory, the above seem to use terms like ""attractor"" in an abstract or metaphorical sense, that is, outside of a formal mathematical context.   Is this kind of application useful or just a bunch of preety words, stripped of their real meaning ? Do we have a better understanding of psychological phenomena through such a framework?  "
3121,What is the most comprehensive system of describing human emotions or states of mind?,"Reading about the human mind, I sometimes come across attempts to classify human emotions using various scales. The one that comes to mind most often is the 6 scale circle model shown below.   Is there one or more models of human states of mind or emotions that as of 2014 is most accepted or best regarded by the fields of cogsci/psychology/psychiatry?  To clarify my question - using a model like that, any ordinary experience of ""being"" can be identified as consisting of various shades of different emotions represented by the model. ?    or     or even an attempt to create a periodic table:  "

However for whoever is standing near to those persons the situation can become very annoying  (see Does neuroticism cause people to hurt others?).  The narcissist is often unconscious to have a ""problem"", he simply thinks that the problem comes from others and that his way of thinking should be taken also by others.

3124,Is memory biased towards positive or negative memories?,"I am trying to understand the relationship between positive/negative memories and the congruence of memory to existing beliefs.  These quotes are from Wikipedia, presented in alphabetical order:   Choice-supportive bias: ""positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, whether or not they originally were part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options."" Egocentric bias: ""This bias suggests that people remember the past as they want it to be rather than the way it was"" Fading affect bias: ""a psychological phenomenon in which information regarding negative emotions tends to be forgotten more quickly than that associated with pleasant emotions."" Mood congruent memory bias: ""the improved recall of information congruent with one's current mood."" Mnemic neglect: ""a pattern of selective forgetting in which certain autobiographical memories tend to be recalled more easily if they are consistent with positive self-concept."" Negativity bias: ""the psychological phenomenon by which humans have a greater recall of unpleasant memories compared with positive memories."" Placement bias: ""tendency to remember ourselves to be better than others at tasks at which we rate ourselves above average and tendency to remember ourselves to be worse than others at tasks at which we rate ourselves below average."" Pollyanna principle: ""the tendency for people to remember pleasant items more accurately than unpleasant ones."" Positivity effect: ""older adults' memories are more likely to consist of positive than negative information and more likely to be distorted in a positive direction."" Rosy retrospection: ""refers to the finding that subjects later rate past events more positively than they had actually rated them when the event occurred"" Self-verification: ""self-views bias memory recall to favor self-confirming material over non-confirming elements.""   Most of these suggest congruence with existing beliefs rather than a strict positive bias, but since ""on the balance, most people tend to view themselves positively,"" and most people are happy, it makes sense that there would be a positivity bias overall.  The oddball in the above list is Negativity bias, that appears to contradict other findings.  Another exception is Mnemic neglect: ""mnemic neglect is based on self-protection rather than self-verification"" - ie, there is a strict positive bias, rather than a congruence with existing beliefs, in direct contradiction with research in Self-verification and others.  I think the resolution of these apparent contradictions is in the details: Is the memory about personal experience or just memorizing items?  Is the memory self-referent or otherwise?  Is the bias referring to memory encoding or memory recall?  Is it an issue of missing or distorted memories?  So my question is, is anyone aware of any studies that look at the circumstances under which memory bias is strictly positive, congruent with existing beliefs, strictly negative, or unaffected by mood or belief?  Or failing that, a comprehensive review of memory bias that might clarify this? "
3125,Why has behaviourism fallen out of favour?,"The reasons for behaviourism as a philosophy and school of psychology to have fallen out of favour are well known and documented.  However, when Newton's view of gravity was replaced by general relativity, his entire works were not then tossed aside as if discredited.  But this is, practically speaking, what has happened to behaviourism.  Beahviourism has always focused on learning-based mechanisms (eg, conditioning, role modelling, enculturation) that are highly evidence-based, repeatable, and generalizable.  Today, cognitive / computational-model theories dominate many fields, but their explanatory approach rarely considers learning-based theories traditionally associated with behaviourism.  Why is that?  More specifically, my question is:  Have there been any surveys or studies asking cognitive psychology researchers whether or not they incorporate learning mechanisms in their theories, and why or why not?  A nice article I ran across suggests some reasons why cognitive research may not consider learning mechanisms, but it is purely speculative, with no data to back anything up.  Today, behaviourism continues to thrive in the form of behaviour analysis, and its history is regularly taught as part of introductory psychology courses.  However, while other branches of cognitive science often collaborate (as for example cognitive psychology and neuroscience forming cognitive neuroscience), behaviourism's learning models are rarely incorporated into other works.  The founding ideologies of the radical version of this school of psychology have long been discredited, but ignoring over a century of highly productive research into an influential branch of cognitive science seems to me like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Note: Questions like this tend to attract opinion-based answers, that are discouraged on this forum.  Despite the catchy title, I am interested in evidence-based answers, and the bolded question suggests the kind of evidence that could be pertinent.  Note: Examples of well-established cognitive theories with evidence of learning but yet fail to incorporate learning mechanisms in their explanatory approach include: Cognitive dissonance, emotion, self-serving bias, and metacognition.

3126,Can a person with multiple personality disorder have one of their personality based on a real person?,"Can a person with multiple personality disorder have one of their personality based on a real person encountered during their lifetime? For example, in a family with multiple children, can one of the children with multiple presonality disorder have one of their personas be a ""clone"" of sibling? If so, how close are the two, and more interestingly, what happens when the two meet?  This question is related to this one about isolated internal representation of people, and potentially to the phenomenon of imprinting  "

How do the math skills of those with ADHD compare to others? As above, please explain in detail from a biochemical perspective.  "
3128,Detecting signs of dementia in EEG signal,"I would like to know, how dementia can be recognized in the EEG signal of patients with dementia.  What I have found so far:  According to (Henderson et al., 2006) subjects with dementia are characterized by a decrease in high frequencies, and an increase of the low frequencies in the EEG.   Are there any more characteristics in the EEG that could be used to detect dementia? Which channels of the EEG will be more influenced by dementia? "
3129,Where is motor skill function located within the brain?,"Does the neural activity that correlates with motor skill function tend to be focused near or far from the outer surface of the brain, or both? And what about perception?  My deeper curiosity being: I'd conjecture that the first is either near the surface or both, given the ability of technology now to read input directly from the brain in order to move virtual objects.

3130,Do hormonal factors cause a trend of lower IQ in women?,"This is a hard question to ask without coming off as a sexist, merely via the title, so I'd like to make one thing clear right away: I understand that men and women have an identical capability of developing intelligence on perfectly equal levels. I'm not expressing that I think any one woman is any less capable of equal or greater intelligence compared to any man.   With that said, I understand that the human mind is a very dynamic tool that can be excersised and developed. Just like after never lifting a weight in my life, I wouldn't be capable of walking in and bench press 350, I can't expect to have an IQ of 130 all in a sudden after never once putting my mind to solving a tough problem.   In my life experience, I've met highly intelligent people, both men and women. However I've noticed a strong trend of women having far less interest in the very problem solving that defines one's IQ. I have put some thought into this, and after learning that men and women have identical brains for the most part, I assumed the trend must be due to hormonal differences, causing women to spend far more time on emotional thought processes rather than on problem solving.   Am I completely wrong? Partially wrong? I'm not an expert in cognitive sciences, so I ask this question with an open mind. Thanks!  Edit: This question hasn't been received well. See my comment on an answer below for a brief explanation of my thinking. Basically I'm either asking the wrong things, or in the wrong place. I'm not trying to be sexist though. I genuinely want to study the topic in order to understand, in the best interest of women, whom I find aren't engaging as much as men are in intellectual topics.  "
3131,If a person constantly invalidates your feelings is he/she a narcissist?,"If someone constantly invalidates your experiences and feelings does that mean they are a narcissist?  For example, if I am really hurt by someone and I go to a friend for support and my friend always invalidates everything I tell them does that mean they lack empathy? The interaction is always confusing and the fact of the matter is always deflected. They say things like 'I'm sure he didn't mean it. That wasn't his intention. etc.' Always!  Is that a sign of narcissism? They can't feel the pain themselves or they can't see it so they dismiss it?  But they say they care then impose what they think you should feel onto you. Self-absorbed?  "
3132,Is there a psychological concept about erratic (long term) memorisation?,"I'm asking as much to improve my study skills as out of curiosity.  Is there any research into when memorisation fails? Specifically, why the same person can sometimes routinely fail to remember things, and at other times have a very good memory?  Perhaps a difference between a robust and large short term memory? "
3133,What causes dopamine in our body,I was curious as to know what are the natural causes for the secretion of dopamine in our body.   Are there any specific foods that increases the dopamine level?  It is said that dopamine are usually high when you are in love is that a myth or a fact?   How does dopamine affect ones behavior/mood? 
3134,Which theories explain that given a choice of hard and easy tasks one would pick the easy one?,"Which theories deal with cost benefit analysis? For example, given a binary choice of hard and easy tasks (eg. Picking low hanging fruit, stealing what is not bolted down, cheating on a test, taking a spacial shortcut/jaywalking) one would exhibit preference towards the easy one. How can that be explained from behavioral, evolutionary or cognitive perspective? I need studies or names. "
3135,Why do Spiritual people try to sleep less?,"In Monasteries and other spiritual contexts, there seems to be a ""rule"" that sleep is wasted time, and so the usual daily schedule only allows for about 4-5 hours of sleep. This might be enough for an 80-year-old, but anyone else will probably be sleep-deprived and not very functional, let alone be able to make any spiritual progress.  I asked about whether adults can get by with less sleep, and got no answers. Does anyone know why spiritual scenarios seem to try to reduce sleep hours? One thought is that people think it is associated with laziness, indolence, lethargy, unproductive time, idleness, sloth, etc. But no one tries to reduce food intake, or use of the toilet, so why is sleep the big bad guy? "
3136,Emotional detachment as a reaction can be considered an aggressive behavior?,"Social Rejection from Wikipedia     rejection can be passive, by ignoring a person, or giving the ""silent   treatment"".   Is it possible to say that the victim of a verbal aggression who hide or repress (negate) the negative emotions like fear, anger, sadness through the emotional detouchment showing himself as secure, not hurted can lead the other to feel impotent and thus become even more aggressive to get an emotional reaction?  Can emotional detachment be considered as a dysfunctional behavior for the victim of a verbal aggression? Opposed to demanding empathy.   Emotional detachment can be considered a kind of hostile / aggressive behavior?  EDIT  Is there any evidence that most of people would suffer from these kind of other's behaviours so that they can be considered a way to hurt people? "
3137,Do gating mechanisms in the neocortex have individual degrees for all gated connections?,"For example, the upward connection between layers in the neocortex flows through the thalamus which is assumed to have a gating function.  I wonder whether there is a single value per gate, determining the degree to which patterns can pass. Or can the gate be different for different synapses or signals at the same time? In this case, there would be more like a vector of degrees for all individual synapses of the gated nerve cord.  Is there anything known about this? "
3138,Links between biases and personality?,"I was thinking of how a lot of people are biased against overweight people. .  One of the answers considers how we tend to ""take part"" with those that remind us of ourselves, and we are biased against those who seem different from us. This should imply that a person who is biased against overweight people is a person who considers him/herself ""not one of the overweight people"". This further implies that the biases a person has, says something about his/her identity.   Is there any research on what characterizes people who are biased against any specific group of people? Is there any kind of research on what characterizes people prone to any specific bias?  "
3139,"Research on ""probabilistic thinking"" in non-human animals?","We all seem to have a ""probabilistic sense"", which manifests itself in certain types of expectations (e.g. even if one has never used a bow to shoot an arrow, one expects that hitting a small target will be more difficult than hitting a large target, all other things being equal), and also in certain characteristic responses when events do not match those expectations (these responses consist primarily of surprise, but also include suspicion, and in extreme cases maybe even awe or fear).  For me at least, this probabilistic sense feels subjectively very fundamental, in the same way that physical pain, hunger, thirst, etc., ""feel fundamental"".  In other words, I could not describe them to someone in simpler terms.  (I may be able to explain to someone the mechanics of shooting an arrow with a bow, but I would not know how to explain to someone how to feel the immediate intuition that hitting a small target would be harder than hitting a large one.)  Motivated by the kind of questions that follow, I'm looking for a review of research on ""probabilistic thinking"" by non-human animals.  How analogous is this ""probabilistic sense"" to the more traditional    (""classical"") senses like vision and touch? In particular, how much does it depends on human culture?  I've searched for these keywords online, but I have not come up with anything.  Maybe I'm not using the right keywords.  Also, since probabilistic methods as standard tools in research (and hence, the research literature is awash in terms like ""probability"", ""expectation"", ""Bayesian"", ""statistical"", etc.), it is very difficult to craft searches that are selective for the research I'm looking for.  Some specific pointers (i.e., to specific papers, or books, or at least specific researchers) would be appreciated.    FWIW, the clearest example I can come up with to illustrate what I mean by ""probabilistic thinking"" is this thought experiment.  Imagine presenting a human subject the opportunity to participate in a raffle for some prize that the subject finds desirable, and suppose the subject is just told that he/she has the choice of having (A) one, or (B) two tickets for the raffle (at no cost in either case).  We would expect, of course, that every ""normal"" subject would prefer (B) over (A).  (In fact we would question the sanity (or at least the seriousness and sincerity) of any subject who fully understood the situation, and still preferred (A) over (B).)  What makes the universal preference for (B) an example of ""probabilistic thinking"" is the simultaneous recognition on the subject's part that choice (B) is unequivocally better, and that still it could fail to lead to the prize, even if the raffle had only three tickets.  I'm not sure how one would go about setting such an experiment with non-human animals, but I've been impressed before by the ingenuity of the experiments that researchers devise to test animal cognition, so I remain hopeful that something like the ""probabilistic thinking"" I illustrate above has been investigated.  That said, I realize that it would be rather difficulty is to distinguish between pure ""probabilistic thinking"" (as a distinct, independent faculty) and conditioning.  In fact, it can be (and has been) argued that what I'm calling ""probabilistic thinking"" is nothing more than a special case of conditioning.  (After all, conditioning may be thought of as the nurturing of certain expectations, and preferring two tickets over one could be simply a manifestation of one such expectation.)  Ironically enough, when it comes to humans, I can't think of any ethical experiment that would be able to establish ""probabilistic thinking"" as a faculty that would be present even in the absence of any conditioning.  With animal subjects, however, it may be possible to set up experiments that minimize the possible confounding by conditioning. "

Will I be more motivated with one good friend or with a group of the same interested people during group exercise?  Does group size affect our internal motivation? (starting by size of 2 people up to X)  Where are bounds for the worst motivation, average motivation and the best motivation for physical workout? (or we can discuss other activities as well)   My input: I'm just thinking about competition feelings in bigger group of people when my brain is saying something like this: ""I have to be better than everyone else.""   This question doesn't need to be exclusively bound to the gym workout. "

If yes, where can I find some material to explore that is suitable for undergraduate level understanding? In particular, is there any audio contennt on this?  "
3144,What are new and exciting research areas or applications in systems neuroscience?,"Like the title says, what are new and exciting research areas or applications in systems neuroscience? I know the question is a broad one, so let me narrow it down a bit:  I will get my master's degree in about year from now. Currently, I have published two papers related to fMRI data analysis. I'm also familiar with PET. So, I am actually looking for a topic for my PhD.  I have considered taking part in some existing research group at my university, but to be honest, I'm not really excited about what they are doing. It seems to me that they are reinventing things (which I think is also evident from their publications records - for example, my current advisor's publications have not received much citations expect from herself).  So, the problem is that I know the basic things in my field, but nothing that could be the next big thing.  I would like to have a PhD topic on something that is new, and has potential. Any suggestions? "
3145,What is the consequence for the MBTI in not having a neuroticism factor?,"This very interesting question: Do the Jungian Cognitive Functions/ Processes really exist? is dealing with neuroscientific attempts to show Jungian functions and preferences exists. In addition to that question can someone explain the following ""Escher infinite staircase"" situation.   MBTI is not exactly Jungian theory because they added judging perceiveing dimension. Also there is not neuroticism measured. [website]MBTI and Big Five is possible to link as same psychological test in research by Costa and McCrea: [website]Question:  How is the MBTI possible without neuroticism? "
3146,What is understood about interactions between personality types or traits?,"There are several psychological tests based on Jungian typology (e.g., MBTI, Insights &amp; DISC) which extrapolate findings about personality into how those types interact (e.g., interaction styles). It is claimed that these tests can predict cooperation, conflict, and so on. However, there are also several three and five dimensional personality tests which are presumably more accurate.  My questions are:   Is there any research on interactions between personality traits based on the Big 5, EPQ, or 16PF? Are interactions between Jungian types scientifically supported or is it an example of the  Forer effect?  "
3147,Is dominance a hypothetical construct or is it based in neurobiology?,There are several personality tests which have dominance as trait or type as result. In addition to this question: How to measure dominance and submissiveness?   How are dominant types constructed in tests? Does it consist of one factor or multiple factors? Is there any neurobiology research as to what is dominance or what parts of brain is in charge of it?  
3148,Are motivation and efficiency inversely correlated?,"Observation: Motivation and efficiency seem appear to me to be inversely correlated for most people. That is, I know some people who tend to get very excited about a goal and take large amounts of action but fail to plan efficiently, so a large chunk of their work is wasted. Conversely I know a lot of people who can plan and take action efficiently but tend to do comparatively less work (and I tend to fall into this category.)  Questions:    Is motivation and efficiency inversely correlated? If so, is there a biological/neuroscientific reason for this?    For example, perhaps willpower is a finite resource, so that planning literally uses up the energy you have to do other work. "
3149,To what extent does the awarness of the presence of others affect brain function and cognitive state?,"This scope pertains to non-life threatening interactions and the awareness of the presence of a single or multiple individuals - (not direct conversation, not group mentality) just the presence.  To what extent does the presence of others affect brain function, emotion and cognitive state?  What are the differences within the host that cause certain individuals to evoke stronger cognitive changes vs. those that evoke weaker changes?   What are the changes in state when one is completely sure nobody is around?  Are there any studies that measure this or show what a reasonable standard deviation would be for this phenomenon?  In addition, what are the factors that allow the host to completely block any changes in cognition regardless of the presence of others? (i.e. - higher serotonin, larger frontal cortex, etc?) "
3150,How to restore and maintain a healthy sleep pattern?,"Background: Some people over holiday periods or weekends get into sleep patterns that involve waking up very late in the day (e.g., 1pm), and then going to bed quite late (e.g.,, 4am). Such people can find it very difficult to bring back their sleep pattern to be in line with more regular day time rhythms (i.e., waking up between 6am and 10am). When earlier wake-up is attempted, this can result in feelings of fatigue and low mood.  Such attempts can even fail, when the person sleeps through the alarm clock.  General questions:   How can a sleep pattern be effectively re-aligned with normal day time rhythms? What are effective strategies for maintaining a regular sleep pattern? Is there any specific research on what strategies work best?  "
3151,How effective are multiphasic sleep schedules?,Does multiphasic sleep work well enough that it can be used as a replacement for monophasic sleep?  Has there been any research done on people that have used bi/polyphasic sleep for extended periods of time?  Do multiphasic sleep schedules require different eating patterns? 
3152,"Can bipolar disorder be considered a malfunction of the ""love circuit"" in the human brain?","I've not so long ago read a book on depression by a Russian psychiatrist Vladimir Levi. The book's title can be roughly translated as ""Not only depression, but a pursuit of mood"". I have not been able to find an english translation, so I cannot quote it directly.  In that book, the author lists several examples of love-related depression, where a person who drops out of a love relationship experiences symptoms of moderate to severe depression.   This got me thinking - love is often portrayed as the ""ultimate goal"" in religion, popular culture, movies, etc. The psychiatrist above provides examples that losing love can result in depression. Another condition that is characterized by dramatic uplift in mood and outlook on life is the hypomania stage of Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar disorder is characterized by multiple episodes of hypomania/mania and depression over the course of a lifetime.  Putting both phenomena together, it appears to me that there are similarities, and I'd like to ask these questions:  -Does bipolar disorder use the same mechanisms/pathways in the brain that ""love"" does?  -If so, can bipolar disorder be considered a malfunction of the ""love circuit"" in the human brain?  UPDATE: I found this article on neurochemistry of loVe on Wikipedia      Chemically, the serotonin effects of being infatuated have a similar   chemical appearance to obsessive-compulsive disorder; which could   explain why people experiencing infatuation cannot think of anyone   else.[12] For this reason some, such as anthropologist Helen Fisher,   assert that taking SSRIs and other antidepressants impede one's   ability to fall in love.   From the article on love:     Studies in neuroscience have involved chemicals that are present in   the brain and might be involved when people experience love. These   chemicals include: nerve growth factor,[8] testosterone, estrogen,   dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin.[9   From the Wikipedia article on bipolar disorder causes     A review seeking to identify the more consistent findings suggested   several genes related to serotonin (SLC6A4 and TPH2), dopamine   (DRD4 and SLC6A3), glutamate (DAOA and DTNBP1), and cell growth   and/or maintenance pathways (NRG1, DISC1 and BDNF), although noting   a high risk of false positives in the published literature.

3153,Neural Mechanisms of Accumulation and Triggering,"What is the mechanism by which the brain/mind 'accumulates' a felt-sense to a point of 'triggering' an action?  For example, if unable to complete a task (e.g. opening packaging), a person can feel increased frustration for each attempt at the task.  Eventually, the level of frustration will reach a 'trigger-point' and a compensatory action ('will you open it for me?') can occur.  I see this in many areas of human life (though frustration is the most common/obvious example), so I would suspect that it's a general principle of neural action than a specific mechanism of tracking sensory perceptions.  Also, apologies for any unclear language or concepts.  I will happily rewrite if necessary.  [EDIT]: For clarity, I'm more curious about the 'accumulation' and less about the 'triggering'.  Also, with regards to accumulation, I'm particularly curious about accumulation over longer time periods.  So, not just task-specific frustration (as an example), but also things such as life skills.    So, another example: talking to a specific person, you notice that they have some behavioral quirk that irks you.  Over time, you feel more and more irked by this quirk.  (Hrmm.. irk, quirk, maybe I need different words...), to the point where you avoid interacting with this person due to their irksome quirk.  I am semi-assuming that the mechanism involves an increase in conscious or subliminal attention to the offending perception, thus creating a sensation of increased salience of the stimulus.  But...I don't want to assume too far, and I'm curious if the subject has been formally explored. "
3154,"Is there a part of the human brain responsible for triggering imagination, fantasy and coming up with unusual stories?","I'm trying to understand if there's a specific process or part of the human brain which, when activated, causes the person to daydream, engage in fantasy or come up with ideas that are far from common reality? In other words, what is the trigger that initiates imagination process?  Examples   Looking at the clouds and guessing their shapes - there's no animals, unicorns or majestic castles in the sky - there are clouds, but the brain still comes up with unusual explanations.  Thinking about ""What would I do if I was teleported back in time"" or ""what if I had super powers"". I'm interested in what causes this slip into daydreaming. When a person in love is fantasizing about a romantic partner and attributes all kinds of traits to them. Once again, some kind of trigger modifies thinking pattern.    Question  The phenomenon I'm talking about might be related to when people suddenly start to think about all kinds of stuff, real or imaginary upon going to bed (which prevents them from falling asleep).  It seems to me that all of these share a common theme, and I'm trying to learn if they are bound by some physical process or part of the brain.   This question is related to this question about factors that trigger creative thought in humans "
3155,"What is the neurobiological basis of the ""inner voice"" used for thought or reading?","I've recently experienced a number of hypnogogic near sleep states characterized by change in thinking (stage 1-2 sleep). I noticed that if I let go and get absorbed in the state, I can follow it.  I can describe the hypnogogic sensation as a feeling of empty space without a definite boundary. Typically the state arises at 17-23 minutes after bedtime (I'm using a timer to check). However, as soon as I activate ""inner voice"" or think a thought spoken in that voice, those other near sleep states get completely suppressed. Literally, a single word disrupts these states.  This makes me interested what happens in the brain when a person thinks using a single threaded, spoken train of thought? (""I'm typing a question on cogsci right now"" or ""I'm reading a question right now"") Is there some part of the brain that gets activated while others get suppressed? In particular I'm interested why spoken thought suppresses other non-verbal states that a brain can consciously experience?     Internal monologue, also known as inner voice, internal speech, or   verbal stream of consciousness is thinking in words. It also refers to   the semi-constant internal monologue one has with oneself at a   conscious or semi-conscious level.   It would be interesting to know if there's some difference that fMRI can show between a brain that's reading using voice and brain that's reading non-verbally.   I recall reading about similar phenomenon in the eastern spiritual traditions, like Taoism or Buddhism, where the states of mind they are trying to achieve are also incompatible with inner voice. "
3156,Why do people behave better when observed?,"Why does it seem that people behave like they are supposed to when they are being observed?  For example. If you place a fake security camera on an employee, they would behave better (or at least appear to).  Alternatively, when a system or workflow becomes transparent, it seems to me that people would make an extra effort to do better since they are more exposed.  Is there any particular identified effect, cognitive bias, or phenomenon that describes the reasons behind this change of behavior? "
3157,"What causes introverts to lose ""energy"" in social settings and require recovery afterwards?","Over the years I've seen numerous articles about introverts that mention that they dislike large social interactions (meetings, parties, etc) because they drain their energy. These articles mention that it can take days or weeks to recharge this energy.   This is anecdotal evidence, but I've personally felt it twice in the last week, which peaked my interest. A good way to describe this phenomena is - after a couple hours of large corporate meeting, the energy is gone, and I feel demotivated and just want to go home. ""Feeling drained"" is another good way to put it.   Are there scientific theories about what is causing introverts to lose energy in social settings? Is it related to mirror neurons? Is it related to a particular neurotransmitter system in the brain? Maybe it is related to a specific neurotransmitter receptor mutations?  Edit:   I found this relevant question that asks for the name of the ""introverts losing energy"" phenomenon. It mentions the following terms:   Social overload Social exhaustion Decision fatigue Over stimulated  "
3158,Are cognitive biases hardwired in the brain or they are acquired during lifetime?,"The Kahneman–Tversky interpretation of biases as deviation from rationality was challenged by Gigerenzer on the basis that heuristics help making decisions and, thus, rational from the evolutionary point of view.  But are individuals born with significantly biased judgment as part of their genetic heritage or biases come mainly from early education and later experience?  Given a wide variety of issues implied in this question, maybe you can answer about some biases? "
3159,How does masking work?,"Masking occurs when the delay between the target and the mask is less than a threshhold (say 50 milliseconds). If sensory data passes from lower to higher visual cortices/processing regions as in a linear one way street, how can the mask (which comes later) influence the perception of the target (which moved ahead of the mask)?   So does this mean masking works because the neuro-network consists of nested connections folding back and forth on itself? If so, at what scales do they operate? Do they occur both within higher regions and between higher and lower regions? Do we understand how they work in detail in the case of masking?        I learned that masking is often used as a research tool for subconsciousness/unconsciousness. But maybe neuro-feedback disruted using masking is just one of the many ways subconscious perception can occur? If so, shouldn't we reserve some qualms about general conclusions about subconsciousness/unconsciousness drawn using the masking method?       "
3160,"How many words are toddlers ""making up""?","My 20-month old has learned many words to express herself.  In addition she says many other words that are indecipherable from context nor pronunciation.  It's most noticeable in novel or unusual situations.  Is she inventing words to express the new or not-yet-learned situation?  If so, (until she learns the ""correct"" word), will she continue to use the invented word for a while, or will she invent a different word should the situation recur? What does the literature in developmental psychology have to say about this? "
3161,Does fixing cognitive biases do more harm than use?,"The Kahneman–Tversky interpretation of biases as deviation from rationality was challenged by Gigerenzer on the basis that heuristics help making decisions and, thus, rational from the evolutionary point of view.  What drawbacks of ""fixing"" biases have been empirically confirmed? I mean, avoiding heuristic rules requires more cognitive efforts, which possibly affect really important decisions.  PS: This question was separated from Are cognitive biases hardwired in the brain or they are acquired during lifetime?. "
3162,Do animals have some kind of rudimentary personality types or preferences?,"I'm looking at the Myers Briggs type indicator and am trying to understand if type/personality preferences are a human only construct. I'm talking about Introversion-Extraversion, Sensing or iNtuition, Thinking-Feeling, Judging-Perceiving.   Reading books on personality, human children are frequently described as already having some type preference (for example the intuitive child versus sensing child) which gets developed as the child matures. This makes me question as to where this original preference comes from. If it comes from some brain structure, I'm interested if lower animals also have these structures.  I know that animals have alpha/beta males which determines social dominance, but are there other personality traits that have been identified in animals?   For example, a common proverb is ""curiosity killed the cat"" - are some cats more curious than others? Are some specimens of the same species more sociable (extraverted) than others?   Another example would be  experiments in primates, where monkeys were able to deceive their peers.  "
3163,'Always Give a Reason Why' - How to describe this subject area?,"I summarise [website]  In Dr. Robert Cialdini’s book, Influence, he cites a research study showing that simply adding the word “because” to a request multiplies the likelihood of compliance.      Interestingly, the study seems to indicate that the legitimacy of the reasons supplied did not seem as important to the outcome as you might suppose. In fact, it seems hardly necessary to have a real reason at all.      For example, you might ask to cut line at the post office, and be more likely to get a “yes” response from the person in front of you if you simply frame your question by saying something like, “Would it be possible for me to please cut a front of you in line, because I’m really in a hurry.”   I recognise the lack of substantiated evidence in the above quote, but I'm interested in learning about such empirically, scientifically proven behaviour and human psychology (eg through reputable peer-reviewed articles). To clarify, I seek not the hard data itself, but only conclusions and tips supported by credible evidence. I only chanced upon that above link, so to discover more in this area methodically and productively,  what are some key words terming this subject? Where should I start?   I've no training in sciences, so I'd cherish answers and advice written in lay, simple, readable language.  "
3164,Why is sunrise therapeutic?,"Despite being a night owl, I find when I'm up and about at sunrise1 I feel mentally much better than any other time of day - regardless of how much sleep I've had or whether I've been awake for many hours prior to sunrise. Indeed I'd almost imagine getting up for dawn and then going back to bed would be beneficial in and of itself.  Why is sunrise therapeutic?  And are there reasons above and beyond the circadian rhythm2?  1. Strictly speaking, nautical twilight 2. Since the psychological effect of sunrise can apply even when jet lagged or are so frequently a night owl that prior reinforcement of experience is unlikely. "
3165,What is the name of a cognitive bias by which existing facts are tailored to fit a personal hypothesis?,"What is the name of a cognitive bias where a person takes all of their knowledge of a particular subject (at a point in time) and arranges it in a hypothesis or world model that makes sense to that individual?  In particular I'm thinking of Sigmund Freud and his work on the interpretation of dreams. It seems to me that he took what he knew at the time and arranged it in a hypothesis, selectively including or excluding facts to the point where he deemed just about everything in dreams, from hats to stairs to buildings and mountains in dreams as referring to sexual content.    I believe that Freud himself, in his book mentions that before him people were evaluating dreams as various influences of spirits or divines. A modern researcher might interpret dreams as a product of interaction of brain regions and neurotransmitter systems.   Is this a cognitive bias or a general way in which a certain kind of brain (rational temperament) works? "
3166,"If stimulus triggers dopamine release, can dopamine release trigger memory recall of stimulus?","Modern science of sleep is starting to lean towards a viewpoint that dopamine has an important function in dreaming, and that dopaminergic pathways - mesolimbic and mesocortical are activated during dreaming.   Here's what the list of functions that dopamine is responsible for in the human brain:      Inside the brain, dopamine plays important roles in motor control,   motivation, arousal, cognition, and reward, as well as a number of   basic lower-level functions including lactation, sexual gratification,   and nausea.   With this in mind, I'm posing the following question: Can random activation of dopaminergic system during dreaming cause dreams of stimuli which activated dopaminergic system during waking state? In other words, if perceiving sexual stimuli triggers dopaminergic system activation, can similar activation during dreaming cause recollection of the sexual stimuli?  To simplify:    Seeing erotic image -> causes dopaminergic system activation Activation of dopaminergic system -> can it cause recall of erotic image or some other experience from the list above?   Has there been any research into what happens when a person's dopaminergic system (mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of Ventral Tegmental Area) is artificially stimulated (like during brain surgery) - does this cause recall of experiences, desires or cravings or other things people ""want""?  "
3167,Why does injury cause brief unconsciousness?,"I suppose I'm thinking specifically about head injuries, though this question applies to any injury that causes unconsciousness for, say, a few minutes. If you would revive so soon, why would you fall unconscious in the first place? What exactly is happening physiologically during brief unconsciousness? Is it a sort of healing process? Once you're unconscious in cases like this, what causes revival? Also, is such unconsciousness on the same spectrum as coma, physiologically, or do they have different causes and/or mechanisms? "
3168,Studies on visually recognizable personality traits?,"Are there any studies on the possibility of visually recognizing someone's personality? When I say ""visually recognizing"" I mean things like clothes, accessories, body attitude, visible behavior, vehicles driven etc. When I say personality I mean things like Big 5 traits, personal motivations (money, love, attention, etc) and life goals (die rich, have a happy family, have high career, etc).  For instance, I realized that big seller personalities (loves money, loves attention, will lie for any sale, loves to manipulate) would wear (or want) a gold watch. So when you see someone wearing a gold watch there is a high chance the person is a big seller-personality.  In general, I would claim that everyone spends the most money, the most time and the most attention on what is most important to them. But what is the most important owned properties for different personalities? "

3170,Is this Auditory Processing Delay?,"Would a person exhibiting some of these symptoms be a candidate for Auditory Processing Delay, or does it possibly suggest some other sort of diagnosis?  Some basic symptoms/examples:   A seeming inability to follow directions.  When zipping a suitcase the other day, subject was instructed to, ""Open the top compartment and close the side.""  Subject opened both up.  When asked, ""Can you repeat what I just said to you?""  He paused, correctly repeated the instructions and understood his error. An almost comic inability to remember song lyrics or tunes.  He is completely tone deaf and can't even recall simple children's songs, even after excessive amounts of repetition. While carrying some boxes last week, subject was about to crash into some things.  Someone shouted, ""Watch out!"" and he kept walking, knocking over some things.  When questioned after, he said, ""I didn't know what that meant!""  ""Stop?"" was suggested, ""Do anything but continue doing what you're doing?""  ""I guess,"" he replied, ""I didn't think of that."" Frequent excuses of ""I forgot"" when given a list of instructions/tasks.  "
3171,Physiological mapping of frustration,What physiological changes are seen in the brain when a person is experiencing frustration? What effects do these changes have on learning?  Optional background: I'm trying to figure out an exploration schedule (exploration = increasing the noise in the action selection neural population) for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and I'm wondering if there's an easy way to base it biologically. 
3172,"Writing system, its future and social importance","I work on a rather specific subject, namely developement and inventing of writing systems (simply - alphabets). For some years it was just a hobby and creative exercise, but with time this hobby developed in a serious work of mine, with a series of very interesting discoveries which could lead in serious improvement of reading performance. First thing which motivated my work was the clear understanding of the fact that the Latin alphabet (Roman 'minuscule') is the most readable system of all existing in the world. So at least one has something to start with. At the same time it is clear that the one and the only objective criteria for the developement is the readability of the system, and that all imposes the task very clearly - the more readable the system is, the better the system is, so we have a strictly definite and objective scale of ""goodness"" of the system.  On the other hand this task is (IMHO) of a great social and knowledge importance. BUT, strangely enough this subject is so little examined and almost does not develop, if at all. So it seems like I am pioneering this knowledge area, since I have never found any serios works or even examination attempts on the subject, well aside one hobbyist site [website]So it turns out that my last succesful ""workmates"" were medieval masters (e.g. Claude Garamond), whom is the development of modern Latin minuscule is ascribed, and who stay ""unbeaten"" almost 500 years! Very interesting topic, but since its a Q&amp;A forum I'll try to put clear questions, which are worrying me much:   From your point of view, how big is the importance of text information in our world by comparison to other media, like audio/visual media, and how the priorities of those types of media will rearrange in the future? What do you think about the fact that there are absolutely no success or significant effort to develop this important tool (writing system) or at least attempt to define guidelines for its developement?

3173,What is the data structure used by the brain to store data?,"As a computer science undergraduate I was wondering if there are any special data structures used by the brain to save data?  I am especially interested in the hash tables data structure. If data are saved in this type of data structure then you could search, insert and delete them in a short time no matter the size of the data (or technically speaking in O(1)).      I was wondering if the brain works in the same way or not?  And if it does, how does it? "

3175,Is meaning-seeking behavior a biological optimization problem?,"In short, I'm interested in cognitive, neuroscientific, biological and/or computational perspectives on what we vaguely refer to as meaning seeking. Of course, this is a large topic, but any information would be highly appreciated.  Background  Humans tend to desire meaning in their lives. While it would be hard to agree on a precise definition of meaning, it often refers to positioning oneself in a way that is compatible with one's beliefs, ambitions and values, allowing the individual to make sense of the world and of himself, and to pursue whatever (often transcendental) goals he considers worthy (i.e. meaningful). In simpler words, meaning could refer to making peace with the perceived reality of the world and with oneself. At first glance, it seems to me that a meaningful existence requires the absence of cognitive dissonances, but I wonder what science would have to say about this, and if there is any empirical basis for claiming this. Or perhaps the questions is misformulated and such behavior should not be put into the domain of meaning?  Possible explanations  A simple evolutionary argument could be that meaning-seeking behavior originates from our impulse to belong (isolation means death), but how do we then explain hermits or dissidents or all other individuals who have effectively made themselves suffer/die in order to uphold meaning in their lives (i.e. dying for one's beliefs)? So the argument that meaning-seeking behavior is a purely evolutionary phenomenon that serves only to maximize one's potential for reproduction doesn't appear sufficient.  Questions   Can meaning seeking be thought of as an optimization problem of some biological parameters on an individual level, e.g. in terms of energy required for various cellular processes, homeostatic gene expression dynamics etc.? For example, depression (which can have an existential origin) is damaging to health and has been linked to epigenetic modifications (Sun et al. 2012), so having a mechanism that would seek to minimize such damage would seem to be beneficial for an organism. Can we construct a more formal definition of meaning that would be less anthropocentric? In other words, how far would we need to curb the definition so that humans would no longer qualify as the only meaning-seeking organisms? Or are we indeed the only species with the required neural capacity to express such behavior? Could modern experimental methods such as EEG, fMRI, gene expression profiling and epigenome sequencing be used to answer some of these questions at least to a degree? E.g. would a comparison of individuals who claim to live a meaningful life vs those who don't make any sense? Of course, even if a some significant differences were observed, an obvious next question would be what caused them, i.e. a mind-body-environment problem ...   I'd be happy to know at least if there are some research groups or labs that try to tackle such questions.  "
3176,When is it defendable to use manifest instead of latent variables in psychological research?,"In psychology, most of the concepts, theories, ideas etc. of interest refer to latent variables, where a latent variable is one that can't be observed directly. Instead, one has to find a manifest variable, which can be observed directly and which can be used as an indicator for the latent variable. Unless there is a perfect indicator (which usually there is not), the measurement of the latent variable contains an error. To estimate the error, latent variable modelling techniques like CFA or Item Response Theory (among others) have been developed.   Latent Variable Theory  Now, it is generally agreed upon that variables like age and gender are manifest. But what is it that makes the difference between a latent and a manifest variable? Borsboom (2008) explicates this difference. In his latent variable theory, the distinction depends on the certainty, with which an inference can be made from the observed data to the variable in question. In this sense, a variable like gender is manifest, because one can infer with certainty if a subject is male or female from his or her answer on a questionnaire. Note that this is possible, even though one has not actually observed the gender of that subject. Borsboom's account of latent variable theory also implies that the status of a variable as latent vs. manifest can change over time, if for example more information becomes accessible. But as long as a variable has proven to be manifest, it remains latent.  It seems to me, then, that pretty much every researcher in psychology should use latent variable modelling techniques, since most of the time it is not at all possible to infer something with certainty. However, this is clearly not the case. There are numerous published articles that use manifest variables and analyze the relationships between them without accounting for measurement error, thereby implicitly making the latent variable in question a manifest variable. (If anyone wants citations for this claim, I will happily provide them.)   Question: Under what circumstances is it defendable to use manifest instead of latent variables in psychological research, even if it is clear that the variables can only be measured with error?

3177,What are the mechanics behind the mind of a conspiracy theorist?,"Conspiracy Theorists, in my opinion, are people I don't like except for some exceptions. However, this question will not be answered with my irrelevant opinions on said people..  Now, here is the question:   Why do conspiracy theorists become conspiracy theorists? Why do they get the ideas that they do? Are they looking for attention? What are the mechanics behind their minds/thought process?   Some conspiracies:   ""Tupac is still  alive, he will come back in year 20(12,13,14)"" ""The New World Order is going to take over the world.""   Do these people warp things like the Illuminati into a conspiracy? What is behind the minds of these people? Is there any prevalence of mental (conditions, disease) among them? Is there any different type of parenting or environment they are raised in?  All of these questions don't need to be answered, but those are the questions running through my mind. "
3178,Is it possible to create artificial thoughts in a childs mind,"What I mean is, is it possible to create memories in a childs mind, memories which a child grows up to remember as real events, when infact those events never happened in real life?  For example:  If a child has a fear of bugs, and has never been bitten by bugs, if I keep telling the child that ""bugs will never bite your arm"".  If I say this phrase every single day to a child, 5 to 10 times a day for a year, what are the chances of that child having a dream that a bug comes up to the child and bites him/her on the arm?  Then when the child grows up, s/he remembers a vague memory of a bug bitting him/her which s/he thinks was a real event which happened in the passed.  Is this sort of this possible? "
3179,Any models that act using both streams of visual processing?,"The Two-Stream Hypothesis, where object properties are processed independently from spatial information, remains the most well established theory of visual processing. However, it concerns me that most models that reference this theory stop at the end of the two streams (as per the cartoon model in the image below); they never say how the mind translates those sources of information into action (i.e. the two arrows in the picture never meet).    Are there models and/or theories out there that try and situate the Two Streams of information into a full perception action cycle?  And if not, then why not (e.g. complexity, better theories, different level of analysis, etc.)?    "
3180,"What do id, ego and super-ego exactly mean?","I don't know much about psychology, but I've heard about Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche, with the three part of the psychic apparatus. However, I couldn't really understand the parts.   As far as I could understand it: the ego is the ""everyday part"" of self: our behaviour, personality and style we use in everyday events and interaction between other people.  With this logic, the super-ego is just an ""ideal""; a human model that we follow either if we want it or don't - and it often, since it depends on our wants, experiences, aims and fears.  But id is something constant, that never changes, and contains our deepest feelings: fear, love, and instincts. Maybe even some hidden knowledges.  So overall: ego is what we are, id is what we ACTUALLY are, and super ego is that what we want to be.   Am I right? Or is it more complex? What exactly is meant by id, ego, and super-ego?  "

Thus, to rephrase:   What does it mean when you get two or more Mechanical Turk participants in a study with the same IP address? What is a general strategy for dealing with such cases? Are there are any references discussing the issue?  "
3182,Why are people afraid of things that they know are harmless or non-existent?,"Why are people afraid of things that they know are harmless or non-existent? For example: Why do horror films/stories leave people scared after they have finished? Someone may see a harmless spider somewhere that isn't even on their property, and still be scared of it. What is the phenomenon behind this? "
3183,What is the cognitive basis for a sudden loss of confidence in social/professional interactions?,"This question is similar to this earlier question, but from a very different viewpoint - what I am asking here is, what is the cognitive basis for a sudden loss of confidence?  For example, if a person has been confidently answering questions in a room of experts, a party or on an online forum (or a Q&amp;A site like here), and encounters negative feedback for what ever reason (and what ever the motive), why is it that some will simply withdraw and become silent?  To put the experience in perspective (note: this is not a request for personal help), when I experience it, it is like the confidence goes out like a light, and only rarely does the 'light' come back on. "
3184,How is age related change in IQ measured if tests use age specific norms?,"In a comment to this question about age related IQ decline in professors and scientists, the following comment was left:     I noticed that lot of IQ tests (RPM or California) have different   norms for age groups. So how do they measure decline of IQ. Is it decline   of IQ as absolute mental strength? Or drop in numbers measured by   specific test? – @ICanFeelIt    I thought I'd phrase it as a specific question here:  If IQ involves age specific norms, how do researchers study age related changes in IQ?  See also this earlier question on age related change in IQ. "
3185,Where to post online psychology studies for participant recruitment?,"A common challenge when running psychological studies is getting enough participants.  Of course, there are many general strategies for recruiting participants, but I was specifically interested in forums and web pages that are specifically designed for posting links about online psychological studies.  For a given forum, are there any rules about what can be posted? is there any indication of the likely response rate?  "
3186,How strong is the need to belong?,"Are there any studies that measure the need to belong?   Does this need vary greatly from person to person or is there a tight deviation?  What would explain why some have very little need to belong vs. those with a very strong need.  Also, to what extent will an individual forgo other needs to fulfill this need? "
3187,Have humans always had problems with motivation and laziness?,"I originally wanted to ask a question ""Is there a drug for motivation or laziness"", but google search revealed that people have been asking this question for years and there's no drug that is currently prescribed to fix those issues.  This makes me interested in the the following question: Did ""motivation issues"" or laziness always exist for humans, or is it something that became a much bigger problem because of the modern lifestyle or cuture?   For example, I'm thinking of peasants of ""ye olde days"", who had to work really hard to get by, or early factory workers, who apparently did 12+ hour shifts from a very early age. Those people had no drugs or cognitive-behavior therapy to correct their issues.   Maybe there's some ""laziness scale"" that could be used to look at historic trends in laziness and motivation?  UPDATE: it would be very interesting to examine if a correlation exists between laziness and workforce moving from working physically/outdoors(ex: farmers) towards working mentally indoors(office workers) over the years.  I would define laziness or motivational issues as ""I will do this tomorrow"" attitude (procrastination) or promising to do something, but delivering excuses as to why the task wasn't done. The task never gets started. "
3188,Dopamine deficiency more frequent in the addiction prone?,"I found this clip about dopamine deficiency.     ...[P]eople with low dopamine activity may be more prone to addiction.   Is the reverse also true? Does susceptibility to addiction (genetic, etc.) have an effect on the likelihood that one may have a dopamine deficit? "
3189,How did the unique features of human intelligence evolve?,"I have been debating the following topic with a friend.   She argues that humans do not descend from chimpanzees or orang-utans, because if we did, such animals would share the same cognitive thinking that humans have. I argue that we do descend from that such animals, and that a high protein diet has allowed early humans to develop a better memory, intelligence, and other mental processes.   Questions   What is the  the real origin of human intelligence?  If non-human animals do have intelligence too, why is their intelligence not as advanced as humans?  "
3190,How can surprise be labelled conscious when mismatch negativity shows that surprise takes place earlier than conscious states?,"Mismatch negativity (MMN) is the brain response to violations of a rule. The MMN peaks at about 100–250 ms after change onset.  If MMN occurs so early, before conscious perception, why is surprise considered a cognitive phenomenon?  Isn't it rather connected with autonomic processes that take place earlier than cognitive process.  Surprise is considered as belonging to cognitive processes. Among emotion theories, the appraisal theory of emotions, considers that there can be no emotion unless I consciously 'label' it. Here I wonder - how can there be any conscious 'labeling' of surprise when MMN shows that surprise takes place earlier than conscious states? If we accept that surprise does not need conscious awareness for taking place then the appraisal theories that connect surprise with unexpected events are mistaken. See Ortony, Reisenzein and many other appraisal theorists on surprise. "
3191,Resource on how to effectively develop within-subjects vignette based study,"Background: Where I used to work fellow researchers used to have a task known as the CV task. The task required participants to answer a number of questions about a set of CVs (e.g., is this a good job applicant, rate various features of the applicant). A set of CVs was generated based on a factorial design. Thus, features of the CV were manipulated such as gender (male vs female) and other characteristics of the applicant.  I'm currently supervising a student where the student is doing a vignette based study (nothing to do with CVs). I realised that I have a lot of implicit ideas about how to design a vignette-based study. However, it would be nice to be able to refer such students to a resource which outlines best practice in vignette design. Relevant issues might include   How many factors to manipulate and how many levels to include How to write vignettes in terms of length, creating variability and authenticity Whether to randomise other elements across the vignettes How to pilot test vignettes How to choose questions to accompany each vignette and so on   Questions   What is a good resource on designing vignette based study? Or alternatively what are a good set of suggestions for writing a vignette based study?  "
3192,"If I have ADHD, how can I focus on programming task for hours?","Already in 9 years, I was identified as ADHD child. I was quite obviously weird.  I can observe many known symptoms of ADHD even now.   I'm unable to focus on stereotypic tasks which results in many failures in work, where I'm usually supposed to assemble electrical devices. I often just stop listening what somebody is talking directly to me. This happens so often that I stopped pretending anything what's so ever. I just say ""Sorry, I wasn't listening. Could you repeat it?"". Friends just repeat it, other people are usually so shocked that they repeat it too. In school, I always used to draw stuff al over my notebooks instead of paying attention. But I think even totally normal people do this. Maybe just not as much.   Now while this all happens, when I have an interesting programming project I can focus on it for hours. Yes, it's true that I often distract myself with various details instead of doing the main task, but generally I'm still concentrated on some intellectual task without losing train of thoughts.  So where does my problem disappear? "
3193,Do highly creative people dream more and/or differently than ordinary people?,"Everybody dreams, and I'm trying to understand if there is a cause and effect relationship between ability to dream and recall dreams and creativity as an adult.   I would define the kind of creativity I'm talking about as creating art, designing products, inventing and making original stuff. These people are at the upper end of a bell curve of creativity or are outside the curve completely (extraordinary creative genius). This is in contrast to ordinary people who would be somewhere towards the middle of the creativity bell curve.  The kind of dreaming I'm talking about is long, clear or multi episode dreams lasting over 5 minutes as opposed to fragments and vague impressions of activity. Let's say 2+ dreams per night.   Do highly creative people dream more and recall more than average or analytical people? Does active interest in dreams as a child or teenager(like keeping a dream journal) influences creativity as an adult?   I found some evidence to support that dreams and creativity are related, particularly in visual fields, like graphic design:     Barrett also interviewed modern artists and scientists about their use   of their dreams, documenting dramatic anecdotes including Nobel Prizes   and MacArthur 'genius grants' whose ideas originated in dreams.[6] Her   research concludes that while anything—math, musical composition,   business dilemmas—may get solved during dreaming, the two areas dreams   are especially likely to help are 1) anything where vivid   visualization contributes to the solution, whether in artistic design   or invention of 3-D technological devices and 2) any problem where the   solution lies in thinking outside the box—i.e. where the person is   stuck because the conventional wisdom on how to approach the problem   is wrong.   Another example from an overview of the modern theory of dream content:      Second, dreams cannot be the guardians of sleep if there are people who can sleep even though they do not dream, and we now have reason to believe there are such people, including young children (Foulkes, 1999), leucotomized schizophrenics (Jus et al., 1973), neurology patients suffering from parietal lobe injuries (Solms, 1997), and perhaps normal adults with weak visuospatial skills (Butler &amp; Watson, 1985).   Another example comes from Nancy Andersen's book ""the Creative Brain"", in which she suggests that highly creative people, like Issac Newton, Albert Einstein, Virgina Wolf, etc may be capable of thinking in a very different ways from ordinary people. She suggests this may be due to increased or different communication between their centers of the brain responsible for combining information and sensory input. It appears to me that dreaming is very related to this kind of information assimilation.   Another example from Domhoff's neurocognitive theory of dreaming. Spatial construction is required for ""traditional"" creative venues, like painting, sculpture and architecture.      For example, the complete loss of dreaming in adults due to injuries   to either inferior parietal lobe, when placed alongside the finding   that increased dream reporting in young children correlates with   visuospatial skills, suggests that the ability to dream in children   depends in part upon the development of the neural network for spatial   construction centered in the parietal lobes.

3194,Is it possible for a person to have anterograde amnesia and be aware of it?,"In ""Memento"" the main character has got anterograde amnesia, but he's aware of it. Is it even possible and how, if it is? Compare it to ""50 First Dates"" &mdash; the heroine is not aware of her condition.  Imagine you wake up in the morning. How would you come to awareness that you've got anterograde amnesia, if you don't remember anything since the moment you got it, including that? And even if you find this out by logical thinking, you'll forget it soon (in ""Memento"", what, in several minutes?) "
3195,Is cognitive science a concentration of psychology?,"Is cognitive science apart of psychology? If I major in psychology, will it be easy for me to be a cognitive scientist? "
3196,Is there a term to define the influence and sharing of common expressions among people?,I'm wondering how to call the phenomenon that happens when people spend a lot of time together and end up sharing similar vocabulary or reusing the other's expressions? Is there a term for this? 
3197,What neurotransmitters can be suppressed/promoted by tDCS,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modify suppression in the visual cortex and GABA suppression in motor control.  As of now, the exact neurobiological mechanism that creates this phenomenon isn't known, but what are the neurotransmitters that can be modified by this methodology? To what degree can these neurotransmitter levels be manipulated? Are there limitations to the parts of the brain this technique can be applied? "
3198,How do the blind dream?,"Lately, a friend of mine has been telling me that he's been having recurring dreams involving a certain rabbi, who died around a hundred years ago. Since there's been some controversy surrounding the truth of several famous pictures of him (some say that the most famous images of him really show someone else), I wanted to ask my friend which picture he looked like. Luckily, I stopped myself before I did -- this friend of mine is blind.  Therefore, I'd like to know what the blind experience when they dream -- do their dreams contain whatever types of experience they have in real life (ie, purely based on touch, hearing, smell, etc), or might they dream with vision? If they dream with vision, do they see color? Is this impacted by whether the particular person in question had ever had sight (or partial sight) at any point in their life? "
3199,What is the result of an excess of dopamine?,"I'm pretty familiar with the results of having not enough dopamine, though the reasons are not so clear to me.  To get a better insight on the topic I'd like to know something about having too much dopamine:   What behaviour is result of having too much dopamine? Why does it happen?   I am aiming to get insight in disease states associated with excess dopamine, not drug-induced states. "
3200,Age of learning versus relative mastery - are they linked?,"Infants learn different things in different ages. Let's say infant A learns to speak at age 1 (I have no idea what is normal), and infant B learn to speak at age 1.5. Does the age of learning say anything of who will be better (at any skill) in grown up age?   We know that it is easier to master something that we are truly interested in, as the interest will motivate and fuel us to progress. We also know that personal characteristics and general interests start at very low age and possibly before birth. Based on this, it would make sense if infants with an inborn interest for something (for instance language) are faster at learning the relevant skill (talking) than infants with less interest in it. Is there any research on this? "
3201,Which is the shortest duration for a pitch difference in audio signals to be perceived by the human auditory system?,"If I have two short audio signals, for example pure tone C4 and C#4, so half-tone difference, how short can they be that the human can hear the difference in pitch? Was there any blind-experiment/research with a good set of subjects done about this?  I was causally testing with a short script and it seems I am able to distinguish down to 30 ms long samples if I play one sample, then one second of pause, and another half tone higher sample.  I can also do it for shorter, but I am not sure anymore if I really hear it, or if I just imagine hearing the difference.  Bonus question: how short can it be if the signal consists of two tones. So of both C4 and C#4 at the same time. Can one hear that there are both C4 and C#4 in the signal if it is only 30 ms long? "
3202,Effective sampling rate in human visual system,"The [stroboscopic effect][1] is often explained as one of the problems of sampling. If sample rate is too low, you might have the impression of the signal frequency being low or even reverse. There are many animations on the internet describing the process but I find static sinus function graph more comprehensible:    You definitely know this effect from car wheels or plane propeller in movies. That's because the movie captures certain amount of frames. If the event is significantly shorter than capture rate, the output doesn't make any sense anymore.  My question is, how can I observe the stroboscopic effect in full light with my very own eyes? I thought there's no fixed frame-rate for human vision. I thought it's an analogous process (continuous stream), rather than digital (timed sampling).   Q: How can be human vision in non-flashing (such as sun) light be subject to stroboscopic effect? Where does the damage happen?  "
3203,The accuracy & malleability of memory for color,"How accurate is colour memory for the standard person?  It would seem most people are quite good at remembering the colour of objects by visualising the object. But in some cases peoples visualisation could be wrong. This is the case I am interested in.  Can this visualised 'incorrect' colour be shifted in a specific way?  Is there any known reason why someone would visualise objects colour incorrectly in some set shifted way. E.g. They always remember things by their composite colour?    Motivation:  My memory self ranked:   Faces - Great Names - Average Geography - Poor Colour - Non-existent   For some reason, I find myself incapable of remembering colours unless I specially label it with a colour, and often people will ask me to get something of theirs without telling me the colour, and I will be unable to find it because I can visualise it perfectly in the wrong colour.  One example I can remember. A large brick wall on my drive, I can perfectly remember(still can) that it was a light lime green, roughly this colour, and I was thinking about it in the car as I was planning my route mentally. Once I reached it I saw that it was purple, my girlfriend tells me essentially this colour. "
3204,Is all learning a subconscious activity?,"As a non-native English speaker I recently tried to understand difference in phrases ""to study"" and ""to learn"". I found some explanations here on English language and usage SE, stating that learning is a subconscious activity. Then in some articles I've found, authors stated that language learning is subconscious and that acquiring knowledge and skill isn't the same  [ also that learning language is actually learning a skill, while learning history is acquiring knowledge.] .  So I got confused : is all learning subconscious or not?   Is there a difference in learning language and learning anatomy, laws of physics or programming?   Additionally some articles got me confused, especially  those that want to sell you hypnosis  DVDs and instruction manuals to ""boost"" your subconscious mind. Aren't we already equipped with proper subconscious mind?  "
3205,What changes brought into DSM-5 have increased therapeutic use of medications?,"Given the controversies surrounding DSM-5, has there been any research into its impact on prescription practice (in the United States)?  If so, what are the changes that have resulted in increased use of medications? "
3206,What are the key features of dreams that trigger dream recall in the waking state?,"There are various ways of writing down dreams upon awakening in one's dream journal. I've seen long, detailed descriptions that read like novels and take a page or two. Then there are terse notes of place, action and characters.   In both cases, it is possible that the dream is forgotten, and upon reading the description, no recall happens, instead the mind starts to visualize the writing anew.  This makes me ask - Is there a key feature of a dream that prompts recall upon reading/thinking it? Is it a place, a feeling or something else? Is it recalling a known dream, then reading the description?   For example, in my current dream journal, i note the following:   Record the location, note indoors/outdoors Record the main action, focusing on feelings Record light level (ex: dark/light) Mention dream characters Record the topic of conversation Record any remembered phrases or response   But the above list is still not guaranteed to trigger recall "
3207,Have there been any scientific experiments attempting to communicate with one's unconscious mind?,"For the purposes of this question, I will define unconscious/subconscious as the parts of the human mind that are not normally available for introspection or control, but which are still involved in cognition. These parts of the mind might be involved in memory recall or assimilation of information. While I would define communication as receiving a recognizable response to input.  Have there been experiments attempting to establish communication with the researchers own unconscious mind? If so, what were their results? I'm not looking for ""new age"" kind of articles, but genuine scientific research findings.  The most direct way of communication that comes to mind would be talking to dream characters in a lucid dream and evaluating their responses upon awakening. Such characters are capable of semi-intelligent speech, and their responses at least casually appear to be related to the question at hand.  A consistent pattern of responses over several dreams might be considered a form of communication.   Another experiment I can think of, which uses non-verbal communication would be using some daily activity to consistently triggers a recurring dream setting at night. For example, intense study causing dreams of classrooms or exams. In this case, the setting can be considered a response of unconscious system.   Another example I can think of is exposing a person to a stimuli which consistently causes  some song to surface and ""get stuck in one's head"" - earworms during waking cognition. Alternatively, some saying or thought might arise unbidden in response to the stimuli. In this case, this can be considered another form of response.   Have there been scientific experiments along the lines described above? What would be the term I would use to search for ""communicating with unconscious"" in a scientific setting? "
3208,What is the concordance rate for schizophrenia in monozygotic and dizygotic twins?,What is general level of concordance for twins and is it higher for monozygotic twins? What research is available on this? 
3209,Which personality trait(s) characterize high need for external validation?,"Some background to explain my question: I recently overheard a conversation, between two men working in the same firm. One of them (A) is thinking about finding a new job, as he is not happy where he is. The other (B) says ""A, you have very valuable skills in this, nobody else knows as much as you do about this! You will have no problem at all finding a better job!""  I can see and hear that A is very hesitant to find a new job, he looks uncertain and not convinced that he will indeed find a better job. A says he feels a need for external validation. A does not seem to have low self-esteem, so the need for external validation seems to be unrelated to self-esteem.   In the Big 5, which personality trait(s) would explain such a need for external validation? Neuroticism and agreeableness might be able to answer the question, but that depends on the following:   Would a high-neuroticism low-agreeableness person crave for external validation? Is high agreeableness alone enough to make someone crave for external validation? Is high neuroticism alone enough to make someone crave for external validation?  "
3210,Research on avoiding thinking about things that trigger depression or anxiety,"Has there been study done in regards to the phenomenon of avoiding thinking about things that would emotionally trigger depression or anxiety?  What I mean is, a person will think about something randomly, and if they don't push the thoughts away immediately, they will start to obsess over those thoughts and become depressed. Is this a known phenomenon?  "
3211,Any research on a concept of 'empathetic preferences' used in economics?,"Some economists/political scientists/philosophers (it's sometimes hard to classify them) have used in their theories a concept of ""empathetic preferences"", also known as ""extended sympathy preferences"" - by which they they understand a preference of being a person X under a circumstance p than a person Y under a circumstance q, i.e. a counterfactual comparison of two different persons under two different situations. One needs to both empathise with two different persons to take into account their different preferences and create his own preference, hence the name empathetic preferences. A problematic concept to say at least, but nothing really important for those who used it (Kenneth Arrow, Patrick Suppes). But Ken Binmore, quite a known chap in math, game theory and economics, devised a whole theory explaining humans' natural sense of fairness in which empathetic preferences play a crucial role, grounding interpersonal comparisons of utility (technical exposition in ""Game Theory and the Social Contract"" from 1994, more readable in ""Natural Justice from 2005"").  Has anything remotely relevant been studied by psychologists/cognitive scientists? Binmore is claiming that empathetic preferences are very similiar to empathy and basically ""every properly socialized human being has them"". He also claims that there are tons of research on empathy that support his view, without citing anything relevant. The problem is that he is not ""philosophising"" them, conjuring them out of nothing like some political philosophers - he claims that this is how human beings work.   Binmore's example of empathetic preference - if we know that Eve likes apples and Adam does not mind being naked, we might think ""I would rather be Eve eating an apple than Adam wearing a fig leaf"".   For me this seems utterly implausible, and making such comparison is just impossible. Also, as we are never different persons, why would we be capable of doing that? But it's not like he was some guy on a University of Woolamaloo writing things that only his PhD students read, he's a world-class economist, claiming empirical support of his work, and I'm curious if there is any.   "
3212,How to filter noise in EEG data,"I am a computer science student and I'm doing something for a psychology professor.  We have EEG data from an experiment where a person was shown 140 images for 2 seconds each. We placed 64 electrodes on the scalp so we have 64 channels of continuous data.   We want to correlate each node with every other node so that we can graph it using a chord diagram.   Since my professor is abroad, I am having trouble with the directions he gave me to manipulate the data to get the correlations.     ""Once you are able to read the matrix of channels I suggest subtracting the mean signal from each, filtering to remove noise above 30 Hz.""   My question is how to remove the noise above 30 Hz? For example, data for 1 electrode for 10 milliseconds looks like this (measured in uV):  [ 31172.50, 31173.53, 31174.80, 31177.34, 31173.73,   31172.85, 31172.75, 31172.70, 31174.95, 31178.95]   The python script I am using also gives this data:  sampling rate: 1000.0 Hz time: 0.0 s to 1883.15 s   Can anyone point me in the right direction what steps to take to remove noise above 30 Hz? And also, is that a good way to compute the correlations between the electrodes? "
3213,What drives civilization?,"Fossil record indicates humanity arose on the African Continent - in/around Gauteng. Yet the oldest civilizations on record are far afield - Ebla, Mesopotamia  What drives civilization? Why is the cradle of civilization not nearer the cradle of humanity?  In my opinion civilization is that state of intellect when beings of a community recognize that collaboration rather than competition for resources is feasible, and actively work in that direction (granted we humans still have competition at the level of village, town, company, &amp; nation). Unlike other contemporary civilizations (ants and bees for instance) humans are not segregated into castes such as the warrior, worker - intellect drives human civilization.  "
3214,Do repressed memories exist?,"Is there such a thing as repressed memories? Suppose a person undergoes a traumatic event (e.g failing out of school, having a relative die suddenly). Is it normal for the person to act as if everything is normal? Do the traumatic events have an affect on someone even if they dont think about it every day? "
3215,Philosophy Meets Neuroscience: The Molyneux's Problem,"Consider the Molyneux's problem     ""If a man born blind can feel the differences between shapes such as spheres and cubes, could he similarly distinguish those objects by sight if given the ability to see?"" (Wikipedia)   There is recent evidence[tex] that the answer is likely negative. In their experiment, Held et al. used ""three-dimensional forms drawn from a children’s shape set"" (Legos, actually). I was thinking would the results be the same, if the stimuli were reconstructions of snakes or other reptiles? Humans are argued to have evolved fear modules[tex] in their brain for such creatures. Or, if the stimuli were directly related to humans, e.g. body parts? Could this kind of experiment test whether a child's mind is tabula rasa?

3216,What forms of the travelling salesman problem are difficult for humans to solve?,"In the traveling salesman problem (TSP) we are given a set of nodes, where one node is the starting node. The task is to find the shortest tour starting at the start node visiting every node exactly once. A variant of the more general TSP is the Euclidean TSP, where the distance between two cities is the usual Euclidean distance. Different metrics can also be considered, suck as the city-block metric.  Based on experimental data in [1], the authors claim that Euclidean TSP instances are easy for humans. They also gathered data on case where the metric used is the city-block metric. They note that ""... people are near-optimal for these problems in both metrics.""   What variants of the travelling salesman problem are hard for humans? Has any research been done on this?     [1] Walwyn, A. L., &amp; Navarro, D. J. (2010).

3217,"If people did not have to work, what would motivate them to work?","In industrialized countries around the world, ""work"" appears to be something that most people try to avoid as much as they can, dreaming of winning a lottery so they will never have to work again -- and be free to do nothing or do what they like. Money serves as a motivator for work, because in these cultures you need money to stay alive, or at least to live well.  Many social welfare states pay a basic income to people unable to find work. Despite the fact that usually this basic income is not unconditional but a transitional payment only and bound to the receiver's attempts to find a job, there is quite a lot of hostility from those who force themselves to their jobs each morning, towards those who appear to be happy with having little and prefer not to work.  Around the world there are proponents of an unconditional basic income that would free individuals from the necessity to take up work. I don't want to go into the whys and wherefores of such a freedom, or into how such an income could be financed, but want to ask you:  If everybody received an unconditional basic income that was high enough to make their lives reasonably comfortable, what would incite people to do the work (like baking bread) that needs to get done?  I am not lookig for opinions or theories here, those already abound on the net, but for empirical evidence for:   which percentage of a populace can be expected to busy themselves without need, and how those that like to laze around can be motivated to work without need.     B.F. Skinner in his utopian novel Walden Two attempts to design a society where no-one is required to work more than four hours a day and unwanted jobs result in more credit points than desirable jobs, so that some people clean the toilet and then have more free time than those working at their dream jobs, but this concept relies on a virtual currency of points that you have to earn, so there is a need to work to earn your living, even if it does not have a payment of traditional ""money"".  In my question, the motivator for work must not be anything that has to be fulfilled, but something that does not take away the freedom not to work. Something that makes even the least desirable job attractive. In the case of the toilet it might be something simple like this being your toilet, and if you don't clean it, you'll have to use it anyway. But there are public toilets. What would work there? "
3218,"What, if anything, sets humans apart from other species?","As I grew up, I was taught that the difference between humans and animals was that human beings have free will and animals do not. The basis is that animals will act accordingly to the nature of their species. I never fully understood this statement and still wonder whether it is a valid claim.  From an evolutionary  perspective, we would be regarded as a species at the top of the food chain. The main advantage in our development is our brains.  If we put aside the differences in what human beings are capable of, e.g. making clothes, machinery, etc., is there a real distinction between human beings and other animals? Do we really have free will, or an illusion of free will? Or are we behaving, as other animals, in accordance with the nature of our species?  I know this is a big question and could result in a range of debates over my definitions. So for the sake of clarity, let's keep this question limited to what defines a human brain as opposed to an animal brain and any evidence that supports any significant difference, allowing for the fact that the human brain is well-developed (as opposed to, e.g. to our canines). "
3219,Can stress be detected by an fMRI?,"How does stress damage the brain (if at all)? Is it akin to taking drugs, heavy drinking, or a minor stroke?   Would an fMRI of a stressed person present evidence of stress?  "
3220,Does reading a book out loud make you better in social situations?,"Suppose a person reads a book out loud for 1 hour straight. Would this ""exercise"" the parts of the brain involved in speech? Would this make the person a better communicator in social situations? "
3221,What causes student errors on a problem involving differentiating a factorial?,"Consider the following maths problem, assuming only a high-school level knowledge of calculus:      If [tex], find [tex]    Almost all of my respondents seemed to switch on their ""mental differentiation pipeline"" and tried to expand [tex] as a product and got stuck. The right answer is that [tex] is undefined for any non-integer, so [tex] is discontinuous, and [tex] doesn't exist!  Is there a name in psychology for the phenomenon that causes one to think along the wrong lines in the problem above?  Is it the same as the one leading to incorrect answers to the bat and ball problem? Is this a test of your thinking style? For, perhaps an intuitive thinking style will  lead one to expand [tex] as a product and attempt to differentiate term-wise. Is there a ""cognitive remedy"" for wrong thinking? "
3222,What are the negative effects of meditation?,"I see lots of articles touting the benefits of meditation. But what are the bad things about it? Maybe if a person has to make quick decisions, meditation would not be a good thing? This could be similar to a paridigm of ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"" by Kahneman. "
3223,Why does a clock counting down generate more pressure than a clock counting up?,Why does it seem that people feel more pressure with a clock counting down as opposed to counting up? Is there a specific term for this? Maybe counting down signifies some sort of loss whereas counting up signifies some sort of gain? 
3224,Why is it difficult for employees to express hatred to their boss?,"Suppose Bob hates his boss. Note that Bob is an ""average"" person. Also suppose that he shouts as loudly as possible ""[Curse] my boss"" (with nobody else around but him).   Why is it so difficult for Bob to say this directly to his boss? Is this based on social norms or is there a specific brain region which restrains this outburst? "
3225,What does scientific research say about the relationship between penis size and attractiveness?,"Pop-culture often equates a larger penis with a more attractive penis.   Is there any scientific research examining the relationship between penis size and attractiveness ratings? What are the reasons for any such relationship?   I've heard that symmetry is relevance to beauty, but what is the relevance of size. "
3226,Are Satoshi Kanazawa's findings about racial differences in attractiveness valid?,This post discusses a study published in a blog post by an evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa. The study suggested that black women were rated less attractive than women of other races. There is a copy of the original blog post here.   Are the conclusions in the Kanazawa article valid? What criticism can be made about the article?  
3227,Why do power laws describe learning and skill acquisition so well?,"In humans, why do powers laws describe skill acquisition? In particular, [tex] where [tex] is reaction time and [tex] is amount of practice.    Does the power law generalise to learning in other mammals? Does the power law apply to learning whilst under the influence of drugs or alcohol? Does the power laws apply to creative ideas or just to tangible skills?  "
3228,What does cognitive science say about whether to learn mathematics top-down from research papers?,"There is currently a popular question on math.SE on whether it is effective to learn math top-down.      By top-down I mean finding a paper that interests you which is   obviously way over your head, then at a snail's pace, looking up   definitions and learning just what you need and occasionally proving   basic results. Eventually you'll get there but is this a bad idea? Is   learning each required math area by textbook the better way?   I thought that cognitive science might have something to contribute to this discussion. Specifically:   What would cognitive science have to say about the pros and cons of learning from the ground up versus taking a difficult mathematical text and following up on the details? What decision rules would cognitive science have for deciding whether to adopt a given a approach? Has any empirical research explicitly dealt with this question?  "
3229,Is the process of long term potentiation (LTP) definitively linked with brain plasticity?,Given that the process of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) is one of the processes that increases synaptic efficacy:  Is it reasonable to conclude that the process of LTP is sufficient and necessary to control plasticity of circuits within the brain?     Can we assume that the biochemical factors that modulate LTP are also intrinsically linked with brain plasticity? 
3230,Do smart drugs (nootropics) make you smarter?," Do nootropic drugs like modafinil make you smarter? Are they like coffee? Do they improve working memory? Is there a potential for a pill like NZT-48 from the movie Limitless? From the Wikipedia plot summary:      After taking [a nootropic drug, NZT-48,] Eddie finds himself able to learn faster and recall memories from his distant past, with the only apparent side effect being a change in the colour of Eddie's irises while on the drug - his eyes becoming an intense shade of electric blue. He uses this ability to finish ninety pages of his book. The next day, the effects [have] worn off...      Testing his new ability on the stock market, Eddie makes large returns on small investments...  "
3231,Is there a psychological condition which promotes literal and overly complicated thinking?,"Quote from Sheldon Cooper, Big Bang Theory IMDB     Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and   shampoo her carpet.   Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?   Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to... hold up a   sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?   Sheldon: You have a sarcasm   sign?   Some people tend to think very literally and also over-complicate things.  This causes much misunderstanding when communicating with people, especially with the advent of texting, email and social networking, as the verbal and nonverbal cues are absent.  It sometimes causes difficulty when completing tasks, as those with this condition can misinterpret what is required of them. This can be an asset academically. A  ""misinterpretation"" (or better put, a different interpretation) in one way, will, usually mean there is a gain in another aspect.   When someone truly does not understand something, others might think that person is  joking. Others may not understand their humor, as he/she will make a joke about something, he/she sees as obvious and will be taken seriously by others.  Another way to describe this ""condition"" is to use the example of sudokus and cryptic crosswords. Someone might make mistakes in the easy ones, and find the more difficult ones easier to solve, looking for a more complicated solution than the one that was there and already apparent.  To solve complex problems is, often, easier than the straightforward and simple.   Is this a known condition?  What, neurologically, may cause this in the brain?   Could this be some form of ""retardation""?    Are there ways to improve this?  "
3232,Why do teenagers take the internet and cyberbullying so seriously?,"Background: I saw this post on the daily Mirror: A girl committed suicide because some users bullied her on ask.fm. I signed up to see what that site is, and it was some Q&amp;A site. So she committed suicide just because someone bullied her, someone she doesn't know, maybe a bot!  That article said that many other teens did the same.    I'm broadly interested in why do teens in particular take the internet so seriously. As Sherry Turkle said, we're connected but alone. And she said that the internet is all about sex, lies and avatars.  Questions   Why do teenagers take the Internet so seriously? Is it because they are attached too much to the internet? Are they trying to escape real life by building virtual worlds? Is there any study research on this?  "
3233,What is the effect of displayed online personal identifiers on online communication?,"Online interaction provides an interesting avenue for experiment and experience.  People are able to hide or fabricate their personal details including age, sex, and appearance. For the purposes of this question I am using the term ""personal identifiers"" as any indication of a person's age, sex, name, race, place of residence, etc*  As a user here, I have experimented with showing my real name, changing my user name; having a photo of myself as a kangaroo, and whether or not to display my age, provide my real age, or at one point used an age of 93 years. I have also played with whether or not to show my country (the kangaroo reveals I am at ease with this).  I am most active on Stack Overflow, which is a programming site, and my belief is that programming is a male dominated field. So when I address a user, with no personal identifiers, I find myself assuming that they are male. I have noticed that when people assume I am of the opposite sex (to what I am, not what they are!), I respond differently.  This has led me to think about the value of maintaining a certain anonymity and which aspects of one's identity are best revealed in various online settings.  Questions   What information is there about perceived personal identifiers and how this affects  people's online behaviour? What information is there regarding a person's reaction when they know they are being treated as if they are a person with different identifiers?  "
3234,What causes some people to unconsciously imitate the accents of others?,"Background: I often notice that when I talk with someone with an accent that I often unconsciously start to imitate their accent. Similarly, you see some people that very quickly after moving to a country start to adopt the local accent whereas others maintain their original accent for many years.  Questions   What causes individual differences in the tendency to unconsciously take on accents? Has there been research on the process of unconsciously imitating accents?  "
3235,What evidence is there that the adult brain can produce new neurons?,"At school I was taught that the adult brain did not produce new neurons. That we had the maximum number of neurons and this would only diminish over time due to events, like head injuries, drinking excessive quantities of alcohol, various other processes, not to mention the general atrophy the body experiences through the process of aging.  I remember sitting through a Neuroscience lecture (about 15 years ago), and learning, that studies had shown that whilst exercising enabled the brain to produce new neurons.  What is the latest evidence that the adult brain can produce new neurons?    Please note the link is not to the lecture I refer to. "
3236,Does dopamine signal become stronger when goal distance is defined using time?,"Howe et al (2013) found that a dopamine signal becomes stronger as a goal is approached. The experiment involved rats running in a maze. If the rats were close to solving the maze, the dopamine signal became strong. The intensity of this signal did not depend on how fast the rats completed the maze.   Goal distance was defined in terms of space and distance (i.e. how far a rat was from the end of the maze). Would this dopamine signal also become stronger if the goal distance was defined using time instead? More specifically, if the rats were under some type of time pressure, would their dopamine signals become stronger?   Source  Mark W. Howe, Patrick L. Tierney, Stefan G. Sandberg, Paul E. M. Phillips, Ann M. Graybiel. Prolonged dopamine signalling in striatum signals proximity and value of distant rewards. Nature, 2013 "
3237,Is sluggishly progressing schizophrenia recognized outside of Russia?,"I've been trying to look up information about sluggishly progressing schizophrenia, but the only source accessible to me was a Wikipedia article, that states that the term “sluggish schizophrenia” was created to diagnose political dissidents, but nevertheless, it has been also adopted in modern Russia.  I wish to know about other countries, which haven't been a part of USSR. Is the term officially recognized in the western world? Is it considered a complete misdiagnosis? Is there some other classification, that is used for the same condition instead? "
3238,Why do some people only work well under pressure?,It is  common for people to procrastinate. Putting off tasks until  the resulting deadlines get closer and  there comes a point at which the person will fire into action. (whether this point leaves the person with enough time to complete task is another question).  Why is it that some people seem to only work well under pressure? Why is it that people find it difficult to discipline themselves and have all their task complete well before deadlines are due? 
3239,Is the concept of neuroplasticity applicable to visual cortex and how does it affect visual perception?,"I've been searching about this but all I found was this presentation, which is a bit too technical for me to understand, e.g: Visual Cortical Plasticity  In what way does neuroplasticity affect the visual cortex?  For example, a person that wears glasses, if he/she stopped using them completely or from time to time, will the visual perception and interpretation of blurred data get better by just training? Will that blur also be reduced with training? "
3240,What is the psychological basis for people coming together during a disaster or major event?,"Something I have witnessed several times, and got me wondering, what is the psychological basis for people coming together in response to a disaster or a major event?  Be it large scale or local.  An example is one that I was right in the middle of (and at one stage was in very serious danger) - the Queensland floods of 2011, which is encapsulated nicely in this video-editorial ""Hope Lives Here"". Now, a couple of points from the editorial - the narrator states that as the city of Brisbane has grown, people have become more distant and are not likely to even know their neighbours' names.  This is obviously not just pertinent to the example above, but is repeated in many places.  However, when push comes to shove, and when a community of strangers are faced with a catastrophe, destruction, loss and are basically 'forced into a corner' - this is when the community comes together. Following the example, a 'Mud Army' started up of people helping strangers get back on their feet (I was involved in that, despite just coming out of surgery a few weeks before).  When the danger passes, life goes back to normal (generally) and we all seem to go our separate ways.  What is the psychological basis (more in depth than the linked editorial) for why we come together in a disaster or major event? "
3241,"What is a short, drug-induced ""blackout"" experience called?","I know of anecdotal evidence for the following drug-related side-effects:   It can happen while getting used to a new drug, or when quitting a drug. Probably also some other situations. The feeling lasts a split second. All hearing disappears when it happens. Before and after the hearing disappears, there is some sort of auditory noise that lasts about equally long. It will feel like some sort of mental disconnection, as if you passed out for just a split second - except you don't lose physical control. It can happen many times every day. All cognitive and physical functions seem to work like normal. It can happen with different medications, including Effexor/Venlafaxin and 5-htp.   What can this temporary black-out be? Does it have a scientific name (i.e., is it a known and recognized phenomenon?)  "
3242,Why can some people not cry on demand?,"Why is it, when we need to cry, it sometimes doesn't work?  Is there any psychology explanation for this? "
3243,Can one alter their auditory perception?,"I'm coming from the idea that the way we perceive sound is a reaction to a certain signal, sent to our brain by ears. Of course this feeling intensifies as volume of the sound increases and our ears send us a stronger signal.   Now here I am wondering if we can augment that signal in our brain, so when the volume stays the same - we will be able to perceive it louder. Can that be done without any kind of chemical or surgical intrusion, just by sheer force of will? Do such perception ""controllers"" even exist and we just haven't learned to control them? This question is about auditory system, but since it touches the brain signal interpretation you could explain this from a different perspective (visual or even tactile).  This isn't part of the question, but I also wonder, if previous is possible, than can the same be done to mentally create sounds in your head and hear them as if they were real..? "
3244,Can hallucinogens treat depressive states?,"Given the serotonin hypothesis of depression, increasing synaptic serotonin level may cause anti-depressive effects.    Hallucinogens seems to have such advantages:   They improve mood at once, but not after a while as SSRI. So hallucinogens may actually act faster.   There are more types of hallucinogens, then there are SSRIs. They have a wider pharmacological effect on serotonin receptors than antidepressants do.   So the questions are:   Are hallucinogens anti-depressive agents? Which are their advantages and problems in comparison with modern antidepressants?  "
3245,Do the colour blind have a distinct visual cortex structure?,"Studying the structure of the visual cortex, it seems there are many neural structures specifically dedicated to detecting and interpreting colour. For example, parvocellular cells are particularly sensitive to colour. Consequently, in a colour blind person, are parvocellular cells or other neural structures less prominent? What are the differences in brain structure between a colour blind person and a normal seeing person? "
3246,Is there any study on the effectiveness of taking notes in a lecture vs taking notes on written materials?,"In many lectures I heard, I basically copied the lecture notes of the professor from the board into my notebook (I study mathematics). For me those lectures are comparable with going into the library, taking a textbook and making a handwritten copy from it.  The question I asked myself today: Is there a study investigating what is more effective? Going to lectures where I copy the professor's lecture notes from the board or making a handwritten copy from the lecture notes by myself?   (I assume here that the lecture notes are available, e.g. from the lecture's homepage)  On the one hand the professor might give additional comments in the lecture. On the other hand one can take the time he needs to understand a complicated paragraph when he works by himself and is not in the lecture. One also can skip easily understandable parts when he works by himself... "
3247,Comparative functional neuroanatomy: humans & octopodes,"Cephalopod brains are toroidal (high surface area to volume ratios!), with the esophagus passing through the, uh, donut hole; octopodes are very intelligent, particularly spatially.  Where can I find more information on the functional and anatomical comparisons between human and cephalopod brains, and its consequences for the cognitive abilities of both?  Specifically questions like   How does the functional neuroanatomy of the cephalopod compare to human functional neuroanatomy?    How does cortical organization (both    perpendicular to the surface and across the surface) between    cephalopods and humans compare? How do human spatial cognitive abilities differ from those of the octopus?  (Somewhat akin to how the pigeon's object recognition capabilities are less dependent on canonical views of familiar objects than the human system.)   Bonus points for answer materials that are aimed at those with a knowledge of other neural systems, particularly human. "
3248,What study examined the effect of number of traumatic life events on falling into poverty?,"I recall a study that concluded the risk of falling into poverty / homelessness increases dramatically after experiencing 5 (or 7?) traumatic life events, such as   Death of a loved one Abandonment by spouse Bankruptcy Being fired Foreclosure   etc (a threshold effect). That's about as clear a memory as I can form, and search engines don't help. Anybody know about this study? It might have been from New Zealand. "
3249,Central and peripheral route dilemma,"Pretend a woman watching tv and she is moved by the speaker's credibility and his ability to speak at length on the new product. She also notes that he is attractive.  So in this case she is likely being influenced by 'Peripheral route', but does she also have been influenced by 'central route' ? (Minded because of the credibility of the speaker. Or is that also a characteristic of the peripheral way?) "
3250,Definition of or research on fun,"What does research have to say about defining ""fun""--what it is or when it happens?  I've found some research on whether or not people rate specific things as fun, and lots of misleading titles with the word ""fun"" in them, but very little on what fun is (cognitively, neurologically, affectively, socially) and when it happens.  I also found a couple of cogsci.SE questions but the answers are either entirely unsupported or stray into other waters (motivation, addiction).  Is there a cognitive or scientific definition of ""fun""? Is there a body of research on when fun happens? "
3251,Number of exercises and the learning of some subject?,"For example, I show to my students that XY=Z, so I ask for them to do some exercises, so in the future, they will always know that XY=Z.  Is there any known study relating the numbers of exercises needed to learn a subject?  And that relates the numbers of steps with the amount of practise?  Because we can see clearly that the sequency 1-3-8 is easier to remember than 1-3-8-6-9-8-7-5-5.  But the second sequency will need three more times of exercise to remember?  I think this may be useful in my studies, considering time a important factor.  If a do just some exercises, I just can half learn, and if I study much more than I need, I waste my time. "
3252,"How does glial cell activity influence fMRI, EEG signals?","Glial cells comprise about 80% of the cells in the human brain. But physiological models of EEG and fMRI often relate only to neuronal activity.  How do glial cells affect large-scale imaging modalities?  Also, does glial activity artifact dye imaging and local field potentials?   Are microscale recordings more sensitive to artifacts due to glial activity than macroscale recordings? "
3253,Acoustic and light wave coherency?,"I know how some music notes combinations sound pleasing, yet others do not. Does the same occur with different frequencies of light (colors)? Since spectral color and acoustic pitch are both defined by their respective wavelengths (frequencies), it made me think that the psychological properties of the two may be related.   So do light waves, for example one with the same wave length as a mid-C and another with a mid-F wave, look nicely together? Or do certain colors when viewed simultaneously, or side by side, appear pleasing? "
3254,Short term memory and an effective learning strategy,"What is the most efficient method learning multiple academic topics in parallel with each other. I propose, for a small number of different things (say 4), the best method is to cycle the topics, over the course of 4 days, i.e. topic 1,2,3,4,1... on days 1,2,3,4,5... respectively and working full days on each topic.   I am just wondering in terms of cognitive effectiveness is this the best strategy? Would changing up the topic every half day be more effective? I would tend to think that switching every half day could improve brains ability to work (reduced 'boredom') but maybe as the 2 topics would be inherently different it could hinder information retention for the first subject.   Does anyone know of any studies done which could relate to this or have any ideas themselves? "
3255,Do lonely people get addicted more easily than social counterparts?,"The so-called ""Rat Park"" study conducted in the late 1970s indicated that lonely rats get drug addicted more easily than social ones.  Does anyone know if there are more recent studies about the topic? About drug addictions or other addictions?  Reference  Alexander, B. K., Coambs, R. B., &amp; Hadaway, P. F. (1978).

3256,Neural Processes of Inducing Flow,"Related to my previous question: Improved Typing as a result of slight movement  For context: slight movement (&lt;1 inch in any direction) improves typing, piano-playing, and writing, among other things.  I believe this is because the continuous movement helps induce a flow state.  Additionally, any mistakes made during the activity (a misspelling, an inappropriate piano note, etc) are more easy to recover from.  I am now curious as to what neural processes could be taking place here - by what process does this slight movement ease the primary activity, remove or reduce errors, and induce a flow state?  What mechanism of the human body allows this 'cross-entrainment'?  For bonus points, what neural activity is taking place during a flow state itself? "
3257,What causes pathological jealousy?,Taking the meaning of the word pathological to mean maladaptive and unhealthy.   What is/are the aetiology of pathological jealousy?  What conditions are associated with features of pathological jealousy?  Discussion can concern neurological or psychological problems or both. 
3258,Are there any studies that examine the phenomenon of songs stuck in the head?,"Frequently I hear people say (and myself included) ""darn it, I can't get that song out of my head!"".  Are there any studies that examine this phenomenon of songs getting stuck in people's heads?  I.e., what factors are involved in some people to get a certain song stuck in their head and not others:   When is it more likely to occur? Why does the same song gets stuck for one person and not for others? What methods can stop it? Is there any relation to other issues like OCD? When it is considered not normal?  "
3259,What are the real life applications for Probability Learning?,   Probability learning is a principle that states probability of a response tends to match the probability of the reinforcement.   How does one achieve such rationality under uncertainty? What are the real-life applications of this concept?  I'm looking for lucid answers as I'm a lay person.   Reference: [website]
3260,Learning a language by Immersion,"Immersion is the process by which children learn their native language, but it can also be used in educational settings. Apparently in some countries, where the official language is not the language that is actually spoken, immersion is used in schools to teach the official language. Some companies (like Rosetta Stone) also use the method of immersion in their language programs.  From reading the Wikipedia article it seems that learning (a second) language by immersion is mostly used for children and does take quite a long  time.   Are there studies that compare the learning of a language by immersion and the learning by other approaches?  Is immersion equally useful for adults and for children?  "
3261,Is there any empirical support evaluating the fast phobia cure?,"There have been several papers going against the effectiveness of NLP. One aggregate paper is referenced in the Wikipedia article on NLP, namely Witkowski (2010). However, NLP seems to encompass a wide variety of techniques.  I'm particularly interested in the fast phobia cure.  Is there any empirical support for or against the fast phobia cure?  References   Witkowski, Tomasz (1 January 2010). ""Thirty-Five Years of Research on Neuro-Linguistic Programming. NLP Research Data Base. State of the Art or Pseudoscientific Decoration?"".

3262,Does intoxication ever improve reaction time?,"Background: As I write this I am rather ""tipsy."" I wanted to do some experiments and test my reaction time. I noticed that ironically, my reaction times were a lot quicker than when I am sober. Is there a reason for this? Perhaps slight intoxication may improve reaction time?   I know that slight intoxication can improve creativity according to Jennifer Wiley.  Are there laboratory results backing up the fact that reaction time could actually be faster under these circumstances? "
3263,Is the 'addiction' to receiving sympathy similar to substance addiction or just a deficit of resilience?,"A lot have encountered people who seem to be addicted to receiving sympathy - before getting to my question, allow me to clarify, what I am referring to are people for whom, knowingly portray 'everything as a crisis'.  I am deliberately putting 'addiction' in quotation marks as I am not sure that it is in fact an addiction.  I used to be this way myself, making even the smallest transgression into a big issue and then using it to get sympathy from others, when I received said sympathy - it felt 'good'.  (Nowadays, I just deal with issues myself).  So, my question is, is the sympathy 'addiction' akin to substance addiction or is it a deficit of resilience? or maybe both? "
3264,How much additional sleep is required to recover from a given number of hours of sleep deprivation?,"A previous question dealt with whether it is possible to catch up on lost sleep. This question is a little different.  Assume that a healthy adult has been deprived of sleep for ""x"" hours. How much sleep is required to restore healthy brain function, compared to sleep lost?     I wouldn't think the hours needed could be predicted by a linear scale. Is there some predictable relationship between the two and what type of relationship is it? "
3265,Is consistent dual n-back training likely to improve the performance of analysis (mathematics) students?,"Suppose you isolate a class of undergraduate mathematics majors who are about to enroll in a semester of real analysis (rigorous, proof-based calculus) and split them into two groups. Then, you schedule the first group to study n hours of real analysis every week and the other group to study (n-m) hours of real analysis every week and perform m hours of n-back training (assume that n and m are reasonably well tuned; m is probably much smaller than n).   Also assume that the second group does not take shortcuts in doing the training (where certain patterns are exploited).   Which group do you conjecture to perform better in the analysis course and why? To what degree will one group perform better and why? Does having a wider short-term memory horizon of numbers (which I assume n-back produces) result in being able to keep track of more variables and rigorous proof steps in a sharper way (working memory) and in faster comprehension of mathematical concepts (fluid intelligence)? Does the training result in a larger attention span and therefore to better grades?  "
3266,"What is the scientific definition of ""brain training""?","A lot of companies are selling products under the heading of ""brain training"", and ""brain exercises"", ""brain games"" such as Nintendo DS Brain Training, Lumosity, and a host of other companies.  I'm highly sceptical that such exercises have any generalised effect beyond improving the task that is being practiced and possibly some very limited form of generalisation. Nonetheless, I was curious about what makes an exercise or a program of activities ""brain training"".    What is the scientific definition of ""brain training""? Alternatively, what definitions have been proposed by researchers or very popular providers of brain training?   Such a definition would presumably make clear how daily living is different to brain training. It would also hopefully clarify whether daily cognitive activity like doing a crossword, answering a question on stack exchange, making a shopping list, or playing a computer game is brain training or not. "
3267,"Why does being in a natural environment induce some kind of ""peace"" state while mecha/tech ones induce the opposite?","Usually, natural environments (being out in ""nature"") tend to induce a happy and peaceful state, while mechanical and technological ones tend to induce stress and sadness.  Why does this happen? Are we born with this notion, or do we just build up that in our minds over time? and even so, why? "
3268,The relationship between narcissism and self-esteem,"Given that personality disorders are rooted in abnormal experience and development. There has been much discussion about the aetiology of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Having a concept of the causes of such an illness is helpful in establishing the answer to my question. The common belief was that beneath the arrogance of a narcissist, is an incredibly low self-esteem, hence the need to protect the fragile ego.     Those with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they're   superior to others and have little regard for other people's feelings.   But behind this mask of ultra-confidence lies a fragile self-esteem,   vulnerable to the slightest criticism.   Mayo Clinic  I can see that there is some discussion refuting this, and postulating the opposite.     It was once thought that narcissists have high self-esteem on the   surface, but deep down they are insecure. However, the latest evidence   indicates that narcissists are actually secure or grandiose at both   levels.   Psychology Today  I have wondered, how do we really know how the narcissist self-esteem is? Is there an inverse relationship between narcissism and self-esteem or is the converse true?  Please provide a well researched answer. "
3269,"Is ""brain training"" effective?","We've had quite a few questions about ""brain training"" on this site (see questions tagged brain-training). And the effectiveness of ""brain training"" has been touched on in several questions (this question on the definition of brain training, this question about lumosity, and this question about n-back training).  That said, I agree with @Chuck's suggestion that it might be useful to have a canonical sceptics-style question about the effectiveness of brain training.    Questions   What is the effect of completing ""brain training""? Is there any evidence for domain general benefits to cognitive functioning that extend beyond the specific task practiced? Is there anything particularly ""neural"" or ""brain""-like about brain training? Is there any evidence that brain training prevents any neurological diseases?   Naturally, it would be good if any answers are backed up by independent scientific empirical research. References to and summaries of recent scientific review articles would also be particularly useful. "
3270,"Can ""7 deadly sins/virtues"" be explained in terms of brain hormone level or receptor mutations?","I'm thinking about this question on biology.se: do hormones make men think of sex?  From the interview linked in the answer, I get two takeaways: a man who lost most testosterone for 4 months mentioned more humility, while a lgbt person on testosterone therapy reported more intense sexual thoughts or urges.  With this in mind, I'm thinking of the Christian concept of "" deadly sins"" and their opposite virtues. From a purely historic perceptive, I take recurring accounts of these phenomena in writing to say that these traits have existed for the last couple thousand years or more in the western world.  Is modern science any closer to explaining the phenomena like wrath, sloth, gluttony or humility in terms of neurotransmitter, hormone, receptor mutations or other genetic mutations?   Here's the kind of answer I'm looking for:  ( from serotonin receptors )     Deceased suicidal and otherwise depressed patients have had more   5-HT2A receptors than normal patients. These findings suggest that   post-synaptic 5-HT2A overdensity is involved in the pathogenesis of   depression.[4]  "
3271,Is reading from the screen more difficult than reading from paper and how can screen reading be made easier?,"I've noticed that as a student when reading material, there is a choice between reading from the screen or reading from paper. When reading from paper I find that I concentrate more and that  comprehension is  much better. I can partially memorize the material rather than reading from screen. In addition, I find reading from screen is more tiring. When I feel tired reading from the screen I often print to paper, and it provides relief.  Questions   Does research support this observation that reading from paper results in less strain and greater comprehension? Are there any techniques to improve reading from screen?  "
3272,The effects of pain on cognitive function and incidence of depression,"There have been studies about  the link between depression and cognitive function..  There have been studies between pain and cognitive function. This has, also, been discussed in this question here.  There have been studies linking pain and depression.  From a biochemical viewpoint: Are pain, depression and cognitive function intrinsically linked? Is it possible for chronic pain not to have an effect on cognitive function and the likelihood of depression? "
3273,Current directions in emulation theory,"Over the decades there have been several theories from various aspects of cognitive science that have appealed to a link between perception and action as a way of understanding information processing in the brain. The example that I'm most familiar with is Liberman and Mattingly's Motor Theory of Speech Perception (Liberman &amp; Mattingly, 1985), which, starting almost 50 years ago, made the following claims — reviewed in Galantucci, et al. (2011):   ""speech is special"" -- there are specialized pathways in auditory cortex for processing speech perceiving speech is perceiving the speech gestures of the talker, not necessarily the acoustic patterns of the speech waveform the motor system is recruited for processing speech   Although more recent work in neuroscience has discredited many of these claims, particularly the first one, there do seem to be several recent results (e.g., Wilson, et al. 2006; Fadiga, et al. 2002; Pulvermueller, et al., 2006; D'Ausilio et al. 2009) that establish a very interesting link between speech perception and motor cortex activity.  At a higher level, this sort of theory fits into the general ""emulation"" framework proposed by Grush (2006), and also agrees well with insights from the mirror-neurons branch of neuroscience research.  My question is, now that all of this ""newer"" research is five to ten years old, have there been even more recent results -- especially from non-speech areas of cognitive science -- that might help form a unified theory of action and perception ? How might we go about building up such a unified theory based on what's currently known ? What further studies or models do we need to evaluate emulation as a fundamental building block of cognition ?  References  D'Ausilio, A., et al. (2009). The Motor Somatotopy of Speech Perception.

3274,Why would a behaviour effect one sex?,"After reading the article Regular sleeping hours really are good for children—if they are girls I started wondering what would be a good explanation for something such as sleep patterns have an affect on cognition, and specifically higher in girls?  And are their other examples where one sex is influenced at a higher rate? "
3275,Consistency Theory - Why do we go back on promises,"I'm fairly new to the field of social psychology so forgive me if this sounds like a naive question.  I just read about the consistency principle - ""Once we make a choice or take a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision.""  I have the question - exactly what kind of decision/commitment are we talking about? As in, how do we reliably identify a situation in which a person has made a decision/commitment such that he will now behave as per the consistency principle?  If the consistency principle is really so pervasive, then why do people often back out of promises? There are tons of situations when people don't honor their ""commitment"" towards other people (for example not showing up for some social event, or not showing up for a date, etc.) "
3276,Psychology of intelligence,"I studied some cognitive psychology of problem solving. But I havent studied the psychology of intelligence in depth.  I wanted to ask, to what extent do IQ/psychometric tests predict academic performance? Einstein was said to have a high IQ and there are maths/physics prodigies out there.  What intelligence limitations limit an average person to achieve similar academic achievements such as of Albert Einstein's?  Any reference to research on psychology of intelligence is welcome. "
3277,Are there parts of the brain which don't change over a lifetime?,"We know that during our lifetime the brain develops new neural connections. In addition, there is pruning of neural connections. These phenomena together are called neuroplasticity.   Is there any research on part(s) of the brain that are fixed in terms of structure and other properties? In other words, are there regions in the brain where neuroplastic changes do not occur? "
3278,How is the biological accuracy of ANNs typically measured?,"I am referring to the computational neuroscience side of neural network research that focuses on biological accuracy.  I've read references to improving biological realism (using say spiking neurons or binding neurons of various types) by emulating known properties of real neurons (action potentials and what not).  However, I haven't been able to find any detail on how the effectiveness of such attempts is measured empirically.  For example, cultured neuronal networks (such as a neurochip) could be used as a benchmark: Create an ANN and a BNN with the same number and arrangement of neurons, give them the same inputs, and compare the results...  Has anything like that been attempted?  How is the biological accuracy of ANNs typically measured? "
3279,Neurophysiological indications of focus and motivation,"Is there any way to detect a subject being focused or highly motivated (assuming that these two states are essentially the same) using any sort of external detection, such as fMRI or EEG? How would the accuracy of these measurements be compared? I have a hard time imagining what the ""ground-truth"" of these measurements might be. "
3280,How is the signal-to-noise ratio of an event-related-potential measured?,"I often encounter publications where the authors try to ""increase the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals"". Some define a numeric value of SNR of EEG signals, but I am confused as to the exact definition of the SNR and how it can be measured for ERPs?  Previously, I have calculated the SNR using a model of noise, for example a Gaussian model. I have also encountered SNR calculations based on a ratio between the mean and the standard deviation of a signal, but both of these approaches seem to be impractical. When I process the EEG signal, I would like to emphasize how the ERP changes in the EEG signal. All of this is strongly related with variance. If the variance approaches to zero, then theory tells me that SNR goes to infinity (a really good signal), but the signal that I will have is useless.  Is there a better way to measure the SNR then I have mentioned? "
3281,What are presynaptic puncta?,What are presynaptic puncta? And what makes them different from presynaptic terminals? 
3282,What characterises people who stay calm in crisis situations?,"When something critical and bad happens, like a house on fire with people inside it, people react very differently.   Some persons will usually panic, cry and can barely be soothed.  Some persons will usually manage to stay calm, think rational and actively do the best out of the situation. Sometimes people go into shock, freeze and are unable to act.    For a long time I have wondered what is the difference between people with different reactions. What characterizes those who always seem to keep calm? What is the reason that some never seem to be able to stay calm? What happens mentally when someone freezes and neither panics/cries nor acts?  I suspect this has to do with Big5 Neuroticism or Big5 Openness facet #3(""Feelings""). "
3283,Does research support the notion of mimicry building trust?,"Mimicry is the behaviour in which one person subconsciously imitates the gesture, speech pattern, or attitude of another person.  Some people believe that mimicry has strong social effects. For example, according to NLP, mimicry can be used strategically to build rapport (here, the technique is called ""mirroring"").  Has there been any scientific research on the effects of mirroring? If so, does research support the notion that mirroring builds trust? "
3284,Is there a relation between speed of executing a task and ones intelligence?,"I recently came across a code refactoring problem. Considering the risk of getting into a risky bug later I switched to my usual mode of think and solve it, rather than go and make the changes fast. However, another colleague of mine solved the same problem with a fast paced code changes approach. Both of them worked correctly. However, this incident made me wonder whether it was actually a problem with one's ability to solve the problem that led one to take a slower approach.  So my question is, whether intelligent people actually can finish their tasks faster, or whether it is the speed of working that gives an illusion of intelligence?  What is the significance of speed in finishing tasks in general? "
3285,"""Need"" vs ""Want"" in psychology",In marketing the terms needs and wants are usually used to refer to different concepts. It is not clear to me what exactly they mean.  In psychology what are the definitions for needs and wants? What is the difference between them? 
3286,Isolating the desired event in EEG signals,"When we took an EEG data from subjects, does the subject have to be in  ""neutral state"" i.e there is no anger, no sadness,   no happiness ...etc. and they also in situation that they  neither do any logical operations nor any concerns in their life events?  Often when I read in the literature, they assume that the subject is in this situation above! For example if someone want to elicit the emotion state on the subject from an EEG signal , it's feature extraction process depends on the variance of the signal, and it's assumed that all variance in the EEG is for only the emotions. The brain process a lot of processes, and the signal will contains Emotion , logical operation ,  the usually processes to organize human functions ... etc .   So what is the rational judgment on this experiment? Assuming that the subject so clever and operated with experimenter, how much will he really control on his mind behavior?  In short : how can we depend on parameters (i.e variance) for evidence when this parameter does not only depend on the behavior that we want to make a decision with?  I know that when we deal with event related potentials (ERPs) , we  make the parameters  highly dependent on that event , but this is does not apply on inner-voice research. "

3290,Is it possible to become addicted to sleep deprivation?,"Background: After staying awake for an entire night without sleeping medication, some individuals report feeling tired while others report feeling euphoric and at some point begin to hallucinate with funny noises endlessly repeating.  Questions:   What neural or psychological mechanisms could make an individual want to experience the effects of sleep deprivation? Is sleep deprivation addictive? Does sleep deprivation count as a drug?  Is enjoying sleep deprivation related to having Asperger's Syndrome?  "
3291,What is the difference between Megalomania and Narcissism?,"As far as I can tell, both megalomania and narcissism are found in [delusions of] grandiosity. Perhaps megalomania has more focus on power, rather than just being well liked?  What is the primary difference between the two?  Are all megalomaniacs narcissists? Or all narcissists megalomaniacs? Or are they completely separate? "
3292,Can you make yourself like/hate something when you learned to hate/like it during early life?,"Suppose that someone develops liking (or even obsessing with) something since very early life, e.g watching football from age 5 to age 25. Is it possible to consciously make oneself hate it when one is older?  Can the converse happen also? Is it possible to hate something at a young age and then consciously make oneself like it when older?  If this ""brain rewiring"" can happen, what are the methods to achieve it? Is there any research on this subject? "
3293,Can the mind affect the physical brain? - a simple thought experiment,"Scientists maintain that ""a physical action requires a physical cause"". However, if I am in deep thought about my dead spouse, for example, and a tear comes to my eye, how is it that the mind (thought) can cause a physiological response (a tear)? Does this not contradict the (physical) law of cause and effect? "
3294,Can the brain be trained into a state of persistent happiness?,"Happiness is a state of mind. Can we retain this state even in the case of sadness, depression, or a dire situation through training? What methods could one use in order to train the brain to retain the happy state? "
3295,"Does a condition exist that resembles autism, but featuring much instead of little empathy?","I recently read a book by an autistic author who relates his experiences in professional life in IT. (He was diagnosed only in mid adulthood.) Colleagues see him as highly intelligent but also stubborn and egocentric. He explains that he cannot read people's faces  and therefore misses out on the non-verbal part of human communication, which is 80%. Because he cannot remember faces, he often cannot greet acquaintances, which obviously causes consternations. One also gets the sense that neither would be inclined to do so because he abhors all situations with idle small talk.   Many outer markers of his biography reminded me of a friend of mine: also high IQ, also in IT, with his private life (perennial single) and professional life now somewhat in shambles. That friend also often irritates people and avoids small talk. But while he seems similar to an autist on the surface he may be very different on a deeper level.   Whereas the autistic author (at least by his own account) has very little empathy, this friend may have too much. He can (or ""can"") read the faces of other humans, but somehow he does not seem to be able to trust much of what he sees. Some of his intelligence seems to stem from being constantly on the guard, as if to form models in his head about what really is going on and where he can fit in, but never arriving at safe conclusions. I know that there were unspoken tensions between his parents when he grew up. He is not obviously constrained in public and dear to some who know him well, but struggles with the scale of human relationships in between at a severe price.  My question is this: Does this ring any bells? Is there a name for this condition? Any books that I might follow-up and/or recommend? "
3296,What is Intelligence? Is it based on prediction capability of an agent?,"I have the intuition that at a first level is the capability of an individual to predict outcomes of her/his/its own actions in a environment were he/she/it has familiarity with (don't you feel stupid when you find yourself stranded in unknown environment?).  Then at higher level intelligence should correspond to be able to predict the outcomes of the actions of the other agents in the same environment, especially if they have a significant impact on the subject autonomy.  Does my intuition make sense? "
3297,To what degree is emotional state visible in a person's eyes?,"Is it true that a person's emotional state (such as arousal, fear, etc) can be determined by looking solely at the persons eyes?  Here I am assuming that this may be the case only in limited circumstances (specific scenarios or specific basic emotions such as fear) but if emotional state can be determined from the eyes, is there any research on the extent to which this is possible? "
3298,How common is alien hand syndrome?,"The impression that I got from looking at a couple of articles on alien hand syndrome was that it was an extremely common or basically guaranteed result of getting a callosotomy to treat severe epilepsy. However, I just ran into a study that showed essentially no effect from being born without a corpus callosum:     The pattern of anatomical features of the brain revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is described in six patients incidentally identified as having acallosal brains... Conventional clinical testing revealed no abnormalities except a slight impairment of walking heel-to-toe in two patients. None of the patients had subjective restrictions of activities of daily life, which shows the efficacy of unknown compensatory processes.   Questions   How common is alien hand syndrome?  How frequently do callosotomies result in alien hand syndrome?  How often is there severe damage to the corpus callosum unaccompanied by alien hand syndrome? How many cases of alien hand syndrome are there with no visible damage to the corpus callosum?  "
3299,Is art therapy really effective?,"I read the whole Wikipedia article. But I still have doubts. Is art therapy effective? If so, in which ways has it been studied? "
3300,Do Big 5 or BIS/BAS personality theories propose that combinations of personality traits are meaningful?,"Personality traits tend to correlate. That is, the factors 'reward seeking', 'fun seeking' and 'drive' of the BIS/BAS scales are inter-correlated and similary in the Big 5 theory, the factor Neuroticism negatively correlates with Extraversion and Conscientiousness. (In the general population.)  I was wondering, does either of the personality theories (or any other personality theory) propose that there exists a balance between personality traits? Or that certain combinations of traits are meaningful. For example would high Neuroticism and high Extraversion describe some subgroup and be predictive in any way? "
3301,Regarding the mind and what it can affect,"About the question 'Can the mind mind affect the brain?': Some responses are 'no' because the mind is a physical 'thing' or structure (if I read it correctly). Yet if the Mind is only a physical structure why couldn't the mind affect the brain if they are both physical systems? The brain, the physical system regarding active neural excitation events and the mind, the physical system dealing with the manipulation and organization of 'established' patterns of neural-signalling. The 'higher-level' organization of the physical system, the mind, could manipulate or alter the physical system called the brain. "
3302,Can information theory be applied to human interactions and communication?,"I am not sure if this question is better suited for the computational science SE.   I learned a bit of Shannon's information theory in a course I took last year. In the class it was defined as the quantitative relaying of information between a signal and a receiver across a medium that introduces noise. In all the examples we explored it was typically defined in terms bits of information that can be quantified and conveyed across the communication channel. Some examples we discussed were data compression, the transfer of DNA from parent cells to daughter cells, and aspects of speech/written words.  Let's say two individuals are in conversation. One speaks a phrase communicating his current state of mind. He then speaks the phrase out loud. The second individual hears this phrase. She then processes it based on her own brain and the way it functions and produces a response.   Here the signal would be the person speaking the phrase and the receiver would be the person interpreting the phrase. Could we argue that the ""noise"" in this communication is the subjectivity of the two people? The first person is attempting to convey information that is derived from his particular subjective state and whatever patterns were generated by his brain from his experiences. The second person would have to weight this information against her subjective state and past experiences with the first person. This might introduce ""noise"" that would affect the intended interpretation of the phrase.  Essentially, my question is with regards to social communication - sometimes you must know the appropriate way to phrase something so that the correct information is conveyed and is not subject to misinterpretation.  Question: Would this be a proper application of information theory?  Note here that I am not talking about the actual information content of the sentences themselves (which may be noisy if imprecise language is used) but the interpretation on the part of the two people in communication. "
3303,What's the function of the clean-up memory in SPA?,"When I read about cognitive models that use the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA), such as a model for general intelligence, I often see a component called the ""clean-up memory""? What's the function of this component and how does it function vary from SPA model to SPA model? "
3304,What is the effect of viewing pornography on children?,"It is generally accepted that porn shouldn't be seen by children, and we even sometimes punish parents who fail to stop their children from finding porn.  How much are these laws based in science? Can a simple image cause real injury beyond mere disgust? Have there been any studies that track lives of people who were exposed to porn or other disturbing imagery as children or adolescents?  Note that I have also posted this question on parenting.SE. "
3305,What motivates individuals to engage in cyberbullying?,"With the advent and proliferation of social media, forums and q&amp;a sites, there has been a matching increase in the incidents of online-bullying, or 'cyber-bullying, that goes beyond trolling. All too many times, the consequences of this kind of bullying (like any type of bullying) can be tragic.  What is the psychological motivation behind the cyber-bully?  Is it a consequence of them feeling empowered by their apparent anonymity?  I have read the post ""Why do teenagers take the internet and cyberbullying so seriously?"", but my question is focused on the psychological motivations that the perpetrator of cyberbulling has, not why it is so damaging to the victims.  I am after authoritive (refereed) articles about this. "
3306,Why is the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard so intolerable?,"I am curious as to what current research shows regarding why scraping noises such as fingernails on a chalkboard, a knife/fork scraping against a plate, metal grinding against metal or stone etc are so intolerable to humans. In doing some initial research for this I read the wikipedia article on Sound of fingernails scraping chalkboard (there's a wikipedia article on everything!) but I am looking for more references or updated research.  From the reading I have done, there seems to be two competing theories:   The sound is reminiscent of the warning calls of primates and triggers an evolutionary response left over from an earlier age designed to protect us from predators The sound hits a resonante frequency of the inner ear which causes it to be particularly intolerable   To me personally the first theory makes very little sense. Hearing the warning calls of primates does not personally trigger anywhere near the same feelings of extreme frustration and irritability that I feel when I accidentally scrape my knife on my plate. Furthermore the feelings caused by the ""nails on a chalkboard"" sound do not at all trigger a fight-or-flight response or put me on edge as a loud noise or something that startles me does. If anything it is almost paralyzing, which seems counter to the evolutionary theory.  How accurate is the wikipedia article? Is there any newer / more widely accepted research available on what causes the sound of ""fingernails on a chalkboard"" to be so intensely awful to human beings? "
3307,How can people better express subjective conscious experience with words?,"I'm interested in how the human mind works, and over the years have experienced and took notice of a number of peculiar states of consciousness, thought patterns, dreams, etc.  While a lot of these states of mind are replicable, I do not know the correct English terminology for them, which makes it difficult to describe or explore them.  For example, if a person does not know the term deja-vu, two people can give very different accounts of ""experienced something that just happened again"" and use completely different words, while if they speak of common deja-vu experiences, everything is much clearer.  It is even harder with more complex concepts, like spontaneous, intuitive and non-verbal comprehension of a concept, for which the word noesis fits. Without knowing that word, it's really hard to convey or compare experiences.   Is there a way to learn to better express what's going on in one's head in such a way that the experience can be compared with another persons?   Maybe there's a comprehensive list of words that describe subjective states of mind, developed to help people better express themselves? "
3308,Which morals are universal across the species?,This is the first of a series of three questions about morality:    There are sets of moral standards within any given society. What one society deems as acceptable may be deemed as abhorrent in another. This concept lends itself to the idea that some aspects of morality are learnt and not innate within an individual.  Which morals are universal across the species?  The second question: What is the psychology of morality?  The third question: How is individual morality linked to psychological profiling? 
3309,Is the condition Pathological Intoxication recognised as real?,"The plot of the movie Final Analysis revolves around a murder committed by a person diagnosed with Pathological Intoxication.  The following study confirms the:       probable existence of a discrete syndrome of pathological reaction to   alcohol without reference to the amount of alcohol consumed.   The Diagnosis of Pathological Intoxication Barry M. Maletzky Volume 37, 1976 > Issue 09: September 1976 Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.    However there are doubts as raised by the following article.     The existence of pathological intoxication as an entity must remain in   doubt unless the disorder can be reproduced under controlled   conditions.   Pathological intoxication--is there such an entity? Hollender MH. J Clin Psychiatry. 1979 Oct;40(10):424-6.    I can see other conflicting articles; What is the latest position on Pathological Intoxication?  "
3310,How sexual activity influences a woman's sex drive,"Sheila Gregoire suggests that increasing the amount of sexual activity increases a woman's sexual desire in general. I can postulate that child bearing and raising impacts significantly upon a woman's life and that possibly, when a woman finds a mate worthwhile, it is a primitive drive to reproduce.  In  studies by Winnifred B. Cutler, it is demonstrated how, as sexual frequency declines so does sex drive, for women.    HOW SEXUAL FREQUENCY AFFECTS A WOMAN'S SEXUAL RESPONSIVENESS, FERTILITY, AND HEALTH Paul H. Byerly   Is it true that having sex increases a women's future desire to have sex? What physiological purpose does this serve?  "
3311,What explains the relative importance of physical versus mental features in human mate selection?,"I assume that it is the brain that has put human beings at the top of the food chain (Biped and  opposable thumbs aside).  Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest suggest that the best specimens of a species are those that have the greatest mating privileges. I assume that well developed characteristics, required by that species to ensure survival will will be sought after, not just of one particular group, but the species as a whole. So for lions it strength will be desired, and for elephants size will matter.  For humans, it is the  brain that is our evolutionary marvel. It sets us apart from all other species.  I think human physical prowess is somewhat redundant when it comes to our survival and progress.   Many highly intelligent people are still regarded as social misfits, nerds and geeks. The high school football team and cheer leaders are still very popular. Sports stadiums are filled and televised, and the regular chess clubs are not. This seems a bit like a limiting mechanism, where we are not smart enough to overcome our base natures and so the truly, evolutionary, superior specimens are downgraded, whilst the redundant brawny types that appeals to the apes, are still highly sought after.   What is the relative importance of physical versus mental features in human mate selection? Do mental features receive relative little weighting? What is the evolutionary psychology argument for the relative importance of physical versus mental features in mate selection?  "
3312,How does emotional pain cause as much suffering as physical pain?,"Consider someone who has a serious injury. Example examples include losing a limb, being shot or falling from a great height. It is easy for the human mind and science to comprehend and explain why and how much pain that person would suffer.  Emotional pain originates in a relatively small part of the body, within the brain, and it isn not usually caused by physical injury.    How can emotional pain cause as much or even greater suffering than physical pain? Why is emotional pain so difficult for many people to cope with?  "
3313,How to calculate composite factor scores post factor analysis for a questionnaire?,I have a question with regard to calculating composite factor scores after running a factor analysis in SPSS. My research is on work related stress and I collected my data through a perceived stress questionnaire. I check for reliability for all sub scales and ran a factor analysis and obtained a clean factor solution extracting four factors. Each factor consists of 5-6 items.    How do I calculate the totals for each factor? Should I calculate the scores before or after centering the data?

3315,Steady State Topography and Advertising/Preference: Weaknesses? Criticism?,"Steady-state topography is a derivation of EEG/ERPs using an evoked potential to an ongoing oscillating stimuli called the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). Variations in the phase difference between the SSVEP and the stimulus are interpreted to measure ""summed changes in synaptic transmission time"", where a latency reduction indexes an increase in synaptic excitation and a latency increase indicates a reduction in synaptic excitation (Silberstein &amp; Nield, 2008).  This kind of change at lateral prefrontal sites, particularly left lateral prefrontal sites, has been interpreted to show increased long-term memory activation to specific stimuli (Smith &amp; Gevins, 2004).  Some studies have also shown that this increased LTM activation is a predictor of future buying behavior (Silberstein &amp; Nield, 2008).  What are the criticisms of this method?  Weaknesses?  Other possible interpretations?  References:      Silberstein, R., &amp; Nield, G. (2008) Brain activity correlates of consumer brand choice   shift associated with television advertising.

Just watch the show ""American Pickers"" to get an idea of this subculture.  The nostalgia and style of the vintage subculture seems to create some sort of feeling that is very pleasant/euphoric.  Especially during times of increased stress, high levels of psychological pressure and/or life struggle - the vintage objects seem to provide some sort of comfort for the individual (as I have also witnessed this in myself and observed in others).  Are there any studies that look into this phenomenon and what are some of it predominant findings?  "
3321,Are life positions in transactional analysis accurate aides in diagnosing personality disorders?,"Eric Berne developed the notion of transactional analysis (TA ) and author of the book  ""The Games People Play"".  Thomas A Harris then wrote the book ""I'm OK - You're Ok"" based on Berne's theory of TA.  Tony White expanded on this theory.  They produced the following concepts about people's life positions. As a basis for a person's way of relating to others and the world.:    ""I'm OK, You're OK"" ""I'm not OK, You're OK"" ""I'm OK, You're not OK"" ""I'm not OK, You're not OK"" ""I'm not OK, But You're Worse"" ""I'm not OK, You're Irrelevant"" ""I'm a Bit More OK Than You Are"" ""I'm OK, You're Irrelevant"" ""I'm OK, You're OK, They're not OK""  How effective is this paradigm as an aide  to diagnosing personality disorders?

3322,Would the Milgram Experiment results be replicated in Eastern cultures?,"When the Milgram Experiment was performed in the 1960s and replicated multiple times up until the 1980s, it was performed in Western cultures. When it was replicated in 2006, it was again performed in the USA. One of the interesting observations that was made, was that the subjects in most cases, agreed to continue the shock treatments if they were reassured that they cannot be held  responsible for anything that happens and cannot be sued*.   This to me, sounds to be an individualistic reaction to the experimenter's command as opposed to a collectivistic response where subjects would not only try to protect their self interests but would also act to protect the confederate being shocked from ill treatment**. Is this an accurate assertion?  As we know, Western cultures are known to emphasize on individualism whereas Eastern cultures are known for inculcating collectivism. So, would the experimental results differ if the experiment were replicated today in an Eastern culture (Japan, for example)?  Have any such studies been conducted in the East?   *Mentioned in Burger, Jerry M. (2008).

3324,Is there a correlation between people who frequently laugh at their own jokes and narcissism?,"It is not uncommon for people to  laugh at their own jokes. One comedian discusses how he uses this as a benchmark for whether or not a joke is going to be funny for the audience.  Psychology Today interviews John Hodgman     Your delivery is famously dry. Do you ever crack yourself up? I find   it to be comedically unethical to laugh at your own jokes on stage.   ...//...      But the reverse is true when writing. I generally only like a joke of   my own if I make myself laugh when I write it. If my brain can fool   myself into a surprised chuckle, even when I am the one who wrote the   joke, my guess is that it can also fool you.     Is there a correlation between  people who frequently laugh at their own jokes and narcissistic features? "

3328,How do our emotions toward a subject affect our brain activity within similar activities?,"I'll bring an example: there are people who love to dance and could do it for hours. Yet, if you'd make them run a long distance they would get tired really soon just because they don't like running not because they wouldn't have the stamina. On the other hand there are people who love long distance running and could run for hours yet if they are forced to dance they get easily tired.  Both activities are physical so while doing either of them, our brain releases endorphins, which make us feel good. However it seems that just our emotion toward the activity we are doing defines whether we actually feel good.  So my question is: Is there any difference in brain activity while doing something you love or doing something similar you don't like?  If our emotions do affect our brain activity significantly, would it be possible to psychologically train ourselves to like/dislike a certain activity we want to do more/less? "
3329,What were the long-term effects on the participants of the Stanford Prison Experiment?,"It has been maintained by Dr. Philip Zimbardo that the experiment has had no long-term harm on the participants. However, one out of the 24 initial participants, who had suffered a breakdown within 36 hours of starting, later went on to become a prison psychologist and has been in the profession for at least 14 years.  While the experiment may not have had any ""harm"" on the participants, the fact that it had such a huge impact on one participant (as the person himself claims in the experiment documentary), calls into question the fact that how much did the experiment end up altering or affecting the participant's lives.   So, were long term effects (not just ""harm"") of the experiment tracked and documented by the team or anybody else? If tracked, has this been published at any point of time?  Secondly, in most of the popular literature and even on the official website, I do not find any discussion of the experiment in terms of long term effects. Are long-term effects of psychological studies on participants' not considered worth recording? Why? "

3332,"Sadistic personality disorder, psychopathy and correlation with violence","Going through some article, it seems the differences between the descriptions for sadistic personality disorder and psychopathy is minimal, if at all existent.  In the first article it appears  the only difference is a propensity for physical violence. In the second article, the high correlation between psychopathy and physical violence is debunked as a myth.    Given the similarities between the two conditions; What is the real difference between an individual with Sadistic Personality Disorder and Psychopathy?    What are the real facts correlating violence in psychopathy?  The excerpts are provided below:     The Sadistic Personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of gratuitous cruelty, aggression, and demeaning behaviors which indicate the existence of deep-seated contempt for other people and an utter lack of empathy. Some sadists are ""utilitarian"": they leverage their explosive violence to establish a position of unchallenged dominance within a relationship. Unlike psychopaths, they rarely use physical force in the commission of crimes. Rather, their aggressiveness is embedded in an interpersonal context and is expressed in social settings, such as the family or the workplace.      This narcissistic need for an audience manifests itself in other circumstances. Sadists strive to humiliate people in front of witnesses. This makes them feel omnipotent. Power plays are important to them and they are likely to treat people under their control or entrusted to their care harshly: a subordinate, a child, a student, a prisoner, a patient, or a spouse are all liable to suffer the consequences of the sadist's ""control freakery"" and exacting ""disciplinary"" measures.      Sadists like to inflict pain because they find suffering, both corporeal and psychological, amusing. They torture animals and people because, to them, the sights and sounds of a creature writhing in agony are hilarious and pleasurable. Sadists go to great lengths to hurt others: they lie, deceive, commit crimes, and even make personal sacrifices merely so as to enjoy the cathartic moment of witnessing someone else's misery.      Sadists are masters of abuse by proxy and ambient abuse. They terrorize and intimidate even their nearest and dearest into doing their bidding. They create an aura and atmosphere of unmitigated yet diffuse dread and consternation. This they achieve by promulgating complex ""rules of the house"" that restrict the autonomy of their dependants (spouses, children, employees, patients, clients, etc.). They have the final word and are the ultimate law. They must be obeyed, no matter how arbitrary and senseless are their rulings and decisions.      Most sadists are fascinated by gore and violence. They are vicarious serial killers: they channel their homicidal urges in socially acceptable ways by ""studying"" and admiring historical figures such as Hitler, for instance. They love guns and other weapons, are fascinated by death, torture, and martial arts in all their forms. 1   In another discussion the idea of a  psychopath being typically violent is dispelled as a myth:     All psychopaths are violent. Research by psychologists such as Randall T. Salekin, now at the University of Alabama, indicates that psychopathy is a risk factor for future physical and sexual violence. Moreover, at least some serial killers—for example, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy and Dennis Rader, the infamous “BTK” (Bind, Torture, Kill) murderer—have manifested numerous psychopathic traits, including superficial charm and a profound absence of guilt and empathy.   Nevertheless, most psychopaths are not violent, and most violent people are not psychopaths. In the days following the horrific Virginia Tech shootings of April 16, 2007, many newspaper commentators described the killer, Seung-Hui Cho, as “psychopathic.” Yet Cho exhibited few traits of psychopathy: those who knew him described him as markedly shy, withdrawn and peculiar. 2   1  Sadistic Personality Disorder ""Personality Disorders Revisited"" (450 pages e-book) By: Dr. Sam Vaknin   2 What ""Psychopath"" Means It is not quite what you may think By Scott O.

3333,How objective are scientific measures of paraphilia?,"   Paraphilia (from Greek para = beside and -philia = friendship, meaning love) describes the experience of intense sexual   arousal to highly atypical objects, situations, or individuals.   Which practices that have been defined as paraphilia has changed over the course of time and with changes in ""religious"" control over modern society and so a freedom of moral conscience. A striking example being homosexuality, which was considered a mental illness. The educated and enlightened thinkers of many communities now find such an idea as abhorrent.   What is acceptable sexual practice varies across cultures. This in part is reflected by the age of consent across nationalities; which range from 12 to 21. Striking disparages showing in the Phillipines where female to male age of consent is 12 and 18 for female to male respectively; but for any   male to male or female to female sex is 18. And in Burkina Faso  where the age for female to male sex is 13 for both sexes, but for male to male or female to female is 21 for both. Not to mention the places where homosexuality is illegal.  Given this great variation is what is legally acceptable (thereby one would conclude socially acceptable within that culture) and what one place would deem as acceptable another would deem as aberrant.   How can paraphilia be, scientifically, defined on behaviour alone? Are there neurobiological differences between the brain of a ""paraphilic"" and a ""normal""?  What is the correlation between other mental illness and/or abnormal psychology and paraphilia?  note: this lends itself to what we define as illness or abnormal psychology "
3334,How do memories come up for no apparent reason? Is this evidence that we remember everything?,"As I was driving, all of a sudden the name ""Holden Caufield"" came to my mind. It sounded really familiar. I googled the name and it was the main character in The Catcher in the Rye. The last time I even read that book was in 2005. I had no reason to even remember this book because I thought it was boring.    Yet how did I seem to recall the name ""Holden Caufield?""  Is this proof that we basically remember everything, we just have to find ways to access the memories?  "
3335,Do graphemes relate to communication and thought disorders?,"The question Does language and/or culture affect an individual's cognitive capacity? explores the possibility of  differences in cognition based on language and cultural variations.  In this question I am focusing on certain aspects of language only: the orthography, in particular, the types of graphemes.  Syllabary graphemes are shallow orthographies, where each kana represents and maintains a consistent sound throughout that language (with some exceptions). The well recognised scripts of some Asian cultures (Chinese, Japanese, Korean,...) use syllabary systems.  Alphabetic graphemes are more complex.  English, and a good deal of European languages use alphabetic graphemes, where each letter and its usage represents a sound. The great variation in how one symbol (letter) can sound, depending on the context of the letter within a word or sentence, is referred to as a deep orthography.   Given the level of complication with alphabetical languages;   I am interested if they can  lead to increased incidence of faulty cognition, for instance, thought disorders, dyslexia, circumstantiality, clang association, phonemic paraphasia, blocking, neologisms,.. to name a few.  Have there been any studies on this, and if so, what are there findings? "
