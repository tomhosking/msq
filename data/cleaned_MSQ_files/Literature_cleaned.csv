0,"Is there significance behind the name ""Scout"" from To Kill A Mockingbird?","I am asking this question in response to the response to this question, which was more broadly asking about the significance of the names in To Kill A Mockingbird. However, it was closed as too broad. As I stated there I have not done a significant amount of research because I am not yet finished with the book. Is there significance behind the name ""Scout"" from To Kill A Mockingbird? If so, what is the significance of ""Scout""? "
1,Is this fictional event of a ship becoming airborne because of a storm based on a real event?,"In the book Nation, by Terry Pratchett, a sailing ship becomes airborne from the force of a storm, and is pushed inland quite a distance, before becoming lodged in trees.  Is this possible? If so, are there records of it happening to other sailing ships, that Terry Pratchett could have possibly used as inspiration? "
2,What does Nuvoletta's disappearance signify in Finnegans Wake?,"I am studying Samuel Barber's art song ""Nuvoletta"", whose text is adapted from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. I have not studied Finnegans Wake. The music is very beautiful.  As I understand it, Nuvoletta is likened to wind, dew, and cloud, and she disappeared in the end of the excerpt. What does the event suggest and signify? What is the background of Nuvoletta (whom I suppose is a character in the novel) that makes such metaphor appropriate?   Ms Bird sings Nuvoletta Barber's adaptation of lyrics  "
3,"What was ""Rip Van Winkle"" based on?","I was recently surprised to discover that the story of Rip Van Winkle is credited to the US author Washington Irving, who published it in 1819. I'd always vaguely imagined it to be a Brothers Grimm story or an old (probably European) folk tale. It certainly has the feel of such stories.  Was it, in fact, based on one? Or did Washington Irving come up with the story out of whole cloth, inspired merely by the idea and atmosphere of traditional folk tales in general?  Was ""Rip Van Winkle"" inspired by a particular traditional folk tale or older story? "
4,"To the Lighthouse -- ""Whitening before rain""","From Virgina Woolf's To the Lighthouse:     It was fringed with joy. The wheelbarrow, the lawnmower, the sound of poplar trees, leaves whitening before rain, rooks cawing brooms knocking, dresses rustling -   How do leaves ""whiten before rain""? Is this something common to all plants?  Additionally, is a ""rook"" a type of raven, or what is a rook? "
5,How did people know the meaning to Shakespeare's new words?,"I don't pretend to know much about the history of literature, but I was always told that Shakespeare invented an awful lot of words, 1700 is usually the number given. How did anyone know what they meant? I know some were portmanteaus, and some were nouns transformed into verbs, the meaning of which may have been discernible, but what about entirely new words he made up?  Did each play come with a list of words he'd invented? Was there a glossary attached to his works? Or did he just tell the actors what they meant and let them try portray the meaning to the audience?  For example, let's say Shakespeare invented the word ""mimic"". How did this word come to mean or was discovered to mean ""thing that copies another thing"" or  ""to copy another thing""? "
6,"Where did the idea of a ""true name"" come from?","There's a common trope in Western fantasy that, up until now, I've sort of taken for granted: the ""true name.""  This is the idea that all things have true names that are somehow more closely linked to what the thing is, and that knowing it grants some degree of power over the thing. This has many forms and tropes, but they all have the exact same underlying elements.   Most commonly, though, it's used as a plot device with regard to people:    That in order to figure out someone's true name, you have to totally understand them.  That true names are to be kept secret at all costs.  That finding your own true name requires some sort of developed sense of self-knowledge.  That knowing someone's true name allows you to bend them to your will.    Some works seem to apply these to objects, or ideas themselves, but they ultimately stem from people and (more generally) sentient beings. Still, the idea does seem to show up in one form or another in many fantasy books.   Where did this idea come from, originally? Does it have a clear source? "
7,Did Shakespeare consider Julius Caesar a tyrant or a martyr?,"I've seen the Shakespeare play Julius Caesar interpreted in two different ways (by people with different social and political views, naturally):   either Caesar as a power-mad tyrant who got his comeuppance, and Brutus and Cassius as freedom fighters sadly defeated by Caesar's former lackeys who now sought power themselves; or Caesar as a martyr murdered before his time, and Brutus and Cassius as power-hungry killers on whom righteous vengeance was taken by Caesar's friends.   What is the evidence - either from the text of the play itself, or from surrounding evidence, if any - of which of these interpretations the writer himself intended?  Note that I'm not interested in any analysis of actual historical events, except inasmuch as they may inform us about the play by comparison. I'm asking about how Shakespeare was trying to portray Caesar and the conspirators who killed him. Or to put it another way (assuming everyone involved thought themselves in the right), from whose point of view was the play meant to be written? "
8,Why do the Grayer twins switch places?,"This question contains spoilers for David Mitchell's Slade House.  The first four chapters of Slade House end with the narrator in the twins' attic, sitting around a candle with them. I noticed that during Sally's viewpoint, they've switched places around the candle:  Nathan     Lady Grayer on my left, but she's younger now, younger than Mum. To my right is Jonah Grayer but he's older than the Jonah in the garden.   Gordon     On my left there's Chloe, in a hooded padded robe thing. On my right there's... a male Chloe.   Sally     To my right sits Kate Childs, the Wicked Witch of the West, dressed in a gray Arab-style cloak thing, but now in her midthirties. Have I really been here so long? Have all those years been stolen from me? To my left hovers another vaguely familiar face... Jesus, it's Melbourne Mike.   Freya     Left of the candle hovers a woman in her midthirties. She's familiar... it's Maggs the landlady, but twenty year younger, slimmer, blonder, smoother-skinned and eerily beautiful. Right of the candle is a man of the same age, also blond, and also known to me... as I study him, a young Fred Pink emerges from his face.   This seems like a mistake to me, but is there any evidence whether or not it really is (from inside or outside the book)? Has this been changed in another edition, has Mitchell commented on it, etc? As far as I can tell from the story, while the twins can work all sorts of magic, switching places in the attic should be impossible, since time doesn't pass in the attic between these scenes. "
9,"Do I need to read all the supplementary material for The Expanse, and in what order?","I want to read The Expanse, but I'm kind of confused about which to read first and what I actually need to read. So far as I can tell The Expanse is a series of novels that fall in roughly chronological order, but there's also a number of novellas and short stories which jump around the chronology.  I figure the shorter stuff is going to be harder to find (published in magazines, etc). Does it matter what order I read the non-novel material in? Can/should I skip the non-novel material entirely? "
10,Was Jonah Wizard based on any specific celebrity?,"In the The 39 Clues series, Jonah Wizard is the Cahill's famous face - he's a star hip-hop musician, and he gets mobbed everywhere. He's a celebrity - he flies private planes, has tons of money, etc. He talks like a 'gangsta'. Here's an example:     ""Wassup, Pierce Landing? The Wiz is in the house!""   -The 39 Clues; Unstoppable: Flashpoint, chapter 26   ...     ""Legit, I've got some things to tell you about my man, J-dog,"" Jonah harangued the crowd.   -The 39 Clues; Unstoppable: Flashpoint, chapter 27   Was Jonah based on any specific celebrity? "
11,Why did John le Carré choose a French pseudonym?,"The former MI5 and MI6 agent David John Moore Cornwell used the name John le Carré on his numerous spy novels. Wikipedia explains why he had to write under a pseudonym:     he wrote the detective story A Murder of Quality (1962) and The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1963), as ""John le Carré"" (le Carré is French for ""the Square"") – a pseudonym required because Foreign Office officers were forbidden to publish in their own names.   But why did he choose that particular pseudonym? As a British intelligence officer writing about British intelligence officers, why did he decide to use a French-sounding name? And for that matter, why that particular name - what was the significance to him of a square? "
12,Is there a specific tuition system that the University's was based on?,"In Patrick Rothfuss' The Kingkiller Chronicle, students at the University are asked to pay a variable amount for their tuition per term, based mostly on their performance in an interview in front of the entire head staff, and partly on their performance during the previous term. For example, a student who does well is asked for a lower payments, and troublesome or ignorant students are asked for higher payments.    Tuition is variable, and depends partly on the intelligence of the student:     I knew from my previous discussions with Ben that you needed money or   brains to get into the University. The more of one you had, the less   of the other you needed.      [...]      I also heard how high the other students' were set. The lowest had   been four talents and six jots, but most were double that. One student   had been charged over thirty talents for his tuition.   The Name of the Wind Chapter 36 ""Less Talents""     The last span of every term at the University was reserved for   admissions exams. Classes were canceled and the masters spent several   hours of each day conducting examinations. Your next term's tuition   was based on your performance. A lottery determined what day and hour   you would go through admissions.      A great deal hung on the brief interview. Missing a few questions   could easily double your tuition.   The Name of the Wind Chapter 49 ""The Nature of Wild Things"" Bad behavior can negatively impact tuition:     ""No,"" Manet snapped. ""He's telling you what I've told you twice   already. You're a king-high idiot if you go through admissions this   term.""        ""What?"" I asked. ""Why?""      Manet set his cards down with profound calm. ""Kvothe. You're a clever   boy, but have a world of trouble listening to things you don't want to   hear."" [...]      ""Take a term off,"" Wilem said [...]      ""You really have to,"" Sim said earnestly. ""Everyone's still talking   about the trail. It's all anyone is talking about.""      ""The trial?"" I laughed. ""That was more than a span ago."" [...]      ""You can be certain the masters are uniformly wet-cat-mad about that.""      [...]      Wilem set down his cards. ""I predict,"" he said calmly, ""that if you go   through admissions, you will receive a tuition of at least thirty-five   talents."" He looked back and forth between Sim and Manet. ""I will   wager a full gold mark to this effect. Does anyone care to take my   bet?""      Neither of them took him up on his offer.   The Wise Man's Fear Chapter 49 ""The Ignorant Edema""  Upon his return to the University, Kvothe deliberately flunks his admissions interview, inflating his tuition to bring profit to the bursar and to himself (Alveron pays Kvothe's tuition after Kvothe did him some favors).     It was bad behavior though, and poorly timed, especially after my   otherwise lackluster performance. As a result, I was assigned a   tuition of twenty-four talents. Needless to say, I was terribly   embarrassed.      Afterward I returned to the bursar's office. I officially presented   Alveron's letter of credit to Riem and unofficially collected my   agreed-upon cut: half of everything over ten talents. I put the seven   talents in my purse and wondered idly if anyone had ever been paid so   well for insolence and ignorance.   The Wise Man's Fear Chapter 142 ""Home""   As the story continues, Kvothe is charged a different amount each semester, ranging from ""less three talents"" (simultaneously inventing and earning an academic scholarship) to some very high amount I can't remember at the moment.  Is there an existing tuition system in the real world that this system resembles?  I ask this question because many pieces of the University (besides, of course, the alchemy classes) seem to be based on real world higher education, including fairly accurate representations of chemistry labs, among other things. Kvothe's struggles in making his tuition payments are discussed a lot in the first two books of the series, so I was wondering if this tuition system is based on anything currently or previously practiced in real institutions of higher learning. No school that I have attended has ever used a system remotely similar. "
13,Is there any evidence that George Orwell read 'For whom the bell tolls'? Did Hemingway read 'Homage to Catalonia' or (later) '1984'?,"Orwell was familiar with Hemingway, who was already very famous by the 1920s. Mostly Orwell was quite scathing about Hemingway, because of his macho image.  Hemingway was relatively favourable towards the official Communists, did this contribute to Orwell's antipathy towards him? Did he ever read Hemingway's novel about the Spanish Civil War?  Did Hemingway read Orwell's book on the Spanish Civil War, Homage to Catalonia?  Did Hemingway read 1984 (obviously, after he had written For whom the bell tolls)?  Edit: I see from the Hemingway list below that Ernie owned three copies of Homage to Catalonia, including a first edition from 1938. I recall reading that only a few hundred copies were printed in '38 (HoC flopped as direct political pamphleteering) so this must have been a fairly rare first edition. Perhaps someone knows if Hemingway was the kind of man to collect books without reading them, or if he would have probably read what books he owned. "
14,"In Wind in the Willows, why is Mole's garden full of Italian heroes?","I recently noticed the passage in Wind in the Willows where Mole comes back to his old home contains this extraordinary quote.     On the walls hung wire baskets with ferns in them, alternating with   brackets carrying plaster statuary - Garibaldi, and the infant Samuel,   and Queen Victoria, and other heroes of modern Italy.   Plaster busts of Samuel and Queen Victoria would, presumably, have been common British garden ornaments in 1908 when the book was written. But Italian revolutionary Garibaldi seems more of a stretch. Not to mention the fact that Mole's collection of statues extends to a range of other Italian heroes.  This seemed so incongruous that  I couldn't help but wonder: why are they there? Is this some oblique political statement by the author? "
15,"In ""Love,"" who is Junior's ""Good Man,"" and what does that imply about her?","Late in Toni Morrison's Love, Junior starts referring to her ""Good Man"":     And her Good Man agreed. As she knew from the beginning, he liked to see her win.       They recognized each other the very first night when he gazed at her from his portrait. But it was in dream they got acquainted. No fuss, no bother, no recriminations -- he lifted her up to his shoulders, where she rode through an orchard of green Granny apples. When she woke in a bright, cold room, the dream-warmth was better than the blanket.   The portrait, unquestionably, is of Bill Cosey. But the leap that Junior makes -- from tough-as-nails, look-out-for-number-one survivor, to imagining a dead man as her personal protector -- seems to me surprising, out of character, and pretty  arbitrary.  Why does Junior ""adopt"" Cosey and cast him into the role of her ""Good Man""? What does this signify about her character? Are we meant to understand her as being insane, unstable -- or is this part of her character more thematic? What theme is being expressed here - and how does such an instant, intense, intimate imaginary connection to Cosey fit in with the rest of the book, thematically? "
16,"What makes L unique in ""Love,"" and what is her significance?","Toni Morrison's Love is narrated by L, who lives on the beach, and seems to be the only person around who truly understood Bill Cosey.     I pay attention and I know all about him. That kind of understanding can only come from practice, and I had a lot of that with Mr. Cosey. You could say I fathomed his mind.   But L, throughout the story and backstory both, is removed from the action. She's often mentioned as a quiet voice of reason, and a twist near the end has her hand in it -- but it seems we never really learn who L is, what her relationship to Cosey was, and why it is that she alone has such insight.  What do we actually know about L? Is any justification for her uniqueness given -- do we get any sense of why she is a reliable guide and narrator, when all the other characters are wrapped up in their flaws and histories? What structural or thematic role does her character fulfill in the book? "
17,Is this the longest sentence by Twain?,"I noticed this sentence in chapter 4 of The Gilded Age with numerous commas, semi-colons, colons, and dashes prolonging a sentence of prodigious length:     Sometimes the boat fought the mid-stream current, with a verdant world on either hand, and remote from both; sometimes she closed in under a point, where the dead water and the helping eddies were, and shaved the bank so closely that the decks were swept by the jungle of over-hanging willows and littered with a spoil of leaves; departing from these “points” she regularly crossed the river every five miles, avoiding the “bight” of the great binds and thus escaping the strong current; sometimes she went out and skirted a high “bluff” sand-bar in the middle of the stream, and occasionally followed it up a little too far and touched upon the shoal water at its head—and then the intelligent craft refused to run herself aground, but “smelt” the bar, and straightway the foamy streak that streamed away from her bows vanished, a great foamless wave rolled forward and passed her under way, and in this instant she leaned far over on her side, shied from the bar and fled square away from the danger like a frightened thing—and the pilot was lucky if he managed to “straighten her up” before she drove her nose into the opposite bank; sometimes she approached a solid wall of tall trees as if she meant to break through it, but all of a sudden a little crack would open just enough to admit her, and away she would go plowing through the “chute” with just barely room enough between the island on one side and the main land on the other; in this sluggish water she seemed to go like a racehorse; now and then small log cabins appeared in little clearings, with the never-failing frowsy women and girls in soiled and faded linsey-woolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles and rail fences, gazing sleepily at the passing show; sometimes she found shoal water, going out at the head of those “chutes” or crossing the river, and then a deck-hand stood on the bow and hove the lead, while the boat slowed down and moved cautiously; sometimes she stopped a moment at a landing and took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of slouchy white men and negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on with their hands in their pantaloons pockets,—of course—for they never took them out except to stretch, and when they did this they squirmed about and reached their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on tip-toe in an ecstasy of enjoyment.   Does anyone know the ""story"" behind this? Was Twain deliberately seeing how long he could draw out a sentence? Are there any longer ones in any of his works?  By the way, some of the chapters of this book were written by Twain's friend and neighbor Charles Dudley Warner, but not this one - this is Twain. "
18,Why does the former nurse create with metal?,"In Kay Chronister's short story ""The Fifth Gable,"" the women who live in the four-gabled house are described in an interlude.     Before they had been women who lived in the four-gabled house, they   had been:      A maiden aunt.      A minister’s wife.      A washed-up stage actress.      A nurse.      They did not resemble themselves anymore.   I might be wrong, but as I see no other order to this list, I think that the first description (""A maiden aunt"") belongs to the woman who makes her bed in the first gable, and the second to the second etc. There is a certain amount of support for this throughout the story; for example, when the women of the house bury Marigold's third child (the one from the woman who makes her bed in the first gable), it would seem appropriate that the minister's wife would suggest a religious activity for the funeral.     “We should sing a hymn,” said the woman who made her bed in the second   gable.      “Why?” said the woman who made her bed in the fourth gable.      “It’s conventional. She’d like that.”   It makes sense that the woman who makes her bed in the third gable, whose reproductive process is linked to drama, is the ""washed-up stage actress."" A stereotypical minister's wife would keep a garden, I suppose, so it makes sense that the woman who made her bed in the second gable would produce botanical offspring.  I just don't understand why a former nurse would be associated with technology, and children made of metal. I guess it's possible that the women's life-creating powers don't relate to their former occupations, but then those don't really need to be mentioned at all, right? (And that also would contradict the pattern I established above.) Although, to be fair, associating the nurse with the almost-biological process of the woman who made her bed in the first gable cellar does make a certain amount of sense.  Another possibility is that the order of former vocations does not match the order of gables. I just think it makes sense to make the list follow that order; besides, if I'm right about the actress and the minister's wife, that means that half of the list does follow that order.  But, assuming I'm right in my assumptions about the women and their former jobs, why does the nurse create with metal? "
19,"What is the ""Intentional Fallacy""?","The intentional fallacy is described in Wimsatt and Beardsley's essay ""The Intentional Fallacy"". What exactly is the intentional fallacy? Is the concept still used in academia? "
20,Who killed this Forsaken in The Fires of Heaven?,"   Asmodean pulled open a small door, intending to find his way to the   pantry. There should be some decent wine. One step, and he stopped,   the blood draining from his face. ""You? No!"" The word still hung in   the air when death took him.   Who killed Asmodean?  I am pretty sure it was one of the Forsaken, but which one? Demandred or Graendal or someone else? "
21,How many gables are there in the four-gabled house?,"In ""The Fifth Gable"" by Kay Chronister, the protagonist interacts with the women who live in the four-gabled house. Which, suddenly and inexplicably, at the end of the story finds itself with five gables.     “Where are we going?” said Marigold.      “The fifth gable,” said the woman who made her bed in the third gable   of the four-gabled house. “We’ll need privacy.”   Additionally, it is mentioned that the house formerly had only a single gable:     But before then, the woman who made her bed in the third gable had   lived alone. And the house had only one gable, and she could bear no   children.   I checked with a dictionary to be sure that the word ""gable"" doesn't have any meaning besides for the architectural one (eg ""place where people sleep""); it doesn't.   I do understand that there is magic in this story, so the house could conceivably be a Hogwarts sort of place with shifting architecture, but is there another explanation?  How many gables could there be in a four-gabled house?  Is there a possibility of a gable that isn't counted as part of a set, but is still a gable -- like a house with a peaked roof and four gables that extend from the flat part of the roof (the set of four gables), but the ends of the peaked roof might also qualify as ""gables""? Take this picture as an example: are there two gables here, or four? Could the house below be referred to as a two-gabled house, because of the two smaller gables that jut out of the roof?       "
22,Why did the doctor give Count Bezukhov cream of tartar?,"In War and Peace, Count Bezukhov's doctors gave him Cream of Tartar after his stroke. What purpose did that serve? I haven't been able to find anything about medical benefits of cream of tartar that seem even vaguely related to this condition; what exactly did they think that giving him that would accomplish? "
23,"How much ""self-editing"" did Nabokov do when his Russian novels were translated into English?","Several of Nabokov's early, Russian-language novels were translated into English in the 1960s, either by Nabokov himself (Despair), or by translators under his guidance (including his son Dmitri).  To what extent did Nabokov take these translations as opportunities to improve upon the originals?  Did he make extensive changes to any of them?  I'm not looking for a catalog of changes, just a high-level overview of the extent to which there were any. "
24,Why did Bill Watterson choose the character names he did?,"Several major characters in Calvin and Hobbes are named after fictional or historical characters.   Calvin is named after theologian John Calvin Hobbes is named after Thomas Hobbes Miss Wormwood is named after Wormwood in The Screwtape Letters, a low-level demonic tempter. Appropriately, it's also the name of a bitter substance.   My question, then: why did the author choose those specific names? Were they mostly for the deliberate irony (naming Calvin after a serious theologian, Wormwood being named after both a tempter and a bitter substance, etc.), or are there more ""layers"" to this that I'm missing? "
25,"How was ""Contos para os nossos filhos"" used in schools?","Reading about the Portuguese author Maria Amália Vaz de Carvalho, I came across the following interesting tidbit of information:     The collection of stories for children she wrote with her husband, Contos para os nossos filhos (""Tales for our Children"", 1886) was approved by the Board of Public Instruction for use in schools.   Unfortunately, Wikipedia provides no citation for this claim, and I haven't been able to find out any more information online (I tried searching for the author's name together with ""tales for our children"" and together with ""schools""). How exactly was a book of short stories ""use[d] in schools""? Were the stories educational in nature, was it a ""cautionary tales"" type collection, or were they simply studied in literature class, presumably together with more classical works? "
26,"What can we learn from this character's death in ""Mockingjay"", out of universe?","At the end of Mockingjay,      Primrose Everdeen   dies. What can we learn from their death? What does this teach us, from an out of universe point of view? "
27,What are the Shadow Children?,"In Gene Wolfe's loose trilogy of novellas The Fifth Head of Cerberus, the middle story (""A Story"" by John V. Marsch) is the one which gives us the most direct insight into the lives of the so-called 'abos' or Annese, the original indigenous inhabitants of Sainte Anne. The story focuses on the twins Sandwalker and Eastwind, but the Shadow Children, mysterious person-like creatures who dwell on Sainte Anne together with the people, also get a lot of page time.  Who or what are the Shadow Children? When they talked about having come from another world, I assumed they were humans who had somehow had their form taken from them by the Annese, and that this explained the humanoid form of the Annese in this story. But in the third story, V.R.T., it seems as though the splashdown at the end of this story really was the first arrival of humans on Sainte Anne ... so where did the Shadow Children come from, why are they so insubstantial now (if they're not human, were they always that way?), and what is their relationship to the Annese?  Even though I've now finished the whole trilogy, there are still things to be understood and mysteries to be unravelled! This reflects the depth and subtlety of the stories and the world Wolfe created. Perhaps I should reread the second one. "
28,Finding comic referenced in semi-classic physics problem,"A physics problem in my book (and apparently in others, from the hits Google gives) goes     Comic-strip hero Superman meets an asteroid in outer space and hurls it at 800 m/s, as fast as a bullet. The asteroid is a thousand times more massive than Superman. In the strip, Superman is seen at rest after the throw. Taking physics into account, what would be his recoil velocity?   (For the curious, it would be 800,000 m/s, or over 2 million miles per hour, but that isn't my question.)  Could anyone find the comic (if it exists) that this problem refers to? "
29,"Is ""by the iron rods of soil and season"" in Graham Hancock's ""The Sign and The Seal"" an idiom?","Is it an idiom or should it be understood literally? It is from ""The Sign and The Seal"" by Graham Hancock. The full quote runs thus:     The peasant whom we met and talked to were poor, in some cases very poor indeed, and their lives were clearly ruled by the iron rods of soil and season.     (emphasis mine)  ""iron rods of soil"" puzzles me the most. Unless it is an idiom, does it refer to some geological feature of the Ethiopian soil?  If it is an idiom, what is its meaning? "
30,Should I keep the jacket on a hardcover book?,"I've got a few hardcover books. I usually read paperback, but sometimes I'll find myself with a hardcover book. Often, these will have jackets on them. Paper jackets that rip and get in the way and fall off when you try to move them. You can't even use them as proper bookmarks, they'll just slip out. (No, I love those covers, why do you ask?)   Is there any harm that it will do to the book itself if I remove the jacket and permanently keep it off?  "
31,"Questions on the meaning of a passage about friendship in Frankenstein, Letter 4","I've just started reading Frankenstein. I really want to make sure that I understand everything I read, so I want to make sure of what these sentences mean. I already did google them, but didn't find anything - seems that I am the only person who didn't figure them out.      ”And expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this blessing.”   I'm not really sure what it means. Does he mean that some people boast about happiness even if they didn't have it?    ”If one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures”   He previously says that humans are half made-up and need another half to complete themselves, why does he then advise to not lend a friend's aid to improve one's self? I didn't get it.    ”I spoke of my desire of finding a friend—of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot”   I thought that it means that he seeks a fellow man who has passion for science and knowledge to share sympathy with him, can (ever fallen to my lot) mean he did meet others before?  "
32,Do the characters in Line (by Israel Horovitz) ever fully grasp the absurdity of their behavior and situation?,"In Line (a one-act play by Israel Horovitz), the characters constantly jockey for position in a line. All of the characters seem to have a very different idea of what they're even waiting for, or why it's so important to be first in line. Why are they so determined to be first in line? What do they think that they're going to achieve? Also, do they ever figure out how different their conceptions of what they're even waiting for?

34,Does Uncle Andrew consider himself an Übermensch in The Magician's Nephew?,"The philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche rather prominently includes the idea of the Übermensch (""overman"" or ""superman""), who were exempt from the ordinary rules of morality in some sense. Is this what the following passage from The Magician's Nephew is referring to? Does Uncle Andrew consider himself an Übermensch?     ""All in good time, my boy,"" said Uncle Andrew. ""They let old Mrs. Lefay out before she died and I was one of the very few people whom she would allow to see her in her last illness. She had got to dislike ordinary, ignorant people, you understand. I do myself. But she and I were interested in the same sort of things. It was only a few days before her death that she told me to go to an old bureau in her house and open a secret drawer and bring her a little box that I would find there. The moment I picked up that box I could tell by the pricking in my fingers that I held some great secret in my hands. She gave it to me and made me promise that as soon as she was dead I would burn it unopened, with certain ceremonies. That promise I did not keep.""   ""Well then, it was jolly rotten of you,"" said Digory.   “Rotten?” said Uncle Andrew with a puzzled look. “Oh, I see. You mean that little boys ought to keep their promises. Very true: most right and proper, I’m sure, and I’m very glad you have been taught to do it. But of course you must understand that rules of that sort, however excellent they may be for little boys—and servants—and women—and even people in general, can’t possibly be expected to apply to profound students and great thinkers and sages. No, Digory. Men like me, who possess hidden wisdom, are freed from common rules just as we are cut off from common pleasures. Ours, my boy, is a high and lonely destiny.”  "
35,"Did Joseph Heller invent this particular use of the verb ""to disappear"" in Catch-22 or merely popularize it?","When Nurse Duckett informed Yossarian in Catch-22 that the Brass was planning to ""disappear"" Dunbar, Yossarian replied that ""It doesn't make sense. It isn't even good grammar. What the hell does it mean when they disappear somebody?"" This strongly suggests that this use of the verb ""to disappear"" wasn't in popular use at the time that the book was written (or that, if it was, Joseph Heller wasn't aware of it).  Was this the first use of the term, or did Catch-22 merely popularize it? "
36,Why Catch-22 if there was only one catch?,"Catch-22 contains the following quote:     There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.      ""That's some catch, that Catch-22,"" he observed.      ""It's the best there is,"" Doc Daneeka agreed.   If there was only one catch, why is it ""Catch-22""? I had always thought that ""Catch-22"" was ""the catch after Catch 21 and the catch before Catch 23"". Or was it that that particular policy (the one on when you could be grounded) only had one catch and that the other catches applied to other policies? Or that Catch-22 was the ""summation"" of all the other catches in some sense (because Catch-22 means that they have the right to do anything you don't have the power to stop them from doing)? "
37,"Why did Yossarian sign letters with ""Washington Irving""?","When he's in the hospital and is forced to censor letters, Yossarian signed his ""name"" as ""Washington Irving."" Later in the book, Major Major does the same thing on official documents. What's the significance of this? Why Washington Irving? "
38,How does scansion work in Arabic poetry?,"I was reading about Arabic poetry on Wikipedia, and specifically the description of scansion:     The rhymed poetry falls within fifteen different meters collected and explained by al-Farahidi in The Science of ‘Arud. Al-Akhfash, a student of al-Farahidi, later added one more meter to make them sixteen. The meters of the rhythmical poetry are known in Arabic as ""seas"" (buḥūr). The measuring unit of seas is known as ""taf‘īlah"", and every sea contains a certain number of taf'ilas which the poet has to observe in every verse (bayt) of the poem. The measuring procedure of a poem is very rigorous. Sometimes adding or removing a consonant or a vowel can shift the bayt from one meter to another. Also, in rhymed poetry, every bayt has to end with the same rhyme (qāfiyah) throughout the poem.   This confused me for a number of reasons.   What does it mean to have fifteen different meters? Meter in poetry is the overall rhythmic structure; are the fifteen different things actually feet? Is ""seas"" really just another word for meter, or is there some significant difference between the ""seas"" of Arabic poetry and the meter of western poetry? Since seas are made up of taf'ilahs, does that mean it's a taf'ilah which is basically a foot?   I've looked for a better description of this, but searching for ""seas arabic poetry"" just gave me a list of results which were essentially identical to the above-quoted Wikipedia page. Is there a better resource for learning about the scansion structure of Arabic poetry?  What are the basics of how scansion works in Arabic poetry? "
39,"Why did Yossarian and Major Major consider ""Irving Washington"" less monotonous to sign?","Related: Why did Yossarian sign letters with &quot;Washington Irving&quot;?  Both Major Major and Yossarian would routinely sign official documents and censorship documents with ""Washington Irving"" (I have another question on exactly why they do that). When that became too monotonous, they'd sign stuff with ""Irving Washington"" for awhile. Why didn't they simply select a completely different name? Why did they consider reversing the names less monotonous? Or is that part of the joke (the fact that it really wasn't all that different)? "
40,Why did Dunbar consider a life of intentional boredom worth living?,"In Catch-22, Dunbar would routinely cultivate boredom in an effort to extend his life. Why did he consider that worthwhile? Why did he want a long but boring life? "
41,"To what extent was Catch-22 inspired by ""The Trial""?","Bureaucratic logic is one of the primary themes in Catch-22. To what extent is this inspired by The Trial by Franz Kafka? Both have the sense of being caught in the cogs of a remote, irrational, and soulless bureaucracy, but are there more concrete examples of the influence of The Trial on Catch-22? "
42,Why is Josef K.'s last name never revealed?,"Throughout the novel, the main character's name is given only as ""Josef K."" In fact, as I recall, several characters even actually refer to him as Josef K. Why isn't he given a last name? Is this symbolic of the soul-crushing influence of the bureaucracy that is, in some sense, stripping him of his identity? "
43,Why didn't Josef K. simply ignore the summons?,"Given that Josef K. didn't know exactly who was even summoning him or on what basis they were doing so, why did he cooperate?

44,"Is ""The American Claimant"" a veiled take on ""The Indian Question""?","Mark Twain's 1892 novel The American Claimant was written very soon after the Wounded Knee Massacre (1890), which was basically revenge for the 1876 Battle of Greasy Grass (""Little Big Horn""). This unprovoked and wanton slaughter was seemingly the final nail in the coffin of Indian resistance to Euro-American territorial incursion and cultural forced assimilation.  Although ""anti-Indian"" for the first decades of his life, it seems Twain at the end re-thought his position on them.  Could it be that the titled English heir in The American Claimant (Berkely Rossmore, who even dressed up as a cowboy and took the name Howard Tracy to remain incognito) was meant to represent wealthy Euro-Americans, whereas the uncouth and eccentric American (Mulberry Sellers) was a symbol of the ""Indians""?  Note that the character Washington Hawkins, a confederate of Sellers', was from Cherokee Strip (land taken from the Cherokees in the ""Oklahoma Land Rush"" of 1889).  Also, to quote from the book where the Earl of Rossmore speaks of the rights of the American Claimant: ""...morally the American tramp is rightful earl of Rossmore; legally he has no more right than his dog.""  Even L. Frank Baum (author of The Wizard of Oz) admitted that the way the Indians were treated was wrong, although he still called for their utter destruction.  BTW, although I love ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Huck Finn"" as much as (and probably more than) the next guy, The American Claimant may be my favorite novel from this, my favorite author. It is at least as topical as anything else he's written, too, and is replete with zombies, robots, mass-produced monstrosities, etc. etc. It could make a great movie. Are you listening, Hollywood? Netflix? Amazon? "

46,Why could Dragons lie in Old Speech?,"In chapter 5 fo A Wizard of Earthsea, which states the following:     [The dragon] spoke, as did Ged, in the Old Speech, for that is the tongue of dragons still. Although the use of Old Speech binds a man to truth, it is not so with dragons. It is their own language, and they can lie in it, twisting the true words to false ends, catching the unwary hearer in a maze of mirrorwords each of which reflects the truth and none of which leads anywhere.   Why could Dragons lie in Old Speech? Are they essentially telling half-truths, technically true but misleading statements, etc., or can they actually tell a ""direct"" lie? "
47,Narrator in The Idiot,"I'm struggling to understand the narrator in The Idiot. He seems like an omniscient narrator, talking of characters in third person. But, in Chapter I of Part One, while describing know-it-alls, the narrator says:  I have known scholars, writers, poets, political activists, who sought and found their highest peace and purpose in this science, who positively made their careers by it alone.  Did he mid-narration self-insert into the character of Myshkin? Does this happen throughout the novel? Is it possible that the narrator is someone or am I looking too much into it? Sure feeling like an Idiot right now :P  The translation I'm reading is that by Pevear &amp; Volokhonsky. "
48,How did Ursula Le Guin translate the Tao Te Ching / Dao De Jing?,"In 1998, Shambhala Publications published a translation of the Tao Te Ching (in pinyin: Daodejing and Dao De Jing) by Ursula Le Guin. The Dao De Jing was written in Classical Chinese, so it takes much more than just ""knowing Chinese"" to undertake a translation task like this.   According to the publisher, Le Guin had studied the Dao De Jing for more than forty years and     She has consulted the literal translations and worked with Chinese scholars to develop a version that lets the ancient text speak in a fresh way to modern people, while remaining faithful to the poetic beauty of the work. Avoiding scholarly interpretations and esoteric Taoist insights, she has revealed the Tao Te Ching's immediate relevance and power, its depth and refreshing humor, in a way that shows better than ever before why it has been so much loved for more than 2,500 years.   (You can find the same blurb on the website of PenguinRandomHouse, which distributes Shambhala's books.)  The above description of the translation process is rather vague, so I would like to know if any further details are available, such as:   Which ""literal translations"" did Le Guin consult? Which scholars did she work with? What kind of interaction did she have with those scholars? (E.g. did she just ask questions about specific passages or did she also ask them to review passages that she had translated?) How long did the process take?  "
49,Was John Galt foolish in wanting to return to the world so quickly?,"John Galt was a genius. He invented ""the motor"" and executed the greatest strike in world history. And it's clear that he understood the danger he was always in (out in the world) and how the looters operate.  So it has always been puzzling to me why, at the end of Atlas Shrugged, Galt thought it was a good idea to go back to the world so quickly after the final crash and bring all the strikers with him.  Granted, the lights had gone out in NYC, the Taggart bridge had collapsed, and the nation was near starvation. But the political leaders such as Mr. Thompson and all his cronies were still--at least to some degree--in power.  If the strikers had come back and started fixing everything, why would anyone believe that Thompson's gang wouldn't have immediately started exploiting them, regulating them, taxing them to death, and controlling them? I would have thought that the strikers needed to wait long enough for the current government leaders to be swept from power and run out of town, clearing the way for the strikers' return.  Rand makes it clear that the strikers cared little for political power, so we cannot assume that upon their return they would have tried to step into the shoes of political power in order to achieve their goals. They simply would have gone back to work, and once again been exploited by the looting politicians.  Admittedly, we don't know how much time passed between the rescue flight back from the State Science Institute and the moon-lit walk in the valley in which Galt declares to Dagney that ""we're going back"", but it certainly seems as though very little time had elapsed. Weeks? Days? "
50,"In Finnegans Wake, surely these two characters are different, and one is dead?","Since the motivation and argument supporting my question is long, but the question itself is fairly short, I will state the question as a spoiler. If the answer turns out to be indeed yes, then it would certainly spoil a brave first reading of Finnegans Wake.      Surely, HCE and Finnegan are distinct characters in Heliopolis (aka. the 'real' world, as opposed to dreamland), but Finnegan is dead by the time the novel begins? Finnegan is Anna's first husband, HCE a second. Further, in Anna's monologue, surely the monologue is primarily addressed to Finnegan, not HCE?   I wish to first introduce the current accepted interpretations of Finnegans Wake, and rail against these  on purely aesthetic grounds. I will then pose questions suggesting an alternative reading, which now appears obvious to me.   Finnegans Wake aside, Joyce has stayed with me, unlike most of the ""difficult""  postmodern texts, because Joyce's texts always resolve. The more you read the clearer Joyce becomes. Confusions clear into beauty. Once upon a time (and a very good time it was) I could not parse ""a moocow coming down along the road""! Later for ""Chrysostomos"" and ""Send us bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit"". There are now many readers' guides to Ulysses that (1) members of this forum would mostly agree on, and, (2) make an initial reading of Ulysses a pleasurable task.   Twenty odd years ago, I began reading Finnegans Wake, and was immediately dismayed. No matter how I tried I could not parse even a few pages in. Armed with A Skeleton Key and A Reader's Guide I forced my way through. I was very disapointed and neither of the texts lead to Finnegans Wake resolving for me. To this day, every text I have read on Finnegans Wake seems hollow. Until recently so did Finnegans Wake.  Here is the conventional wisdom.     The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family,   comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children   Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified   rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows   his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle   to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by   ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence   fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line,   making the work a never-ending cycle.      The introductory chapter (I.1) establishes the book's setting as   ""Howth Castle and Environs"" (i.e. the Dublin area), and introduces   Dublin hod carrier ""Finnegan"", who falls to his death from a ladder   while constructing a wall. Finnegan's wife Annie puts out his   corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake, but he vanishes   before they can eat him. A series of episodic vignettes follows,   loosely related to the dead Finnegan, most commonly referred to as   ""The Willingdone Museyroom"", ""Mutt and Jute"", and ""The   Prankquean"". At the chapter's close a fight breaks out, whiskey   splashes on Finnegan's corpse, and ""the dead Finnegan rises from his   coffin bawling for whiskey and his mourners put him back to rest”,   persuading him that he is better off where he is. The chapter ends   with the image of the HCE character sailing into Dublin Bay to take a   central role in the story.      Part IV consists of only one chapter, which, like the book's opening   chapter, is mostly composed of a series of seemingly unrelated   vignettes. After an opening call for dawn to break, the remainder   of the chapter consists of the vignettes ""Saint Kevin"", ""Berkely and   Patrick"" and ""The Revered Letter"". ALP is given the final   word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final   long monologue, in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband,   declaring ""Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!"",   and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence.   At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears   at dawn into the ocean. The book's last words are a fragment, but they   can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words   that start the book.   The motifs I have seen suggest something like    Finnegan/HCE  = Bloom, Joyce, Adam, etc., the master builder and the average man, overloaded with Homer, ?, Jesus, etc.  ALP = Molly, Nora, Eve, etc. CAD = Blazes Boylan, Gogarty, The Snake?, etc., but also with  overtones of CAD~Finnegan/HCE    Really? The genius who took Stephen to Bloom and Molly (with Boylan), had nowhere further to take this key structure than into the abstract? No fundamental movement? Sure Shaun and Shem is interesting, but we have already met Stephen+Mulligan. Come on. ""(please stoop)""!  Joyce taunts us with the question ""Who is he?"" and tempts us with tidbits of answers.     [261.26]   Terror of the noonstruck by day, cryptogam of each nightly bridable.   But, to speak broken heaventalk, is he? Who is he? Whose is he? Why is   he? Howmuch is he? Which is he? When is he? Where is he? How is he?   And what the decans is there about him anyway, the decemt man? Easy,   calm your haste! Approach to lead our passage!   But the answers I have met in texts about Finnegans Wake seem empty. He is every man, but impossible to pin down. But isn't Bloom every man? Finnegan is a mythical/historical pre-shadow to HCE. But what about Bloom and Homer? Finnegan is but one form of HCE in dreamland with no referent in Heliopolis. So why the title to the novel?  And the corollary question: Who is she?  The Joyce I know from Ulysses, wouldn't leave these questions without proper resolution. I don't think Joyce would leave it so open that all possible answers are the solution to the problem. I hope. A bit unrewarding for the amount of work the reader must put in.   And why no real drama for us to sink our teeth into? For example, both A Reader's Guide and Finnegans Wake: A Plot Summary read Anna's monologue as Anna awaking her husband HCE, in her mind, and then taking him on a stroll down memory lane. Is that really it? Not unlike Molly's monologue but without Blazes Boylan!     SPOILERS FOLLOW    An Alternative  The novel ends with a woman's interior monologue. Part IV is a single chapter that begin in dreamland, with dawn breaking, and ends with ALP delivering an interior monologue, as the rain falls softly, but persistently, outside. Ten pages of uninterrupted interior monologue. A single paragraph readable to anyone familiar with Molly's monologue. By Occam's Razor, the owner of this monologue is the owner of dreamland, i.e., ALP dreams the wake (see In Finnegans Wake, surely the dreamer is this character?). So that answers ""Who is she?"".  Anna's monologue is primarily addressed to a male ""you"" whom she 'awakes'. ""Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!"". There is also a ""him"". While ""there’s a great poet in you"",  ""so has he as bored me to slump."" While mostly addressed to ""you"", often about ""him"",  the reader must cope with sudden pronoun-referent shifts characteristic of any realistic interior monologue. As ALP thinks about ""him"", ""you"" is prone to change in referent, i.e., ""you"" refers to ""him"" suddenly. And naturally, there are few proper nouns, none definitive!  But who are these male ""you"" and ""he""? We are back to the question ""Who is he?"" but with a twist.  Anna/Joyce, frustratedly, give us the answer as we transition into the monologue.     [619.10]    Here gives your answer, pigs and scuts!   Hence we’ve lived in two   worlds.   He is another he what stays under the himp of holth.   The herewaker of our hamefame is his real namesame  who will get himself   up and erect, confident and heroic  when but, young as of old, for my   daily comfreshenall, a wee one woos.      Alma Luvia, Pollabella.       P.S. Soldier Rollo’s sweetheart. And she’s about fetted up now with nonsery reams. And rigs out in regal rooms with the ritzies. Rags! Worns out. But she’s still her deckhuman amber too.      Soft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing.    In Heliopolis there is a he other than HCE.   While HCE, the ""herewaker"" will get up and face a new day in Heliopolis, HCE is not the ""he what stays under the himp of holth"". ""He is another he"".  That other ""he what stays under the himp of holth"", will not be getting up to roam Heliopolis, because he is dead. In Heliopolis, he ""stays under the himp of holth"" ""under our  our mounding’s mass"",  ""and their upturnpikepointandplace is at the knock out in the park where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst loved livvy"". Sad, but true. Infact, ""one yeastyday he sternely struxk his tete in a tub for to watsch the future of his fates but ere he swiftly stook it out again, by the might of moses, the very water was eviparated"", since he had no future. ""He addle liddle phifie Annie ugged the little craythur"". But then, ""wan warning Phill filt tippling full. His howd feeled heavy, his hoddit did shake. (There was a wall of course in erection) Dimb! He stottered from the latter. Damb! he was dud. Dumb""! The rest is herstory.    This other he is Finnegan, ALP's first husband. He has been dead for many years by the time the novel begins. He died without completing his ""masterwork"".    At the end of chapter one, ""good Mr Finnimore, sir"" is urged to ""take your laysure like a god on pension and don’t be walking abroad"" since ""you’d only lose yourself in Healiopolis now"". Finn is kept up to date about ""the lads is attending school nessans regular, sir, spelling beesknees with hathatansy and turning out tables by mudapplication"" (Shaun and Shem) and ""queer Behan and old Kate"" (Saunderson and Kate) and "" your missus in the hall"" (ALP), but no mention is made of Issy.    Finnegan and Anna are the parents of the twins. Issy is not born of Finn and Anna.    Issy is born of Anna and ""that samesake sibsubstitute of a hooky salmon"". ""There’s already a big rody ram lad at random on the premises"", namely HCE, and it is HCE, not Finnegan, ""who will be ultimendly respunchable for the hubbub caused in Edenborough"".  He is Anna's ""P.S."". He is "" Soldier Rollo"". Oh, and he is ""ensectuous"", which means, amongst other terrible things, raping your daughter: ""went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she was barely in her tricklies"". HCE is horrible. ""Rolloraped"". Here comes every man. #metoo #mishemishe   Issy is born of Anna and HCE.  HCE is not the biological father of the twins.   So, in Anna's monologue, who is ""you"" and who is ""he""?     [HCE]  will get   himself up [...] when but, young as of old,   for my daily comfreshenall, a wee one woos.   The receiver of Anna's confession, her father confessor, does not seem to be HCE, but rather some ""wee one"".   So who is this ""wee one""?   Let us resist jumping ahead to the monologue for clues, and attempt rather to let Joyce reveal the answer.   Since ""wee"" means small, one possibility is Issy. But the ""you"" in Anna's ""comfreshenall"" is most certainly male and hence not Issy.  Issy  features large in the monologue, but as ""she"".   Recently for me, the pun dropped.      Definition of wee. 1 : very small : diminutive. 2 : very early   The receiver of the confession, the ""wee one"", is the earlier one, i.e., Finnegan. He only existed earlier, and now only exists in the ""wee"" hours. (Of course, Finn is also late.) The symbol of ""wee one"" as small one is also valid, since Anna will shortly tell ""you"" that ""You’re but a puny"".    Anna primarily addresses her interior monologue to Finn, not HCE.   In Heliopolis, Anna ""resurrects"" Finn every morning in her daily waking morning interior monologue. He must begin again. Anna is conscious of this activity. In dreamland too is Finn nightly resurrected, but that is obvious, and Anna is not conscious of it.    This interpretation is supported by the monologue itself.     [619.25] Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long! Or   is it only so mesleems? On your pondered palm. Reclined from cape to   pede. With pipe on bowl. Terce for a fiddler, sixt for makmerriers,   none for a Cole. Rise up now and aruse! Norvena’s over. I am leafy,   your goolden, so you called me.   Notice that it is the ""man of the hooths"" that Anna 'awakes', rather than the man of the house.     [622.16] You know where I am bringing you? You   remember? When I ran berrying after hucks and haws. With you drawing   out great aims to hazel me from the hummock with your sling. Our   cries. I could lead you there and I still by you in bed. Les go dutc   to Danegreven, nos? Not a soul but ourselves. Time? We have loads on   our hangs. Till Gilligan and Halligan call again to hooligan.   It is Finnegan, not HCE, that Anna 'awakens' for this daily early morning ""helpyourselftoastrool"". The primary ""you"" is Finnegan. There is also, however, a ""he"".     [619.31] But there’s a great poet in you too. Stout Stokes would take you offly. So has he as bored me to slump.    The secondary ""he"" is HCE.       [627.36] And it’s old and old it’s sad and old it’s   sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad   father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size   of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt   saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms.   ""You"", ""my cold father"" confessor, is Finnegan, and ""him"" is HCE. That's drama.  [... Note that John Gordon has ""you""=HCE, because there is no Finnegan, and no explanation as to who might the ""he"" of the monologue might be. Further he has ""wee one"" = Issy, with no explanation as to why Anna confesses to a male. William York Tindal has the ""you"" in the monologue being HCE, although morphing into Finn at times, and with no analysis of the ""you"" and ""he"" in the monologue ...]  Alternative Motif   Finnegan = Bloom, Joyce, Adam, etc., but dead before completing their ""master work"". Finns sin, ""finfin"", is an affair with Kate. ALP = Molly, Nora, Eve, etc., but after the death of their first husband (Finn), but now married to HCE. HCE = Blazes Boylan, Gogarty, The Snake?, etc., i.e., the average man, and he is not nice. HCE's sin is, amongst other things, an 'affair' with Issy.    Joyce is able to look beyond his death, and truly write a ""Book of the Dead"", since he still lives in Nora's mind. Nora, has had to move on, and here comes everybody.   While Finnegan/Joyce/Bloom/Adam died (in this story) without completing their ""master work"" (Finnegans Wake in Joyce's case), ALP/Nora/Molly/Eve still reads this work, and dreams with its language.      [623.31] Scratching it and patching at with a prompt from a primer. And what   scrips of nutsnolleges I pecked up me meself. Every letter is a hard   but yours sure is the hardest crux ever. Hack an axe, hook an oxe,   hath an an, heth hith ences. But once done, dealt and delivered,   tattat, you’re on the map.   As an example of how this reading makes things clearer, consider the mystery of the four wise men ""mamalujo"". Who are they? Look in any text on Finnegans Wake and you will find the answer disappointing. With this reading, however, they are certainly Finnegans childhood friends, still very much alive tonight.(1)  Summary of Question   Surely, HCE and Finnegan are distinct characters in Heliopolis, but Finnegan is dead by the time the novel begins?   Like HCE, Finnegan too has a referent in Heliopolis (not only in dreamland). Finnegan is not HCE. Finnegan was Anna first husband, but is dead before the novel begins. He died without completing his ""master work"". Finnegan and Anna are the biological parents of the twins. HCE is Anna's husband/partner by the time the novel begins. HCE and Anna are the biological parents of Issy.  Further, in Anna's monologue, surely the monologue is primarily addressed to Finnegan, not HCE?   Expected Answers  In am expecting answers of the forms, ""No Finnegan is unlikely to be Anna's first husband because..."", or, ""No, in the monologue, Anna is more likely to be addressing her (current and only) husband HCE, because ..."", etc. Explanation, however, would need to be given to the ""pigs and scuts"" answer, as well as to the ""you"" and ""he"" in Anna's monologue. I am also interested in any references to analyses of Anna's monologue.     P.S. Y'all know about this beautiful but abridged reading  and   these complete readings (some beautiful, some terrible, but between the lot of them, good readings of all chapters), right? Finnegans Wake,  is best appreciated in spoken word.  Most precious of all is this, which despite its title, is a reading of Part IV (with Anna's monologue) riverrunning into a reading of I.1. Enough to make you cry. The text of course is online in many forms. This is a call to arms.    (1) It has become clear to me that the four wise men, Mamalujo, are Anna's childhood friends. In fact the very first Mark-Iseuld-Tristam triangle is Mark=Mark-of-the-Mamalujo, Iseuld=Anna, and Tristam=Finnegan! Way back when they were teenagers/young-adults. "

52,How much of Fantastica remains the same between iterations?,"Each time a human comes to Fantastica, the whole world is essentially 'rebooted'. We see this in chapter 13, where Bastian and the Childlike Empress start off in total empty nothingness, before he begins to make wishes and the world begins to be (re)created around them.  On the other hand, some features of the world remain unchanged. Not only the Childlike Empress herself; also, for example, Atreyu and Falkor, or the country of the Sassafranians (mentioned in both halves of The Neverending Story, before and after Bastian's arrival).  This raises the question: was there really total nothingness before Bastian started to make wishes? Did Atreyu, Falkor, the Sassafranian country, and so on exist only because he wished for them? (If so, Atreyu has a remarkable amount of free agency for someone recreated only through Bastian's will.) Could anything he remembers from the previous Fantastica be recreated? (But that would include many things that had been swallowed by the Nothing.) In short:  How much of Fantastica survives between iterations - what and why?  Informed and supported speculation, based on the text or other good evidence, is acceptable. "
53,"Did Isaac Bashevis Singer write only in Yiddish, or also in English?","While researching another question, a couple of us have found what appears to be a contradiction in the Wikipedia page for Isaac Bashevis Singer. The introductory section of the article says:     He was a leading figure in the Yiddish literary movement, writing and publishing only in Yiddish.   But section 2.3 on language says:     He edited his novels and stories for their publication in English in the United States; these versions were used as the basis for translation into other languages. He referred to his English version as his ""second original."" This has led to an ongoing controversy whether the ""real Singer"" can be found in the Yiddish original, with its finely tuned language and sometimes rambling construction, or in the more tightly edited American versions, where the language is usually simpler and more direct.   None of these claims on Wikipedia is cited to anything else, and the language section in particular is full of [citation needed] notes. So what is the truth of the matter? Did Singer write his stories only in Yiddish, and merely permit others to translate them into English? Or did he write the English versions himself as well? Please include support for your answers. "

55,"How is black being portrayed in ""Black, Their Regalia"" by Darcie Little Badger?","Black features fairly prominently in ""Black, Their Regalia"" by Darcie Little Badger - it's in the title, and black is fairly prominent throughout the story. The Apparently Siblings play neoclassical alt-metal fusion and look goth, wearing black a lot. For their saving-the-world dance, they wear black. When they meet the Plague Eater, it's described as ""...ground crumbled, and darkness enveloped their world, a darkness so absolute, even phosphenes vanished.""  In addition, in the copy I have the story is printed with a black background, and the whole thing feels rather ""dark"" in color.    How is black being portrayed, though? As a positive thing? Negative thing? Just powerful? "
56,"Who is Soleil Moore, The Bone Clocks character?","In The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell a character is introduced in the section 'Crispin Hershey’s Lonely Planet'.  The character named 'Soleil Moore' pops up three times:   The Hay-on-Wye book fair where she gives Crispin her first collection of poetry A literary event in Shanghai where she gives Crispin another volume of poetry Bard College, USA where:       Crispin is then visited by Soleil Moore, whom he does not remember and who is horrified that he has not read the works she gave him. She tells him he is part of ""the Script"" and that humans are being used and abused by higher beings and she hoped that Crispin would help her publish her works so that they would become widespread knowledge. She then goes to Plan B and shoots Crispin, knowing that the murder will make her and her work infamous.    Nothing more is mentioned about Soleil in the book and it's never revealed whether her poetry actually does reveal what is going on.

Its Italian title, Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio, literally means ""Discourses on the first decade/ten books of Titus Livius"", i.e. the first ten books of Livy's history work Ab Urbe Condita Libri.  Does this mean that one should read at least these first ten books of Livy's history of Rome? Or, if it is not absolutely necessary, what would be the specific benefits of doing this? After glancing over the introduction to an English translation of the Discourses I was none the wiser. "
65,What did Lewis Carroll mean by 'a grin without a cat'?,"Source: Five Ideas to Fight For (2016) by Anthony Lester QC. p. 88 Top.     Coalition politics      Though it is a model law, the Act was attacked when the coalition came to power. Senior Conservative ministers sought to thwart it for ideological reasons. One of Prime Minister Cameron’s close advisers apparently wanted to abolish it completely. Liberal Democrat ministers blocked that foolish proposal.     The government issued a ‘Red Tape Challenge’ to scrap unnecessary regulation burdening business. The EHRC was an obvious target of the austerity cuts. The equality side of its work became a grin without a cat.44 It had a large budget that was hard to justify because of the EHRC’s lacklustre performance and weak financial control. The budget was radically cut and its helpline was taken away, even though it had proved a vital link with potential victims.      44 ‘ “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life.” ’ Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Chapter 6.

66,What is a ‘tongue-leaved eye-figured Eden tree’?,"In book III of Robert Browning’s The Ring and the Book, Violante adopts an unwanted new-born child and passes her off to her husband Pietro as their daughter Pompilia:     Well, having gained Pompilia, the girl grew   I’ the midst of Pietro here, Violante there,   Each, like a semicircle with stretched arms,   Joining the other round her preciousness—   Two walls that go about a garden-plot   Where a chance sliver, branchlet slipt from bole   Of some tongue-leaved eye-figured Eden tree,   Filched by two exiles and borne far away.    What is the meaning of the line in bold? ‘Eden tree’ would seem to be one of the trees in the Garden of Eden, either the tree of life, or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. ‘Tongue-leaved’ might mean ‘with leaves like tongues’ or ‘with leaves that speak’, but I can’t make any sense of ‘eye-figured’.  Cook says of this line:     The reference in this passage must be to a legend or allegory which I cannot trace. A friend suggests that the use of the epithets ‘tongue-leaved’ and ‘eye-figured’ was ‘due to some allegorical woodcut of the early sixteenth century, representing the tree of the knowledge of good and evil’.

In particular, is there any connection with the nursery rhyme ""London Bridge is Falling Down"" which is often also called ""My Fair Lady""? "
68,Confused about the meter and rhythm of Ulysses by Tennyson,"Ulysses is written in iambic pentameter. There are a few spondees and trochees thrown in for good measure, but I'm confused in some places, like here:     I cannot rest from travel: I will drink   Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd   Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those   That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when   Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades   Vext the dim sea: I am become a name     In the second line, there's a trochee (Life to), but then it continues on normally. Ok. Fine. The line after that does the exact same thing (Greatly). What goes on in the fourth and sixth (last) lines, though?     That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when   The first pair (that loved) is an iambic foot, the second (me, and) is what? A trochee? The third (alone) is, finally, an iamb. The rest are iambs.  What goes on in Tennyson's head when he creates such a weird structure? How does he decide to break the rules, and where? Also, is it correct to think in pairs when breaking down a poem like this?  Similarly, the last line is also funky:     Vext the dim sea: I am become a name   Vext the: trochee.  Dim sea: spondee?  There's also a line at the end of the poem that has 11 syllables, but I guess he just thought ""shit, this sounds so good I just have to leave it in"" because it's the best line in the entire thing. But I'm guessing that's not the usual thought process going on? "
69,What is the history of the universe/canon/word-of-god approach to literature?,"Over on the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Stack Exchange, some participants apply the following theoretical approach to the interpretation of fiction:   The role of fiction is to describe a fictional ‘universe’, and an important task of readers is to determine facts about that universe by analysis of the sources. Sources can be divided into ‘canon’ (works accurately describing the universe) and apocrypha (works that purport to describe the universe but which can be rejected as false, for example, fan fiction). Canon determination is based on a hierarchy of closeness to the ‘main’ source or sources, or to the author, whose pronouncements are described as ‘Word of God’.   Does this approach to literature have a name? Has it been studied? What is its history? Is it purely a ‘folk theory’ or does it have an academic counterpart? Terry Eagleton’s Literary Theory purports to give a “reasonably comprehensive account of modern literary theory” but does not mention it.  The earliest work I know that takes a similar approach is ‘Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes’ (1911) by Ronald Knox, but Knox and the other early participants in the ‘Sherlockian game’ were clear that it was to be played with tongue in cheek:     The rule of the game is that it must be played as solemnly as a county cricket match at Lord’s: the slightest touch of extravagance or burlesque ruins the atmosphere.

70,"Doubts concerning Chapter 15 of ""Persuasion"" by Jane Austen","I am having trouble understanding a passage in Chapter 15 of Jane Austen's Persuasion. This chapter describes Mr. Elliot's renewal of acquaintance with his family, from whom he was previously somewhat estranged, while they are all staying in Bath.  The particular phrases and sentences in this passage that I am having trouble with are as follows.      but he had now been a fortnight in Bath   Does this mean that Mr. Elliot was presently staying at Bath? Why this confusion arose is because, at the end of the chapter, Mr. Elliot is being shown as visiting Camden Place. So, how could be Mr. Elliot be staying at Camden Place and visiting it at the same time?    Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.   Colonel Wallis had been well acquainted with Mr. Elliot's wife. So, this means that Mr. Elliot had a wife and seemed to live perfectly happliy with her. Yet it has been shown that Mr. Elliot fancied Elizabeth to a certain extent. Why is that so?    Allowances, large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke. She heard it all under embellishment.   What does it mean for Anne to hear it all ""under embellishment""?    Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice, or too observant, if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot’s frequent visits were talked of.   I can't follow this at all: why did Anne ""wish that he might not be too nice""? What was ""the idea"" that Mrs Clay was encouraging?    Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without being much attended to.   What is the meaning of this sentence?    He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connexion, were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day! He was astonished, indeed! But his character and general conduct must refute it. He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.   Here Mr. Elliot has been shown as someone possessing somewhat negative qualities. For, he apparently tried to project himself as someone who never boasted of being an Elliot nor did he appear to conform with the feudal standards of the society back then. Yet he would mention of his connection with Sir Walter Elliot to anyone who he would meet and attempted to reconcile with the Elliot Family as he was the heir to the Elliot estate.  Then why would Lady Russell bear positive notions about Mr. Elliot?   If possible, please answer without spoiling anything in the novel after chapter 15. "
71,Why are television shows in Fahrenheit 451 interactive?,"In Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, television shows are broadcast with parts missing so that viewers can act the scenes out:     She didn't look up from her script again. “Well, this is a play comes on the wall-to-wall circuit in ten minutes. They mailed me my part this morning. I sent in some box-tops. They write the script with one part missing. It's a new idea. The home-maker, that's me, is the missing part. When it comes time for the missing lines, they all look at me out of the three walls and I say the lines: Here, for instance, the man says, 'What do you think of this whole idea, Helen?' And he looks at me sitting here centre stage, see? And I say, I say —” She paused and ran her finger under a line in the script. “ 'I think that's fine!' And then they go on with the play until he says, 'Do you agree to that, Helen!' and I say, 'I sure do!' Isn't that fun, Guy?”    What is the meaning of this interactive television show within the novel? What does it show about the society portrayed there? "
72,Why did Rachel Carson begin “Silent Spring” with an allegory?,"Rachel Carson begins her book Silent Spring with an allegory, explaining how a small American town with beautiful nature, one day is destroyed and all the birds stop singing.     There was a strange stillness. The birds, for example—where had they gone? Many people spoke of them, puzzled and disturbed. The feeding stations in the backyards were deserted. The few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly. It was a spring without voices. On the mornings that had once throbbed with the dawn chorus of robins, catbirds, doves, jays, wrens, and scores of other bird voices there was now no sound; only silence lay over the fields and woods and marsh.   Obviously she tries to convey the message how pesticides harm nature and she uses an allegory to make non-scientist readers understand what she means. But is there another reason for such use of allegory, and if yes, then what is it? "
73,"Can the success of ""The Day of Doom"" be attributed to above average literacy in colonial America?","""The Day of Doom"" has been described as America's first bestseller, but can that be attributed to the above-average literacy rate among Puritans and in America overall? Would this poem have been less successful in Seventeenth-Century England, as the literacy rate there was very low?  I do concede that I don't know for a fact if there was an above-average literacy rate in America at the time of the poems release, so clarification on this would also be appreciated.  Edit: Could ""The Day of Doom"" been as successful if it were published at the same time, but in the UK, as at that time the literacy rate in Great Britain was poor among the common folk.  "
74,"In ""Orphans of the Sky"", what does the society's treatment of women indicate about the society?","In Heinlein's Orphans of the Sky, the people on the Ship treat women as if they're not people. There are references to ""naming"" their women like dogs, they make deals with father and husband, and are, I believe , referred to as ""wenches"" at several points. There are no women in high positions. There's also this quote:     He washed himself, and went thence to the compartments of his uncle, for whom he worked for his meals. His aunt glanced up as he came in, but said nothing, as became a woman.   These seem to reflect negatively on the society. However, the story was originally published in 1941. Women's rights in the 1940s weren't the way they were today.  So, two closely related questions:   Was this intended to reflect badly on the society, or was it simply in line with the thoughts of his time? Regardless of what the author thought, how does this change our perception of the society in the Ship?  "
75,"In Persuasion, why does Anne feel ""ashamed"" before being able to ""safely suggest"" Louisa?","This is from chapter 18 of Persuasion by Jane Austen.  This is when Admiral Croft tries to mention Anne about the possible alliance of Louisa Musgrove and Captain Benwick.     Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really   did; but now she could safely suggest the name of ‘Louisa’.   Does this mean that Anne was ashamed to comprehend the name of Louisa too soon for it (might have) seemed unladylike? If such is the case, then how a few moments later could she 'safely suggest the name of Louisa'? "
76,"What does Browning's cloistered soliloquist mean by ‘Hy, Zy, Hine’?","Here’s the last stanza of Robert Browning’s ‘Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister’, first published in Dramatic Lyrics (1842):     Or, there’s Satan!—one might venture       Pledge one’s soul to him, yet leave   Such a flaw in the indenture       As he’d miss till, past retrieve,   Blasted lay that rose-acacia       We’re so proud of! Hy, Zy, Hine.   ’St, there’s Vespers! Plena gratiâ       Ave, Virgo! Gr-r-r—you swine!   What is the meaning of the mysterious phrase ‘Hy, Zy, Hine’ in the sixth line? Is it onomatopoeia for the ringing of the bells for vespers? (But if so, in what language do bells go ‘hy zy’?) Is it the  interrupted beginning of a pledge to Satan? (But if so, did Browning have a particular source for the incantation?) Or is it something else entirely? "
77,"Why does Laxness mention ""second sight"" in ""Independent People""?","From Independent People by Halldór Laxness (translated from Icelandic by J. A. Thompson):     Others believe that she lives much in the lake in the form of some kind of serpent or water-monster; and indeed it is on all men’s lips that a monster has now for many generations inhabited the lake and appeared to countless witnesses, who have testified to it upon oath, even those without second sight.   What does the highlighted phrase mean in this context? It seems to imply that witnesses were divided into those with second sight and those without. Was this ever common practice in Iceland? To what extent is Laxness alluding to historical or legendary events here?  Text added from author's comments which seem important in understanding the question:  'there is no mention of people having up-normal powers within the people ""in the context"" so it's not logic to assume that people without ""specific powers"" are testifying.'  '...the only witch in here is the women who turned to be the lake monster after death...other people are normal that is why they killed her'  "
78,Is there any significance in King Lune's name?,"The king of Archenland during the time of The Horse and His Boy, father of the Archenland princes who play a more major role in the story, is called Lune. Is there any significance to this name? Perhaps either a connection with the moon or possibly with insanity? (For what it's worth, Lewis has a history of making symbolic connections to heavenly bodies in his novels, including Narnia.) "
79,Why is Hemingway's generation a ‘lost generation’?,"I recently began reading Hemingway’s memoir, A Moveable Feast. In it, Hemingway and his contemporary Americans are described as a ‘lost generation’:     It was when we had come back from Canada and were living in the rue Notre-Dame-des-Chanps and Miss Stein and I were still good friends that Miss Stein made the remark about the lost generation. She had some ignition trouble with the old Model T Ford she then drove and the young man who worked in the garage and had served in the war had not been adept, or perhaps had not been serieux and had been corrected severely by the patron of the garage after Miss Stein’s protest. The patron had said to him, ‘You are all a generation perdue.’      ’That’s what you are. That’s what you all are,’ Miss Stein said, ‘All of you young people who served in the war. You are all a lost generation.’      ’Really?’ I said.      ’You are,’ she insisted. ‘You have no respect for anything. You drink yourself to death ...’      ’Was the young mechanic drunk?’ I asked.      ’Of course not.’      ’Have you ever seen me drunk?’      ’No. But your friends are drunk.’      ’I’ve been drunk,’ I said, ‘but I don’t come here drunk.’      ’Of course not. I didn’t say that.’      ’The boys patron was probably drunk at eleven o’clock in the morning,’ I said. ‘That’s why he makes such lovely phrases.’      ’Don’t argue with me, Hemingway,’ Miss Stein said. ‘It does you no good at all. You’re all a lost generation, exactly as the garage-keeper said.’    What does this mean? How does one lose oneself, or even a whole generation? What is it that they have lost? And where did they lose it? In other words, what did Gertrude Stein mean by saying this and what did Hemingway mean by including this exchange and what does it mean in the later context of American history? More broadly, are there any other references to this in Hemingway’s work?   edit  I was surprised to learn that the Lost Generation is a literary term that refers to a number of writers from the post war era, including Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis. It doesn’t really answer my question in the depth that I would like but it does say that Hemingway used the term in the epigraph to his novel, The Sun Also Rises.  "

My guess is that it's simply a description of a ""single unit"" of a dew. But is it? Another guess is that it's some play on the (valid) word ""dewfall"". But if that so, what's that ""ball""? What does it mean to peer from a dewball? I'd understand alternatives such as ""through"", or something close, but can't figure out the imagery meaning of from here.   I may be peering reading too much into this single line, but I'm not a native speaker and hence I afraid I'm missing something simple. What do you think? "
82,Did Shakespeare write his own stage directions?,"It's well known that Shakespeare had no part in publishing the text of his own plays - indeed, many of them were only published posthumously. I've read that a significant proportion of his plays came to press by way of actors in his company, hoping to earn a little extra money, stealing copies of his scripts and smuggling them out to publishers.  I've also read that the only parts of the scripts published today which were actually written by Shakespeare are the lines - not the stage directions, nor the setting descriptions. Unfortunately, I don't have a reliable source for this claim. Is it true?  Do any of the stage directions in modern publications of Shakespeare plays originate from the man himself? "

Despite each being able to function as a stand-alone story, these three tales are clearly set in the same 'universe', linked by featuring the same characters.  Are these the only Poe stories which are thus 'linked'?  Are there any more of his stories which connect to each other - perhaps by including some of the same characters, or the same fictional locations, or by one of them referring to the events of another - in such a way as to make clear that they're intended to be set in the same world? If so, what is the full list of such linked stories? "

86,What message is Bradbury trying to convey in Fahrenheit 451?,Fahrenheit 451 is one of Ray Bradbury's most famous works and possibly one of the most famous books in modern times.   In my experience most people who read the book believe that Bradbury was warning of the dangers of state-sponsored censorship (i.e. the book burning).  Did Bradbury intend for this to be a moral/message of the story?  Has he commented on the matter at all? 
87,What mechanism does David Weber use to ensure internal consistency of works in the shared Honorverse?,"In certain franchises/shared universes, there are well known mechanisms for ensuring internal consistency (E.g. Star Wars has LucasFilm's Holocron/LSG).  David Weber's Honorverse is a shared universe of books/stories, where other writers participate as well as Weber himself.  Is there a mechanism that Weber uses for ensuring the universe's internal consistency? (Database? forum? specific set of people? his own memory?) "
88,Why was The Call of the Wild banned?,"I periodically see Jack London's The Call of the Wild on banned book lists, but I'm not sure why it would be – it doesn't seem that controversial.  I found ALA's page cataloguing the reasons given for banning many classics, but all that appears for The Call of the Wild is:     Banned in Italy (1929), Yugoslavia (1929), and burned in Nazi bonfires (1933).   Why was the book banned/burned in these countries?  Assuming it was on the basis of the text itself, and not merely the author, which particular passages of the book were seen as especially problematic? "
89,"In Foucault's Pendulum, by what method does the translation choose to keep or translate Italian?","Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco was originally written in Italian. Most of the book was translated to English, except for the parts that weren't in Italian to begin with.   I understand that decision; however, at other places in the book, specific phrases, sentences, and words are left in their original Italian. Is there diegetic significance to those phrases? If not, by what method was the book translated that led to certain untranslated words &amp; phrases? "
90,"What order should I read the ""Ender's game"" series in?","Ender's Game is a very large epic science-fiction series by Orson Scott Card. To quote wikipedia:     It currently consists of fifteen novels, thirteen short stories, 47 comic issues, an audioplay, and a film.   With so many books, it's overwhelming to know where to start. Especially since the books are not all in chronological order, and are still being written today. The books that are currently out (in release order) are:        Ender's Game   Speaker for the Dead   Xenocide   Children of the Mind   Ender's Shadow   Shadow of the Hegemon   Shadow Puppets   Shadow of the Giant   A War of Gifts: An Ender Story   Ender in Exile   Shadows in Flight   Earth Unaware   Earth Afire   Earth Awakens   The Swarm      and The Hive, The Queens, Shadows Alive, and Fleet School are planned to be released in the future.  What is the chronological order of this series? And more importantly, what order should I read them in? "
91,"Is this hypothesis about the significance of the name ""Denna"" in the Kingkiller Chronicle supported by the text?","There's a somewhat popular theory about The Kingkiller Chronicle, which is that the name ""Denna"" derives from the use of denner resin, and its addictive properties.   The theory branches two directions: the first speculates that the name is supposed to be symbolic, rather than textual. Denna is an addictive person for Kvothe to be around, and causes long-term detrimental effects to his mental health and well-being.   The second theory states that Kvothe is an unreliable narrator, and since it's well-established already that Kvothe has an unfortunate tendency to embellish his stories, it's plausible that Kvothe simply has a denner resin addiction. Consequently, he'd be personifying that addiction in Denna. Curiously, this seems to have some more support: from Kvothe's extended poverty despite wealth, to the fact that seemingly every time he loses wealth, Denna leaves him (though this is never portrayed in a cause-effect way).  Are there textual reasons to believe either of these theories are true? (Or, alternately, are there good reasons to disbelieve them?) "
92,Has The Danish Girl novel been banned in any countries?,"There is a film The Danish Girl based on the fictional novel of the same name by David Ebershoff.  The film has been banned in some countries on grounds of moral depravity.  Has the novel been banned in some countries as well? If not, was the novel less controversial? "
93,How many The Outer Limits comics were published in the 60s?,In the 1960s there were The Outer Limits comics published every few months.  How many comics were published in total and across which period? Was it between 1964-1969? 
94,Why did Irina choose to die in the fire and not jump?,"In The 39 Clues, The Clue Hunt: In Too Deep, Irina Spasky dies in a fire set by Isabel Kabra rescuing Alistair Oh and Amy and Dan Cahill. (Chapter 25, pages 196-198)  But why didn't she just jump from the roof? She was on the roof, having vaulted up there to save the others. She would have had a much better chance of living if she had jumped.  Why did she decide not to jump, and instead stay on the roof as it collapsed? "
95,Did the Lord of the Flies have any kind of religious reference more specific than just the Devil?,"Lord of the Flies contains an absurd amount of biblical references, one of which being the titular character.

Someone two days ago told me this is a reference to a different piece of literature. I didn't know how to spell the name of the reference so didn't write it down, and have forgotten what the reference was. I have no idea which piece of literature it is referencing, and wish to find out. This specifically refers to:     They pluck out mine eyes.   What does this reference? "
101,Would a reader of Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea miss anything essential without knowing about Jane Eyre?,"I read Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea without ever having heard of Jane Eyre. I didn't see even it was a prequel to another work, because I try to avoid spoilers on the back of the book.  What, if anything, would I have missed while reading Wide Sargasso Sea? For example, were there references to characters who are also in Jane Eyre? Or direct allusions to events that would happen later?  In my reading, I felt the book lacked depth, and I wonder if it's because there was a whole other thread to the plot that I was completely missing. "
102,Did Piggy participate in the killing of Simon?,"This spawns off an argument that my friend and I had. I had always assumed that he had, however my friend disagreed. The main point I cited, Piggy's attempt to console Ralph while also trying to absolve himself of guilt, was interpreted by her as him just being a nice friend. Is there any piece of evidence besides the conversation mentioned? Quotes from Golding or quotes from the book are ideal over speculation.  Did Piggy participate in the killing of Simon? "
103,"Was ""Earthly Powers"" actually based on Burgess' private, and secret life?","The gay-oriented book Earthly Powers (1980)       was narrated by an 81-year-old successful, homosexual writer, Kenneth Toomey, a figure loosely based on W. Somerset Maugham.   However, it seems that many of the scenes were of a more personal nature. At least one source has claimed he was a closet homosexual.  Of himself, in the Guardian, Burgess wrote:     I published a novel about contemporary Russia at the time of my disgrace, and this was reviewed at some length in the New Statesman – I will not say by whom – and considered as a literary demonstration of my homosexuality...   I never had to prove homosexuality, which would have been difficult for one who is boringly normal. I offer this anecdote to prove nothing.   Within the novel, the narrator of the story, Kenneth Toomey,  penned a self-described “bad” first novel, Once Departed, in which he claimed     I told no one that I could bring myself to compose the more intimate scenes only by imagining them as homosexual.   In a twist on “Art imitating Life”, or maybe “Life imitating Art”, did Burgess write Earthly Powers out of his personal experiences or his private desires for an alternative life-style? Or was he imagining his homo-erotic encounters in the book by doing a reverse of   Toomey's technique from “Once Departed”?  Is there any real evidence to support the theory that the book was based on the life of Willie Maugham, and not on Burgess' own life? "
104,From where did David Foster Wallace draw inspiration for writing style and technique?,"D.F.W. has a peculiar writing style. For example, in his essay, Authority and American Usage, he makes use of a colloquial form of writing which is often repeated in his other essays. An example of this concerns his use of footnotes - the essay has 81 of them, and sometimes even footnotes have footnotes. This makes the essay something of a wild ride to read.   An example more localized to Authority and American Usage is the colloquial use of titles. Though they draw an ironic point, it's very typical to see this in DFW's writing elsewhere:     THESIS STATEMENT FOR THE WHOLE ARTICLE        COROLLARY TO THESIS STATEMENT FOR THE WHOLE ARTICLE       INTERPOLATION POTENTIALLY DESCRIPTIVIST-LOOKING EXAMPLE OF SOME GRAMMATICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NON-STANDARD DIALECT THAT THIS REVIEWER ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT FIRSTHAND      ANOTHER KIND OF USAGE-WARS RELATED EXAMPLE, THIS ONE WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON DIALECT AS A VECTOR OF SELF-PRESENTATION VIA POLITENESS   ...and so on and so forth. (This essay is a treasure to read.)   He's even, in some other places, gone so far as to embed footnotes inside of boxes inside pages, and putting more footnotes inside those boxes, up to three or four layers deep, such as in the essay, Host.   Did DFW ever write about where he drew inspiration for his style? Was this sort of colloquial-academic prose unique to the way he writes? "
105,"In The Bet, why does the lawyer willingly stay fifteen years instead of five years for no extra reward?","In The Bet by Anton Chekhov, the lawyer voluntarily accepts to stay in prison for 15 years, instead of the original agreed upon 5 years. Here's the relevant passage:     ""The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if   I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I   would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not   at all.""      A lively discussion arose. The banker, who was younger and more nervous in those days, was suddenly carried away by excitement; he   struck the table with his fist and shouted at the young man:      ""It's not true! I'll bet you two million you wouldn't stay in solitary confinement for five years.""      ""If you mean that in earnest,"" said the young man, ""I'll take the bet, but I would stay not five but fifteen years.""      ""Fifteen? Done!"" cried the banker. ""Gentlemen, I stake two million!""      ""Agreed! You stake your millions and I stake my freedom!"" said the young man.   (emphasis mine)  Why does the lawyer do this? He's not gaining any monetary reward, so I really can't see his motivation for opting to stay in prison an extra 10 years. "
106,"A story starring agreeable, fuzzy blob/animal creatures","This was a childrens novel with infrequent illustrations from maybe 10+ years ago. I think it was set in Australia or maybe South Australia? I'm going to start by describing the aforementioned creatures, as they're probably the most distinct and recognisable part.   They're sorta like slightly taller Furbys, more egg-shaped, with distinct arms. They're especially squishy and stretchy. They always, always agree to things. Saying ""Oh, no doubt, no doubt"" and other things. It's implied to be more just a derpyness/innocence to them. I want to say that their names began with a ""Woo"" or maybe ended in ""ble""?   These things were targeted by another made up race, and I want to call them the Gretchins or something. The latter species tries to enslave them, eat them, etc. but all of their plans fail.   At the climax of the book,      The blobs all fuse into one giant version of themselves.   That's all I really remember, other than the book in general being REALLY weird. "
107,"What does “Until a man is nothing, God can make nothing out of him” mean?","I came across the following passage in Dan Brown’s fiction, “Inferno”:     [...] their physical being and cosmic importance shrinking to the size of   a mere speck in the face of God … an atom in the hands of the Creator.      Until a man is nothing, God can make nothing out of him. Martin Luther   had spoken those words in the sixteenth century, but the concept had   been part of the mind-set of builders since the earliest examples of   religious architecture.    p. 52    I’m not clear with the meaning of “Until a man is nothing, God can make nothing out of him.”   Does it mean until a man recognizes himself as a being no more than nothing, God cannot help him?   Would you put this line in plain English so that I can understand the gist of the quote? "
108,Did the Strikers assume that the Strike would change other countries as well?,"Virtually all of the Strikers were American - it included, for example, Judge Narragansett (Illinois), Midas Mulligan (Chicago, IL), John Galt (Ohio), Ted Nielsen (Colorado), Roger Marsh (Colorado), Hank Reardon (Minnesota and Pennsylvania), Dagny Taggart (New York), among others. The two recorded exceptions were Ragnar Danneskjöld (born in Norway, and possibly living at least part of the time in Norway while he was a Pirate) and Francisco D'Anconia (who was born in Argentina and was the only person definitely recorded to have lived outside of the U.S. much of the time).  It is mentioned in passing that most of the People's States were barely getting by on handouts from the U.S., so presumably if the U.S. was no longer able to export anything, their governments would collapse along with the U.S.'s.  Was John Galt's speech ever broadcasted in those countries? What was the plan for them? "
109,How would the Strikers re-emerge if there were so few competent people left in the world?,"The text doesn't directly answer this, so this more of a question about the ""world"" of Atlas Shrugged than about the text itself, but I'm curious as to how the Strikers would go about rebuilding the world after the Strike.  The text is very clear that part of Ragnar Danneskjöld's purpose in capturing gold for the Strikers is to ensure that the world would have sufficient capital to rebuild, which he wanted to happen. I'm curious about other details, too, though.  The Strike would presumably put an end to looting and its philosophy (implying that people who survived the Collapse would be expected to change; there's no discussion about what would happen to the people what wouldn't change). However, how would it put an end to incompetence?  The Valley didn't have enough of a population to supply all of the necessary jobs to sustain the U.S. Economy after they re-emerged. Even if we include the people who disappeared to places other than the Valley after Galt's speech, it doesn't seem like there'd be enough people to fully restore the U.S. economy in the near future.  Given the widespread incompetence that existed prior to the end of the Strike, how would the Strikers be able to fill jobs with competent people once they re-emerged? Is the assumption that people would be willing to learn actual skills and become competent once they stopped being Looters? "
110,Was Jim Taggart's physical abuse of his wife supposed to parallel and contrast with Hank Reardon's gift of the Ruby Pendant to Dagny Taggart?,"   [Dagny Taggart] thought of the evening last winter, when [Hank Reardon] came in, took a small package from his pocket and held it out to her, saying, ""I want you to have it."" She opened it and stared in incredulous bewilderment of a pendant made of a single pear-shaped ruby that spurted a violent fire on the white satin of the jeweler's box... [the stone looked] like a sparkling drop of blood.   On the other hand, when Cheryl Taggart finally realized how evil her husband Jim was, she visited Dagny to discuss the matter. They emphasized their connection to each other and discussed philosophy, with Dagny calling her her ""sister... by choice"" (not through Jim, as emphasized by Cheryl).  Upon returning home, she discovered the fact that Jim had just had an affair with Hank Reardon's wife. She confronted him on that as well as his ""overall"" evil, demanding to know why he had married her in the first place. At the end of their confrontation, she concluded that     ""You... you're a killer... for the sake of killing...""   It was too close to the unnamed; shaking with terror, [Jim] swung out blindly and struck her in the face.      She fell against the side of an armchair, her head striking the floor, but she raised her head in a moment and looked up at him blankly, without astonishment, as if physical reality were merely taking the form she had expected. A single pear-shaped drop of blood went slithering slowly from the corner of her mouth.   In the second scene, Jim's evil is on full display, ultimately expressing itself in physical abuse of his wife. This is an expression of the basic violence and destructiveness of his philosophy as well as of his personal evil.  In the former scene, Hank Reardon gives Dagny a gift simply for the pleasure of seeing her wear the pendant. It's a reflection of his love of life and the depth of their feelings of each other. It is reflected shortly thereafter in a physical expression of that (in contrast with the second scene, where this is the result of a physical expression of Jim's evil and his feelings of contempt for his wife).  Was this deliberate on the author's part? Did she intend these scenes to be parallel, or was this purely coincidental? "
111,Pulchritudinous callipygosity,"In the short story ""Inertia"" by Rudy Rucker (which I found via this ID question on another site, and which is published to be read in full at the author's website here), the near-Googlewhack phrase ""pulchritudinous callipygosity"" appears in a piece of dialogue near the start:     “Campbell’s dead, more’s the pity.” Harry sucked a last drop out of the beaker and smacked his lips. “I’m commencin’ to feel pret-ty damn good.”      “You learn to talk that way at the prep-school?”      “The Collegiate Academy. Oh, my, yes. Those sweet girls. Bless their hearts. The cardioid curve, dear Fletcher, is, of course, a traditional symbol for pulchritudinous callipygosity, and when I speak of blessing, I think, selbstverständlich, of the censer and thurible, the spray of holy anointment, and the fullness of emotion appropriate to such …”      Maundering on in such fashion, Harry drifted over to my equipment and began hefting this object and now that.   What is Harry on about, and why is he talking like this?  Googling the phrase ""pulchritudinous callipygosity"" gives me only three results, none of which explains its meaning, while ""censer and thurible"" are apparently some incense vessels used in religious ceremonies. It might be some sort of euphemism, but I'm not getting it.  Also, beyond the question of meaning, why is Harry giving vent to his loquacity by extraneous bombastic circumlocution? He doesn't seem to talk like this all the time - he does use some long words when talking about advanced physics, but it's kind of necessary in that context. Even in the rest of their conversation while drunk, he talks normally most of the time, except in this one paragraph. "
112,"Under Ayn Rand's philosophy, would the Strikers have the right to use and/or re-open abandoned factories and equipment?","When the Strikers re-emerged, there would've been numerous abandoned factories and equipment (including, presumably, factories and equipment that had been abandoned by the Strikers themselves). While the original owners may have been around in some cases, in many other cases there wouldn't be any clear ownership of these factories (e.g. if the owners were dead). If some of them were in at least somewhat salvageable condition, would the Strikers be able to rightfully use them?  While the book doesn't directly answer this, how would someone gain the rights to the property in the first place?  Economist and political philosopher Murray Rothbard (who was not associated with Ayn Rand), for example, argued that property rights (e.g. to the rights to land ownership in a previously-undiscovered area) ""originally"" derived from being able to make productive use of it.  Does Ayn Rand have some kind of view of how property rights could ""originate"" in the first place? Is it similar to Rothbard's or different?  The most direct hint to this in the book is when Dagny and Hank visited the 20th Century Motor Factory, seeing if anything was salvageable from it. (They discover the prototype of John Galt's motor along with a partial manual related to it, which they promptly take with them; Dagny promptly goes through considerable trouble to try to find the original inventor and, when she failed to find John Galt, hired Quintin Daniels to try to reverse engineer it).  You could argue that this was meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive (i.e. the fact that the book records that Dagny and Hank did that doesn't necessarily mean that Ayn Rand thought that they were doing the right thing), but is this an implicit endorsement of a view that's analogous to Murray Rothbard's? Was the fact that they were able to at least try to put it to productive use and the fact that there was no longer any clear ownership in the company a basis for them to claim at least some kind of a property right over it? "
113,Did John Galt remove part of the manual for his engine from the 20th Century Motor Company?,"When Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart searched the abandoned 20th Century Motor Company, they found the prototype of John Galt's motor along with some documents describing it. However, the documents related to it were incomplete, missing what Robert Standler and some other characters described as the most important parts (e.g. John Galt's definition of energy and some other basic facts).  John Galt later told Dagny that he left the prototype there because it was their rightful property, given that they had paid him to develop it. He also wasn't too concerned that they'd actually use it.  What about the manual? It seems odd that a lot of the manual was there, but it was only missing the most important parts. For example, if someone used the missing pages as fuel for a fire or something like that (like a lot of the other paper in the plant was), wouldn't they have just burned the whole thing? Why bother using only a few pages? Did John Galt (or William Hastings, John Galt's boss who later joined the Strike) remove the most important pieces? If so, why didn't they regard the manual as the new owners' property, too? If they didn't remove it, why did John Galt and William Hastings risk someone reading the documents and learning the secret of the motor? "
114,Why wasn't Ellis Wyatt researching new applications of oil (or at least diversifying his product line)?,"When Dagny crashes in Galt's Gulch, we learn that Ellis Wyatt has been experimenting with new ways of producing oil.  However, there's no textual evidence that he was researching new applications of oil (unlike Hank Rearden, who actively researches new applications for his metal).  Here's the problem: the main applications of oil are engines of various kind (diesel engines, airplane engines, car motors). John Galt's motor obsoleted oil-burning engines; there's absolutely no reason that you'd ever develop anything but an electric motor. The fact that John developed the prototypes of the motor while he was at the 20th Century Motor Company, it seems likely that it was likely originally intended for use as part of car engines. Dagny pointed out that it could be used to replace a lot of other existing motors, too, such as engines for trains.  Also, the existence of Rearden Metal would drastically reduced energy consumption anyway because it was so much lighter than steel. For example, Hank Rearden told Dagny that he wanted to eventually make planes out of his metal.  I suppose that oil is also used in plastic manufacturing, it's currently not the primary source of raw material for plastic making in the U.S.. According to the linked article,     Although crude oil is a source of raw material (feedstock) for making plastics, it is not the major source of feedstock for plastics production in the United States. Plastics are produced from natural gas, feedstocks derived from natural gas processing, and feedstocks derived from crude oil refining. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is unable to determine the specific amounts or origin of the feedstocks that are actually used to manufacture plastics in the United States.      Petrochemical feedstock naphtha and other oils refined from crude oil are used as feedstock for petrochemical crackers that produce the basic building blocks for making plastics. EIA data can only identify those oil-derived feedstocks specifically designated as petrochemical feedstock by petroleum refineries in EIA’s refining surveys, which break out into Naphtha For Petrochemical Feedstock Use and Other Oils For Petrochemical Feedstock Use. However, the petrochemical industry also consumes large quantities of hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGL), which may be produced by petroleum refineries or natural gas processing plants.      In 2016, most of the HGL produced in the United States (85%) were byproducts of natural gas processing, and the remaining 15% were from crude oil refineries.   Point being oil production isn't even the main source of raw material for plastic anymore. (I have no idea if this was the case at the time that the book was written, though, or the extent to which it's true in other countries).  According to this list, oil is used in some quantity in a number of everyday household items (even things like, for example, toothpaste and deodorant). However, I doubt that any of these applications come anywhere near the amount of oil that's consumed for cars, airplanes, certain types of energy production, etc.  That being the case, it seems like the majority of the use of oil would be for legacy purposes (e.g. cars, airplanes, etc. that hadn't been retrofitted with non-oil-based motors yet). Even in some of these, the amount of oil consumed would be reduced over time. For example, if they started manufacturing boxcars out of Reardon Metal, the overall weight of freight trains would've been reduced, which would've reduced the need for oil (even if Taggart Transcontinental was still using Diesel engines). In other words, the largest application of his product was becoming obsolete.  Why wasn't Ellis Wyatt doing more about the fact that the largest application of his only product was becoming obsolete? "
115,How does Jane Eyre remember the German words Diana Rivers says?,"When Jane is at Moor House looking in at the Rivers sisters reading German, she writes:     At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: though when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me...   How does that make any sense? Did she remember after studying German for several years? "
116,"Near the end of The Scarlet Letter, is it plausible that Hester Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale will marry?","Near the end of The Scarlet Letter, Hester Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale meet in the woods and talk. At the end of this conversation they seem intent on returning to Europe to marry.  Is this plan at all plausible? After all, she's married to someone else, and they are adulterers. Was there really a country in Europe where they could have married? Was there any way to justify this action religiously?  From a certain point of view, it would seem more plausible that they should arrive in Europe and lie to the community that they join there. Hester might claim that she and Dimmesdale are simply a married couple and the parents of Pearl; or she might claim to be the widow of Pearl's father, and then arrange a wedding ceremony with Dimmesdale after arriving in their new community.  But that would be adultery, wouldn't it? They would simply be pretending that they are married to each other, regardless of the lie that satisfied the legal or social scrutiny. Can we suppose that both of them have rejected morality so totally, suddenly and simultaneously? "
117,"What is ""vulgar white of personal aims""?

I cannot judge these tides–I shall, perhaps.   A woman's always younger than a man   At equal years, because she is disallowed   Maturing by the outdoor sun and air,   And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk.   Ah well, I know you men judge otherwise!   You think a woman ripens as a peach,–   In the cheeks, chiefly. Pass it to me now;   I'm young in age, and younger still, I think,   As a woman. But a child may say amen   To a bishop's prayer and see the way it goes;   And I, incapable to loose the knot   Of social questions, can approve, applaud   August compassion, christian thoughts that shoot   Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims.   Accept my reverence.'     Why is it ""vulgar white""? Does it refer to white paper, or white clothes?  "

She was at the door when he sighed and said, ""I hope he's still alive."" She stopped. ""I hope they haven't done anything rash.""   A moment passed before she was able to ask, ""Who?"" and to make it a word, not a scream.   He shrugged, spreading his arms and letting them drop helplessly. ""I can't hold my own boys in line any longer. I can't tell what they might attempt to do. There's one clique - the Ferris-Lawson-Meigs faction - that's been after me for over a year to adopt stronger measures. A tougher policy, they mean. Frankly, what they mean is: to resort to terror. Introduce the death penalty  for civilian crimes, for critics, dissenters, and the like. Their argument is that since people won't co-operate, won't act for the public interest voluntarily, we've got to force them to. Nothing will make our system work, they say, but terror.... We're trying to keep the Ferris boys in check, but... you see, they're set against any surrender to John Galt. They don't want to deal with him. They don't want us to find him. I wouldn't put anything past them. If they found him first, they'd - there's no telling what they might do... That's what worries me. Why doesn't he answer? Why hasn't he answered us at all? What if they've found him and killed him? I wouldn't know...""   Is he actually telling the truth here? It is perfectly true that certain people were arguing for extreme measures sooner, that Mr. Thompson had resisted such extreme measures, and that it was Mr. Thompson's idea to negotiate with John Galt rather than to kill him like Robert Stadler wanted to. Is he actually worried that they'd killed him? Or is this a veiled threat (i.e. ""either cooperate or I'll let the dogs off the leash"")? Or is he trying to manipulate her into trying to contact John Galt knowing that he's having her watched? Or is it some combination of the above? "
120,What happens when a rider dies of old age?,"In the Pern novels, what happens when a rider dies of old age? Does the dragon go between without them? It's implied that dragons never die of old age themselves, so I'm asking about the riders.  As a second note, is this ever recorded in the books?  I would assume that there would be something about the Oldtimers dying off, but as far as I can tell they just do, without much explanation. "
121,"What is the device Shimrod found with multiple balls moving together, and what does it signify?","Towards the end of Madouc, book 3 of Jack Vance's Lyonesse series, Shimrod is studying a strange device with multiple (seven?) balls or discs moving around like planets. They move apparently asynchronously, but occasionally two and rarely three move together in unison. As he watches it, four, five, six, and finally all seven of the balls start moving in unison, until they appear to be all a single object. He goes to tell Murgen, but Murgen doesn't respond to his calls, and it is then that Shimrod discovers the plot to free Joald.  What is this device, and what does it signify? "
122,How did the Sphere know about A Square's dream?,"Full disclosure: I haven't entirely finished the book yet, so I'm hoping that this isn't an obvious question.  When the Sphere visited A Square, he was aware of A Square's dream about Lineland and seemed familiar with its content. The Sphere stated:     Do you not remember - for I, who see all things, discerned last night the phantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain - do you not remember, I say, how, when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were compelled to manifest yourself to the King, not as a Square, but as a Line, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent the whole of you, but only a slice or section of you? In precisely the same way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious enough to represent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice or section of me, which is what you call a Circle. (From Chapter 16, ""How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland"")   How did he know that? He merely vaguely states that he ""sees all things."" Most of the other things the sphere describes would be easy to learn if you really were 3D (rather than flat), but this is an obvious exception. "
123,What is the significance of the fact that the covered wagons were traveling East at the end of Atlas Shrugged?,"At the very end of Atlas Shrugged, a group of covered wagons picks up people who were stranded by the Comet's demise. Is it significant that they're heading east (e.g. that they were somehow ""undoing"" the progress of the people who contributed to progress by heading west in the covered wagons)? Or am I reading too much into that?  I'm asking specifically about authorial intent here. "
124,Short story in Russian about time travel and changing the history of WW2,"I remember when I was child (probably about 40 years ago), I read some story in a Russian book (I think original was Russian, not translated).  Story is the following: a man read some documentary book about WW2, but it isn't the same WW2, which we know, other events, other names, other Nazi leader (not Hitler).  And he think that if he could go to this time and kill this leader, we can save lot of lives. Then he fell asleep and transferred to this time. He managed to meet this leader and kill him.  Then we woke up at home, take this book and see that events changed, WW2 now is the same as we know and the Nazi leader was Hitler.  I'd like to find this story, so it's probably around 70th and in Russian language.  UPDATE: What else I remember: it was in  a book, containing science fiction stories by different authors (for example I remember another story, where a man could use electricity instead of food and became very strong). This story (which I'm looking for) is short (2-3 pages).  To kill the Nazi leader (before they took power) the man came to one meeting and after the meeting asked the leader for a private conversation and strangled him.  Other detail: when he was in an old German (or maybe Austrian) city, he hired some man with a mustache to help with his luggage and by mistake gave him a very big banknote (because was not familiar with local currency). This mustache man took the money and disappeared very fast.  When the protagonist returned to his time, he recalled his face and understood who he was. Last sentence in this story: ""What was his name? Schicklgruber? Hitler!"".  "
125,What was Ishamael doing for three thousand years?,"Lews Therin and his Companions put the seal on the Bore and supposedly locked away the Dark One and all of the 13 Forsaken. But in the prologue​ of The Eye of The World which happened after this, Ishamael meets Lews Therin, also there are multiple indications in the first book that Ishamael was never imprisoned. If that's the case, why did he wait for three thousand years? He could have done a lot of bad things, maybe even become the ruler of the whole world? What was he doing all that time? "
126,"How fictionalised is ""Dust Tracks on a Road""?","I just finished reading Zora Neale Hurston's memoir Dust Tracks on a Road and I thought it seemed to be full of tall tales as well as omissions, though obviously it is based on her real life. In his afterword to the edition I read, Henry Louis Gates Jr writes     Hurston did make significant parts of herself up, like a masquerader putting on a disguise for the ball, like a character in her fictions.   I wondered to what extent the memoir was fictionalised - is it possible to summarise the key fictions? Or would it be shorter to summarise the key facts?! "
127,What's the difference between a five-act play and a three-act play?,"Many stage plays - including all thirty-seven/thirty-nine of Shakespeare's - consist of five acts, while others consist of only three acts. (Are there any other common numbers of acts?)  What's the difference between a three-act play and a five-act play, in terms of the kind of story they tell and how they tell it? What considerations tend to be taken into account by the playwright when deciding how many acts to divide their play into? "
128,How should we view Dan Conway?,"Dan Conway, head of the Phoenix-Durango in Atlas Shrugged, was evidently a superb executive. He also receives (largely) positive treatment in the novel. However, the book also says that he initially went along with the industry group behind the anti-dog-eat-dog rule, and the novel gives several other indications that the author's not trying to present him as being 100% positive.  First, is there any significance to the fact that his railroad wasn't named after him? The ""good"" characters all named their companies after themselves (Wyatt Oil, Rearden Steel, Taggart Transcontinental, etc.) and the ""bad"" characters' companies had generic-sounding names (Associated Steel, Amalgamated Switch and Signal, etc.), so is the generic-sounding name evidence that we're supposed to have a negative view of Dan Conway - that he represents people who just ""caved"" morally?  Secondly, he definitely never joined the strikers (he wasn't in Galt's Gulch when Dagney was shown around, and Eddie is able to track him down towards the end of the novel), and there's no evidence either way about whether John Galt ever approached him (in fact, he seems to have quit on his own without any of the strikers having met with him).  That being said, why didn't Dan Conway ever join the strike? Why didn't the novel say whether he was asked to join? Would John Galt have been likely to have asked him to join? (It seems like an odd omission given that Dagney asked him to stay and fight and Eddie tracked him down to ask him to help Taggart Transcontinental).  How does Ayn Rand want us to view this character? Is he basically a good person who ""caved"" under pressure from the looters?  I'm asking specifically about authorial intent here. "
129,What suggests Edmund might be gay?,"While I was doing some research, looking for an answer for Are Frog and Toad more than just friends?, I found this article listing 15 fictional characters the author thinks are probably gay. Some of them are widely joked about (Bert and Ernie, Peter Pan), but two characters on the list were deeply mystifying: Old Yeller, and Edmund Pevensie from the Chronicles of Narnia series.  Granted, it's been a long time since I read the Narnia books, but I did read them again as an adult, and I can't remember a single thing that would suggest Edmund is gay, particularly if we confine ourselves the The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe as the list does. I can't recall any of the four Pevensie children having any kind of sexuality at all, except for some intimations about Susan in The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle, so it seems to me we could as well say that Peter was gay and Lucy was a lesbian.  I very much doubt Lewis, as a Christian philosopher in the 1950's, would have written a gay character intentionally, but is there any way to interpret the text that would suggest Edmund is gay? Conversely, is there a way to interpret the text that suggests he's not gay? "
130,Should Go Set a Watchman change our view of Atticus defending Tom Robinson?,"I do realize that the passage of To Kill a Mockingbird where Atticus defended Tom Robinson has been heavily analyzed elsewhere at this point. However, it seems like most people got the impression that Atticus's choice to give Tom Robinson a competent defense reflected a progressive view of race on his part (I certainly got that impression from studying that in lit class). This is obviously why Go Set a Watchman's portrayal of him was so controversial.  With that said, do we necessarily need to change our analysis of that passage based on the later book? How do you reconcile those two?  Given the complicated publication history behind Watchman (the fact that Harper Lee seems to have forgotten about it, the lack of clarity about when she decided to publish it, and the fact that Watchman was written before Mockingbird), is Harper Lee essentially flatly contradicting herself here? How did Harper Lee view Atticus at various points? For example, when she published Mockingbird, had she already forgotten about Watchman (and/or believed that she would never publish it) and therefore changed her view of Atticus?   There's a strongly related question about how much ""authority"" authors have to change an existing ""canon"" after the fact (particularly long after the fact), but that should be a separate question at a minimum and may or may not be the best fit for Stack Exchange.  Also strongly related (but not identical): Should Go Set a Watchman be read as a prequel, or an early draft? "
131,Why doesn't James Joyce ever use quotation marks?,"None of his books use quotation marks for direct speech. For example:     — Will he come? The jejune jesuit!   Ceasing, he began to shave with care.   — Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.   — Yes, my love?   — How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?   Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.     From Ulysses, Chapter 1.     The fellows talked together in little groups.One fellow said:   —They were caught near the Hill of Lyons.   —Who caught them?   —Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. The same fellow added:   —A fellow in the higher line told me.     From A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Chapter 1.  Is there some particular reason?  Edit: Before reading the comments and responses I was not aware that the use of quotation dash was common in other languages. My purpose for asking the question was, as someone guessed, to find out whether Joyce aimed to achieve some theatrical effect or maybe introduce purposeful ambiguity by choosing the dash over the quotation mark. Or did he want to use the device that is common to plays - and if so did he explicitly ever mention why they are preferable to him?  I do not think that it is a question for English Language and Usage because I am not questioning whether it is correct to use them, only what literary effect would someone gain by using them. "
132,Is Deeper Magic something more than God (the Emperor beyond the Sea) in Narnia?,"When Aslan is asked why he has to die in the The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, he answers something in the sense that there is a ""deeper magic"" that he has to obey.   What exactly is this ""deeper magic""? Since Narnia can be interpreted as a religious allegory, does this ""deeper magic"" have any correspondence to Christian beliefs? "
133,Story ID: Brother and sister go back to colonial times,"This was a Scholastic-type book, probably about 5th-grade level. I would have read it in the 1980s.   I remember there were a brother and sister, possibly in upstate New York. They either found or fell into a cave, inside of which were hazelnuts. They ate? the nuts, and this transported them back to Colonial times. They ended up living with a friendly family until they could get back to the cave/hazelnuts to return to the present. I think the settlers were Dutch or German.   There was one bit I remember vividly: upon arrival, they were taken in by a family, and saw something like a coal scuttle. When one of them asked what it was, the neighbor laughed and said something to the effect of ""Well, if you're living with this family, no wonder! A coal scuttle is for carrying live coals from one house to another when your fire goes out, and Mrs. [Name] has never let that happen! Her fire has burned for years!"" Later in the book, the family has rushed out for some emergency and forgotten to bank the fire. They run back, the woman feeds and fusses over the fire, and finally finds one coal poking out like a glowing eye:      She sat back on her heels. ""X years,"" she said proudly, ""and still it burns!""   There were a few monochrome illustrations — maybe in brown? — and the one I remember is just after the two have transported back to the present. The brother is standing and the sister is sitting on the ground of the cave, knees up, head on her crossed arms, and he notices her Colonial-style dress and her long hair spilling over her shoulders and back.  I would really like to read this again, so please let me know if this sounds the least familiar. I've Googled every combination of keywords I can think of. "
134,"What justifies the anti-Tess interpretation of ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles""?","Upon its publication, Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles inspired much debate as to whether Tess should be perceived as an innocent young woman thrust too early into the cruel world of men or as a shameless, immoral woman who deserved everything she got. The author claimed to be surprised by this controversy, as he had intended the interpretation to be clear all along; he even added the subtitle ""A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"" in an attempt to clarify the issue.  Now the pro-Tess interpretation intended by the author was also my own interpretation of the novel, so I don't need that explained to me. I'm still puzzled, however, by how it could be read as a criticism of Tess and the women like her. What justifies the anti-Tess reading of the novel? What is there in the text (or anywhere else, e.g. prevailing views in the society of the time) which could be interpreted in that light? Why did some people's sympathies not lie with Tess after reading it?  Has any anti-Tess critic ever explained their interpretation in detail? Lacking that, can we still work out what exactly might have led such people to their view of the book? "
135,What is the significance of the magicians in the poem 'In The Bazaars Of Hyderabad'?,"In the poem In The Bazaars Of Hyderabad, the poet Sarojini Naidu says:     What do you chant, O magicians?   Spells for aeons to come.   Here aeons likely refers to eternal ages and the magicians are likely chanting such spells for the eternity of their visitors.  But I can't understand the significance of the reference to the magicians in the poem.  Can anyone help me with this question? "

137,Story-ID Teenager in orphanage or prison,"I am looking for a story that was part of a Reader's Digest anthology. I read in the very early 1990s as a German translation, but I am pretty sure, the story is from the USA (and was probably written in the 1980s).  I remember neither title nor author of the story, but this is a synopsis:  The story is probably set in the 1970s-1980s.  Main actor is Mat[t]hew (?) McFadden, a teenager around 15-16 years old. He grew up on a farm (probably in Wyoming/Montana/Idaho), but lost his parents. The first days after his loss, he stays with an aunt and uncle. He also tried to commit suicide with a rope, but fails. Somehow he ends up in a prison cell, where he learns, that his uncle and aunt do not want to / can not care for him on the long term. Thus, he is sent to an orphanage (or a Juvenile Detention Center?).  During his time there he makes 3 close friends:    The first is in his age. The second is also around that age, but has hearing problems that were diagnosed loo late. Due to this problems, his family thought he was mentally challenged and he did not get proper treatment and education. He is a physically strong and friendly, good-natured person. The third is younger, around 10. Grew up in a bad neighbourhood in a big city(?). He is clever, funny, and becomes the best friend of the ""second guy"". I think he also had fun learning sign language from his friend - I remember the sign for snow played a role.   There is also a bad guy (red haired?), a criminal and leader of a group of bullies, some ignorant watchmen and a female teacher who recognises the kid's true potential.  The conflict between the ""good"" and the ""bad"" kids escalates and Matthew fights with the bully-leader. This fight was described rather detailed, I remember lost teeth and blood.  He wins this fight (strong farm boy), but the revenge would be fatal.  To save him, the teacher helps him to escape from the orphanage, brings him to an isolated farm where he can make a living. One by one, his friends come to this farm as well (either escape the orphanage or are old enough to be released). These last parts after his escape were less detailed, rather an epilogue.  Does anyone have an idea about the title/author or how to find it?  Edit It is not Holes by Louis Sachar. Comparing the two, I would say, the story I am looking for is more dramatic. The story focuses on the things that went wrong in the kid's previous life and the things that are wrong in this orphanage (e.g. like the ignorant watchmen).  "
138,Is there a specific order to read Ursula Le Guin's novels and stories?,"Ursula Le Guin wrote both fantasy novels (especially the Earthsea cycle) and science fiction (e.g. the Haynish cycle). The Wikipedia articles about these two cycles don't say whether a specific reading order makes sense (except that one story is said to be about Ged's last days). In addition, there are a number of novels and stories that aren't part of any series.  For a reader who wants to gain an understanding of the development of Le Guin's ideas (e.g. ideas about socio-political organisation, the environment, taoism and feminism), is there a recommended reading order for her work? Simply chronological? First one cycle, then another cycle? "
139,"Just finished the Martian Chronicles. ""The Off Season"" left me baffled"," Sam Parkhill is obviously a character you love to hate, but I was left baffled when the Martians gave him land deeds to half of Mars, especially after he shot one of them.  Why would they do that?  Were the deeds real?  Why did they chase down Sam so vigorously to talk to him specifically? I assume not, but did Sam return to Earth in the end? The 150 Martians that give Same the deeds... it seems like they are still alive at the end of the book with no mention.  Perhaps at the end of the book there are still quite a few humans and martians left on the planet?  If so, was anything else written to talk about all of the people still on Mars, and maybe they all found a way to live in peace in the end?   Thanks!! "
140,What connects the strangeness of the people and the magic of the bathroom?,"I was just reading Turkish Short Stories from the October 2017 issue of Words Without Borders. In particular, the story ""The Little Bathroom"" by Sine Ergün (published freely online, and translated into English by Ayça Türkoğlu, so you can read it in full at the linked page).  The story begins by introducing the flatmates Selen, Onur, and İnanç, who are all described as strange in one way or another. Later on we learn that the second, unused, bathroom in their flat is some kind of magical place, although exactly what kind of magic isn't really described in detail.  What's the connection between the residents' 'strangeness' and the magic in the bathroom?  I'm not only thinking of an in-universe connection (did the magic make them strange? could only strange people live in such a flat?) but also a thematic connection in the story (does reading about strange people prepare us for a magic bathroom?) I'd be interested in answers based on either or both of these lines of thinking. At the moment, their strangeness and the bathroom's magic seem to me like two unconnected phenomena, but I'm guessing there's something I haven't picked up on. "
141,"Was the Eatonville of ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" modeled exactly on the real town of the same name or simply inspired by it?","According to Wikipedia:     The all-black Eatonville of Their Eyes Were Watching God is based on the all-black town of the same name in which Hurston grew up. The town's weekly announced in 1889, ""Colored People of the United States: Solve the great race problem by securing a home in Eatonville, Florida, a Negro city governed by negroes.""   How similar are the fictional and real towns? Was it directly modeled after the real town, or simply inspired by it? "
142,"What did Tennyson intend to say, by 'fierce light that beats upon a throne and blackens every blot'?","Source: Rebecca Gowers. Plain Words (2014 ed). p. 270 Top.       The fact is not that officials do uniquely badly but that they are    uniquely vulnerable. Making fun of them has always been one of    the diversions of the British public. The fun sometimes has a touch    of malice in it, but the habit springs from qualities in the British    character that no one would like to see atrophied. The field for its    exercise and the temptation to indulge in it are constantly growing.    De facto executive power, which during the seventeenth and eighteenth    centuries moved from the King to Ministers, is being diffused lower    still by the growth of social legislation. The theory that every act of    every official is the act of his Minister is wearing thin. [The preceding sentence isn't in the 2014 edn, but was in this online edition that Google yielded.] Tennyson's “fierce    light that beats upon a throne and blackens every blot” is no longer    focused on the apex; it shines on the whole pyramid. So many    people have to read so many official instructions. These offer a    bigger target for possible criticism than any other class of writing    except journalism, and they are more likely to get it than any other    class, because a reader’s critical faculty is sharpened by being told —    as we all so often have to be nowadays — that he cannot do something    he wants to, or must do something he does not want to, or that he    can only do something he wants to by going through a lot of tiresome    formalities.    I learned from Google that the emboldened quote is from Idylls of the King. But what exactly did Tennyson intend by:   'beat upon'? 'blackens every blot'?   If a light is shining on a throne, then wouldn't it brighten, and not blacken, the blots on the throne? "
143,What does 'reflection of love for the soul' intend to say?,"Source:  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism (2013 1 ed). p. 90.     From the medieval period through the Renaissance, Plato's argument that    physical beauty should be seen as an emanation or reflection of ideal    beauty really took off. Writers such as Dante, Edmund Spenser, and    Baldassare Castiglione, among others, wrote poems of ""courtly love,"" in    which a lover sees his or her attraction to a beloved as a reflection of love    for the soul. By contemplating earthly beauty and love, the lover would    draw closer to the divine beauty and truth of God.   I don't understand how you can love the soul? Whose soul?  "
144,How does Derrida's Signifying obfuscate his writing?,"Source:  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism (2013 1 ed). p. 235.     Deconstruction and a focus on the materiality of writing have also been    important for Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s theories of Signifyin(g) (see    Chapter 14). In fact, Derrida's own writing often Signifies on the    subjects he is addressing—which is one reason many people find    Derrida's writing rather difficult.    Are there examples where Derrida's Signifying makes something readable unreadable?   Rhodes Scholar John Wideman explains Signifying in 1988:     IF you look up ''signifying'' in a dictionary, you'll find a set of definitions. If you hear the word used by a black person, chances are you'll need something more than a dictionary to understand what the speaker means. The word ''signifying'' is situated where Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his new book situates the critic of comparative black literature, ''at a sort of crossroads, a discursive crossroads at which two languages meet, be these languages Yoruba and English, or Spanish and French, or even (perhaps especially) the black vernacular and standard English.''      To identify the concept of signifying drawn from Afro-American oral tradition and signal its difference from, as well as convergence with, another universe of discourse, Mr. Gates employs a capital letter to distinguish black usage: Signifying. Since this seemingly innocent naming - assigning upper case to black, lower case to white - also implies hierarchy and pecking order, it is itself an example of Signifying. Signifying is verbal play - serious play that serves as instruction, entertainment, mental exercise, preparation for interacting with friend and foe in the social arena. In black vernacular, Signifying is a sign that words cannot be trusted, that even the most literal utterance allows room for interpretation, that language is both carnival and minefield.  "
145,"Is the beginning of ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" drawing a comparison of men and women?","The beginning of Their Eyes Were Watching God goes like this:     Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they   come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon,   never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes   away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is   the life of men.   Now, women forget all those things they don't want to remember,   and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the   truth. Then they act and do things accordingly.   Is the use of ""man"" here in the ""human"" sense, or in the male sense? If it's drawing a comparison between these two sexes, what does Their Eyes Were Watching God mean by this comparison? "
146,What does the last sentence in chapter 2 of Crime and Punishment really mean?,"The sentence I'm referring to is this one.     ‘And what if I am wrong,’ he cried suddenly after a   moment’s thought. ‘What if man is not really a scoundrel,   man in general, I mean, the whole race of mankind—then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there   are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.’    It's the very last sentence of the second chapter.  I have read a German version but that doesn't really matter. The translation is very similar.  I don't fully understand what this sentence really means. Can someone explain it?  This seems to be an important sentence since we don't get to hear much from Raskolnikov in this chapter besides this sentence. Or maybe the question is: What does Raskolnikov mean with this sentence? "
147,"Dante Alleghieri's Divine Comedy ""has been translated into the most languages in the world & top printed work after the Bible""?","There is a MOOC about Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy by the The University of Naples Federico II, in which a certain professor named Raffaele Giglio starts a video (published in September 2017) in which he recites some verses from the work.  I already become very suspicious about any credibility of this professor when he immediately afterwards uses the following vague words: ""the greatest Humanity poet"".  (English subtitle track:)     They were written by our great poet, the greatest Humanity poet, Dante Allighieri,...   (Italian subtitle track, for reference:)     Li ha scritti il nostro grande poeta, anzi il poeta più grande dell'umanità, Dante Alighieri,...   But my question relates to whether or not there is a general consensus among scholars with regards to the following two claims:  (English subtitle track:)     ...in his comedy, the book which, after the bible, has been translated into the most languages and dialects in the world, and is the top printed work of all time, after the Bible.   (Italian subtitle track, for reference:)     ...nella sua commedia, l’opera che dopo la bibbia è più tradotta nelle lingue e dialetti del mondo ed è quella più stampata sempre dopo la bibbia.     NOTE: It seems to be fashionable for some professors to shout that a book of their interest is the second most translated book in the world. In April 2016 for example, Alfredo Moro, who lectured at the University of Cantabria, claimed this for Don Quixote. "

And the associated reading challenge proposal that inspired the questions: [website]The linked proposal is for a reading challenge for The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed, much of which is computer-generated.  My other linked question asks how this fits into common definition of literature. However, I'd like to ask a more specific question here: someone else pointed out that this kind of text really can't be analyzed from an authorial intent perspective because there's no intent behind the text whatever (see, for example, the Chinese Room argument - it obviously makes no sense to try to claim that the computer was trying to communicate something specific). How would advocates of authorial intent theories of meaning respond to this? Do their definitions of literature usually explicitly require some kind of conscious intent on the author's part for something to even be considered literature in the first place? In other words, from their perspective, would they say ""that's not really literature"" or even ""that fundamentally doesn't even have any meaning at all""?  I suppose that a third possible response would be that the method of construction means that, in some sense, the programmer was the real author.  Has any prominent advocate of authorial intent actually analyzed this type of situation? "
150,What's the difference between a Higher One and a Great One?,"In Sergei Lukyanenko's Watch series, there are several different ""grades"" of magical power, from seventh-grade all the way up to first-grade and then beyond. As I understand it, everyone above first-grade power is called a Higher Magician (or Higher Vampire, etc.): they are ""Higher Ones"".  But another title I've seen used now and then is ""Great One"". Gesar and Zabulon are sometimes addressed or referred to as Great Ones, and I think so is Foma/Thomas the Rhymer in Edinburgh, Rustam in Uzbekistan, and a very few others. But when      Anton becomes a Higher One   at the end of Twilight Watch, nobody in Last Watch ever refers to him as ""Great One"".  What is the difference between a Higher One and a Great One? Is ""Great One"" a loosely defined term of respect for extremely experienced and high-ranking Higher Ones? Does it mean something not directly related to magical power? (Do the original Russian terms make anything clearer?) "

She stopped at the window of a bookstore. The window displayed a pyramid of slabs in brownish-purple jackets, inscribed:  The Vulture Is Molting. “The novel of our century,” said a placard. “The penetrating study of a businessman’s greed. A fearless revelation of man’s depravity.”   What is this supposed to be telling us about the state of the world at that time? What does it mean that the novel of the century is a ""fearless revelation of man's depravity""? "
153,When was Machiavelli's Art of War first translated into Chinese?,"Bookeater recently asked when Sun Zi's Art of War was first adopted outside China. However, Sun Zi was not the only author who wrote a treatise on this topic. Machiavelli wrote Dell'arte della guerra / The Art of War around 1519-1520 and it was the only of his theoretical works that was printed during his lifetime.  My question is a bit like the reverse of Bookeater's question: When was Machiavelli's treatise The Art of War first translated into Chinese? A simple web search did not help; I find mostly links about translations of Sun Zi's treatise ... Doing a search for 翻译 (the Chinese word for ""translation"") on the Chinese Wikipedia article about Machiavelli gives no results. A search in Chinese brings up pages that I can't read with my basic level of Chinese.  "
154,"Meaning and significance of ""vaultlike door"" and ""contract around the object in a single yawn of appetite"" in Egan's A Visit From The Goon Squad?"," What is a vaultlike door? Is this a common adjective for a door? What does yawn of appetite mean?   Would you please paraphrase/rephrase these sentences and explain their relevance?  From Chapter 1, ""Found Objects"", of Jennifer Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad (emphasis added):     It began the usual way, in the bathroom of the Lassimo Hotel. Sasha was adjusting her yellow eye shadow in the mirror when she noticed a bag on the floor beside the sink that must have belonged to the woman whose peeing she could faintly hear through the vaultlike door of a toilet stall. Inside the rim of the bag, barely visible, was a wallet made of pale green leather. It was easy for Sasha to recognize, looking back, that the peeing woman's blind trust had provoked her: We live in a city where people will steal the hair off your head if you give them half a chance, but you leave your stuff lying in plain sight and expect it to be waiting for you when you come back? It made her want to teach the woman a lesson. But this wish only camouflaged the deeper feeling Sasha always had: that at, tender wallet, offering itself to her hand-it seemed so dull, so life-as-usual to just leave it there rather than seize the moment, accept the challenge, take the leap, fly the coop, throw caution to the wind, live dangerously (""I get it,"" Coz, her therapist, said), and take the fucking thing.      [...]      Sasha sighed. She'd told Coz the plumber story about a month ago, and he'd found a way to bring it up at almost every session since. The plumber was an old man, sent by Sasha's landlord to investigate a leak in the apartment below hers. He'd appeared in Sasha's doorway, tufts of gray on his head, and within a minute-boom-he'd hit the floor and crawled under her bathtub like an animal fumbling its way into a familiar hole. The fingers he'd groped toward the bolts behind the tub were grimed to cigar stubs, and reaching made his sweatshirt hike up, exposing a soft white back. Sasha turned away, stricken by the old man's abasement, anxious to leave for her temp job, except that the plumber was talking to her, asking about the length and frequency of her showers. ""I never use it,"" she told him curtly. ""I shower at the gym."" He nodded without acknowledging her rudeness, apparently used to it. Sasha's nose began to prickle; she shut her eyes and pushed hard on both temples.      Opening her eyes, she saw the plumber's tool belt lying on the floor at her feet. It had a beautiful screwdriver in it, the orange translucent handle gleaming like a lollipop in its worn leather loop, the silvery shaft sculpted, sparkling. Sasha felt herself contract around the object in a single yawn of appetite; she needed to hold the screwdriver, just for a minute. She bent her knees and plucked it noiselessly from the belt  "
155,Was authorial intent ever taken seriously in academic literary theory?,"What does the author mean? and What does the author want to say/convey/express/...? are questions we heard countless times during literature classes at school. In other words, it is a common didactic device. However, in the 1940s, W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley, both representatives of the New Criticism, formulated their theory of the intentional fallacy, claiming that     the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art.   (See also the older question What is the “Intentional Fallacy”?.)  However, did older theories actually posit that the author's intention was the standard for interpreting and judging literature? Or have questions about authorial intent always been a teaching device that had little value in (academic) literary theory? "
156,"What texts are the sources for the difference between ""sometime were"" and ""some time are"" in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar?","The Pelican Julius Caesar has I.2.140 as     men at sometime were masters of their fates    (even noting the archaic meaning of ""sometime"" as at one time) while the Arden Julius Caesar has it as      men at some time are masters of their fates    and a Google search results lists many (admittedly not particularly scholarly) articles that use both without seeming to notice the difference.  What are the textual sources for this difference? "
157,"In the Kalevala, what is Väinämöinen?","The character of Väinämöinen is central to the Finnish epic the Kalevala. But from reading about him and the stories online, I can't figure out whether he was a god or a mortal man. Some of the myths claim that he played a role in the creation of the world (but as the first man rather than as a god?) Later on he seems to have a more human role, e.g. seeking a bride for himself. It seems that he must have lived for a very long time, but is he immortal or simply long-lived?  What is Väinämöinen: a god, an immortal, a hero, a human, ... ? "
158,Has Antonin Scalia's version of textualism influenced literary theory or hermeneutics?,"The late U. S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia famously advocated a form of textualism, interpreting legal texts as reasonable readers at the time of the law's writing would've understood it. (This is, of course, distinguished from ""Original Intent"" - comparable to Authorial Intent in literary theory - and ""Living Constitution"" theorists).  Has this had any influence on literary theory or hermeneutics (the method of interpretation of religious texts)? Are there any literary theorists who agree with him? "
159,"Short story about a scientist who (half jokingly) presented the theory that humans evolved from pigs, instead of apes","This was a short story from the 60's-70's.  The story was part of an anthology, perhaps from one of the magazines at the time (since it wasn't award winning material). A scientist (or doctor) at a hospital (college?) had an annoying pompous boss who was going to present irrefutable proof of man's descent from apes.  The protagonist, (mainly for revenge) presented counter evidence about the similarities between humans and pigs, internally (since omnivores tend to have similar digestive tracts, and catch the same parasites); developmentally, (pig embryos &amp; fetuses are often used as examples, or were, since they were very similar to human embryos and fetuses.) and even externally, (relatively hairless, sunburn, sweat, even put on 'sunscreen'.  Also mentioned the old ""Long Pork"" line of cannibalistic societies (maybe apocryphal). The punch line, I believe, was about the fact that the father of the scientific method was, of course, named ""Bacon"". Any help? "

162,Why did Emerson choose 'hobgoblin' in his quote 'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds'?,"Source: Yes!: 50 Scientifically Proven Ways to Be Persuasive (2009). p. 80.      According to Oscar Wilde, “Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.” A similarly disdainful Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” And finally, Aldous Huxley noted, “The only truly consistent people are dead.” Why is it more likely that these famous authors made these statements when they were young whippersnappers rather than when they were elderly sages, and what could this mean for your attempts to influence others?   I understand the quote. But Wikipedia doesn't explain the origin of the following signification? It differs from the original that portrays hobgoblins as guileful. Was there some semantic shift?     The term ""hobgoblin"" is used sometimes to mean a superficial object that is a source of (often imagined) fear or trouble.   "
163,"What does ""This title has Common Core connections"" mean?","I have noticed that online listings for books primarily marketed toward children sometimes include the text ""This title has Common Core connections."", usually toward the bottom.  What does this mean?  This doesn't seem to be something that is unique to any specific author, publisher, or bookseller, so it seems likely that this is some sort of standard term of art in the publication or education field.  Examples:   [website][website][website]The ""description"" section of the third book above is as follows (my emphasis):     Mr. Rabbit's new neighbors are Otters. OTTERS! But he doesn't know anything about Otters. Will they get along? Will they be friends? Just treat otters the same way you'd like them to treat you, advises wise Mr. Owl. And so begins Mr. Rabbit's reflection on good manners.      In her smart, quirky style Laurie Keller highlights how to be a good friend and neighbor—just follow the Golden Rule! This title has Common Core connections.   I would assume that this has something to do with the Common Core State Standards Initiative in US education, but it is not clear exactly what sort of connection is being indicated or implied.   Are these books officially certified, approved, or recognized by some agency as compliant with or allowable for use within a ""Common Core"" classroom? Are these books officially recognized as part of an official Common Core ""curriculum"" or ""reading list""? Is content from these books considered ""fair game"" for appearance on Common Core exams? Is a student who reads these books, or completes assignments based on them, entitled to official course credit in schools adhering to Common Core standards? Are these books self-certified by the author or publisher as having taken inclusion of Common Core learning goals or the exclusion of content deemed unacceptable according to Common Core standards into account during their production, but not ""officially"" recognized in any way? If none of the above, what exactly is the connection?   Alternately, one could rephrase the question by asking to whom the message is addressed and for what reason it is included:   Is the message intended to alert schoolteachers that purchasing the book for their classroom and/or assigning it to their students fulfills some sort of curriculum-related requirement? Is the message intended for parents to help them purchase personal books for their children that do not contradict the Common Core curriculum (""Sorry, son, I'm only supposed to buy you books that are Common Core-connected. Suzie Rides the Train may contain content that contradicts what your teacher expects you to learn and you could end up giving the wrong answers on tests."")? Is the message intended for students in Common Core classrooms looking for additional study materials?  "
164,Do Orwell's and E. B. White's essays belong to a school?,"I have always been charmed by George Orwell's and E. B. White's essays. They're insidiously plain, but extremely pleasant to read.

166,How did the story of Robin Hood pass from oral literature to written?,"Robin Hood is a famous figure of English folklore, whose existence or fictionality is still a subject of debate. The stories about him started off as folk tales transmitted orally (ballads), but by now of course there are many written stories about him. I'm curious about the history of the transition of Robin Hood tales from oral to written form, and I've phrased my title a little vaguely because I think there are several interconnected subquestions here:   Roughly when were Robin Hood stories first written down? What is the oldest surviving written Robin Hood story? Is there one particularly important early written text which influenced many of the later/modern versions of the story? (Cf. Malory's Morte d'Arthur for Arthurian legend.)  "

168,"Why did Mr. Elliot have to decide whose boots were thickest in ""Persuasion""?","This is from chapter 19 of Jane Austen's Persuasion:     The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot. But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne’s; and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne’s boots were rather the thickest.    What is the meaning of the phrase ""as Anne could be""? Is it that even though Mrs. Clay's boots were the thickest, Mr. Elliot was compelled to decide that Anne should be the one who should walk because her boots were the thickest as decided by the others?

169,What movie is Holden describing?,"In The Catcher in the Rye, Holden describes a movie:     It was about this English guy, Alec something, that was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all. He comes out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place, all over London, not knowing who the hell he is. He's really a duke, but he doesn't know it. Then he meets this nice, homey, sincere girl getting on a bus. Her goddam hat blows off and he catches it, and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about Charles Dickens. He's both their favorite author and all. He's carrying this copy of Oliver Twist and so's she. I could've puked. Anyway, they fell in love right away, on account of they're both so nuts about Charles Dickens and all, and he helps her run her publishing business. She's a publisher, the girl. Only, she's not doing so hot, because her brother's a drunkard and he spends all their dough. He's a very bitter guy, the brother, because he was a doctor in the war and now he can't operate any more because his nerves are shot, so he boozes all the time, but he's pretty witty and all. Anyway, old Alec writes a book, and this girl publishes it, and they both make a hatful of dough on it. They're all set to get married when this other girl, old Marcia, shows up. Marcia was Alec's fiancée before he lost his memory, and she recognizes him when he's in this store autographing books. She tells old Alec he's really a duke and all, but he doesn't believe her and doesn't want to go with her to visit his mother and all. His mother's blind as a bat. But the other girl, the homey one, makes him go. She's very noble and all. So he goes. But he still doesn't get his memory back, even when his great Dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid. But then, one day, some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball. Then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and    kisses his mother on the forehead and all. Then he starts being a regular duke again, and he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business. I'd tell you the rest of the story, but I might puke if I did. It isn't that I'd spoil it for you or anything. There isn't anything to spoil for Chrissake. Anyway, it ends up with Alec and the homey babe getting married, and the brother that's a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on Alec's mother so she can see again, and then the drunken brother and old Marcia go for each other. It ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off because the great Dane comes in with a bunch of puppies. Everybody thought it was a male, I suppose, or some goddam thing.   The Catcher in the Rye, chapter 18   Is this a reference to a specific movie? If so, what movie? "
170,Is there any evidence Mat Cauthon was inspired by Matthias Corvinus?,"Matthias Corvinus, also known as the Raven King, was King of Hungary and Croatia for a while in the 1400s. He was a noted general, and extensively made use of Hussite mercenaries in his battles. He was also (reportedly) popular with commoners and married into his title.  Matrim Cauthon, also known as the Prince of the Ravens and Knotai in his later life, was the Rodholder of the Seanchan army and consort of the current empress. In addition, he was the leader of the Band of the Red Hand, a group of soldiers that refuse the title of mercenaries.  These names seem pretty similar to me, especially considering the use of ravens in both of them. Is there any evidence that Jordan based Mat's character (in part) off of Matthias Corvinus? This occurred to me while playing Civilization 6 earlier today. So far I've only found this (incredibly comprehensive) blog post on the subject.   There seems to be a definite parallel here, is there any evidence that Mat was based off Matt? "
171,"Why does Caponsacchi count his fingers in ""The Ring and the Book""?","In book VI of Robert Browning’s The Ring and the Book, Giuseppe Caponsacchi tries seducing two women of Arezzo with love-poetry, but he is disappointed with the results:                                 Sirs, ere the week was out,   I saw and said to myself “Light-skirts hides teeth   “Would make a dog sick,—the great dame shows spite   “Should drive a cat mad: ’t is but poor work this—   “Counting one’s fingers till the sonnet’s crowned.   “I doubt much if Marino really be   “A better bard than Dante after all.”   What is the meaning of the line in bold? Does ‘counting one’s fingers’ mean ‘counting on one’s fingers’? But if so, what is he counting? Lines of verse? Or does it mean something like ‘twiddling one’s thumbs’, that is, being idle and bored? Neither meaning appears in the entry for ‘count’ in the OED.  Update I think Peter Shor is right that Caponsacchi is counting syllables, but here are three citations for the ‘idle and bored’ meaning:     1825   Thomas Dick Lauder Lochandhu 118   with nothing to do but count one’s fingers.      1850   Esther Copley Cottage Comforts 206   they shall do it, while I sit still and count my fingers.      1855   Harriet Parr Gilbert Massenger 75   with nothing to do but count my fingers and remember Bible stories.

175,Can the apparent age discrepancies in The Count of Monte Cristo be reconciled?,"(Note: all emphases in quoted passages below are mine.)    Continuing the theme of confusing mathematics in The Count of Monte Cristo, here is another example that stymies me:  When Edmond Dantès is first described in Chapter One, right when the story begins, his age is given as follows:     He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.   Here he is estimated to be 18-20 years old. In Chapter Two (which is the same day) he himself confirms that he is 20 years old:     “God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?”   At the end of Chapter Two, Mercédès (Edmond's bride) is described as being 17 years old, and her cousin (Fernand) as being 21 years old:     “Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.”      “Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?”      “I only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean with a fine wench of seventeen?”   Thus, at this point we have established that Fernand is about a year older than Edmond, who in turn is about three years older than Mercédès.  Fast-forward about forty chapters, and Mercédès is now married to Fernand (Count de Morcerf) and is the mother of Albert, while Edmond has become the Count of Monte Cristo.  In Chapter Forty-One Edmond visits the de Morcerf house and sees a portrait of Mercédès:     It was the portrait of a young woman of five or six-and-twenty, with a dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes, veiled beneath long lashes.   Albert then explains that the portrait is his mother, taken 6-8 years ago:     “Ah, monsieur,” returned Albert, “I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this. You do not know my mother; she it is whom you see here. She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during the count’s absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my father, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the best works of Léopold Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it. It is true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a most mediocre amateur of art. It is different with my mother, who paints exceedingly well, and who, unwilling to part with so valuable a picture, gave it to me to put here, where it would be less likely to displease M. de Morcerf, whose portrait, by Gros, I will also show you. Excuse my talking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture. The picture seems to have a malign influence, for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it, and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping. This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess, who are still as much united, although married more than twenty years, as on the first day of their wedding.”   Thus, at this point Mercédès would have to be 31-34 years old (25 + 6 = 31; 26 + 8 = 34), which would mean (as per the above evidence) that Edmond would be about 34-37 years old and Fernand would be about 35-38 years old. However, at the end of the paragraph just cited, Albert clearly states that his parents have been married for more than 20 years. That would mean that they got married when Mercédès was (at most) younger than 14 years old, Edmond (at most) younger than 17 years old, and Fernand (at most) younger than 18 years old. Yet that would mean that they were married even before the book began! This, of course, cannot be, as when the book began Mercédès was still betrothed to Edmond, and she only married Fernand well after Edmond had been imprisoned. According to Caderousse in Chapter Twenty-Seven it was a full eighteen months later:     “Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.”      “So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that makes eighteen months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he murmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”      “Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place in the church of Accoules.”   To compound matters further, returning to Chapter Forty-One, Edmond meets Fernand who is described as being 40-45 years old:      Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person.      He was a man of forty to forty-five years, but he seemed at least fifty, and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. He was dressed in plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged.   This is problematic because it makes Fernand 6-14 years older than Mercédès (instead of four years older as indicated from the beginning of the book). It also doesn't fit with how Edmond's own age is described by Albert immediately thereafter:     “And what do you suppose is the count’s age?” inquired Mercédès, evidently attaching great importance to this question.      “Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.”      “So young, — it is impossible,” said Mercédès, replying at the same time to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.      “It is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me, and certainly without the slightest premeditation, ‘at such a period I was five years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,’ and I, induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. The age of this singular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five. Besides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair, and his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,—he is not only vigorous, but also young.”   Edmond being 35-36 would be consistent with Mercédès being 31-34 as was indicated by the portrait, but it is not definitely not consistent with Fernand being 40-45 years old. Furthermore, when Mercédès says “So young, — it is impossible,” she seems to be trying to refute a potential suspicion that the Count of Monte Cristo is actually Edmond, by saying that Edmond couldn't possibly be that young.  What is going on here? How can we make sense of the age discrepancies described above? Have I miscalculated, or misinterpreted any important details? Is this just a mistake? "
176,Why is Paul so torn when he stabs the French soldier?,"In All Quiet in the Western Front, the protagonist and narrator, Paul Bäumer, hides in a shell hole between the trenches and is forced to kill a French soldier that stumbles in beside him during an attack. One full chapter is devoted to how this is his first hand-to-hand kill and the psychological ramifications of the act. However, in a previous chapter, Paul narrates an attack the Germans carry out on the French and how they ""bayonet"" some French machine gun operators. This contradiction puzzles me. Had he or had he not killed someone before in hand to hand combat? Is this perhaps a mistranslation from the original German to English or am I misinterpreting what the author is writing? "
177,Why is there no spelling consistency in Robert Ludlum's books?,"I just started reading ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and I see that in some places Robert Ludlum spells things the British way, and in others the American way. For example, on one page you'd see ""favorite"" and on another one you'd see ""favourite"". Or, he spells ""color"" like ""colour"", even though he's American. There are also much more things that I won't include here.  Is that a common thing in books written by American authors? Or does this style of writing seem weird? "
178,Persuasion by Jane Austen: Why were Anne and Lady Russell talking about curtains when they saw Captain Wentworth passing by?,"From chapter 19 of Persuasion by Jane Austen:     At last, Lady Russell drew back her head. ‘Now, how would she speak of him?’      ‘You will wonder,’ said she, ‘what has been fixing my eye so long; but   I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs   Frankland were telling me of last night. They described the   drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the   way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best   hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I   have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can   see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.’      Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her   friend or herself. The part which provoked her most, was that in all   this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right   moment for seeing whether he saw them.   Why were Anne and Lady Russell talking about curtains when they saw Captain Wentworth passing by? "
179,Why didn't Hermione or Dumbledore use the Time-Turner to defeat Voldemort?,"In The Prisoner of Azkaban, Albus Dumbledore hands Hermione the 'Time-Turner', which they use to free Buckbeak and later on to rescue Sirus Black. One spin on the Time-Turner equals one hour travelling back in time. What prevented Dumbledore and Hermione from using the Time-Turner to kill Voldemort?  Why didn't they use the time turner for good? "
180,Why is Daphne Farquitt never seen?,"In the Thursday Next series, there is an author named Daphne Farquitt. She is a prolific and popular writer, although all her books are pretty much the same unimaginative love stories. (With one exception, where the plot was accidentally changed during one of Thursdays adventures in BookWorld).    There has been some discussion if Daphne Farquitt is based upon a real person; consensus seems to be that she represents a type of writer.        This is perhaps evidenced by the fact that in ""One of our Thursdays is Missing"", she has her own part in BookWorld, implying that she is a genre of her own.   She is described as ""a recluse's recluse""; she is literally never seen in the series. Fforde has surprised us earlier with characters turning out to be someone else. But Daphne Farquitt is an extremely prolific writer;if she was someone else, it would have to be someone with lots of time on his or her hands.    So, do we know why Daphne Farquitt is never seen? Is it possible that she is the secret identity of another character in the series; is there any evidence to that? "
181,"Symbolism of ""hot gammon"" in T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land","I'm reading T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land (which you can read for free online) and one particular line stuck out at me:     Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,   And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—   I have two questions. Is there any symbolism associated with the food ""hot gammon""? And what's up with the phrase ""to get the beauty of it hot""? Since the passage this quote comes from discusses adultery, is it possible that the phrase ""get the beauty of it hot"" is referring to something other than the hot gammon? "
182,What are the challenges in translating a work of literature?,"I'm currently in the process of reading Cyrano de Bergerac (translated by Charles Renauld). There, an introduction is made by Adolphe Cohn, said to be the Professor of the Romance languages and Literatures in Columbia University. You can find a copy on Project Gutenberg, here.  He says:     &hellip; for it is in the nature of great literary works that they consist of a combination of what is purely human with what belongs to the time and place where they have their birth.    &hellip;    Of the faithfulness of his rendering those acquainted with the French language will easily judge, as they can have under the same cover the English of the translator and the French of the dramatist, and they will thus, it is hoped, acquire a clear and adequate conception of the beautiful picture, which, thanks to Edmond Rostand, has restored the life and brilliancy to the somewhat faded features of that eccentric philosopher, poet, hero and gentlemen, Savinien Hercule de Cyrano Bergerac.    Adolphe Cohn   Now, he says here that, in order to have a good translation, the translator must be proficient in both the source and target languages, along with an understanding and familiarity of the setting, etc. of the source play.  However, these are some general translation tips, and while I think it does help to ensure a more correct play, I wonder what has been lost in, for example, the translation from English to French. I know that in some cases (e.g. the Bible), certain mappings of words are not perfect; the specific Biblical case would be four different Greek words mapping to ""love"".  Some other works that come to mind would be Dante's La Commedia Divina (Divine Comedy; Italian to English), many early philosophical works (e.g. those of Plato and Aristotle), and generally any early work of literature.  So, the question remains: What are the challenges in translating a work to, say, English? "
183,Is the mariner immortal?,"   I pass, like night, from land to land;    I have strange power of speech;    That moment that his face I see,    I know the man that must hear me:    To him my tale I teach.   This is one of the last stanzas from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  It describes how he was cursed to wander the earth, telling his story to whoever he meets.  Does he have to do that forever? The title of the poem does call him the ""ancient"" mariner. Is he cursed with immortality? "
184,Why all those tangents?,"Anyone who's ever read Victor Hugo's immortal masterpiece Les Miserables knows that it's a long read...mostly because Hugo goes on a bunch of random tangents in the middle--on such topics as the battle of Waterloo, Paris and its urchins, a certain convent, etc.    In fact the book opens with about 70 pages describing the Bishop before even introducing the main character, Jean Valjean.  I know he was a crazy genius and everything, but what exactly was the purpose of these tangents?    If he wanted to comment on the battle of Waterloo, why not separately write an essay on the battle and save me an hour of time when I'm trying to read Les Mis? "
185,"Is Troy the antagonist in ""Fences""?","Is Troy the antagonist of the play Fences? The antagonist is, by definition, the opposer to the protagonist, who is also Troy. However, Troy often acts against his own beliefs (i.e., sending Gabe to the hospital for money).   Is Troy the main person standing in his own way? "
186,"In 1984, why does O'Brien expect Winston to know what Room 101 is?","In 1984, O'Brien expects Winston to know what Room 101 is.  I know that Room 101 is more torture, but why would O'Brien expect Winston to know that?     ‘What is in Room 101?’   The expression on O’Brien’s face did not change. He answered drily: ‘You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows what is in Room 101.’   And later:     ""You asked me once,"" said O'Brien, ""what was in Room 101. I told you that you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.""  "
187,How long was the Little Prince on Earth?,"In The Little Prince, the titular little prince lands on Earth.   How long was he there?    If I recall correctly, the prince left on the 8th day of the pilot being lost in the desert. I don't know if the prince landed the same time the pilot crashed. Did he?   How long was the prince on Earth? "
188,Was Isidora's fate in Melmoth the Wanderer directly inspired by Faust?,"When reading Charles Robert Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer I couldn't help but notice that Isidora's fate largely resembled Gretchen's in Goethe's Faust and especially the endings of both storylines are largely similar.  Apart from the obvious connection of Melmoth's tale being a Faustian tale itself and from their nature as innocent girls seduced by the protagonist, the parallels between Isidora and Gretchen are quite direct. Both ultimately conceive an illegitimate child from him and end up in the dungeon for their involvement with Melmoth/Faust, losing their child (although Isidora's part in the child's death is less direct, or at least more ambiguous). Both are visited in their cell and tempted a final time by their respective lovers to join them in freedom, but ultimately choose heavenly redemption instead. This scene itself struck me as quite a resemblance beyond just the obvious similarities of Melmoth and Faust making deals with the devil.  So I wonder if that part in Melmoth the Wanderer took a direct inspiration from or is even a reference to Goethe's Faust in particular, or if it is actually relying on older and more general elements of the Faustian legend that Goethe also took inspiration from, or if it is just a downright coincidence altogether. Is there any more information on this? Has the author maybe commented on it or has someone already done a more extensive analyisis of the evolution of the stories? Or am I maybe missing other elements that substantiate the connection even clearer (or refute it altogether)? "
189,Had Keats read any of Homer's works before reading Chapman's translation of them?,"In ""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer,"" John Keats writes:     Oft of one wide expanse had I been told      That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;     Yet never did I breathe its pure serene   Till I heard Chapman speak it loud and bold   Was Chapman's translation the first time Keats had read Homer whatsoever?  Or had he been exposed to other English translations and/or the original Greek, and Chapman was simply the first time he appreciated Homer? "
190,How many sailors from Odysseus' crew survived the Odyssey?,"It's been a long time since I've read it, maybe 20 years. Of course, Odysseus survives, but does anyone else? How many sailors did he start with, and how many made it home with him (or safely departed along the way)? "
191,Was there a deliberate parallel between the Thénardiers and Gollum?,"Long ago, I noticed that there was a parallel between The Lord of the Rings and Les Misérables in the characters of the Thénardiers and Gollum.   Gollum has the One Ring at the start of the tale in The Hobbit, but it wasn't his. The Thénardiers had Cosette, but, of course, she wasn't theirs. The One Ring was taken from Gollum, and Cosette was taken from the Thénardiers. Gollum pretended to help Sam and Frodo, while really intending to betray them. Éponine pretends to help Marius, while intending to have him die. Monsier Thénardier also makes false pretences while intending to rob Valjean. Finally, Gollum had a major (if unintentional) role in the final destruction of the One Ring, just as Monsieur Thénardier was the unwitting reason behind repairing the relationship between Cosette and Marius and the ailing Valjean.   Am I reading too much in this? If not, is the parallel deliberate - Tolkien paying tribute to Hugo, or both of them deriving from an older tradition? "
192,"What was a ""prince"" in Dostoevsky's times, i.e. mid-late 19th century?","In Dostoevsky's The Idiot, the main character is Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin. Sometimes the word ""prince"" almost seems an honorary title, e.g.     ""Here you all are now,"" the prince began, ""looking at me with such curiosity that if I don't satisfy it, you may well get angry with me.""   But usually it's mentioned casually, and the other characters certainly don't treat Prince Lev as some kind of royalty.  What were princes, and about how many were there (100? 100,000?) in those times? Were they respected for this title? Or was it mostly an empty salutation? "
193,Did Shakespeare's audience believe Measure for Measure to be realistic?,"In the play Measure for Measure Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, leaves his city in the charge of a judge while he goes on a ""diplomatic mission"". It transpires that he has not, in fact, left the city at all but has disguised himself as a monk and remained to spy on the actions of his courtiers.   However, it has always bothered me that during the course of the play, the disguised Duke interacts with several characters who know him well. It seems to be stretching the bounds of credulity to believe that they would not recognize him in his relatively thin disguise. Yet none do.  This motif, of a disguised character interacting with people close to them without being recognized, recurs in other literature of the period.   Is this something audiences in Shakespeare's day would simply have accepted? If so, why? And if not, why was/is it not viewed as a problem with the narrative of the play? "
194,How old is Romeo?,"While answering a different question, I wanted to find out Romeo's age in the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. It's well known that Juliet is 13, and generally assumed that Romeo is older (hence the occasional modern-day accusation that he's a paedophile), but what's the actual evidence for the latter? I've looked up about this online and found various places saying essentially that we don't know Romeo's age, but I'd be interested to see all the textual (or extratextual) evidence regarding this.  What, if anything, do we know about Romeo's age? "
195,What is up with the oracle's prophecy in the story of Cupid and Psyche?,"In the story of Cupid and Psyche, found in the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, Cupid, sent to wound Psyche with his arrows, falls in love with her himself, and flees.  Later, her parents consult the oracle of Apollo at Miletus to find out whom she will marry.  The oracle's reply is that Psyche should be dressed in funeral clothes and placed on a hill to be killed by a fiery winged serpent:     Let Psyche's corpse be clad in mourning weed       And set on rock of yonder hill aloft :   Her husband is no wight of human seed,       But serpent dire and fierce as may be thought,   Who flies with wings above in starry skies       And doth subdue each thing with fiery flight.   The gods themselves and powers that seem so  wise       With mighty Jove be subject to his might;   The rivers black and deadly floods of pain   And darkness eke as thrall to him remain.    (This is the Loeb Classical Library translation of 1922, book 4, verse 31.) (Original Latin)  I cannot understand this prophecy either literally or allegorically.  She does not marry a fiery winged serpent. She marries Cupid, who is winged but not fiery. It seems like a metaphorical stretch to understand him as a serpent.  He does subdue each thing, but not with fiery flight.  While it is true that mighty Jove is subject to his might, I do not know what to make of the rivers black and the rest of that part.  Also the clear implication of the funeral dress in the first line is that Psyche will be killed by the monster, and this is how Psyche's parents take it.  But she is not.  What is going on here?  Presumably Apuleius’ point is not that the oracle blew it.  What does Apuleius mean us to understand about the prophecy? "
196,Identify a historical romance/drama where a young woman has an affair while on a beach holiday,"My girlfriend is trying to find a story she once read (in 2004, when the book was not new). If anyone can help me earn a few relationship-points it would be greatly appreciated.  The story is set some time near the end of the 1800s, probably in the USA. The main character is a 15-year-old female only child (possibly named Ophelia?) who has gone on a holiday to the beach with her parents (her family has at least some money, but may not have been particularly rich). The beach has (some) segregated bathing hours, since there is a scene where the girl is walking on the beach with her father during the men's bathing time (which gets questioned). While there, she has an affair with a doctor who is already married with children (who may be a family friend or otherwise known to her parents). The two are caught in the act (possibly by the man's child?), leading to the expected scandal. The doctor's marriage is effectively ended by this, although he may or may not actually get divorced immediately.  In the aftermath, it is discovered that the girl is pregnant. While giving birth she is given laudanum (or some form of drug) and when she comes round the baby boy has already been spirited away by her parents against her wishes. She is then sent away to boarding-school for a few years, but this is skimmed over briefly. Her relationship with her parents is effectively over, due to them stealing her baby.  When she leaves the school at around 18-19 she goes looking for her child, and finds him with a couple who are not native english speakers (possibly French or French-Canadian). She takes the issue to court, trying to get custody, and wins her case but chooses to leave the child with the foster parents when she sees that he is too young to understand what is happening and doesn't want to leave his home (the child hasn't been told that she is his mother). The doctor has resurfaced and is involved in the court case, since he had been the one to find the foster parents three years ago.  The story ends with the main character and the doctor reunited, one or both of the foster parents ill/dying, and the child clearly about to be returned to her (but the story ends before that happens). "
197,"What did Scout mean when she said ""It takes a woman to do that kind of work""?","In the book To Kill a Mockingbird in the chapter in which aunt Alexandra has come to stay with Jem &amp; Scout at Maycomb county, she has a private chat with Atticus about Scout and Jem not knowing their heritage. After the chat Atticus comes to the kids' bedroom and delivers his lawyerly monologue about the need for Jem and Scout to remember they are Finches and behave accordingly.  This un-Atticus like behaviour unnerves the children and when Scout cries, he relents and tell them to forget what he just said. Atticus is visibly frustrated and while leaving makes the remark     ""Get more like Cousin Joshua every day, don't I? Do you think I'll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?""   At the end of this Scout has the following thought     I know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man. It takes a woman to do that kind of work.   What ""work"" was Scout refering to? Is this in a negative connotation (eg work=fear obligation guilt) or something more positive (like making the children feel better) "
198,What's the significance of Liza-Lu?,"In Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, the character Liza-Lu (Tess's sister) plays a very minor background role throughout most of the novel, until near the very end when Tess says she wants Angel to marry her after she, Tess, is gone. Angel and Liza-Lu are seen together in the very final scene, although it's left open whether or not he does end up marrying her after mourning Tess.  Why was this twist added to the end? What does it add to the story, mostly a tragedy of lust and love? I always found it weird that Tess would be matchmaking for Angel at that point, especially her own sister. Is it meant to convey the idea that there is always hope for new love, or what? "
199,Why are the bears bulgy?,"Among the diverse characters introduced in Prince Caspian during Caspian's tour of the Old Narnians are three bears known as the ""Bulgy Bears"". What exactly does it mean for them to be bulgy? It's not a word I've seen used very much, but presumably they bulge somehow - in what way do they bulge? What does this tell us about the characters? "
200,How does Mazrim Taim's timeline work out?,"Warning: spoilers follow for the Wheel of Time series, including the last few books!  We know that Demandred recruited Mazrim Taim for the Shadow, but when exactly did this happen in Rand's timeline? In The Dragon Reborn it is revealed that the runaway Black Ajah Aes Sedai have a plan to free Mazrim. So was he converted even before he met Rand? If yes, why did he come to help Rand at the Dumai's Wells? Was it to plant his own men with Rand? Did Dashiva (Osan'gar, Aginor previously) persuade Taim to help Rand so he can later become Rand's personal Asha'man, or was it Demandred who sent Taim to Dumai's Wells because he didn't want Rand to be captured by the Shaido? Or is it possible that Taim was still not on the Shadow's side and he was there just because he cared about Rand's protection for the Black Tower? "
201,"Is Don Henley equating himself with upper-middle-class suburbia in ""The Boys of Summer""?","The Boys of Summer by Don Henley contains the following lyrics:     Out on the road today, I saw a DEADHEAD sticker on a Cadillac   A little voice inside my head said, ""Don't look back. You can never look back""   I thought I knew what love was   What did I know?   Those days are gone forever   I should just let them go but-   The ""deadhead sticker on the Cadillac"" is obviously a piece of deliberate irony - owning a Cadillac is a symbol of upper-middle-class suburbia and ""deadhead"" is a symbol of youthful rebellion.  I'm particularly interested, though, in the line     A little voice inside my head said, ""Don't look back. You can never look back""   Is Don Henley implicitly categorizing himself (or, at least, the narrator of the song) as a ""Cadillac owner"" (minus the Deadhead sticker)? Is the narrator a former ""deadhead sticker"" type who became a ""Cadillac owner"" type, warning himself that he's no longer a ""deadhead"" type? "
202,What parallels can be drawn between Hunger Games characters and their classical namesakes?," In the Shakespeare play Julius Caesar, the minor character of ""Cinna the poet"" is brutally killed by an angry mob who mistake him for Cinna the conspirator. When he protests, ""I am Cinna the poet"", they respond, ""Tear him [to pieces] for his bad verses"" - his works of art. (Disclaimer: I don't know how faithful this is to any surviving stories of the real Cinna.) In the second novel of the Hunger Games series, the supporting character Cinna is brutally killed by a group of thugs. His death has been ordered because the dress he made for Katniss - a work of art with hidden symbolism - is deemed to be a sign that he's part of a conspiracy.   I'd always thought that ""many of the characters have names used in Shakespeare's play[s]"" was a bit of a silly observation, since the obvious naming connection between many of the characters from District 2 and the Capitol is that they have Roman-sounding names, not specifically Shakespearian ones. But after noticing this maybe-too-much-for-coincidence Cinna connection, I began to wonder.  How many of the Roman-named Hunger Games characters have similar character arcs to their namesakes, either Shakespearian or real-life ancient Roman? (""Character arcs"" could cover their deaths, their roles in the story, or anything else about them.) Is there enough evidence to say that the name choices were more than just a way of giving a general ancient-Rome vibe to Panem, or have I just stumbled upon a coincidence? "
203,"Why are ""Heaven"" and ""Las Vegas"" contrasted in ""Heaven or Las Vegas""?","While the Cocteau Twins are known for their mumbled lyrics (to the point that there's sometimes debate about exactly what's being sung), the song Heaven or Las Vegas (from the album of the same name) clearly and repeatedly contrasts Las Vegas with heaven (""But is it Heaven or Las Vegas?"" --- ""Is it Heaven or Las Vegas?"" --- etc.). Why are these seen as somehow contrasting? Is there any significance to picking Las Vegas in particular for this contrast (or is it just the fact that the name happened to fit, like Winslow, AZ was in Take it Easy by The Eagles)? "
204,"Does ""Kokopelli's Flute"" correctly depict Kokopelli?","In chat, @BESW taught me that there is a certain way that Kokopelli - a Native American god - must be depicted.   In Kokopelli's Flute, Kokopelli is shown as both an old man named Cricket and an actual cricket. Is the way the way he is depicted in line with the respect that is required when depicting Kokopelli? "
205,Why Night and Time?,"In The Sandman - Overture #5 we learn that       Dream is a son of Night and Time,    two entities who were not seen before (in the original run). If there was any doubt that Night and Time are the parents of all the Endless, this post by Neil Gaiman lifts them.  On the other hand, it makes one wonder - why Night and Time? Of all possible entities (or of all possible names), why those two?  Time is described as ""watch[ing them] from the micro-moments between seconds"", while Night is described as ""exist[ing] in the vast stretches of untime and unspace beyond every event horizon"". What can we learn about the Endless from their parentage? What symbolism, if any, does it carry?    The part about Time is particularly interesting; Time and Night would have to represent some fundamental forces or events, given they're the parents of such fundamental things as the Endless. However, time was described as non-essential or ""bendy"", in some regions of space, and especially in Dream's realm, in soft places. It wasn't treated as very important, so it seems a bit odd that the entity who fathered Dream is Time. "
206,Why did the animals in Animal Farm confess to their crimes?,"One of the things that I did not understand about Animal Farm is why the animals, after the hen's rebellion, simply came forward to confess their crimes.  Napoleon offers no incentive for coming forward. He does not threaten anything against animals that have committed a crime and do not confess, nor does he offer any inclination that he even knows who has committed any crime, other than obviously understanding that there must have been ringleaders in the hen's uprising.  Yet, having seen other animals executed by the dogs for committing crimes, animals continue to come forward and admit that they broke the law, and are summarily executed in front of the rest of the congregated animals.  Particularly the rebellion leaders coming forward first seemed particularly strange, as they must have known their punishment would be severe. They were already questioning the authority of Napoleon, so to suddenly submit to him would surely be in their worst interests?  There is also no hint that these were false confessions manufactured by the pigs in order to establish a firm hand against dissenters, mostly because I can't see how anyone would be encouraged to confess falsely if they had just witnessed that their punishment would be death.  And if the hens who did spearhead the rebellion were not the ones who confessed and were executed, then I can't imagine that the pigs would quash the rebellion effectively, it would simply strengthen the resolve of the hens who started the first rebellion.  Did this somehow reflect a real event that happened in Russia? And if it did, was it accurately represented in terms of people confessing their own crimes and being punished after witnessing the punishments of others? "
207,Why does the Reeve ride at the end of the procession?,"In Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, we're told that the Reeve always rides at the end of the procession of pilgrims going to Canterbury:     And evere he rood the hyndreste of oure route.   (line 622; the text is available online).   Why is this? "
208,"Why didn't Hamlet's modifications to the theater troupe's play ""tip off"" anyone else?","When a theater troupe visits Hamlet's castle, he makes some... rather pointed changes to their show, which now includes a murder much like the one his uncle performed. Why didn't anyone else (especially his uncle) figure out (or, at least suspect) such an obvious ploy? And why didn't anyone find Claudius's bizarre reaction to the addition suspicious? "
209,"Where is the setting of ""A Hawk in Silver"" based on?","The sci-fi/fantasy author Mary Gentle's first novel, A Hawk in Silver, is set in the small town of 'Surcombe' on the south coast of England. Although Surcombe is fictional, the description of it is so precise, so detailed, so consistent in tiny minor details that don't matter to the story itself, that surely it must also be accurate, a thinly veiled description of a real town. For example, this from the first few pages, when Holly is lying on Highrock at the top of the East Hill (available on Google Books):     Surcombe Old Town lay below, a maze of narrow streets. Houses with ancient red-tiled roofs, white-plastered walls and black beams, were interspersed with shops, pubs and churches. There were miniature cars, doll-people, and sudden inky shadows that resolved themselves into black cats sleeping on dusty pavements. The main road, scaled with cars, glittered and fumed like a summer dragon. She saw grey stone spires and - raising her eyes - the West Hill and the Castle bulking opposite.      Down on the beach were fishing-boats, drawn up on the shingle in the shadow of the tarry-black net-drying sheds. Her eyes were drawn by the line of the coast past the West Hill, behind which modern Surcombe and her own home lay hidden, along to the Marina where the town ended. From Hallows Hill to Gallows Hill a heat-haze hid the marshes; beyond that lay the small town of Combe Marish and a long sweep of land that finished a score of miles away at Deepdean, where Chalkspit jutted out into the Channel. And all the time, on her left, the sea lay flat and innocent and unbearably bright.   Does the description of Surcombe match a real-life South Coast town, and if so where? "
210,Does Hotel California imply that people aren't capable of changing?,"I've heard a variety of interpretations of Hotel California by The Eagles: the ""high life"" in Los Angeles, a journey from innocence to experience, greed in the music industry, drug addiction. (Confusingly enough, the band seems to have confirmed several of these interpretations). Regardless of which of these interpretations is ""correct,"" though, I'm particularly interested in the final verse:     Last thing I remember, I was   Running for the door   I had to find the passage back   To the place I was before   ""Relax,"" said the night man,   ""We are programmed to receive.   You can check out any time you like,   But you can never leave!   I don't think that this verse is implying that there's some kind of external coercion keeping you in the Hotel California. With that said, why would the narrator be ""running for the door"" and trying to check out, but suddenly find himself unable to leave? Does this imply that people are unable to change, or merely that they tend to go back to their behavior in spite of their best intentions? Or am I missing the point entirely here?  What would it even mean to check out but not leave? "
211,"Why is the moon ""angry"" in e e cummings' ""the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls""?","The e e cummings poem ""the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls"" mocks the titular ladies for their small-minded domesticity. The last four lines read:     .... the Cambridge ladies do not care, above   Cambridge if sometimes in its box of   sky lavender and cornerless, the   moon rattles like a fragment of angry candy   I believe I understand the main point here: the Cambridge ladies are too wrapped up in their gossip and knitting to care about anything else, even something as significant as the sky and the moon; such things are ""above"" their notice. What I don't understand is why the moon is said ""sometimes"" to ""rattle like a fragment of angry candy.""  What occasions does cummings mean by ""sometimes""? How does the moon ""rattle""? And why is it ""angry""? "
212,"Did Evelyn Waugh see himself as a conservative author, and/or did others categorize him as such?",Directly  Did he openly and directly declare himself belonging to the conservative tradition?    Indirectly  or did he do it indirectly through his view of human nature and his choice of themes in his works?

213,What does Pudd'nhead Wilson's joke about half a dog mean?,"In Pudd'nhead Wilson, by Mark Twain, the character David Wilson makes a remark that results in the townspeople writing him off as a ""pudd'nhead"".     He had just made the acquaintance of a   group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl   and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young   Wilson said, much as one who is thinking aloud--      ""I wish I owned half of that dog.""      ""Why?"" somebody asked.      ""Because I would kill my half.""   Like the townspeople, I am rather literal minded and can't really understand what the character is getting at.  Can someone explain? "
214,"Is Bob Dylan's ""A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall"" supposed to be uplifting or mournful?","I've become interested in Bob Dylan's song ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"", which I find perplexing and hard to make sense of. Looking at the lyrics, it seems that there is quite a bit of ambiguity as to how the song should be interpreted. Here's the first verse:     Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?   Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?   I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains   I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways   I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests   I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans   I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard   And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard   And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall   From reading the lyrics I can't figure out if the song is meant to be sad or uplifting. On one hand, a lot of the imagery connotes death and misery, such as ""a dozen dead ocean"" and ""seven sad forests"". And end end of a verse--""a hard rain's a-gonna fall""--seems ominous, almost like a warning of a coming storm. However, the song also seems to be about the reunification of a parent and his son: the parent is asking where the son was, and the son responds with a description of his travels.  The final verse adds to this ambiguity. The son informs the parent that they are leaving again (""Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son? / Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one? / I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'""). This could be considered as sad--they are departing--but also a good thing--the son is continuing with his travels. In addition, the son informs that they expect to drown in the rising water--sad--but that they know their song and will sing it as they drown--defiant, inspiring, and perhaps an uplifting conclusion.  Dylan's performances of the song only add to this ambiguity. In one of his latest renditions of the song, he is accompanied by an orchestra, and the music is similar to an inspiring, uplifting soundtrack that would be played at the end of a movie. In another version from 1963, Dylan is accompanied by only an acoustic guitar, and his voice has the characteristic mournful quality that I associate with his music. And in a third version from his 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue, the song sounds like a bar song: mournful but funny and entertaining at the same time.  So my question is: is the song supposed to be mournful or uplifting? What accounts for the range of interpretations of the song, both from a close reading of the lyrics, and from the various ways that Dylan has performed the song throughout his career. "
215,"In Peter and the Wolf, why is Peter represented by a String quartet?","Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf is a combination of a children's story and a musical composition. A narrator narrates the story while an orchestra plays the corresponding music.  According to the English translation of the performance instructions:     Each character of this tale is represented by a corresponding instrument in the orchestra: the bird by a flute, the duck by an oboe, the cat by a clarinet playing staccato in a low register, the grandfather by a bassoon, the wolf by three horns, Peter by the string quartet, the shooting of the hunters by the kettle drums and bass drum. Before an orchestral performance it is desirable to show these instruments to the children and to play on them the corresponding leitmotivs. Thereby, the children learn to distinguish the sonorities of the instruments during the performance of this tale.   Why is Peter represented by a string quartet? "
216,Why did Mama put the poison in his tea?,"In the novel Purple Hibiscus, Mama kills Papa by putting poison in the tea that he shared with his children, which is not lost on Kambilli.     “Why did you put it in his tea?” I asked Mama, rising. My voice was loud. I was almost screaming. “Why in his tea?”   It seems like a pretty important thing to just leave out, as there is no direct answer that I can see in the text. Why did she choose his tea to poison him? Why would she needlessly want to risk the life of her children? "
217,Why do some books have colors on the edges of the pages?,"On some books, I've noticed that they have colors on the edges of the pages. For instance, on my Tikkun:    And on a G'mara (part of the Talmud):    What is the point of these colors? Are they only found on religious books? "
218,Can absence of information be considered a stylistic choice?,"In The Road by Cormac McCarthy the names of the man and the boy are never revealed.

220,Can music be considered literature?,"This is based off of a recent meta debate. Although something being literature - or not being literature - does not automatically make something on or off topic, this is an interesting question that may shed some insight on the meta discussion.  Can music be considered as part of 'literature'? Has it been considered 'literature' by anyone in the past? What arguments are there for it being literature/not being literature? "
221,"Are there two separate narrators in ""On Most Surfaces"" by The Gathering?","On Most Surfaces By The Gathering (from their Nighttime Birds album) has the following lyrics:     The frost hits me in the eye and wakes me   These are blurry winters and I cannot see      I walk into the white light of the snow   When the sun comes   I break it with my shadow   Which tells me where I go      The frost hits me in the eye and wakes me      I am the snow falling down on you   I tear up your face with my frost   And make you run to somewhere warm   When I come I see you get away   I burst out about your emptiness   Why is the line ""The frost hits me in the eye and wakes me"" immediately followed by the lines ""I am the snow falling down on you / I tear up your face with my frost""? Is the last verse still written from the perspective of the original narrator, or does it change ""perspectives"" and now write from the ""perspective"" of the snow itself? If it's still being written from the perspective of the original narrator, what accounts for the ""transformation"" from being ""acted upon"" by the snow to being the snow itself? "
222,"Why is ""On Most Surfaces"" titled the way that it is given that only one surface appears in the song itself?","Loosely related: Are there two separate narrators in &quot;On Most Surfaces&quot; by The Gathering?  The song On Most Surfaces by The Gathering (on their Nighttime Birds album) has the following lyrics:     The frost hits me in the eye and wakes me   These are blurry winters and I cannot see      I walk into the white light of the snow   When the sun comes   I break it with my shadow   Which tells me where I go      The frost hits me in the eye and wakes me      I am the snow falling down on you   I tear up your face with my frost   And make you run to somewhere warm   When I come I see you get away   I burst out about your emptiness   This only appears to describe a single ""surface"" (evidently a snow-covered landscape). That being the case, why is this titled ""On Most Surfaces""? What's the significance of the title? "
223,Why did the Looters make so many decisions at parties?,"   [Dagny Taggart] did not ask why those men chose to make all their crucial decisions at parties of this kind; she knew that they did. She knew that behind the clattering, lumbering pretense of their council session, committee meetings, and mass debates, the decisions were made in advance, in furtive informality, at luncheons, dinners and bars, the graver the issue, the more casual the method of settling it.   Since Dagny wouldn't ask it, I will - why did they make all their crucial decisions at parties?  Elsewhere in the book (I think it's at Jim Taggart's wedding), it's mentioned that parties were at least partially a way to tell who was able to manipulate whom. Is there a connection? "
224,Which German book was Poe referring to?,"The opening line of Edgar Allan Poe's short story ""The Man of the Crowd"" is as follows.     It was well said of a certain German book that ""er lasst sich nicht lesen""- it does not permit itself to be read. There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told.   What is this ""certain German book""? Is there a real text which Poe is referring to here?  I've searched the internet for the phrase ""er lasst sich nicht lesen"", but most of the results just seem to point back to this Poe story. "

Also, how would you describe Ashlee Vance's tone? Is this a good answer: admiring yet ambivalent? Candid/frank and colloquial?  "
226,Did Stevenson really claim to have been inspired by brownies?,"Jorge Luis Borges claims, in his Book of Imaginary Beings, that the author Robert Louis Stevenson attributed some of the stranger ideas in his writing to fantastical creatures such as brownies who inspired him. This quote from Borges can be found for example here:     The famed author Robert Lewis Stevenson declared that he'd trained his Brownies to be writers. As he slept, they would whisper fantastic plots in his ear -- for example, the strange case of Dr. Jekyll and the diabolical Mr. Hyde, and that episode in ""Olalla"" when a young man from an old Spanish family bites his sister's hand.   Did Stevenson actually say this? Or is it just part of Borges's storytelling? "
227,Was Edwin Abbott trying to make fun of Christianity in this part of Flatland?,"Chapter 21 of the second edition of Flatland contains the following quote:     I AWOKE rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before me. I would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize the whole of Flatland. Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three Dimensions be proclaimed. I would begin with my Wife.   The text contains numerous references like this.  What's the author's point in referring to this as a Gospel, and speaking of evangelizing and making converts? Is he intending to parody Christianity here and, if so, why? "
228,Why did Dr. Pritchett criticize Francisco d'Anconia's (supposed) lifestyle given his own philosophy?,"   ""Just what did Hugh Akston teach?"" asked the earnest matron.   Francisco answered, ""He taught that everything is something.""   ""Your loyalty to your teacher is laudable, Senor d'Anconia,"" said Dr. Pritchett dryly. ""May we take it that you are an example of the practical results of his teaching?""   Given that Dr. Pritchett said that nothing is anything, that the mind is impotent, and that there's no such thing as objective morality or knowledge, why was he critical of Francisco's lifestyle?  Was it similar to the reason that Jim Taggart complained about the San Sebastian Mines affair in spite of the fact that Francisco had followed their morality literally? For example, the widely-held morality held that need took precedence over actual competence in selecting job applicants; accordingly, Francisco turned the operation of the mine over to an incompetent mining specialist that needed a job rather badly.  Elsewhere in the book, Jim Taggart describes Dr. Pritchett's philosophy as follows:     ""Have you ever heard of The Metaphysical Contradictions of the Universe, by Dr. Simon Pritchett?"" She shook her head, frightened. ""How do you know what's good, anyway? Who knows what's good? Who can ever know? There are no absolutes - as Dr. Pritchett has proved irrefutably. Nothing is absolute. Everything is a matter of opinion. How do you know that the bridge hasn't collapsed? You only think it hasn't. How do you know that there's a bridge at all? You think that a system of philosophy - such as Dr. Pritchett's - is just something academic, remote, impractical? But it isn't. Oh, boy, how it isn't!""   That being the case, on what basis does Dr. Pritchett criticize Francisco? By his own philosophy, isn't it just a matter of opinion whether there's anything wrong with Francisco's (supposed) lifestyle? Or is the fact that he doesn't actually have any basis for said criticism part of the point? "
229,First English Renaissance play where women disguise as men?,"In several of Shakespeare's plays, women disguise as men (for a variety of reasons). For example,   In The Merchant of Venice, Portia disguises as a lawyer; Jessica disguises as a man when eloping with her non-Jewish lover. In As You Like It, Rosalind disguises as Ganymdede, and her friend Celia as Aliena.   Philip Stubbes or Stubbs, writing before the start of Shakespeare's career as a dramatist, criticised this type of crossdressing in his book Anatomie of Abuses (1583). So what was the first English Renaissance play that involved women disguising as men?  Update in response to various comments:   Crossdressing may have been a feature of a number of plays from classical antiquity, but this is only of limited relevance to my question. A thousand years passed between the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the English Renaissance. The theatrical tradition had been interrupted; the most common types of plays in Medieval England were mystery plays and morality plays, which were based on a Christian tradition and far removed from the ancient Greek and Roman plays. Cross-dressing seems innocuous now (at least in the West), but this was not the case in Shakespeare's time.    There were sumptuary laws that regulated who could wear what types of clothes or materials; several such laws from the reign of Henry VIII were re-enacted in 1565. For example, only the nobility was allowed to wear imported woollen fabrics; only those with an income of £ 100 per year were allowed to wear satin, damask, silk, camlet or tafetta. The goal of these laws was to keep the ""natural"" class distinctions intact. (Source: G. Blakemore Evans, ed.: Elizabethan-Jacobean Drama: A New Mermaid Background Book. 1988. Pp. 129f.)  Cross-dressing was frowned upon; see e.g. Deuteronomy 22:5: ""The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for all who do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God."". ""Cross-dressing"" could be as simple as women wearing bodices done up with buttons (buttons were very ""masculine"") or a hat; people were shocked and complained you couldn't tell the sexes apart. (Source: Ruth Goodman: How to Be a Tudor. 2015. Pp. 67, 85.)   "
230,Why did Jim Taggart interrupt himself?,"   ""I can't understand it..."" said [Jim] Taggart miserably. ""The top experts of the National Council of Metal Industries...""   ""Who's the president of the National Council of Metal Industries, Jim? Orren Boyle, isn't it?""   Taggart did not turn to her, but his jaw snapped open. ""If that fat slob thinks he can -"" he started, but stopped and did not finish.   Why didn't Jim finish his sentence? If Orren Boyle thinks he can what? "
231,What knowledge was Jim Taggart trying to evade when he hit his wife?,"   [Cheryl Taggart] moved her hands in groping gestures, half-waving it away, half-trying to grasp it; when she answered, her words did not quite name it, but they were the only words she can find: ""You... you're a killer... for the sake of killing..."" It was too close to the unnamed; shaking with terror, he swung out blindly and struck her in the face.   Jim Taggart's evil is, of course, on full display here - not only in his disgraceful physical and emotional abuse of his wife, but also in the violence and destructiveness that's central to his philosophy of life. Of course, later he does realize the truth about himself when he realizes - to his horror - that he wanted Dr. Ferris to kill John Galt (even though it would mean his own death).  Is this what he's trying to evade here - the fact that he doesn't want to live, the fact that he claims to want to live while seeking to destroy everything that actually makes life possible? Or is ""the unnamed"" something else here? "
232,Was the Charles Calthrop plot-element in The Day of the Jackal an example of pure coincidence or good detection?,"Frederick Forsyth's 1971 novel ""The Day of the Jackal"" remains an immortal political thriller that defined the 'assassination novel' in popular consciousness. What has always intrigued me is the small but significant Charles Calthrop plot-element. This was a person in the novel whom police agencies supposed to be the real identity behind the Jackal. Wikipedia notes that     Charles Calthrop is the name of a former small-arms salesman who was in the Dominican Republic at the time Rafael Leónidas Trujillo was shot. The SIS later heard a rumour that Calthrop has helped the partisans kill Trujillo by shooting the driver of his armoured car, causing it to crash. In the book, the British police originally think Calthrop is the Jackal's real name, until the real Calthrop shows up at the end, after the Jackal's assassination attempt was thwarted. The authorities were misled by the fact that chacal (i.e., Cha[rles] Cal[throp]) is French for ""jackal"".    Source: The Jackal, fictional character, 'The Day of the Jackal' - Novel (Wikipedia)  The main Wikipedia article elaborates that     Lebel does everything he can to discover the Jackal's identity. He first calls upon his ""old boy network"" of foreign intelligence and police contacts to inquire if they have any records of a top-class political assassin. Most of the inquiries are fruitless, but in the United Kingdom, the inquiry is eventually passed on to the Special Branch of Scotland Yard, and another veteran detective, Superintendent Bryn Thomas.      A search through Special Branch's records turns up nothing. However, one of Thomas's subordinates suggests that if the assassin were an Englishman, but primarily operated abroad, he would most probably come to the attention of the Secret Intelligence Service. Thomas makes an informal inquiry with a friend of his on the SIS's staff, who mentions hearing a rumour from an officer stationed in the Dominican Republic at the time of President Trujillo's assassination. The rumour states that a hired assassin stopped Trujillo's car with a rifle shot, allowing a gang of partisans to finish him off. Additionally, Thomas also learns that the assassin was an Englishman, whom he is able to identify as Charles Calthrop (...)       Checking out the name of Charles Calthrop, Thomas finds a match to a man living in London, said to be on holiday. While Thomas confirms that this Calthrop was in the Dominican Republic at the time of Trujillo's death, he does not feel it is enough to inform Lebel, until one of his junior detectives realises that the first three letters of his Christian name and surname form the French word for Jackal, Chacal (...) the Special Branch raids Calthrop's flat, finding his passport, and deduce that he must be travelling on a false one (...)      [Epilogue] In London, the Special Branch are cleaning up Calthrop's apartment when the real Charles Calthrop storms in and demands to know what they are doing. Once it is established that Calthrop really has been on holiday in Scotland and has no connection whatsoever with the Jackal, the British are left to wonder ""If the Jackal wasn't Calthrop, then who the hell was he?""   Source: The Day of the Jackal - Novel (Wikipedia)  In short, the name of Calthrop cropped up in a high level international enquiry about the possible real identity of the Jackal, but the police became excited about its possibilities when the person was found missing and his name parts seemed to spell out ""cha-cal"" which is French for ""jackal"".   Ironically the Jackal was probably unaware of the name Calthrop and never used it as an alias, as far as I can recollect. However, what was revealed as false coincidence at the very end, actually energized the search for the Jackal, and gave the police focus and hope: in particular, the discovery of Calthrop's passport in his house created the impetus to look for recently faked or stolen passports and led them to discover the Jackal's assumed identities through genuinely good detective work, which in turn helped the authorities launch a massive manhunt that put him under various forms of pressure.   So how important was the Charles Calthrop element in foiling the assassination?  Did the wild coincidence mean pure bad luck for the Jackal, or was the investigators'   policy of following up every possible lead (especially persons of interest who were untraceable during that crucial time window) simply an example of good and meticulous detection?

233,"What does the phrase ""If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it"" mean?","I find the final passage of Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon to be a bit confusing.     As fleet and bright as a lodestar, he wheeled towards Guitar and it did not matter which one of them would give up his ghost in the killing arms of his brother. For now he knew what Shalimar knew: If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it.   I've thought about it, but I'm not quite sure why it's important to ""surrender to the air""? How does that lead to the ability to ""ride"" the air? Any insight into the meaning of ""If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it"" would be appreciated.  "
234,"Why did Hank Rearden call the formula for his metal his ""personal secret,"" given that several other people in the book knew about it?","At the press conference that Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden gave announcing the opening of the John Galt/Rio Norte Line, Rearden stated that the formula was secret:     ""Inasmuch as the formula of Rearden Metal is my own personal secret, and in view of the fact that the Metal costs much less to produce than you boys can imagine, I expect to skin the public to the tune of a profit of twenty-five per cent in the next few years.""   ""What do you mean, skin the public, Mr. Rearden?"" asked the boy. ""If it's true, as I've read in your ads, that your Metal will last three times longer than any other and at half the price, wouldn't the public be getting a bargain?""   ""Oh, have you noticed that?"" said Rearden.   However, earlier in the book, Dagny and Jim were arguing about whether to order the rails for the Rio Norte/John Galt Line from Orren Boyle or Hank Rearden, and about whether they should be made out of steel or Rearden Metal. Dagny claimed to have seen the formula for Rearden Metal:     ""Then what on earth do you know about Rearden Metal?""   ""That it's the greatest thing ever put on the market.""   ""Why?""   ""Because it's tougher than steel, cheaper than steall and will outlast any hunk of metal in existence.""   ""But who says so?""   ""Jim, I studied engineering in college. When I see things, I see them.""   ""What did you see?""   ""Rearden's formula and the tests he showed me.""   Presumably, too, his research staff would've known about it, as would his Mills Superintendant.  That being the case, why did Hank Rearden call the formula his ""personal secret""? "
235,"Meaning of ""you wear your blue so chiefly in your eyes ... it comforts me entirely for your fame"" in Aurora Leigh","From Aurora Leigh:        She said her name quite simply, as if it meant   Not much indeed, but something,–took my hands,   And smiled, as if her smile could help my case,   And dropped her eyes on me, and let them melt.   'Is this,' she said, 'the Muse?'                             'No sibyl even,'   I answered, 'since she fails to guess the cause   Which taxed you with this visit, madam.'                                      'Good,'   She said, 'I like to be sincere at once;   Perhaps, if I had found a literal Muse,   The visit might have taxed me. As it is,   You wear your blue so chiefly in your eyes,   My fair Aurora, in a frank good way,   It comforts me entirely for your fame,   As well as for the trouble of my ascent   To this Olympus. '                   There, a silver laugh   Ran rippling through her quickened little breaths   The steep stair somewhat justified.     What is the meaning of this sentence? The blue color of Aurora's eyes provides comfort, so that the visitor is not feeling meek, even despite Aurora's fame?   And what is the meaning of ""so chiefly""?

237,"Did Mr. Weatherby ever try to ""cash in"" on his access to Dagny?","   When Mr. Weatherby's voice came on the wire, it sounded cautious: ""Yes, Miss Taggart? Of what service can I be to you?""

""It is my duty to assist the nation's railroads at any time, Miss Taggart."" Mr. Weatherby sounded as if he were trying to avoid the commitment of having heard what he heard; but a sudden note of interest crept into his voice as he asked slowly, thoughtfully, with guarded shrewdness, ""Am I to understand, Miss Taggart, that it is your wish to deal exclusively with me in all official matters? May I take this as your policy?""   She gave a brief, harsh chuckle. ""Go ahead,"" she said. ""You may list me as your exclusive property, use me as a special item of pull, and trade me all over Washington. But I don't know what good that will do you, because I'm not going to play the game, I'm not going to trade favors, I'm simply going to start breaking your laws right now - and you can arrest me when you feel that you can afford to.""   Is there any evidence that Mr. Weatherby tried to ""cash in"" on this connection? It doesn't seem like there's all that much contact between them later in the book (apart from a dinner that they were both at, and Dagny was mostly there so that they could pretend that she agreed with their decision).

He pointed to the picture of the Parthenon.   ""That,"" said the Dean, ""is the Parthenon!""   ""So it is.""   ""I haven't the time to waste on silly questions.""   ""All right, then."" Roark got up, he took a long ruler from the desk, he walked to the picture. ""Shall I tell you what's rotten about it?""   ""It’s the Parthenon!"" said the Dean.   ""Yes, God damn it, the Parthenon.""   The ruler struck the glass over the picture.   ""Look,"" said Roark. ""The famous flutings on the the famous columns—what are they there for? To hide the joints in the wood—when columns were made of wood, only these aren't, they're marble. The triglyphs, what are they? Wood. Wooden beams, the way they had to be laid when people began to build wooden shacks. Your Greeks took marble and they made copies of their wooden structures out of it, because others had done it that way. Then your masters of the Renaissance came along and made copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood. Now here we are, making copies in steel and concrete of copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood. Why?""   What is the historical basis for Roark's argument? Is this accurate? Is there some kind of reference that explores this further?  Was The Fountainhead the first book to use this line of reasoning, or was a similar line of argument used elsewhere? How do people who disagree with Roark's conclusions respond to these arguments? "
239,"Interpreting T.S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land""","I'm having trouble interpreting the significance of a specific stanza in T.S. ELiot's ""The Waste Land"".      “What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing again nothing.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do   “You know nothing?

Is there nothing in your head?”   I understand that the ""pearls that were his eyes"" references ""The Tempest"", but I'm unsure of how that connects to the central message of the poem. In addition, I'm confused about the significance of the wind.  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. "
240,When did Aristotle's Poetics first become available in England?,"In a comment on a recent question about T. S. Eliot's essay on Hamlet, Peter Shor wrote,     According to Aristotle, in great tragedy the hero must have a fatal flaw that leads to his downfall. What Eliot failed to recognize was that Hamlet's fatal flaws were intellectualism and indecisiveness (maybe because he saw these as positive character traits). The delay in revenge has no simple, rational explanation, because it's Hamlet's fatal flaw. If there had been a good reason for him to delay his revenge, the ending wouldn't be Aristotelean tragedy but just bad luck.   This assumes that the theories exposed in Aristotle's Poetics were somehow relevant to Shakespeare's tragedies during the period in which they were written. However, as far as I know, Shakespeare did not consistently use a five-act division (the act and scene divisions we are used to seeing in modern editions are typically the work of later editors) and he disregarded the three unities in all of his plays except (more or less) The Tempest.  This leads me to the question whether Shakespeare would have know Aristotle's Poetics. The first English translation listed on Wikipedia is Thomas Twining's translation from 1789, i.e. long after Shakespeare. Did any other versions (perhaps a Latin translation?) circulate in England during Shakespeare's lifetime?  "
241,"What exactly do these words from ""The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin"" mean in this context?","I read the following in ""The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume I"":     A portrait from Mr. Carlyle's portfolio not regretted by any who loved the original, surely confers sufficient distinction to warrant a few words of notice, when the character it depicts is withdrawn from mortal gaze.   Many words are confusing (to me, at least); ""confer"", ""distinction"", ""warrant"" and ""mortal gaze"".   Does ""confer"" here mean ""grant"" or ""bestow""?   Does ""distinction"" mean ""Excellence or eminence""?   What does ""warrant"" and ""mortal gaze"" mean?     Does the speaker mean that Carlyle praised Erasmus Darwin? or the opposite? "
242,Books that are narrated using various points of view of the main characters,"I recently read the book The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. To be honest I did not like the storyline of the book. However, I found the way the story is told based on the different viewpoints of the main characters very interesting. Is there a name for this kind of style? Is it a common style? "
243,Mann's introduction to the magic mountain?,"I remember that the edition of the magic mountain I read around 7 or 8 years ago contained an introduction that was written by Mann and inspired by a lecture he gave about his book. I remember it saying something along the lines that ""writing the introduction in English makes it easier, just like how in the book Castorp's love was easier to confess in French, a language which is not his native one"".  I'm trying to find that introduction again, but I cannot find it online and I'm not sure which edition(s) of the book have it, to make things worse I might be misremembering the details. So to make this into an explicit question: which edition(s) of the magic mountain have an introduction written by Mann? Is that introduction also available online? "
244,Bakhtin quote about flat plots and characters,"Through serendipity (this question led me to Wikipedia article about Ian Watt) I found that that the Russian literary theorist Mikhael Bakhtin is supposed to have written that certain genres with flat plots and characters      can literally be read front to back, or back to front, with no significant difference in effect.   Note that the wording is from Wikipedia (or from Ian Watt?): it is not in quotation marks and no source is given. The Wikipedia article about Mikhail Bakhtin does not mention this statement. So which of Bakhtin's publications is the source of this statement? "
245,help identifying book in 18th or 19th century France and England,"The main character is a young woman (late teens? early 20s?) She's in Paris with an (aunt?) and they're discussing what to do since her father has suddenly died. If they return to England, her brother will claim the family estate and sell it for gambling debts.  The only way she can see to prevent this is for her to marry someone, anyone, as soon as possible.  Before her brother learns of their father's death.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  "
246,Was Shakespeare a member of the lower classes?,"Am I correct to assume there is a feud between academics considering Shakespeare's social origins? I understand that he was probably born as a member of the working classes (or even the Elizabethan underclass), but his skill might suggest something equivalent to what is portrayed in the film Anonymous, where Shakespeare was a noble who wrote under the name of a commoner. What is the state of this debate? What sources could I read that summarize it? "
247,Thomas McElwain as Ali Haydar?,"On this website of translated Turkish poetry, a traditional hymn of sacrifice from a Turkish Alevi village is included in its English translation, with a note at the top signed ""Ali Haydar"", although the research and translation was done by Thomas McElwain. The website's front page (first link in this question) links directly to that hymn with the following description:     a part of the oral tradition, recorded by Thomas McElwain (alias Ali Haydar)   I found an original article by Thomas McElwain detailing his research into this hymn of sacrifice at the village of Sarilar (near Gaziantep) in 1989. The title is ""Ritual Change in a Turkish Alevi Village"", whereas the website linked above cites ""Rites of Sacrifice in a Turkish Alevi Village"", so I'm not sure if it's exactly the same article. Anyway there's no mention of a pseudonym Ali Haydar. I found a few other references to this pseudonym online, e.g. at Wikipedia, but nothing reliable or sourced. It feels like chasing whispers and shadows.  Did Thomas McElwain take the pseudonym Ali Haydar? When, how, and why?  Assuming yes, was it to be accepted as if he was Turkish during his research in Turkish villages? How long did he keep up that false persona? Is there anything more to this story? "
248,Can three unstressed syllables constitute a substitute foot in Shakespeare?,"While trying to ascertain the accentuation of certain names in Shakespeare, by analyzing lines of verse where they occur, I encountered a couple of lines that I was tempted to scan with a substitute foot consisting of three consecutive unstressed syllables. I would not even know how to call such a foot, if foot it be, but it falls out thus in what seems to me the best way to read either line.  My first instance is from the first act of Titus Andronicus (so we are more likely talking George Peele than Shakespeare, according to what seems a prevailing view among experts):      Behold I choose thee Tamora for my bride, (1.1.322)   My analysis of this and other verse lines where the name occurs satisfies me that Tamora is always accented on the first syllable, and can scan variously as /&nbsp;˘&nbsp;˘ (end of iamb with pyrrhic or anapestic substitution following), or with secondary accent as /&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/ (end of iamb plus whole iamb), or with syncope as TAM&rsquo;ra, /&nbsp;˘.  I scan this particular line with iambic first and fifth feet, spondaic second and third, and the mystery foot fourth, as follows:     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ˘&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/   Behold | I choose | thee Tam | ora for | my bride,   The speaker is new emperor Saturninus, in a mode of public pronouncement, which the five consecutive stresses suit well. Given that mode, the syncope option that would reduce the fourth foot to a regular pyrrhus seems all too sloppy and unemphatic, and it is easy to fit the extra unstressed syllable in while keeping the basic five-beat pentameter rhythm intact.  One could also assign the word for to the fifth foot, making that an anapest and the fourth either a pyrrhus or (with secondary stress) an iamb; but a natural reading seems to place the fourth beat on that for rather than on the -a.   My second instance is Coriolanus 1.6.10:     The citizens of Corioles have issued,   Here the city-name Corioles, as it is spelled in F1 here and in most instances, seems elsewhere required by the meter to be pronounced sometimes kor-EYE-oh-LES (&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;) and sometimes kor-YOHL-es (&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;˘&nbsp;). For the present line, KOR-ee-YOHLS (&nbsp;/&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;) is tempting but unlikely, since the two pronunciations are already a recipe for audience confusion. My scansion suggestion here is as follows, with the foot in question second:     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘   The cit | izens of | Cori | oles | have issued,   Again syncope (cit&rsquo;zens) offers an obvious way out of the difficulty, but seems unnecessary in the natural rhythmic reading of the line, and likely to impair audience comprehension somewhat.  Should such a foot (&nbsp;˘&nbsp;˘&nbsp;˘&nbsp;) be admitted to the list of possible substitutions in Shakespearean iambic pentameter? And if so, what should we call it? Tri-pyrrhic?  P.S.: I see already a better scansion solution for the Coriolanus line, with secondary accent on -zens and an anapestic substitution at the third foot:     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘   The cit | izens | of Cori | oles | have issued,   The Titus line still stands as an example, though as noted maybe of Peele rather than of Shakespeare. I have added an English Renaissance Theater tag accordingly, though without deleting Shakespeare. I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for further bona fide Shakespeare examples. "
249,Three Musketeers - the diamond studs,"The plot of the first part of The Three Musketeers revolves around 12 diamond studs that Queen Anne d'Autriche gives to the Duke of Buckingham.  What exactly were those studs? I mean, what was this object of jewellery? How were they to be worn? "
250,What led Tolstoy to depict that a person would have a change of heart after throwing themselves under a train?,"After having read a few different works by Tolstoy, I have come to the conclusion that his main goal is to accurately depict what goes through a person's mind in various situations.  One of the most vivid memories I have from reading Anna Karenina is the fact that when Anna throws herself under the train, she has an immediate change of heart (i.e. she doesn't want to die), but there's no time for her to change her decision and the train kills her.  That always struck me as both 1) non-obvious and 2) making a lot of sense.  And my reaction seemed to be confirmed when I read a 2003 New Yorker article on people who attempt suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge that says ""Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before."", and ""“I instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable was totally fixable—except for having just jumped.”""  How did Tolstoy know or predict that Anna would immediately regret her decision?  Had he spoken with people who had attempted suicide?  Here's the relevant paragraph:     She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment. She had to wait for the next carriage. A feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed herself. That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys. But she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage. And exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once, dropped on to her knees. And at the same instant she was terror-stricken at what she was doing. “Where am I? What am I doing? What for?” She tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back. “Lord, forgive me all!” she said, feeling it impossible to struggle. A peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her. And the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her all that had been in darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was quenched forever.

252,Short story about a condemned organ,"Well over 50 years ago I read a short story about an organ in a building (church or music hall?) which I believe had been slated for demolition.

Does anyone know the title of this short story and the name of the author? "

254,How was Crime and Punishment originally published?,"I know that Crime and Punishment was originally published in ""The Russian Messenger"". I read that it was a Monthly journal.

Or did they release Part One in one journal release? I also don't really know how The Russian Messenger was formatted in general. "
255,Why did New Historicims and Cultural Materialism develop such an intense interest in Shakespeare and his contemporaries?,"In the 1980s and 1990s, New Historicism and Cultural Materialism were two related and very influential schools of literary theory. Below are a few influential titles:   Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries by Jonathan Dollimore (first edition, 1984), Political Shakespeare: New Essays in Cultural Materialism, edited by Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield (1985), Alternative Shakespeares, edited by John Drakakis (first edition, 1985), The Subject of Tragedy: Identity and Difference in Renaissance Drama by Catherine Belsey (1985), Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare by Stephen Greenblatt (1983), Shakespearean Negotiations: The Circulation of Social Energy in Renaissance England by Stephen Greenblatt (1989), Learning to Curse: Essays in Early Modern Culture by Stephen Greenblatt (1990).   Of course, all schools of literary theory have studies Shakespeare and his contemporaries, but New Historicism and Cultural Materialism seemed to intensify this interest. Is this impression correct? If yes, why was this? "
256,"Sentence structure of a stanza in ""Ozymandias""—how the grammar works?","   Tell that its sculptor well those passions read   Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,   The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.   I do get that it says that the one who made the statue did a really good job of bringing the haughty Pharaoh's emotions to life; that a subordinate clause promptly follows (starting with a 'which') the subject of which are these ""passions"" again; and that the next line brings the focus back to the sculptor and reverses the power dynamics, describing the sculptor instead as the one who literally plays with these ""passions"" and in whose hands the preservation of the Pharaoh's memory and legacy solely lies.  What I don't get is the structure in the last bit.   Is the last line just an extension of the adjective phrase (""stamped on those [..]"") in the second line? If that is indeed the case, shouldn't there be a ""by"" in middle? ""stamped on these lifeless things by the hand that [...]""? It'll be a case of omission then. But what for? Merely for the sake of brevity? For added effect? Or for more impact?  Or is it developing the ""sculptor"" clause at the beginning further, as in the sculptor consists of ""the hand that mocked [...]""? "
257,Whitman's idea of democracy,"There are two lines which disturbs me a little on One's self I sing from Whitman. It reads:     One's self I sing, a simple separate person,       Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.   Does it mean that behind democracy is an En-Masse behaviour? So, he sings to a person with no face, not to a real person but to an abstract one (indeed an average one). Am I wrong? "
258,"Do authors ever think about the literary devices going into their work, including any political allegories?","I'm a Judy Blume fan, and I found this article on TV Tropes. I noticed that they listed a lot of common themes and patterns. Are authors aware of these things when they first write their stories, or is it usually done subconsciously, leaving it up to analysts to interpret them? "
259,What was the point of the job-switching lottery?,"One peculiar thing about the City (in the first two parts of the novel, at least) is that everyone must switch their jobs every once in a while, the job being chosen by a machine based in the person's previous record. The punishment for refusing to change jobs or evading them is being sent to labout on the marshes (as explained by Wan who's had experience with this). As an aside, the mayor seemed to remain the mayor (seemed to me) while other characters changed jobs.  A few questions here: what purpose does this system serve? Is it a part of the Experiment, or something made up by the government? How is it related to the real situation in USSR as it was during Strugatskys' time? "
260,How can readers ascertain that they have identified the author's intent?,"We currently have several questions about auhorial-intent, for example,   How much weight is given to authors' intentions in literary analysis? and  How much weight should we give authors' declarations of their intent after the fact?.   Some of these questions assume that statements by the author about his or her intentions are available. However, for most of the history of literature, I think such statements are not available. (The examples in the other questions are about 20th- or 21st-century literature, though older examples can probably be found elsewhere.)  When all an author has left behind are his literary works, and we have no letters, diaries or other sources of contemporary statements about his or her own works, how can a reader ascertain that he or she has identified the author's intent? "
261,"Meaning of ""We make the wise distinction still, soever made in vain"" in a poem by Dickinson","A poem by Emily Dickinson:     We send the Wave to find the Wave—   An Errand so divine,   The Messenger enamored too,   Forgetting to return,   We make the wise distinction still,   Soever made in vain,   The sagest time to dam the sea is when the sea is gone—      What is the meaning of ""We make the wise distinction still""? What is ""distinction"" here? I can't grasp the basic meaning - I don't need a complex interpretation, just the basic meaning.   Basically, I understand it thus:    We send the wave to find the wave.    Okay, ""we make a wave and we are sitting and waiting till it hits another wave and returns"".    An errand so divine.    Okay, let it be divine. Maybe by ""wave"" the author means some spiritual effort, an effort to understand some other person. Hence, a divine errand. It's hazy, but I get the general feeling.    The messenger enamored too.    The wave is enamored? It's getting hazier. The wave fell in love with another wave (another person?).    Forgetting to return.    It fell in love and forgot to return. Okay.    We make the wise distinction still.    What? Here I crush into a concrete wall. I don't understand this line at all. We sent our wave, it fell in love and forgot to return. But what is ""distinction"" and how does one ""make a distinction""?    Soever made in vain.   I understand that this relates to ""distinction"" but that does not help my understanding. ""This distinction is always made in vain; there is always no use of this distinction"" - but what is ""distinction""? Distinguishing two waves between each other? But we did not see our target wave, and the wave we sent got lost.    The sagest time to dam the sea is when the sea is gone —   Apparently the sea consisted of only two waves. And now that our wave got lost and the first wave was not even seen by us, the sea is gone and we can put a dam on the dry surface.    Maybe there is a plain English explanation of this poem somewhere. I googled but found literary criticism, which does not help. I need at least to grasp the basic meaning.    "
262,What is the function of comedy for Frye?,I have come across this quote from Northrop Frye:     the social judgment against the absurd is closer to the comic norm than the moral judgment against the wicked.   What is meant by it? Can anyone explain it to a non-expert?  
263,Savantism by Whitman,"The poem   I'm trying to understand the following poem by Whitman, called Savantism.     THITHER, as I look, I see each result and glory retracing itself and    nestling close, always obligated;       Thither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,    establishments, even the most minute;       Thither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;       Thither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,       As a father, to his father going, takes his children along with him.   As I'm not a native speaker it is quite difficult, but I have understood almost all the other poems. Going through the web  found that it's not clear what it mean even for native speakers. Of course, there is not necessarily one interpretation.  My attempt   I'm quite puzzled in this case but in the first line, I suppose he means it's better to set glory apart. Then he enumerates more things but I can't see the relation with savantism.   Any help to understand it? I am not asking for a complete explanation, just some help. "
264,"What is the source of Herb Caen's ""I have a memory like an elephant.""?","I found the following quote, attributed to author Herb Caen.     I have a memory like an elephant. I remember every elephant I've ever met.   However, my efforts to identify the source of this quote via Google has come up empty. The search results push me toward quote collections that attribute this quote to him without citation.  Interestingly, Wikiquote does not attribute this quote to him.  Is there a publication or book citation for this quote? Barring that, an interview or biographical article which provides conversational context for when he made this statement? "
265,"In Margeret Atwood's ""Hag-Seed,"" where is Caliban?","Margeret Atwood's Hag-Seed is a metafictional retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Many elements of The Tempest are clearly recognizable (e.g. Felix is very obviously Prospero), while others have interesting twists (e.g. Felix's daughter is a combination of Miranda and Ariel -- and there are other characters who echo Miranda and Ariel as well).  But one iconic character seems to be missing. Where is Caliban?  There's no clear reference to a Caliban character (as we have with Felix/Prospero, Tony/Antonio, Lonny/Lorenzo...). Nor is there any character who seems to take on Caliban's narrative role (e.g., attempting to undermine Felix, threatening something dear to him) or any of his thematic elements (e.g. being warped and misshapen; being mistreated by Felix).  One could argue that the book simply isn't focused on that facet of the story (as, indeed, the book is focused on some elements of The Tempest and not others), but the book's very title is Hag-Seed, a direct reference to Caliban. This seems to suggest that elements of Caliban should be central to the story --   -- and if so, what and where are they? "
266,Earliest work of fiction in which characters using telepathy can't lie,"In Liu Cixin's novel The Three-Body Problem (2006/2008),  the inhabitants of the planet Trisolaris communicate with each other using telepathy and are unable to lie. In Ursula Le Guin's novel The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), Genly Ai is capable of ""mindspeech"" (essentially telepathy) and says it is impossible to lie when using mindspeech.  The term telepathy dates from the late 19th century, although similar concepts in other cultures may predate the coinage of the word (see e.g. ishin-denshin, which is also perceived as a sincere form of communication [*]).  Characters who don't lie can also be found in fiction. For example, Yudhisthira, a character from the Mahabharata, is said to a unable to lie, but this has nothing to do with telepathy.  So my question is: What is the earliest work of literature in which a character (or several) is capable of telepathy and is unable to lie using that form of communication? (Silent forms of prayer to a divine or semi-divine being are outside the scope of this question.)  Note: [*] It would probably inaccurate to translate ""ishin-denshin"" as ""telepathy"", though. There is only a vague similarity in that it is an unspoken form of communication. "
267,What are the origins of the claim that Lewis Carroll was on drugs (or writing about drugs) when he wrote Alice in Wonderland?,"There is a claim that Lewis Carroll was on drugs of some sort when he wrote Alice in Wonderland (or that the book is about drug use). Regardless of the truth (or lack thereof) of these claims, what are the origins of these claims? Can they be traced back to any specific individual(s) or time period? "
268,"Looking for an old O. Henry story about a wealthy young man trying to woo a ""genteel poor"" young lady in New York City","I'm trying to pin down a certain short story by O. Henry. I remember the plot quite well, but not the title, nor which book collection of O. Henry's stories I first encountered it within. And let's face it: That man (otherwise known as William Sydney Porter) wrote a huge number of short stories.   A little Googling failed to turn it up when I searched for words and phrases I thought I remembered. And when I looked for a collection of online summaries of O. Henry's works, I failed to find this one. For instance, it is not one of the stories summarized here or here.   What I remember about the characters and plot:   As the story begins, a young man is speaking to a young lady. It appears that they have known each other all their lives, and in recent years he has been thinking that he is love with her. Now he is begging her to marry him. (It may not have been the first time.) She seems fond of him, but for some reason or other she has turned him down. I got the impression that she was highly sensitive about the fact that his family was wealthy and hers was poor, which he may have been so foolish as to mention as a good reason for her to marry him. The girl's family's ""genteel poverty"" may have been a fairly recent change in their circumstances, however, since I think the two families lived near one another in a ""good part of town."" (Implicitly she resided in a large house which her family had owned, free and clear, for a long time, or so I gathered.)  She even goes so far as to say that she is going to return all his gifts. He blinks, and claims she has never done him the honor of accepting any of the gifts he has tried to give her. (Implicitly: Within the last few years, after he started getting really interested in her in romantic terms.) She gently but firmly sets him straight on that point. Evidently he has forgotten that once upon a time, when she was just a little girl (4? 6? Something like that?), and he was a few years older, he gave her a toy bear (I think) which was hollow and filled with candy. She ate the candy, but she still has the bear, and will return it to him as soon as possible as a sign that she doesn't want to receive any other gifts from him.  After this highly unsatisfactory conversation, this young man goes walking through a park (Central Park?). He sees another young couple sitting side by side on a park bench, and he somehow learns or deduces that they have nowhere else to spend the night, and it promises to be a fairly cold night. (Not actually snowing, if memory serves, but bound to be uncomfortable for people spending all the hours of darkness outdoors.)  The two young gentlemen confer, and the stranger in town says that he and the young lady are eloping. I think they were from ""old Southern families""; I forget how they ended up here (in what I'm almost sure is New York City, where so many of O. Henry's tales were set). They have little or no money at the moment, and no friends or relatives in this city who would put them up for the night, and they can't get properly married until tomorrow morning. Of course it would never do for them to share sleeping quarters inside a room somewhere when they were not yet a married couple. The wealthy young gentleman would be happy to lend or give enough funds to let these two lovebirds each have a separate hotel room, but soon realizes that their Southern pride won't allow them to accept such charity from a total stranger. After chewing on the problem, he does suggest a compromise which would not require any money to change hands. He assures the Southern gentleman that he, the wealthy young man, is very well-acquainted with a young lady of impeccable moral fiber who would be happy to share her accommodations with another well-bred young lady (the Southern girl). The Southern gentleman is, of course, welcome to sit on the park bench all night if he feels the honorable obligation to do it that way, but wouldn't it be nice for his young lady to protect her health by finding shelter with another young lady? This suggestion is finally accepted. At the end of the story, the wealthy young gentleman receives that toy bear back (by messenger, I believe), and there is something inside it -- or accompanying it -- to strongly suggest (in some symbolical way which escapes me) that his young lady has decided the time is right for them to get married after all, now that he's somehow ""proved"" something-or-other about himself.     Does anyone recognize this story? If I went digging around in all the online e-texts I could find that collect material by O. Henry, I might eventually unearth it, but I'm hoping that this approach will be much faster. (Since my Googling efforts didn't work.) "
269,Is there any textual evidence to support that Dumbledore was gay?,"JK Rowling announced in 2007 to an audience at Carnegie Hall that Albus Dumbledore was in fact, gay and always had been...      Q: Did Dumbledore, who believed in the prevailing power of love, ever fall in love himself?      JKR: My truthful answer to you... I always thought of Dumbledore as gay. [ovation.] ... Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald, and that that added to his horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was. To an extent, do we say it excused Dumbledore a little more because falling in love can blind us to an extent? But, he met someone as brilliant as he was, and rather like Bellatrix he was very drawn to this brilliant person, and horribly, terribly let down by him. Yeah, that's how I always saw Dumbledore. In fact, recently I was in a script read through for the sixth film, and they had Dumbledore saying a line to Harry early in the script saying I knew a girl once, whose hair... [laughter]. I had to write a little note in the margin and slide it along to the scriptwriter, ""Dumbledore's gay!"" [laughter] ""If I'd known it would make you so happy, I would have announced it years ago!""   Was there ever any textual evidence in the Harry Potter novels that would have led a reader, especially the target readers, to believe this was the case? "
270,What did George Orwell think of the USSR before travelling to Spain?,"George Orwell volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War. After being wounded on the front line, he went to Barcelona and was caught up in the suppression of the POUM militia by the Spanish Communists. This incident soured him on the USSR and communism for the rest of his life. It led him to write Homage to Catalonia, a denunciation of Soviet propaganda and influence in Spain, and ultimately 1984, a book-length nightmare of the totalitarian future.  Before Orwell travelled to Spain in 1937, what was his opinion of the Soviet Union? Was he always against it? Was he ever for it? "
271,What is the significance of the portraits in Slade House?,"This question contains spoilers for David Mitchell's Slade House.  In the first three chapters, the narrator will at some point ascend the stairs in Slade House and walk past a bunch of portraits. These seem to be very accurate portraits of the previous victims of the Grayer twins as they looked at the time of their death, in chronological order. The last portrait in the line depicts the narrator themselves, but without eyes (whereas the other portraits all seem to have eyes). As far as I remember, the portraits themselves are never mentioned explicitly by either the twins or Marinus in the book (the only people from whom we could expect an explanation).  It's been a while since I read The Bone Clocks, but I seem to remember that the Blind Cathar is also a painting without eyes. This doesn't seem like a coincidence, but I'm not sure what to make of it.  So what is the significance of the portraits? Is it just the twins showing off? Is it some sort of manifestation of the previous victims that they can't control, much like the ""ghosts"" of the hairdresser and of Gordon that show up? They don't seem to be a necessary component of the orison, since Freya doesn't see any portraits in The Fox and Hounds. Why don't the portraits have eyes until the victim is killed?  I suspect that a complete answer might have to draw upon the mythology established in The Bone Clocks, unless I'm missing something obvious in Slade House. "
272,What did O'Brien mean when he said this at the end of 1984?,"   The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.      Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all   caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the   presence of the telescreen.      'They've got you too!' he cried.      'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful   irony.   The above is a quote from the end of 1984, with added emphasis. O'Brien posed as a member of the resistance to entrap Winston, who was trying to end the domination of the Party.  What does the part in bold mean? He said it regretfully; is it possible that at one time he was a dissident and got caught, just as Winston has? "
273,Why did Dr Azad pay for Chanu's ticket to India?,"   ""Dr. Azad,"" she said. ""Why did you give my husband that money?""      The end of his nose was pitted with age, his cheeks had given way to jowls, pockets of air puffed the skin around his eyes, when he smiled the corners of his mouth turned down, and it was a big, generous smile.       ""It's very simple. Because he is my friend. My very good friend.""   In the book Brick Lane, Chanu and Dr Azad have a somewhat strange relationship. The upshot seems to be that they like to needle each other, so keep seeing each other.  So why does Dr Azad give him all that money to go back to Bangladesh? We see their relationship from Nazneen's perspective. Is it possible she didn't understand it, or misrepresented it? "
274,Why did Tolkien publish as J.R.R. Tolkien?,"Quite a number of authors of English literature around the early 20th century published with initialed pen names (EM Forster, JRR Tolkien, TS Eliot, ...) whereas others did not (Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Joseph Conrad, ...), and I was curious as to what might lead an author to use initials for their given names.  To ask a concrete question, why did JRR Tolkien publish as such, as opposed to something like ""Ronald Tolkien"" or ""J. Ronald Tolkien"" since it seems he  went by Ronald?  Is there any record for why Tolkien chose (or was convinced) to use this?  (If you happen to know why other authors around this time period chose to use initials, I'd be happy hear about this also--the only case I know about is the recent case of JK Rowling.) "
275,What is the greater meaning of the thrush?,"In 1984, Orwell devotes a few lines to a singing thrush that lands several feet away from Julia and Winston during their first secret meeting.      A thrush had alighted on a bough not  five metres away, almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its wings,  fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated.  The music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness?    ...     But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that  filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt.   What's the purpose of such a detailed description? Personally, I've always thought that the thrush has had a greater symbolic meaning in the novel because its beautiful singing serves as a sharp contrast to the harshness of Oceanian society. Is there greater meaning in this passage that I'm missing? "
276,Are the comic elements of Conrad's The Secret Agent intentional?,"Conrad's novel The Secret Agent is a critique of the way authoritarian tendencies react to the perceived threat of terrorism. The story it tells is, in most respects, extremely bleak. There are, however, a number of flashes of dark humour. Examples include:   The pathetic nature of the majority of the anarchists, contrasted with their firey words and attitudes. The actually dangerous nature of The Professor, contrasted with his feeble appearance. That the cell of ""dangerous"" anarchists is lead by a double-agent. The police constable seeking approval for his grisly work shoveling human remains while his superious look on, appalled.   This black comedy seems incongruous to the overall tone of the novel.   Is it deliberate on the part of the author?   What purpose does it serve in highlighting the novels themes? "
277,Was pretending to be an abridgement of a made-up work invented by William Goldman?,"William Goldman's The Princess Bride is famous (among other reasons) for a literary device it employs - it pretends to be an abridgment (or ""the good parts version"") of a longer work by S. Morgenstern, and Goldman's ""commentary"" asides are constant throughout.  Of course, Morgenstern and his book do not exist.  Was pretending to be an abridgement of a made-up work invented by William Goldman as a literary device for published literature? If not, where did it originate and what is its history? "
278,Is there any animal internal monologue in The Lord of the Rings?,"Does Tolkien ever include any internal monologue from the perspective of an animal? That is to say, a scene where he shows an animal talking to itself inside of its own head? "
279,"Has the phrase ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" ever truly appeared in a Sherlock Holmes book?","A famous phrase attributed to Sherlock Holmes is ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" or ""Elementary, dear Watson""  Has this phrase ever occurred in a Sherlock Holmes book?   If yes, in which novel or story does it exist?  If no, then have there been any closely related or similar phrases at all?   "
280,"What sources influenced Byron's ""Fragment of a Novel""?","Lord Byron's ""Fragment of a Novel"" is an unfinished story about a vampire. (It's not clear from the story that the man is a vampire, but at least according to this site, Byron said that the man would have arisen from the dead to feed on the upper class.)  What sources influenced Byron's writing? Wikipedia and the site I mentioned above quote Byron mentioning a story recorded by Honest Tournefort, who apparently recorded some vampire folklore. Are there any known sources that Byron used for his story other than folklore and his own imagination? Byron's story and John Polidori's novella based on it, The Vampyre, don't seem to have much in common with the vampire folklore I have heard about. Was Byron influenced by any previous fiction? "
281,How does Room 101 reset for each person who enters?,"It's known in 1984 that Room 101 contains your worst fears; it's the ultimate torture/emotional breakdown technique. However, assuming each prisoner has a different fear, Room 101 would have to continuously be modified specifically for each new prisoner.  How does the Party get around this?  In the novel it seems that a few people each day are sent to Room 101 (that could be a false recollection, though). I doubt the room could be redone that quickly.   Are there several Room 101s?   Is there a whole group of people working on remodeling the room for each new prisoner? "
282,Does an answer to the Sugar Bowl mystery exist?,"In the later books in The Series of Unfortunate Events, the sugar bowl becomes a cryptic macguffin -- everybody's after it, everybody mentions how important it is, but nobody explains why. There are implications that the sugar bowl would destroy Count Olaf, or exonerate Lemony Snicket, or both.  The plot proceeds, and the sugar bowl is fought over, and at very last it is hidden away in a safe location, albeit under tragic circumstances -- but, very pointedly, we never get to see what is inside.  This is strongly in line with the series' themes of uncertainty, complexity, and never being able to act with complete information. It makes perfect sense that there is no answer; that Handler didn't come up with an answer to ""what is the sugar bowl really"" because that would be 100% beside the point of the series.  At the same time, Handler builds it up so evocatively, puts such tremendous weight upon it and seems to sprinkle the series with oblique clues and references, that there might be an answer to be found. Even if the books don't actually give us enough information to puzzle it out, there might still be an answer that Handler has come up with, and is, at least, consistent with what we know.  Does an answer exist? Has anyone made a strong, plausible claim to uncovering it? Has Handler gone on the record anywhere, saying there is or isn't a solution?  I'm less interested in what the answer is (although, sure, that too); what I'm interested in is whether an answer exists at all. "
283,"Is there any evidence of who assaulted Lola in ""Atonement"", given the final reveal?","Content Note: Discussion of the sexual assault of a minor, and ""evidence"" of the innocence or guilt of possible suspects.    Atonement revolves around Briony, who as a child is the only witness to Lola being raped. Briony doesn't get a look at the rapist, but she's convinced it was poor neighbor Robbie - and testifies as much to the police. Meanwhile, the book clearly implies the true rapist is Paul Marshall, the chocolate manufacturer who Lola later, achingly, marries.  But by the end of the book, we learn that we are not reading a neutral narration of the events -- the entire book is revealed to be written by Briony, out of her guilt over accusing Robbie. And an unreliable one as well; she says how she's made changes and touches and written it from memory at best.  It's all very tragic -- except now we need to reassess everything we thought we knew about the actual incident.   The signs we thought were a clear implication of Marshall - scratches on his arm, lavishing attention on Lola - are no longer subtle authorial hints; they're tiny shreds of unreliable evidence that don't make sense for Briony to have remembered with any measure of certainty. The signs we saw of Robbie's affability - e.g. the justification of clumsiness for sending Briony's sister a lewd letter - are now entirely fabricated.   As far as I can tell, this casts the story in a rather different light. While Briony has undoubtedly done Robbie wrong by perjuring herself, the book's assumption that Robbie is innocent and Marshall is guilty doesn't seem to have any concrete support. Unless I've missed something?  Is there any reliable evidence that Briony was actually witness to, as to who the rapist was? "
284,To what effect does Goldman claim The Princess Bride is an abridgement?,"This question was inspired by this question, which asks about the history of one work claiming itself as an adaptation or abridgment of another. In The Princess Bride by William Goldman, the author claims that it is an abridgment of a work by the non-existent S. Morgenstern. Why does he do this? What effect does it have on the understanding of the work? "
285,Did magic realism begin in literature?,"Was magic realism started with literature or was it created in other arts before literature? For example,  One Hundred Years of Solitude is a magic realistic book.  Was One Hundred Years of Solitude the first to use this trope? If not what book was then?  EDIT:  by magic realism I mean the literary genre that incorporates fantastic or mystical elements into otherwise realistic fiction. "
286,Why has the final book for The Kingkiller Chronicle taken so long?,"The penultimate book of the Kingkiller Chronicle trilogy was released in March 2011.  It has been nearly six years and the final book still has no expected release date.    Has Patrick Rothfuss gone on record anywhere about why the last book is taking so long to finish?    If so, what reasons has he provided? "
287,"Meaning of ""to risk, in turn, a woman's paradox""","From Aurora Leigh:     To have our books   Appraised by love, associated with love,   While we sit loveless! is it hard, you think?   At least 'tis mournful. Fame, indeed, 'twas said,   Means simply love. It was a man said that.   And then there's love and love: the love of all   (To risk, in turn, a woman's paradox,)   Is but a small thing to the love of one.   You bid a hungry child be satisfied   With a heritage of many corn-fields: nay,   He says he's hungry,–he would rather have   That little barley-cake you keep from him   While reckoning up his harvests. So with us;   (Here, Romney, too, we fail to generalise!)   We're hungry.      I wonder what the meaning of the phrase in bold could be. It must be an allusion to some paradox or some story, or some saying, mustn't it?   "
288,What makes a poem a Grook?,"I recently learned, while listening to the flow of wisdom, music, and monologue that flows from lauir, that there's a type of poem called a 'Grook'. Quoting from the Wikipedia page:     The grooks are multi-faceted and characterized by irony, paradox, brevity, precise use of language, rhythm and rhyme, and an often satiric nature.   But... this doesn't help much. What does it mean by 'precise use of language'? Or 'rhythm and rhyme'?  What defines a 'Grook'? Is there a set of rules that will define a poem as a 'Grook'? "
289,"Meaning of ""and beauty keeps itself still uppermost"" (Aurora Leigh by Liz Browning)","From Aurora Leigh:      Until at last, as one, whose heart being sad   On hearing lovely music, suddenly   Dissolves in weeping, I brake out in tears   Before her . . asked her counsel . . 'had I erred   'In being too happy? would she set me straight?   'For she, being wise and good and born above   'The flats I had never climbed from, could perceive   'If such as I, might grow upon the hills;   'And whether such poor herb sufficed to grow,   'For Romney Leigh to break his fast upon't,–   'Or would he pine on such, or haply starve?'   She wrapt me in her generous arms at once,   And let me dream a moment how it feels   To have a real mother, like some girls:   But when I looked, her face was younger . . ay,   Youth's too bright not to be a little hard,   And beauty keeps itself still uppermost,   That's true!–Though Lady Waldemar was kind,   She hurt me, hurt, as if the morning-sun   Should smite us on the eyelids when we sleep,   And wake us up with headache.      As I understand it, ""A young person is too intelligent, and thus is a little cruel"". But what is the meaning of the next line, ""and beauty keeps itself still uppermost""?  "
290,Why all the fuss about Doctor Dubble L. Dee?,"In Poe's short story ""Three Sundays in a Week"" (which can be read in full here), the protagonist and his intended bride need to outwit his uncle, who has decreed that they can only get married ""when three Sundays come together in a week"". They achieve their goal by arranging a conversation with two sea captains who have crossed the International Date Line in opposite directions.  So far, so understandable. What puzzles me is the constant references to one ""Doctor Dubble L. Dee"". The uncle refers to this gentleman in almost every sentence, but is interrupted by one of the others before he can finish saying anything about him. For example:     UNCLE. ""Yes, yes, yes--I remember it very well--very queer indeed! Both of you gone just one year. A very strange coincidence, indeed! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would denominate an extraordinary concurrence of events. Doctor Dub--""      KATE. [Interrupting.] ""To be sure, papa, it is something strange; but then Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton didn't go altogether the same route, and that makes a difference, you know.""      UNCLE. ""I don't know any such thing, you huzzy! How should I? I think it only makes the matter more remarkable, Doctor Dubble L. Dee--""      KATE. Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn, and Captain Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.""      UNCLE. ""Precisely!--the one went east and the other went west, you jade, and they both have gone quite round the world. By the by, Doctor Dubble L. Dee--""   What does Dubble L. Dee signify? Why does the uncle keep mentioning him, and why do the others keep interrupting every time he does? Does LLD stand for something relevant? "
291,"Meaning of ""He says it still of truth, which is his own"" (in ""Aurora Leigh"")","From Aurora Leigh:     The book has some truth in it, I believe:   And truth outlives pain, as the soul does life.   I know we talk our Phædons to the end   Through all the dismal faces that we make,   O'er-wrinkled with dishonouring agony   From any mortal drug. I have written truth,   And I a woman; feebly, partially,   Inaptly in presentation, Romney'll add,   Because a woman. For the truth itself,   That's neither man's nor woman's, but just God's;   None else has reason to be proud of truth:   Himself will see it sifted, disenthralled,   And kept upon the height and in the light,   As far as, and no farther, than 'tis truth;   For, – now He has left off calling firmaments   And strata, flowers and creatures, very good,–   He says it still of truth, which is His own.     What is the meaning of this last sentence?   God has named all the things in the world (""left off calling ...""). This work of his is done. Now God ""says it"". What is ""it"" here? I can't even begin to untangle this sentence..  "
292,"Meaning of ""that all the towns make offal of their daughters for its use on summer-nights""","From Aurora Leigh:      Thus is Art   Self-magnified in magnifying a truth   Which, fully recognized, would change the world   And shift its morals. If a man could feel,   Not one day, in the artist's ecstasy,   But every day, feast, fast, or working-day,   The spiritual significance burn through   The hieroglyphic of material shows,   Henceforward he would paint the globe with wings,   And reverence fish and fowl, the bull, the tree,   And even his very body as a man,–   Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns   Make offal of their daughters for its use   On summer-nights, when God is sad in heaven   To think what goes on in his recreant world   He made quite other; while that moon he made   To shine there, at the first love's covenant,   Shines still, convictive as a marriage-ring   Before adulterous eyes.     Man believes that his body is vile. Because of that, citizens of towns kill women and turn them into offal? Something gruesome and totally cryptic. And whose is its use? I cannot understand.   What is the author trying to describe?   "
293,"Meaning of ""who bespoke our place so far in the east""","From Aurora Leigh:        So it is:   We covet for the soul, the body's part,   To die and rot. Even so, Aurora, ends   Our aspiration, who bespoke our place   So far in the east.   What is the meaning of ""who bespoke our place so far in the east""? What possibly could it mean?   As an aside, is there a good version of ""Aurora Leigh"" online with a parallel translation into plain English, i.e. with comments and annotations? It's well-nigh impossible to understand a good third of the poem.     "
294,"Meaning of ""not conclude at yours""","From Aurora Leigh:     Have you learnt    No more of women, 'spite of privilege,   Than still to take account too seriously   Of such weak flutterings? Why, we like it, sir,–   We get our powers and our effects that way.   The trees stand stiff and still at time of frost,   If no wind tears them; but, let summer come,   When trees are happy,–and a breath avails   To set them trembling through a million leaves   In luxury of emotion. Something less   It takes to move a woman: let her start   And shake at pleasure,–nor conclude at yours,   The winter's bitter,–but the summer's green.'     What is the meaning of nor conclude at yours?   Let a woman to start (= jerk in surprise) and shake at pleasure (as she pleases). But what is the meaning of ""nor conclude at yours""?   "
295,"Meaning of ""I shut my tongue against my fly""","From Aurora Leigh:     Poor child! I would have mended it with gold,   Until it gleamed like St. Sophia's dome   When all the faithful troop to morning prayer:   But he, he nipped the bud of such a thought   With that cold Leigh look which I fancied once,   And broke in, 'Henceforth she was called his wife.   'His wife required no succour: he was bound   'To Florence, to resume this broken bond:   'Enough so. Both were happy, he and Howe,   'To acquit me of the heaviest charge of all–'   –At which I shut my tongue against my fly   And struck him; 'Would he carry,–he was just,–   'A letter from me to Aurora Leigh,   'And ratify from his authentic mouth   'My answer to her accusation?'–'Yes,   'If such a letter were prepared in time.'   –He's just, your cousin,–ay, abhorrently.       What does this mean? Is it some saying or proverb?    "
296,Where are Greenfield and Silver City in The Boxcar Children?,"I was reading The Boxcar Children to my niece awhile back. At one point, they're walking along a road and run into a fork in a road. The fork has a sign pointing to Silver City and Greenfield. Both are actual places in New Mexico, but they're over 300 miles from each other.  Silver City, NV is a near ghost town at this point,  Greenfield, CA and Silver City, CA are similarly hundreds of miles away (189 miles by the shortest car route).  The baker, who was chasing them, said that he didn't think that they could've made it as far as Silver City, which suggests that they were, in fact, far from each other.  Is the book referring to actual places? If so, where? Where are the books set? "
297,Isn't Ayn Rand a bit irrational in her criticism of altrusim in The Fountainhead?,"In the speech of Howard Roark, or at most places in the book, altruists are shown to be in negative light/evil. But this criticism seems to constructed by deliberately painting such characters as evil. Altruism is not evaluated ideally as egotism is. All is virtuous of egotists and all is evil of altruists.Does this not weaken the philosophy of objectivism as the comparison is not fair?  For example in the speech :     ""Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the sufferings of others. But suffering is a disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to give relief and assistance. To make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life.""   But it is not the suffering that we should treat as highest virtue, but the act of relieving the suffering. Did not the people like Mother Teresa, Gandhi and Mandela held relieving the suffering of others as prime motive of their lives? Did they enslave people or liberate them? So can't these be called altrusits who initiated human progress in their regions by gaining independence for their people?  I completely agree with virtues of egotism mentioned in the book. But I disagree with some of the vices of altruism mentioned. She says that:     The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to it in reality—the man who lives to serve others—is the slave   The ""living for others"" here is meant in a sense in which Peter Keating lives, for other's appreciation to him etc. But this is how the character is pictured in the book. Can't ""living for others"" imply as life of say, Mahatma Gandhi or any ""honest"" social worker? An implication where self-sacrifice means sacrificing one's happiness, personal goals to serve others but similarly not selling one's soul to others. These people rather can be said to have strongest of souls in human history. Are these not the fountainheads of human progress?  Gautam Buddha renunciated everything as a king. His personal happiness was gained through relief of suffering of people, he liberated people. Unlike Toohey who made them dependant. Why can't the character be someone like Buddha rather than Toohey. Hence, is this is not unfair vilification of altruism? This defeats the rationality of her philosophy to some extent.   In this way, isn't the evaluation of altruism seem partial or conveniently alienated in the book? "
298,"Who said ""Poetry is the art of giving different names to the same thing""?","Over on Skeptics, Laurel found some partial information in a quote from Mathematics as a culture clue and other essays:     I once quoted that mot to a poet, and got the quick response:   ""Poetry is the art of giving different names to the same thing.""   Do we know which poet?     The mot was made by mathematician Poincaré: ""Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things."" Follow up: Is poetry the art of giving different names to the same thing? "
299,"Meaning of ""d-n"" in ""'T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,' the English always used to govern d—n""","From Byron's Don Juan:        She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,        And said there was analogy between 'em;   She proved it somehow out of sacred song,        But I must leave the proofs to those who've seen 'em;   But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong        And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,   ""'T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,'   The English always used to govern d—n.""     What is this word? Darn? But what could govern darn possibly mean?  And ""darn"" would not rhyme. Anyway, I'm not a native speaker, so it's doubly hard for me. "
300,Foreshadowing in The Great Gatsby,"   How does the one writer you have studied foreshadow events or ideas to come later in their works, and what is the effect of such foreshadowing?   This was one of the questions which I have been assigned to. I am supposed to answer this question with reference to The Great Gatsby. One of my pointers is this:     Secondly, foreshadowing is also used to allude to us that things are about to turn horribly sour for Gatsby. This literary device was used in chapter 5, during Gatsby’s meeting with Daisy. On the day that Gatsby and Daisy met, it poured heavily. Meanwhile, inside the house, as Gatsby was reclining, “His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position, his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy”. While conversing, “the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place.” Nick also notes that “I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.”      This series of events that occur consecutively cleverly alludes to us what is about to happen to Gatsby. Firstly, the rain that was pouring during the meeting set the tone for future events to come. It alluded to us that although things appeared to be going well for Gatsby, trouble was just outside the door. Next, the defunct clock that Gatsby leaned on as he stared down at Daisy also represented his life as a whole. Gatsby was constantly shown to be living in the past, in the love that he and Daisy once had. That is depicted through the broken clock that represented Gatsby’s life being frozen in time. The clock then begins to tilt, almost crashing to the ground. This warns us that this frozen life of Gatsby’s is about to fall apart. Even when Gatsby attempts to put things back together, as shown through him setting the clock back in its place, his life will ultimately fall apart and he might even lose it. This is foreshadowed through the fact that everyone else still believed for a moment, that the clock had smashed to pieces on the floor.   Initially, I felt like this analysis was a bit too hopeful. Like I was drawing conclusions from an otherwise minor event in the story. I just found it weird that Fitzgerald would have chosen to write that bit about the clock tipping over if it had no special meaning to it. So I felt that I had to analyse it.  Is my analysis here too far fetched? Any advice on how it could be otherwise interpreted? Or whether this event in the story should need analysis at all? "
301,"Meaning of ""Where juries cast up what a wife is worth""?","From Byron's Don Juan:     Happy the nations of the moral North!        Where all is virtue, and the winter season   Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth        ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);   Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,        By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on   The lover, who must pay a handsome price,   Because it is a marketable vice.     Does it mean that in northern countries it was customary to fine an adulterous male?   Or does it imply that an adulterous male had no recourse for his passion except to find a prostitute (but then why ""juries"" - I doubt that the price of a prostitute was ever set by a jury)?  "
302,How do publishers select who has biographies written about them?,"Presumably, in order for there to be a biography of someone, someone else must decide that they're worth writing a biography about.  How is this determination made? I assume that publishers are interested mostly in selecting biographies that are likely to sell well. Some prominent public figures (autobiographies by ex-Presidents, for example, typically make the bestseller list) are obvious candidates, but what about ""lesser-known"" individuals?  Is there a particular standard for how notable or ""interesting"" someone had to be?  It seems a bit arbitrary at times why certain people have biographies written about them and other people don't. For every prominent public figure who has a biography, you could probably find dozens of equally prominent people who don't.  What's the usual process for an author or publisher deciding to write (or publish) a biography on someone? What kinds of things might a publisher consider? What reasons might they give for publishing a biography on a particular individual, and what reasons might they give for not publishing a biography on a different individual? "
303,Is poetry the art of giving different names to the same thing?,"There was a poet who said this:      Poetry is the art of giving different names to the same thing.   They are copied all over the internet. But is this true? In the comments of that post @Randal'Thor and @JoshuaEngel say that this is a poor description of poetry. Why is that?     FYI: - Skeptics: Was there a person made the quote about poetry that Poincaré responded to? - Mathematics: How correct is the quote that ""mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things""? "
304,What is the chronological order of the Tales of Goldstone Wood books?,"The Tales of Goldstone Wood series is notorious for non-chronological writing, and the publication order doesn't at all reflect ""in-universe"" time.  What is the proper chronological order of the books in the series? Is there any reason to read them in publication order (rather than chronological order)? "
305,"Did Anne Elisabeth Stengl ever write a book under a pen name like she announced that she would? If so, what was it?","Anne Elisabeth Stengl announced in January 2017 that she was writing a new series under a pen name, but refused to disclose what the series was or what the pen name would be. The text of the announcement is as follows:     This is the project into which I am currently channeling all my efforts. I have two and a half novels written in the series, and lots more in the works. BUT . . . after much thought and consideration, I have decided to pursue this series under a pen name. It's very different work from Goldstone Wood--much darker and more adult (not dirty. I don't write dirty books). I kind of doubt that most of you loyal imps will take to it.      If you discover this new series on your own and enjoy it, great! But I'm not going to market it here, under this name, and I'm probably not going to let anyone know my new pen name, at least not at first.   The author evidently isn't too dilligent about updating her blog, though. Is there evidence that such a book was published and, if so, what's the book/series? What name was it written under? "
306,Why did Virginia Woolf judge 'Success prompts to exertion; habit facilitates success' a 'man's sentence'?,"From A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf:     ‘Success prompts to exertion; habit facilitates success.’ That is a man's sentence; behind it one can see Johnson, Gibbon and the rest. It was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman’s use. Charlotte Brontë, with all her splendid gift for prose, stumbled and fell with that clumsy weapon in her hands. George Eliot committed atrocities with it that beggar description. Jane Austen looked at it and laughed at it and devised a perfectly natural, shapely sentence proper for her own use and never departed from it.   Why did Woolf judge the bolded sentence to be a ‘man's sentence’? Can’t the red apply to women (or transsexuals) too? "
307,Why was an American diplomat's family considered the best place for the Antichrist?,"In Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, the original master plan (foiled by dumb chance and human incompetence) was that the newly born Antichrist should be brought up in the family of the US Cultural Attaché in Britain.  Why was this considered the best place for the Antichrist to grow up? Is this a subtle dig at American culture by the two (British) authors, implying that the cultural section of a US embassy is where the world's greatest depths of moral depravity are to be found?    (I'm still in the middle of reading the book, so apologies if this is answered later on. But I'm past the point where Crowley and Aziraphale know there was a mix-up, so I suspect we won't be seeing much more of the Dowling family after this.) "
308,Why is a special license needed to get married?,"In a lot of historical romance novels (specifically those set in Regency England), people decide to get married very suddenly a lot of the time. You see this a lot in the marriage of convenience trope, but also in various other flavours of historical romance.  When this happens, they usually either end up running away to Gretna Green (because apparently anyone there can witness/perform marriages, at least in the era historical romances are usually set) or getting a ""special licence"" that allows them to get married very quickly.  What's this special licence? Why is it needed? Is this an actual thing that was required of people of the time, or is it merely a romance novel trope that allows the author to sidestep the actual laws/rules of marriage in that time period? "
309,Rhett Butler's character archetype?,"My question is about ""Gone with the Wind,"" and is actually more about cinema than literature (I haven't read the book), but I think it might also be pertinent here.   How would you call Rhett Butler's character archetype in ""Gone with the Wind""? I don't mean so much his alpha-male, bad-boy or a self-made-man aspect, but him as a character who can successfully operate on both sides of the political divide without caring much for neither. He isn't a go-between, and the ""crafty self-made-man"" does not really capture his free movement between the two sides, his transcendent or dialectical position. Is there a term for a character archetype like him?   ""The player"" would work, but I find it somewhat lacking as it subordinates his position to the divide rather than suggesting how he transcends it. He is no Harlequin. Trickster is a bit too generic "
310,"Why does ""Nighttime Birds"" associate night with warmth?","The lyrics to Nighttime Birds, the title track from the album of the same name by The Gathering, are as follows:     Their ways are open   they spread as their wings   they want to be certain   of a warm surrounding      When they fly   through the night as beautiful   nighttime birds      The warm wind picks them up      When they fly   through the night as beautiful   nighttime birds   I'm particularly interested in the lines ""they want to be certain / of a warm surrounding"" and ""The warm wind picks them up"". Why is this associated with nighttime birds? Typically, you wouldn't associate ""night"" with ""warm winds"" and wanting to be sure of a warm surrounding, but the lyrics are quite specific that they want to be certain of a warm surrounding ""when they fly through the night.""  Or, are they merely seeking warmth in the midst of the night?  A third (rather literal) interpretation is that the song's referring to the fact that migrating birds tend to try to catch warmer ""updrafts"" by opening their wings to ""catch"" it. There are a few birds that are either nocturnal or frequently migrate at night, so I suppose that it's plausible at least that the author was thinking of that.  Is there an authoritative source on which one the author was referring to? Or are there other possibilities that I'm not thinking of? "
311,Why don't modern critics like archetypes?,"According to The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (pg 24), archetypal criticism has had a falling out with modern critics:     More recently, critics have been wary of the reductionism involved in the application of such unverified hypotheses to literary works, and more alert to the cultural differences that the archetypal approach often overlooks in its search for universals.    Unfortunately, the Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms doesn't really elaborate on this, or provide any resources for me to learn more about the topic. But at the same time, it's the Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms, which is a well regarded source, so it seems unlikely (but still possible) for the dictionary's claims to be incorrect.  Is there a specific point when critics began rejecting the archetypal approach? Why exactly does this approach lead to reductionism and/or the overlooking of cultural differences? Is the Oxford Dictionary even correct when it says that modern critics have become wary of archetypal criticism? "
312,How long did accounts of the Sängerkrieg last as purely oral literature?,"The Sängerkrieg, or contest of minstrels, was an event which (supposedly) took place at Wartburg Castle in Germany in the early 13th century. Since its veracity is disputed, I assume there weren't any contemporary written accounts of it, so presumably the story of the Sängerkrieg lasted a long time in purely oral form. My question is: how long, exactly?  In other words, when was the first written version of either 1) the tale of the event itself or 2) the actual songs which were supposedly recited there? I'm especially curious about the latter, to see how long these songs lasted as oral tradition while being linked to a specific event. "
313,Did Heller base his sarcastic swipe at academia on any actual example?,"In chapter 1 of Catch 22, Yossarian describes how he makes a boring task (censoring letters) interesting by erecting ""dynamic intralinear tensions"":     All the officer patients in the ward were forced to censor letters written by all the enlisted-men patients, who were kept in residence in wards of their own. It was a monotonous job, and Yossarian was disappointed to learn that the lives of enlisted men were only slightly more interesting than the lives of officers. After the first day he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony he invented games. Death to all modifiers, he declared one day, and out of every letter that passed through his hands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he made war on articles. He reached a much higher plane of creativity the following day when he blacked out everything in the letters but a, an and the. That erected more dynamic intralinear tensions, he felt, and in just about every case left a message far more universal. Soon he was proscribing parts of salutations and signatures and leaving the text untouched. One time he blacked out all but the salutation ""Dear Mary"" from a letter, and at the bottom he wrote, ""I yearn for you tragically A. T. Tappman, Chaplain, U.S. Army."" A. T. Tappman was the group chaplain's name.   Was Heller having a go at a particular pompous academic or clique? Or, did he invent this strained term? "
314,Accuracy of a translation: how to forge an opinion?,"This question is directly inspired from this one on French Language stack exchange.  To summarize it, the OP is wondering about the good translation for ""chimiste"" in Baudelaire's opening poem Au Lecteur. This poem can also be found here with some translations of it.  I have tried to provide an answer, but, as non specialist, I feel it can be considered as opinion-based.   So, my question here is double:   What to think about this particular case (""chemist"" or ""alchemist"")? And more globally what is the good way to forge an opinion in such a case?   (I've read these questions and answers (1, 2) but I think this is not totally a duplicate of them)    Following the comment of Hamlet, I try here to explain my reasoning about this translation (but my English is poor and saying all this is not self evident... sorry about that).   I think Baudelaire could have chosen the word ""alchemist"" if he though it was the good/appropriated one. But he did not.  Surely there is the alexandrine aspect, and due to that we can not have:     Sur l'oreiller du mal c'est Satan Trismégiste       Qui berce longuement notre esprit enchanté,       Et le riche métal de notre volonté       Est tout vaporisé par ce savant alchimiste (13 syllables).   And we can't either have     Est vaporisé par ce savant alchimiste (because we lose here the two hemistichs)   But (even if less pleasant), it can be:     Est tout vaporisé par ce grand alchimiste (12 = 6 + 6 syllables... even if Trismégiste is already ""three times great""...)   Or any other formulation that surely Baudelaire was able to elaborate.  On another plane, there is the meaning aspect:  The first one is near context ""riche métal"" (""rich metal"") which recalls gold, added to ""enchanté"" (""bewitched"") et ""vaporisé"" (""vaporized"")... which all could tend to alchemy.   The second is the overall poem context: Baudelaire is talking about our human condition, something totally real which is not related to false beliefs (alchemy). And presuming Satan is part of this reality (or simply an allegory), he is surely skilled enough to make usage of a real science.  So, to summarize, my opinion is ""chemist"" is more appropriate. But I'm in hope to find here a more accurate and expert explanation. "
315,"What does ""Rebirth of Slick"" mean when it quotes ""On the Subway""?","Digable Planets' Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like That) (""Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space),"" 1993, track 06, released as a single in 1992) (genius.com link) quotes the ""blink blink"" passages from On the Subway (""The Last Poets,"" 1970, track 02) (genius.com link), but in a radically different context.  What do the ""blink blink/think think"" lines in Rebirth of Slick signify independent of their reference to On the Subway, when taken solely as lines in Digable Planets' own work?  How does Rebirth of Slick's quotation of On the Subway transform the meaning of the quoted text? Are Digable Planets calling attention to some relationship between themselves (or their work) and The Last Poets (or their work)? "
316,"Why don't people in the Chronicles of Narnia have trouble ""transitioning"" back to their old life after extended times in other worlds?","In The Chronicles of Narnia, people often spend weeks, months, or even decades in other worlds. They return to their old life at the exact instant that they left as if they were never gone. For example, the Pevensies spent years (perhaps decades?) in Narnia after the events of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Afterwards, they're transported back to their original lives as schoolchildren and carry on with their ordinary lives. People still treated them the exact same way that they always treated them, oblivious to all of the knowledge, skills, and life experience that they gained while they were in Narnia.  It's strongly implied that being in certain worlds influences your abilities and attitudes to an extent (characters often slowly regain certain skills, such as swordsmanship, over the course of several hours upon returning to Narnia). Even setting that aside, why didn't the characters find that profoundly disturbing? Personally, if I woke up as a 10-year-old again and was expected to carry on living as if I actually was a 10-year-old (returning to elementary school, etc.) and being treated as if I was 10, I'd find that profoundly unsettling and frustrating (not to mention infuriating), so why does this never appear in the books? "
317,"Why did they meet the ""ghost of Caesar"" or go on the ""road to Mandalay"" in ""Long Road out of Eden""?","The lyrics to Long Road out of Eden by the Eagles are as follows:     Moon shinin' down through the palms   Shadows movin' on the sand   Somebody whisperin' the twenty-third psalm   Dusty rifle in his tremblin' hands      Somebody tryin' just to stay alive   He got promises to keep   Over the ocean in America   Far away and fast asleep      Silent stars blinkin' in the blackness of an endless sky   Cold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passin' by   Galaxies unfoldin', new world's bein' born   Pilgrims and prodigals creepin' toward the dawn   And it's a long road out of Eden      Music blastin' from an SUV   On a bright and sunny day   Rollin' down the Interstate   In the good old USA      Havin' lunch at The Petroleum Club   Smokin' fine cigars and swappin' lives   He said, ""Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket   Give me another piece of that pecan pie""      Freeways flickerin', cell phones chimin' a tune   We're ridin' to utopia, road map says we'll be arrivin' soon   Captains of the old order clingin' to the reins   Assurin' us these aches inside are only growin' pains   But it's a long road out of Eden      Back home, I was so certain the path was very clear   But now I have to wonder what are we doin' here'   I'm not countin' on tomorrow and I can't tell wrong from right   But I'd give anythin' to be there in your arms tonight      Weavin' down the American highway   Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk   Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda   Now we're drivin' dazed and drunk      Been down the road to Damascus, the road to Mandalay   Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian Way   He said, ""It's hard to stop this bingein' once you get a taste   But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste""   Behold the bitten apple, the power of the tools   But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools   And it's a long road out of Eden   The Appian Way was a major Roman Road. The Road to Damascus was presumably referring to the Apostle Paul's conversion experience, and presumably the ""bitten apple"" is referring to the fall of Adam and Eve (hence the ""long road out of Eden"").  Was Caesar selected because he represented imperialist empire-building? If so, is this song primarily ""about"" imperialism and war, or is it talking about imperialism more in the context of overall American materialism and ""cultural junk""?  One more factor to consider: the very next song is ""I Dreamed There Was No War."" I highly doubt that this placement was coincidental.  Also, what's the significance of Mandalay? "
318,"What is The Princess Bride's ""reunion scene"" that you had to write to the publisher for?","In The Princess Bride by William Goldman, there is an extended section where the author says that he wanted to include a reunion scene when Buttercup first discovers that the ""man in black"" is in fact her beloved Westley, but his editor didn't want it in. So as a compromise, Goldman tells you to write to his publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and they will send you the ""missing scene"".  Unfortunately, the company no longer exists at the address given. My eBook copy also includes an asterisk after the address that, when followed to the last page, says this:     *I've been writing since Eisenhower's been president and I think this is my first asterisk. I feel giddy. The purpose of this is to announce that time has marched on. If you don't want to wait to read the reunion scene, you no longer have to. Just go to the Internet and log on to www.hmhco.com/princessbride. You'll see it right on your very own computer screen.   As it turns out, that URL goes to a dead link, and Archive.org's only history is an error page.  So what was the ""reunion scene"" that you would get if you wrote to the publisher or visited the website? Was it actually an additional narrative, or was it just an additional joke, such as claiming that the manuscript was lost as the book went to print? "
319,What is the significance of the traveler carrying writing materials in Ivanhoe?,"   The Jew's dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the storm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering a dark purple tunic. He had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his waist, which sustained a small knife, together with a case for writing materials, but no weapon. He wore a high square yellow cap of a peculiar fashion, assigned to his nation to distinguish them from Christians, and which he doffed with great humility at the door of the hall.   Strange but true: this snippet, apparently about a scribe's tools, has been haunting me rather obsessively lately.  I didn't recall that the bearer was the Jew.  I suppose a lender/usurer would want to keep records of his debtors.  Am I missing something else?  Was it particularly rare to be able to write, even among certain strata of the upper class?  Why does he say ""a small knife, but no weapon""?  Is Sir Walter Scott's mention of writing tools here used primarily to distinguish his social class/ his occupation, or perhaps something else?  Am I mistaken in thinking it might have been a little bit odd for a traveler to be carrying a sack full of pens?  (which lacking further descriptive language is what most readers will assume...) "
320,A woman falling at a heave from the moon and the sun,"In A Ted Hughes poem called ""Criminal Ballad"" (of the Crow collection), there's a usage of the word ""heave"" which I can't figure:      ""A woman fell between the ship and the jetty   At a heave from the moon and the sun   Her pleading cries were humbled out""    What does ""at a heave"" means here?   I know that ""heave"" have a meaning in a nautical context, and I also know that a sea can be described as ""heaving"", but what does it have to do with the moon and the sun?  "
321,"When was Shakespeare's The Tempest first analysed from a ""post-colonial"" perspective?","A recent answer from verbose mentioned:     Postcolonial approaches to The Tempest cast Prospero as colonizer, exercising imperial control over the original inhabitants of the island: Caliban and Ariel.   Previously, I'd only been aware of a connection between The Tempest and colonialism via Nalo Hopkinson's short story ""Shift"", which is set in a post-colonial Caribbean but uses characters named Caliban, Ariel, and Sycorax after those in The Tempest. Even after reading and learning about this story, I had not realised that there are post-colonial interpretations of the original Shakespeare play too. I haven't actually studied this play, only read a retelling years ago, but to me this was never an obvious interpretation. So I'm curious about the history of this approach to study of The Tempest.  When was the first ""post-colonial"" analysis of The Tempest, casting Prospero as a coloniser exercising imperial control? What is the history of this interpretation? "
322,"Meaning of a phrase ""showed up on a white charger with a new moon""","There is a fragment of a short story by Louce Baker.     Sladen Morris is the boy next door.   The girls all think he’s fascinating and tend to deify him now that he’s touched six feet on the wall where his mother has been marking his height since he was two. But I keep remembering when he had braces on his teeth and refused to apply a comb to his hair and wouldn’t even wash his face unless forcefully led to the bathroom. You wouldn’t expect me to go weak-kneed over Sladen, and I certainly never expected to, even if he showed up on a white charger with a new moon for me tucked under a red cape.   And I don't understand this phrase ""white charger with a new moon for me tucked under a red cape"". What is meant here as ""a new moon""? Why ""moon"" and why is it ""a new""? "
323,(How) have the interpretations of Macbeth's ending evolved over time?,"I just attended a performance of Macbeth that ended on a much more ambivalent note than Shakespeare's original text. Instead of Malcolm and his posse picking up the shambles and Malcolm motivating his men to look into a brighter future, it actually ended with Macduff crowning Malcolm, surrounded and cheered on by the witches who start to recitate, together with Malcolm even, the ""fair is foul"" rhyme.  This paints a lot darker prospect of the future, if we understand it as Malcolm ultimately becoming (if not already being) a playball for the witches' schemes as well. It then reminded me of the Justin Kurzel adaptation from 2015, which also had a more ambiguous ending that left me wondering a little. But even more so, I rechecked the 1971 Polanski adaptation and it also ended with Donalbain visiting the witches, possibly implying he'll end up falling for their schemes as well.  Now my experience with Macbeth largely comes from cinematic adaptations, but in retrospect on these and reinforced by the performance I just attended, I can't help but notice a trend of having the play end on a much more ambiguous or even pessimistic note than the original text seems to suggest. But maybe it is also just me failing to read the subtext in the play's ending and it already contains more ambivalent undertones that I just missed in the dialogue. These endings do fit not too badly to the rest of the play's overall tone, especially if we take it as a general parable for the corrupting nature of power.  So to condense these ramblings into a hopefully not too broad question, I'd like to know more about the evolution of these interpretations. Are these pessimistic tendencies already present in the original play? If not, when did these more ambiguous intepretations of the ending emerge? Is this a generally exhibited approach to the play nowadays, maybe as a natural extension of its themes and is this trend maybe pointing to a larger difference in how the characters' motivations are seen? Basically, has the understanding of the larger-scale themes of the play maybe changed throughout history? "
324,"Do word replacements in ""A Clockwork Orange"" affect the interpretation of the book as a whole?","Recently, I started reading ""A Clockwork Orange"" in English. A feature of the book that jumped out at me was that a lot of words used by the main character are adapted from Russian.  Since I am a native Russian speaker, I have no trouble understanding the words and so the reading goes smoothly for me. However, it got me thinking: the author probably had a specific purpose in mind, since the words replacements occur frequently and it must have been too much work for this feature to be just a gimmick.  Hence, my questions:   How does reading the book feel for non-Russian speakers? What did Burgess want to tell the reader with this?   An interesting point to note is that in the version of the book translated to Russian, the replaced words are written using the Latin script. "
325,"What is the meaning of this sentence from ""Polaris"" by Lovecraft?","Below is a sentence from Lovecraft's ""Polaris"":     I said to myself, ""This is no dream, for by what means can I prove the greater reality of that other life in the house of stone and brick south of the sinister swamp and the cemetery on the low hillock, where the Pole Star peeps into my north window each night?""   I read this sentence as roughly meaning ""this is not a dream, because I cannot prove its reality"", which kind of doesn't make any  sense. So what does the author really want to convey?  Thanks advance for any help. "
326,"What makes Elizabeth Bennet ""life-like"" in ""Pride and Prejudice""?","This is an essay prompt from my literature class:     ""The women in Jane Austen's novels are more life-like than men"". How far is this comment applicable to Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice?   What makes Elizabeth Bennet ""life-like""? Is she considered more life-like just because she has a definite arc? Because Mr. Darcy also has his moments where he apparently misjudged Jane Bennet as unfit for Mr. Bingley. Is the essay prompt trying to suggest that that usually men in Austen's works are cardboard figures? Or simply that Austen employs better nuances in forming female characters? "
327,Why did Ellsworth Toohey ignore Peter Keating's confession?,"When Elsworth Toohey and Peter Keating were arguing about Cortland and Toohey was trying to force Keating to admit that Howard Roark had designed the whole thing, they had the following exchange:     ""It's worse... what you're doing... it's much worse..""   ""Than what?""   ""Than what I did to Lucius Heyer.""   ""What did you do to Lucius Heyer?""   ""I killed him.""   ""What are you talking about?""   ""That's why it was better. Because I let him die.""   ""Stop raving.""   ""Why do you want to kill Howard?""   ""I don't want to kill him. I want him in jail...""   Toohey never pressed for details on what he meant by that. What actually happened is that Peter went to Heyer's house to try to talk him into retiring so that he could be made a partner. Their argument caused Heyer so much stress that he ended up having another stroke and dying. Peter realized that, at some level, he had subconsciously wanted that to happen.  Why didn't Toohey press for details or do anything about that? Granted, under his sympathetic facade Toohey was an uncaring jerk who was just after power, but still... why did he just leave it at that? Was he being an uncaring jerk here, or did he think that Peter was just raving and not take his confession seriously? "
328,Origin of symbolic interpretation of Prospero's breaking of his staff?,"At the end of The Tempest, which is generally believed to be the last plays that Shakesepare wrote alone, Prospero breaks his staff and drowns his book. This has often been read as Shakespeare telling us that he will stop writing plays. (Random online examples: Big Magic in The New Yorker, March 2010; René Girard’s Shakespeare; Logan, Forbidden Planet, and The Tempest.)  This has always seemed a projection of biographically oriented readers who ignored or did know about Shakespeare's collaborative works, both before and after The Tempest. After 1611, Shakespeare co-authored Henry VIII, The Two Noble Kinsmen and possibly the lost Cardenio. Collaborative play-writing was very normal in Shakespeare's times, as can be seen from the examples of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, William Rowley and Thomas Dekker.  So what is the origin of the symbolic reading of the breaking of the staff that interprets this act is Shakespeare saying goodbye to play-writing? Who was the first critic or biographer who came up with this interpretation?  I consulted the following works in vain:   Stephen Greenblatt: Will in der Welt. Wie Shakespeare zu Shakespeare wurde. München: Pantheon, 2015. (German translation of Will in the World. Greenblatt discusses The Tempest especially on pages 445-450 and mentions that the play makes the impression that it was a farewell to the theatre.)  Hans-Dieter Gelfert: Shakespeare. 2nd edition. München: C. H. Beck, 2014. (Short introduction to Shakespeare.)  Frank Günther: Unser Shakespeare. Einblicke in Shakespeares fremmd-verwandte Zeiten. München: dtv, 2014. (Günther has been working on a translation of all of Shakespeare's plays; doesn't mention the above theory.) Hans-Dieter Gelfert: William Shakespeare in seiner Zeit. München: C. H. Beck, 2014. (Doesn't mention the theory at all.) Ulrich Suerbaum: Der Shakespeare-Führer. 2nd edition. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2006. Page 2018 mentions that the theory that Prospero was a kind of self-portrait dates from the 19th century. Bill Bryson: Shakespeare wie ich ihn sehe. München: Goldmann, 2008. (German translation of Shakespeare: The World as a Stage. The German translation has no index and I couldn't find any discussion of The Tempest or any of the other romances.)  Kurt Kreiler: Der Mann der Shakespeare erfand. Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Frankfurt am Main: Insel, 2009. (Oxfordian conspiracy theory, but you never know ...) Charlotte Lyne: Alles über Shakespeare. München &amp; Wien: Thiele, 2009. (Page 201: mentions the theory without questioning it; claims that The Tempest was Shakespeare's last play.)  "
329,"Doesn't Burns' use of parallelism reinforce ""My Heart's in the Highlands"" visual images?","Here is ""My Heart's in the Highlands"" by Robert Burns ([website]  My heart’s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;   My heart’s in   the Highlands a-chasing the deer;   Chasing the wild deer, and   following the roe.   My heart’s in the Highlands, wherever I go.       Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,   The birthplace   of valor, the country of worth;   Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,     The hills of the Highlands forever I love.    Farewell to the   mountains high covered with snow;   Farewell to the straths and green   valleys below;   Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods;     Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.   My heart ’s in the   Highlands, my heart is not here;   My heart’s in the Highlands   a-chasing the deer;   Chasing the wild deer, and following the roe.   My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go.   Here is my question: does the author's use of parallelism reinforce the poem's strong visual images?  The book says parallelism only adds to the poem's rhythm and elicits an emotional response from the reader with only such explanation about images:     In this poem, parallelism does not affect the strong visual images in   any way   Why not? For example, in this excerpt, doesn't it help to produce stronger images by applying the same structure of lines?     Farewell to the mountains high covered with snow;   Farewell to the   straths and green valleys below;   Farewell to the forests and   wild-hanging woods;   Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring   floods.

330,"What is Faulkner's point of view in the ""Address to the Graduating Class?""","Here is the ""Address to the Graduating Class"" by Faulkner.     Years ago, before any of you were born, a wise Frenchman said, “If   youth knew; if age could.” We all know what he meant: that when you   are young, you have the power to do anything, but you don’t know what   to do. Then, when you have got old and experience and observation have   taught you answers, you are tired, frightened; you don’t care, you   want to be left alone as long as you yourself are safe; you no longer   have the capacity or the will to grieve over any wrongs but your own.      So you young men and women in this room tonight, and in thousands of   other rooms like this one about the earth today, have the power to   change the world, rid it forever of war and injustice and suffering,   provided you know how, know what to do. And so according to the old   Frenchman, since you can’t know what to do because you are young, then   anyone standing here with a head full of white hair, should be able to   tell you.      But maybe this one is not as old and wise as his white hairs pretend   or claim. Because he can’t give you a glib answer or pattern either.   But he can tell you this, because he believes this. What threatens us   today is fear. Not the atom bomb, nor even fear of it, because if the   bomb fell on Oxford tonight, all it could do would be to kill us,   which is nothing, since in doing that, it will have robbed itself of   its only power over us: which is fear of it, the being afraid of it.   Our danger is not that. Our danger is the forces in the world today   which are trying to use man’s fear to rob him of his individuality,   his soul, trying to reduce him to an unthinking mass by fear and   bribery—giving him free food which he has not earned, easy and   valueless money which he has not worked for; the economies or   ideologies or political systems, communist or socialist or democratic,   whatever they wish to call themselves, the tyrants and the   politicians, American or European or Asiatic, whatever they call   themselves, who would reduce man to one obedient mass for their own   aggrandizement and power, or because they themselves are baffled and   afraid, afraid of, or incapable of, believing in man’s capacity for   courage and endurance and sacrifice.      That is what we must resist, if we are to change the world for man’s   peace and security. It is not men in the mass who can and will save   Man. It is Man himself, created in the image of God so that he shall   have the power and the will to choose right from wrong, and so be able   to save himself because he is worth saving;—Man, the individual, men   and women, who will refuse always to be tricked or frightened or   bribed into surrendering, not just the right but the duty too, to   choose between justice and injustice, courage and cowardice, sacrifice   and greed, pity and self;—who will believe always not only in the   right of man to be free of injustice and rapacity and deception, but   the duty and responsibility of man to see that justice and truth and   pity and compassion are done.      So, never be afraid. Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty   and truth and compassion, against injustice and lying and greed. If   you, not just you in this room tonight, but in all the thousands of   other rooms like this one about the world today and tomorrow and next   week, will do this, not as a class or classes, but as individuals, men   and women, you will change the earth; in one generation all the   Napoleons and Hitlers and Caesars and Mussolinis and Stalins and all   the other tyrants who want power and aggrandizement, and the simple   politicians and time-servers who themselves are merely baffled or   ignorant or afraid, who have used, or are using, or hope to use, man’s   fear and greed for man’s enslavement, will have vanished from the face   of it.   Here, I see mainly two groups of words that can show the author's perspective: ""we,"" ""us"" and ""you,"" ""your."" What I thought is that because this speech is motivational and gives life advice, it has the second person point of view. Because you do write a how-to-do-something or what-to-do articles by using this perspective, right? However, my book says the perspective is the first person. Even though I see a lot in the speech was said about ""us,"" I doubt if it's not more about ""you"" (since it was intended for the graduates whom the speaker could see and address; hence the word ""address"" in the title). Could you help with what's wrong here? Also, could here be two perspectives? I saw such a possibility as well though again, my book says otherwise. "
331,Who are the people referenced in “You Don't Belong” by Bad Religion?,"The song ""You Don't Belong"" by Bad Religion obviously references the SoCal punk scene they were a part of. In it, a number of people are mentioned by name.       Missy was a teen blue video star,   Tom took his life in his mother's car,   Milo went to college but you knew about that,   Todney played our records,   Jimmy&dagger; started riots,   Laurie was always quiet,   she was battling depression        (...)        Jack wore a skirt but he knew how to scrap,   Billy went to county on a class one possession,   Wendy went to school while her daddy shot smack,   Eugene kept a list,   Mugger was security,   Mary she kept her purity,   we were all in it together      —""You Don't Belong"" by Bad Religion, lyrics from their homepage   Who are they?  Some are obvious, like Milo who went to college or Rodney who played their records, but is it known who the others are?  Has the band ever talked about it in interviews?    I saw some speculation on a discussion board:   Missy &mdash; ? Tom &mdash; Tom Clement, known from ""I Give You Nothing"" Milo &mdash; Milo Aukerman, from the Descendents Rodney &mdash; Rodney on the ROQ Jimmy&dagger; &mdash; ? Laurie &mdash; possibly Laurie Anderson Jack &mdash; Jack Grisham, from TSOL Billy &mdash; Brett Gurewitz himself Wendy &mdash; ? Eugene &mdash; ? Mugger &mdash; a roadie for Black Flag Mary &mdash; ?     &dagger;: The lyrics on their official homepage have him as Jimmy, but a number of other sources have him as GG, referring to either Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn or New York punk icon GG Allin.    I've asked this question over on the Music Fans Stack, but didn't get a satisfactory answer. So I'm giving it a shot over here. "
332,Why did Tinky Holloway seem to contradict the principle behind Directive 10-289?,"During a meeting with some governmental officials that precipitated him joining the Strike, Hank Rearden demanded to know why they thought that their policies would work:     ""Who will improve [conditions]?""    ""Mr. Rearden, people don't just stand still!"" cried Holloway. ""They do things, they grow, they move forward!""     Compare this to the discussion of Directive 10-289, which mandated that everything remain as it was. After learning that labor leader Fred Kinnan would have substantial power over the structure of the economy, Jim Taggart commented ""I don't care. It doesn't matter. He'll have to hold things still. Everything will have to remain as it is. Just as it is. Nobody will be permitted to change anything."" When Fred Kinnan asked how things were supposed to improve if everything was supposed to stay the same, Wesley Mouch's response basically boiled down to ""don't be so cynical.""  Why the sudden change here? "
333,Snoopy can balance on an edge atop his doghouse. Is any reason given for this?,"In Peanuts, Snoopy sleeps and does other activities on top of his doghouse. Since the doghouse has a pointy roof, shouldn't he fall down? Why doesn't the below happen every time?    Is there a reason provided, in the comic or any extratextual material, as to why he is able to do this? "
334,Which short story describes a man climbing a tower and then discovering he’s underground?,"I remember this story about a man living in a castle. I think he wanted to escape and he decided to reach the tallest tower in the castle. He climbs the wall from the inside and when he’s finally at the top, he moves a heavy object and he figures the castle is actually underground. I think that at the surface is a cemetery.  The style was gothic, I would say XIX century  vibe, maybe Poe? I read it in Italian, in Italy, maybe 10 years ago. I am quite sure it was a translation from English.  Does anyone know the short story I’m talking about? "
335,Why did Henry Cameron say that Howard would have to fight Gail Wynand?,"Towards the end of his life, Henry Cameron told Howard Roark that he didn't hate anyone anymore, just Gail Wynand because he represented ""the triumph of overbearing vulgarity."" He told Howard that he'd have to fight Wynand. (The irony, of course, is that Wynand later became a major client and close personal friend to Howard).  We learn later, of course, that Wynand didn't create that, he just profited off it. On the other hand, Ellsworth Toohey both understands - and is actively causing - the problem, to the point that Stephen Mallory took a shot at him over it.  Why did Cameron think that the problem was Wynand whereas Mallory recognized that it was actually Toohey? Did Cameron just not know about Toohey, or did he misjudge Wynand and Toohey? "
336,Why did Henry Cameron tell Roark that it was all worth it?,"At one point, Henry Cameron tried to fire Howard Roark and get him to quit architecture because he knew what kind of a struggle Howard would have later. However, towards the end of his life he told Howard:     Do you remember the day when I tried to fire you? Forget what I said to you then. It was not the whole story... Don't be afraid... it was worth it.   Why did he say that? What did he mean by ""worth it""? "
337,Why does Auden relate logical deduction to Adam and Eve's Fall?,"From: Philip Johnson-Laird BA PhD Psychology (UCL), Stuart Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Princeton.    (Author isn't  a logician.)    How We Reason  (1st edn 2008). p. 103.     How We Make Deductions      Could one not almost say that the   Cold serpent on the poisonous tree   Was l'esprit de géométrie,   That Eve and Adam till the Fall   Were totally illogical   But as they tasted of the fruit   The syllogistic sin took root?         From W. H. Auden. Bold emphasis added. Screenshot    I learned from Google that these lines are from Auden's New Year Letter (January 1, 1940) to Elizabeth Mayer. I know that ""l'esprit de géométrie"" is French for ""the spirit of geometry, which this Wordreference thread explains:     The French philosopher Pascal defined two fundamental ""spirits"" of thought. The ""spirit of geometry"" was the calculating and deductive kind, while the ""esprit de finesse"" (spirit of finesse) was immediate intuition without proofs or verification. The author is saying he is of the rational and deductive kind, which is why he goes on to emphasize that he deduced the other two passengers had buckled their seat belts.     But how do these lines relate to logical deduction? What do they mean? Why would the cold serpent have ""l'esprit de géométrie""?  Before the Fall, Eve and Adam were sinless. So how were they ""totally illogical""? To what syllogism is 'syllogistic sin' referring? Can someone please write it in full?   "
338,"Does Auden contradict himself in ""children might well appear to be more rational than adults, for a child is not, by nature, more anything""?","I first saw this quote here: Philip Johnson-Laird BA PhD Psychology (UCL), Stuart Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Princeton.     How We Reason  (1st edn 2008). p. 245. I emboldened.  “Walter de la Mare,”  1963. I think this refers to A Choice Of de la Mare's Verse. Selected with an Introduction by W.H. Auden.      Human beings are blessed with the power to remember; consequently, to grow old means for us not to discard but to accumulate; in every old man there still lives a child, an adolescent, a young man and a middle-aged one. It is commonly believed that children are, by nature, more imaginative than adults, but this is questionable. It is probably the case only in cultures like our own which put a higher social and economic value upon practical and abstract thinking than upon wonder and images; in a culture which put a high value on imagination and a low one on logic, children might well appear to be more rational than adults, for a child is not, by nature, more anything. In all cultures, however, there is one constant difference between children and adults, namely, that, for the former, learning their native tongue is itself one of the most important experiences in their lives, while, for the latter, language has become an instrument for interpreting and communicating experience; to recapture the sense of language as experience, an adult has to visit a foreign country.    What exactly does anything signify here? If children aren't more anything, then how can they appear more rational?   "
339,"What is the message of Poe's ""Eleonora""?","I recently read Edgar Allan Poe's short story ""Eleonora"", a thinly veiled self-portrait in which the protagonist falls in love with his younger cousin, who later dies and leaves him alone. He (the protagonist, not Poe) vows that his love for his cousin will be undying and that he will never love another woman in her place. So far, so unsurprising: this is standard romance fare.  Then, in the final paragraphs of the story, the narrator reveals that, long after the death of Eleonora and his subsequent departure from the valley where they grew up, he falls in love again and marries another woman named Ermengarde, about whom almost nothing is said, except for the implication that Heaven and/or the spirit of Eleonora forgive him for breaking his vow, for reasons unknown.  What is the message being put across by this story? Is the 'moral', if you will, that it's OK to break a vow of eternal love? The story is all about issues which were surely of great emotional importance to the author; is there some hidden meaning in it which isn't immediately clear? "
340,Why did T.H. White name his hero Mr. White?,"In The Elephant and the Kangaroo, T.H. White names his protagonist ""Mr. White,"" with no first name ever given.  There are several notable similarities between the author and his protagonist:   they are both English authors Mr White lives in Ireland, and T.H. White had they both seem to be freethinkers they were both unwed   So one might guess that the protagonist is intended to be some version of the author.  The only other indication of a possible reason for this name I noticed was a brief comparison of the protagonist with the White Rabbit, though I suspect this is secondary.  (Note the title of the work is based on an infrequently used comparison to two of the main characters to an elephant and a kangaroo.)  Did T.H. White ever explicitly explain the choice of name for this protagonist?  If so, did he say to what extent Mr. White and/or his experiences are intended to be similar to the real-life author? "
341,Is there any indication that Sam wanted to go to sea before he states that he wants to go to sea?,"At the end of My Side of the Mountain, Sam apparently wants to head out to sea:     As we approached the hemlock grove, I noticed that Dad was carrying a pack. He explained it as food for the first few days, or until I could teach John, Jim, Hank, and Jake how to live off the land. I winked at him.   ""But, Dad, a Gribley is not for the land.""   ""What do you mean?"" he shouted. ""The Gribleys have had land for three generations. We pioneer, we open the land."" He was almost singing.   ""And then we go to sea,"" I said.   ""Things have changed. Child labor laws; you can't take children to sea.""   However, do we see any indication that he wanted to go to sea? He had seemed pretty happy where he was.  Is there any indication in the rest of the novel that he wanted to go to sea? "
342,Why are place names obscured in Charlotte Brontë's The Professor?,"All place names in Charlotte Brontë's The Professor appear to be obscured. A few examples from the novel's first chapter:      That gentleman and Lord T. knew well enough that the Crimsworths were an unscrupulous and determined race; they knew also that they had influence in the borough of X——; and, making a virtue of necessity, they consented to defray the expenses of my education.       ...      I asked, moreover, if he could give me employment. His answer expressed no approbation of my conduct, but he said I might come down to ——shire, if I liked, and he would ‘see what could be done in the way of furnishing me with work.’ I repressed all—even mental comment on his note—packed my trunk and carpet-bag, and started for the North directly.      ...      “After two days’ travelling (railroads were not then in existence) I arrived, one wet October afternoon, in the town of X——.    Why is that? Is this peculiarity specific to Brontë, or a wider convention? "
343,"How accurate is Corbett's ""My India""?","Jim Corbett's books are mostly autobiographical, My India particularly so. It describes several incidents across Corbett's life in India. One of the most moving ones is from Corbett's time as a Railway contractor on the shores of the Ganges.  There had been some delay in payments, and Corbett was nearly bankrupt. His foreman came to speak to him, and met his servant going to serve him lunch. They asked him what his lunch consisted of, and the answer was, if my memory is correct, a single roti and some dal. The austerity impressed his foremen, and they, after waiting for him to finish his meal, promised him to continue working, but pleaded for some solution. Of course, the payments came soon after.  The story as written by Corbett is powerful. However, I wonder: is Corbett a reliable narrator? Have other, contradictory, accounts of the events in his book come out? Specifically, I'm most interested in the aforementioned event, but a general account of his accuracy would be good. "
344,Who was (were?) the inspiration for Carrie?,"The Wikipedia article on Stephen King's Carrie says that Carrie is based on two girls in King's schools. It has this quote, with a ""citation needed"" attached:     She was a very peculiar girl who came from a very peculiar family. Her   mother wasn't a religious nut like the mother in Carrie; she was a   game nut, a sweepstakes nut who subscribed to magazines for people who   entered contests … the girl had one change of clothes for the entire   school year, and all the other kids made fun of her. I have a very   clear memory of the day she came to school with a new outfit she'd   bought herself. She was a plain-looking country girl, but she'd   changed the black skirt and white blouse – which was all anybody had   ever seen her in – for a bright-colored checkered blouse with puffed   sleeves and a skirt that was fashionable at the time. And everybody   made worse fun of her because nobody wanted to see her change the mold   Googling some phrases from this mostly returns blogs and other sites which repeat this verbatim. Two books seem to be of interest:   Something about the Author, Anne Commrie, 1989, Gale Authors &amp; Artists for Young Adults, vol. 1, Agnes Garrett, Helga P. McCue, 1989, Gale Research.   Neither seem to be a primary source.  Even the part about Carrie being based on those two girls has a rather vague source: ""King, (2000), p.78"". If we assume that this assertion and the quote are from the same source, Wikipedia lists two books published by King in 2000 that might be the source of this quote:   2000, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, Scribner, ISBN: 978-0-684-85352-9. 2000, Secret Windows: Essays and Fiction on the Craft of Writing,   BOMC, ISBN: 978-0-965-01851-7   Who is (are?) Carried based on? Is the above quote true, and if so, where did it come from? "
345,How much do the characters in Waiting for Godot actually know?,"Waiting for Godot obviously never actually explicitly says who Godot is or exactly why the characters are waiting for him. How much do the characters know themselves? For example, do they even know who Godot is or why it's important to wait for him, or do they just know that they're supposed to wait? Is there good literary analysis on this point? "
346,Is there any significance to Major Major being a Henry Fonda lookalike?,"One of the big jokes in Catch-22 is Major Major's striking resemblance to Henry Fonda. Why did Joseph Heller choose Henry Fonda in particular? Is there any significance to the choice, or was it a somewhat arbitrary choice of someone that the audience was likely to have seen (or at least heard of) before? "
347,Where did the spells come from in The Magic Grandfather?,"In The Magic Grandfather, by Jay Williams (published 1979), there are several spells that do certain things. For instance, Aldoragamba luro vopo vir voarchadumia is a transportation spell. Tripsarecopsem helps with the crystal ball.     Near the beginning of the notebook of spells he found a description of how to pronounce the hard words, which was a great help. He fixed each step for himself so that he was clear about how to open the portal and keep it open. Above all, he set himself to learning the transportation spell by heart. It had only five words, but they were a mouthful: Aldoragamba luro vopo vir voarchadumia.   -Horrible Wendel   ...      This, said the notebook, was a ball made out of rock crystal, whatever that was. Looking into it and saying the word Tripsarecopsem, you could see any person or thing at a distance and this helped you concentrate on them so that you could bring them to you.   -Transformations   Where did Jay Williams get these spells from? Did he make them up? Do they mean anything? "
348,Does Snape talk in code?,"In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Snape asks Harry many questions during his first Potions class.   The first thing Snape asks Harry is      “Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”    According to Victorian Flower Language, asphodel is a type of lily meaning ‘My regrets follow you to the grave’ and wormwood means ‘absence’ and also typically symbolized bitter sorrow. If you combined that, it meant ‘I bitterly regret Lily’s death’.  But was this intentional?   I know it seems like a too-good-to-be-true coincidence, but I need confirmation.  "
349,How long is the Nijni-Novgorod trade fair?,"In Jules Verne, Michel Strogoff, part 1 chapter 5, when Michel arrives to Nijni-Novgorod, there's a huge trade fair going on in the city.  The text seems to give two contradictory numbers about how long the trade fair is.      Nijni-Novgorod, qui en temps ordinaire ne compte que trente à trente-cinq mille habitants, en renfermait alors plus de trois cent mille, c’est-à-dire que sa population était décuplée. Cet accroissement était dû à la célèbre foire qui se tient dans ses murs pendant une période de trois semaines.       [later]      Tel était l’aspect de la plaine, tel il devait être pendant les six semaines que dure ordinairement la célèbre foire de Nijni-Novgorod.   Why do these two numbers differ?  What am I misreading?  (You can find the text of the novel online on Wikisource, and also on Project Gutenberg).  I have originally noticed this contradiction in the Hungarian translation Sztrogof Mihály, Pesti Szalon Kvk. (1994), ISBN:963834024X, translated by Supka Géza, edited by Gerencsér Zsuzsa.  This translation doesn't always stick to the meaning of the original text, but in this case it does have both numbers.  I show the relevant quotes below.     Nyizsnyij Novgorod, melynek lakossága általában nem több, mint harminc-harmincötezer lélek, ebben az időszakban több mint háromszázezret számlált, tehát megtöbbszöröződött.  Ennek az oka pedig a híres vásár volt, mely három hétig tartott a város falai között.      […]      Ősrégi szokás szerint még az is megesett ezen a hat hétig tartó Nyizsnyij Novgorod-i vásáron, hogy […]   The English translation by Agnes Kinloch Kingston and the one found on Project Gutenberg does not mention a duration the second time in the text, so it does not have this contradiction. "
350,Did Plutarch Heavensbee actually not know the details of the Quarter Quell?,"At one point in the book, Plutarch Heavensbee claims that he didn't know that Katniss was going back into the Games. This would seem very odd if true, especially given that he was the Head Gamemaker and was already involved in the conspiracy against the Capitol. Was he lying? If so, why? If not, what might the original plan have been given that Katniss wouldn't actually be in the arena for them to retrieve? "
351,How did they plan the conspiracy against the Capitol given mass surveilance?,"The books and movies strongly imply that President Snow was using mass surveillance (e.g. When he revealed that he knew about Katniss and Gale having kissed). Between that, President Snow's paranoia, and the fact that Snow would presumably be watching Plutarch Heavensbee carefully given what happened in the previous year's Games, how did they successfully create a conspiracy involving so many people without tipping off Snow??  Is there any historical precedent for this? "
352,Where are the white folks in The Expanse?,"I'm three books (and three short stories) into Corey's ""The Expanse"" series, and I've noticed an interesting trend.  When Corey describes the ethnicity and inherited culture of individual characters to depict a multicultural, multi-ethnic future, he focuses (sometimes in creepy detail) on their skin color and facial features. But while he's got a future full of people descended from Pacific Islanders, Asians, Africans, etc., hardly any individual is described with physical markers I'd consider ""white.""  I fully embrace an extremely diverse future, but I'm quite sure Corey's not imagining a future where humanity's simply blended out the extremes of physical diversity. I'm told this by his repeated emphasis that Naomi's multi-ethnic features are extremely unusual.  In the TV series based on the books both the main characters and a lot of the background folks are cast with white actors (even the guy with eight parents), but I don't see much indication that's specifically adhering to any sense the book provides for those characters.  Is Corey's future just a largely non-white one, or is something else going on? Am I anticipating a future revelation about the setting or is this just an uncommented bit of subtle worldbuilding? "
353,"What is the Pasifika response to ""Nation""?","Pratchett's ""Nation"" was recommended to me because it depicts an alternate reality version of Pasifika cultures, faiths, and traditions. A quick glance at Wikipedia tells me it's got cannibals and reveals that a Pasifika culture is the forgotten remnant of a culture which was once successful by Western standards of science and technology. My Googles, however, have not turned up much information on what kind of reception this book got from Pasifika people.  How is Nation received by Pasifika audiences? What's the general popular and critical response to it by Pasifika voices? "
354,Why is the study of Philology in decline?,"Philology is a branch of English academia, described on Wikipedia as ""a combination of literary criticism, history, and linguistics"". I am no expert, but its central premise appears to be that these three subjects are essentially indivisible for a proper understanding of a text.   Tolkien, in his letters, described himself as a philologist, as does Tom Shippey, one of the few academics to have made a serious study of Tolkien's work.   In the introduction to his book, JRR Tolkien: author of the century, Shippey states that the teaching and study of the subject is in decline and has practically vanished from universities. But he does not elaborate on the reasons why he believes this to be true or why it might have happened.  Is he correct? And if so, given the obvious utility of the subject (the value of the premise with which I opened this question seems pretty incontestable to me), why has it declined? "
355,How do The New York Times bestseller lists work?,"The New York Times, a leading newspaper in the United States provides bestseller lists in their The New York Times Book Review. These lists are very influential in what is read by a large number of people, due to the publicity gained from a book reaching the list at all.   I'm skeptical of what the list represents. How is the list put together? What standards are used? How are the sales counted? "
356,"Why is 'beer' used in ''a parson much bemus'd in beer""?","In 1735, Alexander Pope wrote Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot. There is a line ""a parson much bemus'd in beer."" What has beer to do with it?  I came across this in Merriam-Webster:     In 1735, British poet Alexander Pope    lamented, in rhyme, being besieged by ""a    parson much bemus'd in beer."" The cleric    in question was apparently one of a horde    of would-be poets who plagued Pope    with requests that he read their verses. Pope meant that the parson had found his    muse—his inspiration—in beer.   First of all whose inspiration did the parson find? How did beer became a source of inspiration? What does it mean in this context? Were they having drinks while reading their verses? I am bemused by the use of beer. "
357,How did Wonka's Golden Ticket sweepstakes ensure that children would win?,"In Charlie and the Chocolate  Factory, Wonka says     I don't want a grown-up person at all. A grownup won't listen to me; he won't learn. He will try to do things his own way and not mine. So I had to have a child. I want a good sensible loving child [...]   and Charlie responds,       So that is why you sent out the Golden Tickets!   To which Wonka replies,     Exactly! I decided to invite five children to the factory, and the one I liked best at the end of the day would be the winner!   But what has always puzzled me, is how did sending out Golden Tickets ensure that children, and not grown-ups, would win? Lots of grown-ups certainly tried to find the Tickets; how could Wonka know that none of them would get one? Has there ever been an explanation given for this? "
358,"Is the Blue Ajah portrayed as ""the good Ajah""?","In Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, the Aes Sedai are divided into seven Ajahs: the Blue, the Brown, the Green, the Grey, the Red, the White, and the Yellow (plus the Black Ajah, which is secret and threaded insidiously through all of the others).     Warning: spoilers from books 4+ follow.   I think few would dispute that the Red Ajah is portrayed as ""the bad Ajah"", the worst of them all (not counting the Black, of course). Various things throughout the series support this:   By its very nature, gentling men who can channel, the Red Ajah presents a serious threat to the main protagonist of the series. Several prominent Blacks are officially Reds, such as Galina Casban (head of both the Red Ajah and the Black Ajah, if I recall correctly) and Katerine Alruddin. Elaida. 'Nuff said. After the splitting of the Tower, the entire Red Ajah sides with Elaida - not a single one in Salidar.   The closest we get to a protagonist among the Red, unless there's someone I'm forgetting, is Pevara, and she isn't really much of a Red, even having spoken in favour of Warders. By contrast, there are more ""good"" characters, people we can sympathise with, in every other Ajah.  Can it be said that the Blue is portrayed as ""the good Ajah"" in the same way as the Red is portrayed as ""the bad Ajah""?  Points in favour:   The very first Aes Sedai we meet, and the only one we know for a long time, is of the Blue. In this sense, the Blue Ajah provides our introduction to Aes Sedai, a base point to identify with and from which to judge the rest. After the splitting of the Tower, the entire Blue Ajah goes to Salidar - not a single one with Elaida. There aren't many prominent Blacks who are officially Blues. There are two Blues among the thirteen Blacks who leave the Tower in book 2/3, but they're probably the two most minor characters among those thirteen.   What other evidence is there in favour of, or against, this reading of the text? "
359,Ray Bradbury says Fahrenheit 451 isn't about censorship. Is he right?,"According to this question about Ray Bradbury's intentions, Ray Bradbury did not intend for Fahrenheit 451 to be about government censorship, and went so far as to say ""Fuck you"" to someone who argued that Fahrenheit 451 was about government censorship.  Is Bradbury right? Is Fahrenheit 451 not about government censorship? Or can an argument be made that Fahrenheit 451 can be interpreted as being about government censorship? "
360,Significance of the Phoenician Sailor having pearls for eyes in The Waste Land,"In T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land (which you can read online), the ""Phoenician Sailor"" (an image on a tarrot card) is described as having pearls for eyes in lie 48:     Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,   (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)   This detail is presumably important, because it is repeated later on in the poem on line 125:     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Do   You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember   Nothing?”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are pearls that were his eyes.   Any insight as to what this means? "
361,Did Winston and Julia oversleep?,"When Winston and Julia are arrested at the end of Part 2 of 1984, Winston speculates dully that they may have overslept in the room above Charrington's shop, and that it is now the morning instead of the evening:     He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the time — had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further. It was not interesting.      -- Part 2, Chapter 10   Later on, at the start of the next chapter, he is resigned to the fact that he will never know:     It might be twenty-four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know, probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.      -- Part 3, Chapter 1   Is there any further evidence for whether they were arrested in the morning or the evening? "
362,In which order should the Sherlock Holmes stories be read?,"The canonical Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle comprise:   four novellas:   A Study in Scarlet The Sign of Four The Hound of the Baskervilles The Valley of Fear  fifty-six short stories, separated into five collections:   The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (12 stories) The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (11-12 stories) The Return of Sherlock Holmes (13 stories) His Last Bow (7-8 stories) The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes (12 stories)    These were published between 1887 and 1927, and set between around 1800 and 1914. Some of them are set during the period when Holmes and Watson lived together at 221b Baker Street, and others during the period after Watson's marriage when they saw less of each other. But the cutoff point in-universe between these two periods is roughly marked by The Sign of Four, when Watson meets his wife, and this was only the second story to be published; so clearly the chronological and publication orders do not agree. Still other stories are set much earlier, before Holmes and Watson met (e.g. ""The Adventure of the Gloria Scott"", Holmes's first case) or much later, after Holmes retires (e.g. ""The Adventure of the Lion's Mane"").  My question is: given all these complications, in which order should one read the complete Sherlock Holmes?  Some suborderings are obvious: for instance, ""The Final Problem"" should be read directly before ""The Adventure of the Empty House"", and ""A Study in Scarlet"" should most likely be read first despite not being chronologically first in-universe. But has anyone worked out a complete list of all the Sherlock Holmes stories, in an order in which they can best be appreciated?  Publication order? In-universe chronological order? Something else? "
363,What is a Byronic Hero?,"I just saw this post: Was Heathcliff intentionally made a Byronic Hero?  Not being familiar with literary terminology, I have no idea what a Byronic Hero is. I had read Wuthering Heights long ago (it was, IIRC, the second English book I ever read), and from what I remember, Heathcliff, while certainly one of the main characters, wasn't very ""heroic"". Words to describe him would best be lifted from this ELU question (Polite synonyms for “a——hole-ish” behavior).  What makes a ""Hero"" Byronic? "
364,Are any of Kino's attackers directly linked to the one pearl buyer?,"In The Pearl, chapter 4, when Kino is trying to sell his massive pearl in the village market, it's revealed that all the pearl buyers work for one man:     It was supposed that the pearl buyers were individuals acting alone, bidding against one another for the pearls the fishermen brought in. [...] Now there was only one pearl buyer with many hands, and the men who sat in their offices and waited for Kino knew what price they would offer, how high they would bid, and what method each one would use.   After Kino refuses to sell, he is attacked, his home and canoe are destroyed, and he is followed into the mountains.  I'd like to know if any of these attackers are meant to be linked to the ""one pearl buyer.""  Does Steinbeck implicitly or explicitly make this connection anywhere in the book, or in other writings?    Put another way: is Steinbeck attempting to emphasize the corruption of the pearl monopoly (at least one attacker from there)?  Or the general jealousy and hatred throughout the community (attackers working independently)? "
365,Did Lenore merely leave or is she dead?,"Edgar Allen Poe's poem The Raven has the narrator mourning the loss of his love Lenore. But it's actually not entirely clear to me if Lenore merely left the narrator (for whatever relationship-related intricacies) or if she is dead altogether.  When the eponymous raven appears, the narrator repeatedly asks him if he will ever see Lenore again, to which we know the Raven's answer isn't particularly satisfying. But still, it's unclear to me if he is talking about an actual real meeting and return of Lenore to him, or the chance of reuniting with her in the afterlife, or even the chance of her returning from the dead. It's all left ambiguous to me.  Now, while getting along in the English language rather well, I'm not a native speaker and I won't deny that some parts of the poem might go beyond my understanding. So did I just miss something more obvious in the text? Or is it only secondary information that gives a really conclusive answer on the matter? Or has it never been resolved at all?  Is Lenore actually dead or did she just leave the narrator? "
366,Moral of the Hunger Games Trilogy,"In the last book of the Hunger Games trilogy, several things happen which make me think that the moral (or conclusion) of the story is that things never change.   The Hunger Games are to continue, just with Capitol kids. Katniss shoots Coin because Coin is another Snow. Snow escapes execution by dying in his own way. Many characters are dead who may have been alive if it weren't for the revolution.   Am I right in thinking that the conclusion is that the revolution was considered by Collins to have been a change from one form of suppression to another? That in the end nothing had changed? "
367,Why does the Lady of Shalott stay instead of stray?,"In Tennyson's poem ""The Lady of Shalott"" there is the following verse:     There she weaves by night and day   A magic web with colours gay.   She has heard a whisper say,   A curse is on her if she stay   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look down to Camelot.        She knows not what the curse may be,   And so she weaveth steadily,   And little other care hath she,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady of Shalott.    (Emphasis mine).  Now part of her curse, as I understand it, is that she cannot leave Shalott, and cannot look out the windows because she may see Camelot. So why is it stay? She has to stay! Shouldn't it be stray? As in her eyes stray to look out the window to Camelot? "
368,Which is the 'correct' version of the Lady of Shalott and why are there two?,"It seems Tennyson wrote two versions of The Lady of Shalott.  They are quite similar but have some big differences, for instance:  Earlier version:     On either side the river lie       Long fields of barley and of rye,       That clothe the wold and meet the sky;       And thro' the field the road runs by       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many-tower'd Camelot;       The yellow-leaved waterlily       The green-sheathed daffodilly       Tremble in the water chilly       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about Shalott.    Later Version:     On either side the river lie       Long fields of barley and of rye,       That clothe the wold and meet the sky;       And thro' the field the road runs by       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many-tower'd Camelot;       And up and down the people go,       Gazing where the lilies blow       Round an island there below,       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island of Shalott.    Is the later one the final version of the original? Or are they two separate versions meant to both be different poems about the same subject? "
369,"What's the point of the hen in Juan Rulfo's ""They Gave Us the Land""?","The short story ""Nos han dado la tierra"" (""They Gave Us the Land"") is a dismal portrayal of the Mexican government's land reform in the mid-20th century.  A group of men are given a barren wasteland by an official, and as they walk through it they discuss how completely worthless it is.  But near the end, it's suddenly revealed that one of the men is carrying a hen under his coat:     I hadn't noticed Esteban very closely.  Now that he's speaking I notice him.  He's wearing a coat that reaches down to his navel, and under his coat something that looks like a hen's head is peering out.      Yo no me había fijado bien a bien en Esteban. Ahora que habla, me fijo en él. Lleva puesto un gabán que le llega al ombligo, y debajo del gabán saca la cabeza algo así como una gallina.   When pressed, Esteban explains why he is carrying the chicken:     I brought her along to take care of her.  Nobody was left at my house to feed her; that's why I brought her.  Whenever I go anyplace very far I take her along.      la traigo para cuidarla. Mi casa se quedó sola y sin nadie para que le diera de comer; por eso me la traje. Siempre que salgo lejos cargo con ella.   My question is – what relevance does this chicken have?  Is it meant to show the poverty or loneliness of the men somehow?  Why include it in the story at all?    English quotations from The Mexico Reader (2002), 468–69.  Spanish from Toda la obra. "
370,"How to read é, ä, û?","If I want to read Tolkien's text aloud, or appreciate the rhythm and rhyme in his poems, I find it distracting not to know how names including these characters (and similar ones) were meant to be pronounced. Unfortunately I only have the main books in e-book format; if this is answered in some background material I would highly appreciate a summary or even a literal quote thereof.  I am in particular interested in these letters, from which I assume it would be more or less straightforward to generalize to others reusing the same accents:   ä (e.g. Eärendil): I suspect umlaut (German) or separation of sounds (French) or both, but I'm having a hard time in making the first verse trochaic (in accordance with the rest of the poem) in     Eärendil was a mariner      that tarried in Arvernien;      he built a boat of timber felled      in Nimbrethil to journey in [...]  û (e.g., Nazgûl or Khazad-dûm): I'm pretty sure that this is just the sound I know as ""u"" (sounds like the /oo/ in /doom/):     The shadow lies upon his tomb      In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.   What's the difference to ""u"" then? é (e.g., Sméagol or Éoden): here I only have the pronunciation they adopted in the movie adaptation, the problem of which is that it plainly ignores any diacritics and says ""Smeagol"" in English pronunciation. I very much doubt that is what was intended. Similarly to the above, how to differentiate ""é"" from ""e""?  "
371,"Who abducted Addison in ""Wit's End""?","In Fowler's Wit's End (also published as The Case of the Imaginary Detective), we see a flashback where Addison is abducted at age three.  It's a strange scene. There are three people involved; she isn't mistreated; she's let out to play in the garden, and her parents find her there immediately. It seems... weird, for an abduction; I'm not seeing any of the motivation or the secrecy I'd expect from the abduction of a child.  Is any explanation given for the events in this scene? Are we meant to understand who took her, or why? "
372,Why don't these lines rhyme in Les Miserables?,"In Castle on a Cloud from Les Miserables,      There is a room that's full of toys,      There are a hundred boys and girls   I know it's translated from French, but why isn't it girls and boys?  There are rhymes throughout the rest of the song.  Was this intentional (and if so, why?) or are the translators just stupid? "
373,Why does the Emperor-Over-the-Sea play such a small role in the Chronicles of Narnia?,"The Emperor-Over-the-Sea is referenced at several points during the series. The Stone Table, Deep Magic and the Deeper Magic were all set in motion by him, and he is the father of Aslan.  At the same time, he does not directly enter the series; he does not appear to be present in Aslan's Country during The Silver Chair or the events of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and doesn't appear to directly intervene. He doesn't even seem to be present at the creation of Narnia during The Magician's Nephew or the Final Judgment in The Last Battle - the entire country was sang into existence by Aslan.  Given that C. S. Lewis was not a deist, why is this? Why was the Emperor-Over-the-Sea such a remote figure? "
374,How and why did the story of King Cnut change?,"The 11th-century king Cnut/Knut/Canute of Denmark, Norway, and England is today best known for the story of how he sat on the beach commanding the waves to turn back. The original account of this story, written in the 12th century by Henry of Huntingdon, uses it to illustrate Cnut's humility:     [W]hen at the summit of his power, he [Canute] ordered a seat to be placed for him on the sea-shore when the tide was coming in; thus seated, he shouted to the flowing sea, ""Thou, too, art subject to my command, as the land on which I am seated is mine; and no one has ever resisted my commands with impunity. I command you, then, not to flow over my land, nor presume to wet ihe feet and the robe of your lord."" The tide, however, continuing to rise as usual, dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leaped backwards, saying: ""Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.""      The Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon (1154) VI.17. Translated by Thomas Arnold (1879).   But later accounts twisted it around so as to portray Cnut as a foolishly proud ruler, as if he really believed he could stop the waves. The tale has become an almost proverbial example of hubris.  How and why did the moral of the story change? I'd like to know both the nature of the change (if possible, some kind of timeline of accounts of the story?) and also the reason for it (e.g. did it start off as just a misunderstanding by a later storyteller, or could there have been some political motive?) "
375,Why is the Emperor Beyond the Sea named that?,"Closely related: Why does the Emperor-Over-the-Sea play such a small role in the Chronicles of Narnia?  Why is the Emperor Beyond The Sea in The Chronicles of Narnia named that? What sea is he beyond, and why is he beyond it? Is this implying that the Emperor Beyond the Sea has a country that's kind of analogous to Aslan's Country? If so, why are they separate countries? "
376,Book about a boy who develops several accidentally destructive science projects,"I read this in the 1990s while living in Kentucky. Pretty sure it was a library book, although I'm not certain if it was the school or city library. The main character is a young teenage male, in either middle school or high school, Caucasian, living in a small town in the United States. I believe it had pen-and-ink drawings at a few places in the book, and I'm pretty sure it was broken up into chapters. Two things have stuck with me: one is that he is at one point babysitting an infant (maybe his little brother?), and starts reading the dictionary to the child (I remember ""pusillanimous"" and ""susurration"" being two of the words, the latter being where he realized that the S words worked best), which calms the child. I think there was a later scene where the child was using a few multiple-syllable words as part of its babble, puzzling its parents.  The other is a running thread in the books where he's doing a science project for a science fair, and his projects keep accidentally breaking things. I believe his overall theme was sources of power over history. I remember one project was a full-sized catapult, complete with a large rock in the holder, which went off when someone (the teacher?) pulled the lever, not realizing it was functional. Another was a steam engine. I think it exploded because he didn't set up the pressure valve correctly. The last had something to do with a fan and a source of smoke, maybe a demonstration of wind power. I remember he initially was going to use a burning rag for the smoke, but found a more elegant solution, I think involving chemicals to generate smoke. At the time of the fair, the teachers were hesitant, knowing what had happened with the other projects, but when he switches it on, the calamity comes when a classmate suddenly leaps back and knocks some things (including a bottle of ink, I think) over. Turns out the classmate had reversed the fan blade, thinking it would cause the smoke to blow back on the protagonist, unaware that a reversed fan blade blows the same direction as before.  I feel like I ought to remember more of the book, but those are the bits that stick out. I remember being particularly impressed with the catapult, and trying the dictionary trick with my little brother (it didn't work as well as in the book, but I learned some new words in the process). "
377,Who is the radio informer in King Rat by Clavell?,"In King Rat by James Clavell, two radios in the camp are found by the Japanese. The radios were found only because of an informer. Who was the informer?  For some time I thought that it was Smeedel-Taylor, but my friends have proven to me that this makes no sense.  Who was the informer? "
378,"What is the distinction between ""literary fiction"" vs. ""popular fiction""?","What are the defining features of literary fictions as compared to popular ones? Is it the way how characters are developed? Or is it some peculiarity in the use of language? Please feel free to explain in detail as I am a novice.  This is a question popped up in my mind because of several reasons. Literary fiction is the more respected form. But many valuable literary works have actually been popular ones. For example the ""Arabian Nights"" or even the bible stories must be considered to be popular. But they are also respected as literary works. Is that solely because of historic reasons? Also is there some objective criteria that demarcates the genre and literary works? Like one is plot driven and the other is character driven. Or the form of language used in one versus the other. If so can they be expressed explicitly?   From the current context, there could be a book which might be characterized as satirical or detective fictions. But they might still be giving valuable insights into human nature or the society we live in. Will such works be remembered as great works of art? "
379,"Why do Simpson and Bostley speak for each other in ""Lost Voices""?","I'm trying to learn more about spoken word poetry, and I stumbled upon Darius Simpson and Scout Bostley's ""Lost Voices"" (you can watch the performance online).  One of the themes of the piece is the problematic nature of the privileged speaking for the marginalized. Darius Simpson is a black man, and Scout Bostley is a white woman. Throughout the poem, they describe how those with privilege speak for them rather than allowing them to speak. Here's one such line:     It is not a problem that you want to sympathize but to tell me you know my pain, is to stab yourself in the leg because you saw me get shot. We have two different wounds, and looking at yours does nothing to heal mine.   What interested me about the piece is that when it's performed, the two performers describe each other's experience. For example, the poem begins with Bostley saying ""The first day I realized I was black,"" despite the fact that she is white.  Why are Simpson and Bostley doing the very thing their spoken word poetry condemns? "
380,Why does Merion react so strongly to being asked what their gender is?,"In the September/October 2017 issue of the Cicada magazine, they ran a story by Nino Cipri, entitled ""A Silly Love Story"". (Published online by the author (who also goes by Nicole).)   The story focuses on Jeremy - our main character, a man - and Merion, a bi-gendered character, who are in a relationship.  We see the story of how Jeremy and Merion met, and we see that Merion has an encounter with a girl who is curious as to whether Merion is a boy or girl.     Jeremy was eating kalamata olives when a tall brunette with Bettie Page bangs approached Merion. ""Sorry,"" she said. ""I just have to ask, are you a girl or a boy?""   Merion glared at her. ""I'm Merion.""   ""Like, as in Maid Marion?""   ""Like, as in fuck you,"" he spat. Jeremy's heart had sped up. It was an odd thing to fall in love with somebody's ferocious vulnerability...     Why does Merion react so strongly? I understand that they are not one specific gender at all times, like the brunette seems to be insinuating, but why not just say 'I'm bi-gendered'? Why immediately blow up at the girl? "
381,"Why is the Omani trinket salesman story ""female"", and what does female mean here?","American Gods contains interludes named ""Coming to America"", which describe how certain gods and other entities arrived to the country. One of those stories features a djinn (a fire spirit, sort of), who works as a taxi driver, and a young man from Oman, who came to America on business.   In ""All Books Have Genders"" 1  (collected in The View from the Cheap Seats), Neil Gaiman discusses the book, and describes it as overall male, with the exception of the ""Coming to America"" stories, including this one:     The book had a gender now, and it was most definitely male. I wonder now, looking back if the short stories in American Gods were a reaction to that. There are maybe half a dozen of them scattered through the book, and all (but one) of them are most definitely female in my head (even the one about the Omani trinket salesman and the taxi driver).    Page 73.    Why is the story female? And what does female mean here? Both the main characters in it are male (there's of course them being gay, but I don't think it prompts the story being called female), and I don't see any traits in the story which could be called female.   1  Hat tip to jo1storm for finding it on Neil Gaiman's website.

382,What happened to Frank and Helen in England?,"Frank and Helen are some of the few people recorded to have entered Narnia and stayed permanently. That being said, most people return to England the exact moment that they left, and most other people don't stay permanently until they're actually killed in England (e.g. Prof. Kirke, who dies in a train accident).  That being said, what happens to them in England? Did they simply disappear? "
383,"Which parts of the portrayal of women in ""Flatland"" are satire?","I recently finished Flatland (full text link), and I found it generally a somewhat disconcerting read. I realize that it's satire, and it's written in the tone of satire, particularly when it comes to women - but some of the remarks that they make in writing are very off-putting.   I can conclude roughly one of three things:   It's actually satire and I'm misreading it under a modern lens with modern expectations, or - It's poorly-executed satire, or - This portrayal isn't satire at all, and it just seems like it could be because of a modern lens.   I have no idea which of these it is.   The book as written is absolutely satire - the author denotes it as this; it's intended to remark on late Victorian-era societal structure. However, parentheticals sometimes include remarks and comparisons that we're intended to accept and gloss over, which has the effect of implying they're simply true without challenging them in any way (end of chapter 3):     Thus, in the most brutal and formidable of the soldier class - creatures almost on a level with women in their lack of intelligence - it is found that, as they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous penetrating power to advantage...    Certain things are absolutely satirical (from chapter 4):     ...others oblige a Woman, when travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by her husband; others confine Women altogether to their houses except during the religious festivals. But it has been found by the wisest of our Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on Females tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race, but also to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a State loses more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.   This is a setup that allows Abbot to draw attention to a poor Victorian standard... and then he challenges it in the worst possible way:     For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement at home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their spleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes destroyed in one or two hours of simultaneous female outbreak.   These kinds of things, in addition to offhand references to ""the Frail Sex"" which go unchallenged, lead me to question whether, or which parts were intended as satire, and which parts were intended to remain unchallenged.  Is there any way to tell? How do we know? "
384,Why does With Those We Love Alive ask the reader to draw sigils on their skin?,"With Those We Love Alive is a work of interactive fiction published by Porpentine. You can read the work online.  One of the unique features of the work is it asks the reader to draw sigils on their arm at very moments during the story. Here is one example of such an instruction:     Draw a sigil of new beginnings on your skin.      Done   The fact that these sigils are drawn on the skin seems significant. It means that the sigil is a part of the reader's body, rather than something like a paper that can be disposed of. This seems to be recognized by various other people who read the story:     When playing this I didn’t want to draw on myself, so I used a piece of paper. The symbols still meant something to me (and I still have the piece of paper), but I think some of the effect was lost.   Why exactly is it important to draw these sigils on the reader's skin, rather than something like a piece of paper? What changes about the story if the sigils are not drawn on the readers arm? "
385,"Why does ""Ode to Joy""/Beethoven's Symphony #9 start with a reference to Greek mythology and only mention God towards the end?","The text of Beethoven's 9th Symphony was largely ""borrowed"" from the poem ""Ode to Joy"" by Friedrich Schiller.  The text of the first verse of the poem (second verse of Beethoven's 9th symphony) is as follows (translation from Wikipedia):     Joy, beautiful spark of divinity,   Daughter from Elysium,   We enter, burning with fervour,   heavenly being, your sanctuary!   Your magic brings together   what custom has sternly divided.   All men shall become brothers,   wherever your gentle wings hover.   The next verse seems to be referring to earthly pleasures:     Whoever has been lucky enough   to become a friend to a friend,   Whoever has found a beloved wife,   let him join our songs of praise!   Yes, and anyone who can call one soul   his own on this earth!   Any who cannot, let them slink away   from this gathering in tears!   The 4th verse makes a passing reference to God, but only after a reference to the ""Daughter from Elysum"":     Every creature drinks in joy   at nature's breast;   Good and Evil alike   follow her trail of roses.   She gives us kisses and wine,   a true friend, even in death;   Even the worm was given desire,   and the cherub stands before God.   The final verse is much more explicitly religious:     Do you bow down before Him, you millions?   Do you sense your Creator, O world?   Seek Him above the canopy of stars!   He must dwell beyond the stars.   Why does this start with an explicit reference to Greek mythology and only ""evolve"" to talking about God later? How did the religious views of Schiller and Beethoven influence this? "
386,What's the significance of the T. S. Eliot reference in Catch-22?,"   ""It takes brains not to make money,"" Colonel Cargill wrote in one of the homiletic memoranda he regularly prepared for circulation over General Peckem's signature. ""Any fool can make money these days and most of them do. But what about people with talent and brains? Name, for example, one poet who makes money.""   ""T. S. Eliot,"" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen said in his mail-sorting cubicle at Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters, and slammed down the telephone without identifying himself.   His superiors were thoroughly baffled by the reference. It's unclear if they even knew who T. S. Eliot was, and it caused a flurry of activity thereafter.  What's the significance of using T. S. Eliot here? Was he used merely because he was a famous and successful poet who the book's readers would've been likely to have heard of, or is there additional significance behind this? "
387,"Does ""Animal Farm"" explicitly state anywhere in the text that it is in fact a political allegory?","I first heard of George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" in high school when a teacher mentioned that it was an allegory of the Soviet State. So I read it 2 years later with that understanding.   While recently reading another novel on the same subject I was led to wonder: If I had come across ""Animal Farm"" at age 12 in a second-hand bookshop in India without any pre-knowledge of its allegorical significance might I not have read it like a regular (if highly imaginative and quite sinister) children's story about talking animals? And might not somebody else read it thus without being aware of its political significance?   That confusion would not occur if that information is explicitly stated in the book itself. The Wikipedia article on ""Animal Farm"" doesn't seem to clarify this point, but does mention that Orwell's very explanatory 'Preface' was for some reason not published in most editions.     Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British self-censorship and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally (...) Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included, and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.   So did George Orwell or the publisher actually state anywhere in the text that it is an allegory? "
388,"What do these metaphors about hardship in ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" mean?","I have been racking my brain with the meaning of three expressions:  taut-jawed men - does it mean that they are stern looking, that their facial expression is tight and tense?  brick-lipped, hard-heeled women - same sense as number 1, I mean that they are with pursed lips or are they wearing some kind of reddish lipstick?  the hard-heeled part - does it mean that their heels are rough, in the sense that they are hurrying, hard-working women, etc., hence their cracked heels though we can't know that just from looking at them on the street. Is it more like they are stomping so hard because they are brusque?  Just to be on the safe side and provide some context, here is the whole sentence:     ""He walked along Eighth Street, over to Christopher, then to the river, threading his way like a pickpocket through the crowds just off the ferryboats from New Jersey: taut-jawed men in stiff hats and suits and obsidian shoes, newspapers pinned under their arms; brusque, brick-lipped, hard-heeled women in floral dresses.""   The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, by Michael Chabon (page 173)  "
389,A figure of speech combining two phrases,"I have read somewhere that it is typical of poems such as Nibelungenlied to use a figure of speech which in fact merges two phrases into one by the mean of a common word. An example could be the following:  And then I ate the apple was red as blood  A proper example of this can be found in Nibelungenlied (Adventure 20, 1184, 1-2), where we have     man sach      Ortwin von Mezze | ce Rvedgeren sprach   which means     one saw      Ortwin von Metz | to Rüdiger said   So, is there a name for this figure of speech? Is it a typical figure of other archaic poems such as Beowulf or am I confusing? "
390,Why did people appear to remember what was going on at the time they left England when they returned from Narnia?,"Very closely related: Why don&#39;t people in the Chronicles of Narnia have trouble &quot;transitioning&quot; back to their old life after extended times in other worlds?  When the Pevensies accidentally wandered back into England, they had been away for years (or perhaps even decades) and had only a vague recollection that they'd even seen the lamp-post before, which implied that they had forgotten. Why didn't they continue to express that kind of confusion when they got back? The book implies that they remember a good deal about what was going on when they left; for example, they remembered to apologize to the Professor for accidentally leaving the coats that they borrowed in Narnia.  The book also mentions that Mrs. Macready avoided the room. While I don't remember if it's explicitly stated in the text, I've always assumed that that implied that they remembered why they had entered the wardrobe in the first place (I could be wrong about that, though).  When they got back, did they remember ""where they had left off"" with their old life? Did they remember everything that they would have remembered when they left (e.g. what they had for lunch the day before they left, the fact that someone asked them to clean their room today, etc.)?  Similarly, after returning from Narnia in Prince Caspian, they apparently got on the train that they were planning on taking to begin with and carried on with their business. (Granted, their absence wasn't nearly as long that time).  While the texts admittedly don't talk a lot about their ""ordinary"" lives in England, there's no indication in the text as to their behavior being noticeably strange (with the exception of Lucy's return from the wardrobe). So, why did they remember as much as they did? "
391,What are stag beetles like in the world of Redwall?,"Cluny the Scourge's armor is described thusly:     His long ragged black coat was made of batwings, fastened at the throat with a mole skull. The immense war helmet he wore had the plumes of a blackbird and the horns of a stag beetle adorning it. From beneath the slanted visor his one eye glared viciously out at the Abbey before him.   Redwall, chapter 10   Cluny is described as being a very large rat. Beetles are generally... quite smaller than a rat, especially one the size of Cluny.   Why does Cluny have stag beetles' horns on his helmet? Wouldn't they be tiny? Or are stag beetles larger in Redwall? "
392,"Meaning of ""faithful to the tomb, so there were quarrels"" in Byron's ""Don Juan""","From Byron's Don Juan:     The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;        Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,   And, turning up her nose, with looks abused        Her master and his myrmidons, of whom   Not one, except the attorney, was amused;        He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,   So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,   Knowing they must be settled by the laws.      What is the meaning of the words in bold? I read about Achates, and probably he was faithful to some tomb in the Aeneid, but what is the meaning of so there were quarrels? I cannot understand it..  "
393,"Meaning of ""As roll the waves before the settled wind"" in Byron's ""Don Juan""","From Byron's Don Juan:     ""My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;        But still I think I can collect my mind;   My blood still rushes where my spirit's set,        As roll the waves before the settled wind;   My heart is feminine, nor can forget—        To all, except one image, madly blind;   So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,   As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.     What is the meaning of this line? ""Settled wind"" is a wind that has settled, isn't it? If it has settled, how can any waves roll ahead of it?  "
394,"Meaning of ""So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole, as vibrates my fond heart to my fixed soul""","From Byron's Don Juan:     ""My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;        But still I think I can collect my mind;   My blood still rushes where my spirit's set,        As roll the waves before the settled wind;   My heart is feminine, nor can forget—        To all, except one image, madly blind;   So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,   As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.     What is the meaning of these lines? What kind of needle/pole is it? Why does the needle shake, and why does the pole stand? And why are they compared to her heart? And how can a heart vibrate to a soul? So cryptic.  "
395,"In ""Close Every Door"", why does 'for I know I shall find' change to the plural the second time?","In perhaps the most famous song of the Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, ""Close Every Door"", we see these lyrics:     Close every door to me   Keep those I love from me   Children of Israel are never alone       For I know I shall find   My own peace of mind   For I have been promised   A land of my own   Then later, at the end of the song, we see:     Close every door to me   Keep those I love from me   Children of Israel are never alone      For we know we shall find   Our own peace of mind   For we have been promised   A land of our own    Why does it change to the plural?

396,"Why are the U2 CDs named after ""Songs of Innocence"" and ""Songs of Experience"" by William Blake?","U2 has an album named ""Songs of Innocence"" and a second, more recent album named ""Songs of Experience"". These appear to at least be named after the William Blake poetry. What is the relationship between the CDs and the William Blake poetry? How did the poetry inspire the CDs and song lyrics? "
397,What do these lines mean in the opening paragraph of Peel My Love Like an Onion?,"What does Ana Castillo mean by these lines in Peel My Love Like an Onion?     Yes, he was dark. He still is except that it is not easy to think of him as still existing, and everywhere my gaze turns he isn't there. What's the expression? Water, water everywhere . . . I was full—a vessel, a huge pre-Columbian pot, a copal-burning brassier, a funeral urn, a well, Jill's bucket up and down, a bruja's kettle simmering over the fire.

398,"What did Holmes mean when he referred to Watson's habit ""of telling a story backward""?","In The Problem of Thor Bridge, Holmes begins running through the background of his latest case before telling Watson that he has a client:     ""The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. The interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence. That was the view taken by the coroner's jury and also in the police-court proceedings. It is now referred to the Assizes at Winchester. I fear it is a thankless business. I can discover facts, Watson, but I cannot change them. Unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope for.""      ""Your client?""      ""Ah, I forgot I had not told you. I am getting into your involved habit, Watson, of telling a story backward. You had best read this first.""   While Holmes often takes small jabs at the liberties Watson takes in chronicling his cases for the public, I don't totally understand this comment.  In what way did Holmes consider Watson to be telling some (or all?) of his stories ""backward""? "

400,"What does ""kettle at the heel"" mean in this Yeats poem, ""The Tower""?","   What shall I do with this absurdity —   O heart, O troubled heart — this caricature,   Decrepit age that has been tied to me   As to a dog's tail?        Never had I more   Excited, passionate, fantastical   Imagination, nor an ear and eye   That more expected the impossible —   No, not in boyhood when with rod and fly,   Or the humbler worm, I climbed Ben Bulben's back   And had the livelong summer day to spend.   It seems that I must bid the Muse go pack,   Choose Plato and Plotinus for a friend   Until imagination, ear and eye,   Can be content with argument and deal   In abstract things; or be derided by   A sort of battered kettle at the heel.      ([website]I'm only interested in the first stanza for now. I have mixed feelings  about the first stanza. I like the image of decrepit age being something tied to a dog's tail. It really serves to show how foreign age is to the poet's soul; it is simply not a part of him, but something he tows along.  I like the idea that age excites his imagination more, but when its song is dormant he must content himself with an old friend — Plato or Plotinus, interesting reading choices. He seems to be saying that Plato and Plotinus come in handy until the imagination is ready to soar.  But then, when the poet is ready to sing, when the imagination is ready to soar, there is no song, no beauty. Only this alternate possibility that things will go wrong, and the poet will be derided by a ""battered kettle at the heel"".  What does this phrase even mean? I can only think of a tea kettle. Why would it be battered? What image is he trying to show? What point is he trying to make? "
401,What are the 'holy' and 'broken' Hallelujahs?,"The third verse of ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen goes like this:     You say I took the name in vain    I don't even know the name   But if I did well really what's it to you   There's a blaze of light in every word   It doesn't matter which you heard   The holy or the broken Hallelujah   What is meant by the 'holy' and 'broken' Hallelujahs? Is this a reference to something? "
402,Was Holden Caulfield molested as a child?,"In chapter 24, Holden goes to Mr. Antolini's place to stay for the night. He crashes on the couch, and suddenly is woken up by Mr. Antolini stroking his (Holden's) hair while he sleeps. There are, then, two passages that caught my eye:     I know more damn perverts, at schools and all, than anybody you ever met, and they're always being perverty when I'm around.   and      When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.   Now, throughout the whole book, I'd been getting the impression that Holden was a depressed individual — as in, actually clinically depressed, not just that ""that kind of stuff makes me depressed"" kinda talk he's always having — but was attributing it to his little brother Allie's death.    Then this happens, right near the end of the book, and it seems like it connects a few more things: his apparent depression, why he's sexually awkward (see the scene with the prostitute, and how he describes how ""something always happens"" when he's about to lose his virginity), why he seems to hate adults a lot more than children and younger folks... and why he wants to protect the children as ""the catcher in the rye,"" as he describes to Phoebe in chapter 22.  Furthermore, Holden seems to actually get physically sick after the interaction with Mr. Antolini, mentioning he passed out, and almost vomited several times when he felt like laughing. This bit would suggest, I believe, a physical reaction to what might be, to some degree, repressed memories of past abuse.  Was Holden in fact molested as a child? Is there any other sort of evidence that I'm overlooking here? Perhaps from the book itself, or an earlier draft, or a note from the author? Or, given the many similarities between the narrative in The Catcher in the Rye and Salinger's early life (see here), is it possible that Salinger himself was molested as a child? "
403,"Does Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" promote an anti-religious view?","Rush's Tom Sawyer includes the following line:     No, his mind is not for rent   To any God or government   Always hopeful yet discontent   He knows changes aren't permanent   But change is   Is this arguing that religion is essentially tyrannical? In particular, does the fact that the phrase refers to ""God or government"" imply that there's an equivalence between surrendering to either one (tyrannical government, tyrannical God)? "
404,Does Suzanne Collins intend to write additional fiction?,"Suzanne Collins published a book a year from 2003 - 2010 (most notably The Hunger Games books in 2008, 2009, and 2010). Since then, she only published a 40-page children's book in 2013. Granted, the movies were coming out between 2012 and 2015, but she's only listed as a screenwriter on the first movie, and the final Mockingjay movie came out in November 2015 (over 2 years ago as of the writing of this question).  What have her literary activities been since then? Has she been involved in any significant literary projects since The Hunger Games books (other than the movies)? Has she confirmed involvement in other projects, or stated an intention to become involved in or start a project in the future? "
405,Is the speaker with an on-off switch a reference to Orwell?,"I'm intrigued by this passage in Lois Lowry, The Giver, chapter 10.     He watched as the man rose and moved first to the wall where the speaker was. It was the same sort of speaker that occupied a place in every dwelling, but one thing about it was different. This one had a switch, which the man deftly snapped to the end that said OFF.      Jonas almost gasped aloud. To have the power to turn the speaker off! It was an astonishing thing.   In chapter 20, the Giver implies that the switch controls not only the speaker, but also the microphone that the Giver's secretary listens to.       “You may stay here tonight. I want to talk to you. But you must be quiet now, while I notify your family unit. No one must hear you cry.”      […]      The Giver waited silently . Finally Jonas was able to quiet himself and he sat huddled, his shoulders shaking.       The Giver went to the wall speaker and clicked the switch to ON.      “Yes, Reveiver. How may I help you?”      “Notify the new Receiver's family unit that he will be staying with me tonight, for additional training.”      “I will take care of that, sir. Thank you for your instructions,” the voice said.   Is this trying to reference George Orwell's 1984?  In that novel, too, every apartment has a television that cannot be silenced, so Smith is astonished that the inner party member O'Brien has a television that can be turned off completely.  O'Brien also seemed to imply that turning off the television turns off the surveillance, although O'Brien lied while the Giver tells the truth. "
406,"Meaning of ""Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause"" in Byron's Don Juan","From Byron's Don Juan:      Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less        In company a very pleasant fellow,   Had been the favourite of full many a mess        Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;   And though his meaning they could rarely guess,        Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow   The glorious meed of popular applause,   Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.

407,How much weight should we give authors' declarations of their intent after the fact?,"Very closely related: How much weight is given to authors&#39; intentions in literary analysis?  Related (as an example of what I'm talking about): Is there any textual evidence to support that Dumbledore was gay?  Loosely related: Should Go Set a Watchman change our view of Atticus defending Tom Robinson?   Also related: Discussion in the comments on this answer.  One more example: Ray Bradbury says Fahrenheit 451 isn&#39;t about censorship. Is he right?  Certain authors, such as J. K. Rowling, are notorious for making declarations about the meaning of their text after the fact. One notable example is Rowling's claims that Dumbledore was gay. From what I've read, most people's reaction to that claim fell into one of three camps: that's great, that's terrible, and ""no, she's wrong."" I'm particularly interested in the ""no, she's wrong"" camp.  To the extent that authorial intent is relevant to meaning (and I do realize that that's a controversial point), how much weight should we give to authors' later declarations on meaning? Does there have to be some evidence that they intended that at the time that they actually wrote the book and/or some kind of indication in the text that that their claim is actually true?  To give a concrete example, does it even matter that J. K. Rowling claims that Dumbledore's gay? How much weight (if any) should we give that claim?  Another concrete example: J. K. Rowling has released additional background material (allegedly used as part of her research for the books) - e.g. character sketches, etc. Is there validity to using those for interpretation (or do we just say ""no, not part of the text"")?  Have there been any cases where an author's later claims about the text were clearly refuted?  Important note: I'm not asking about how authorial intent in general is related to meaning (that was already addressed in a linked post) - just how much weight later declarations that aren't clearly settled by the text should be given (like J. K. Rowling's claim). "
408,The author of a literary work disagrees with critics about meaning—who's right?,"I've just come up with a conjecture on what a piece of literature means, but the author has said that they didn't mean for their work to suggest that.  For example, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is often considered an iconic book about censorship, but Bradbury says that he didn't write the book about censorship at all.  Is there a right answer in a case like this, or does it depend on how you analyse the text?  I've read 'How much weight is given to authors&#39; intentions in literary analysis?', but this question approaches the issue from the perspective on an academic, whereas I specifically want to address questions where more casual readers want to check if their theories are 'correct' and how a reader can decide the method of analysis for themselves. "
409,Is House of Leaves' ergodicity preserved as a digital text?,"I've been trying to read House of Leaves for a couple years now, but don't have the opportunity to sit down with a big physical book for long stretches of time. I do, however, have much more time available to read ebooks.  Does the experience of House of Leaves change or diminish as an ebook? I ask particularly because the ergodic artifact quality of House interests me as a graphic designer with a specialty in print media. How effectively does House's ergodicity translate into the digital text? (Is there a particular ebook version which is notably more or less successful in this translation?) "
410,"What is the reason for partial highlighting in ""The Sandman""?","I was just re-reading Preludes and Nocturnes, the first volume of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman. In the story titled The Sound of Her Wings, the following conversation takes place:       Death: You are utterly the stupidest, most self-centered, appallingest excuse for an anthropomorphic personification on this or any other plane!    Here's the part that interests me:     An infantile, adolescent, pathetic specimen!   What is the reason for ""bolding"" only certain parts of these words? Are we supposed to read them by placing stress on these parts, or is it something else?   The reason I ask is because I have never before seen only a part of work being highlighted, unless it was needed to point a mistake (oh, my dear essays). "
411,Why are haiku usually of 17 syllables?,"One of the characteristics of Haiku is that the poems are usually of 17 syllables (5-7-5). Exceptions exist, of course, but 17 is the norm.  Why 17? How did the originators of Haiku come to settle on 17? How does it contribute to a haiku's aesthetics? "
412,Are the five narrators in The Fifty Year Sword more than a gimmick?,"Mark Z. Danielewski's The Fifty Year Sword is told by five narrators whose parts were ostensibly collected in interviews and tightly interleaved. Quoting the first page:     Maybe because the history of any ghost story is a ghost story unto itself, which is to say another story completely, assuming any of what follows can rightly even be considered a ghost story; rather than delve into the devices and biases and oddly canted idiom of the five persons—one of whom in the early years slept with another and now endlessly wonders about the lakes of fall where someone else once wandered; two of whom still nurture their affection for one another, expressing so in an array of notes and overseas phone calls; a fourth who lost three; and the last of whom from the prison of a later life hates them all—or represent them throughout with characterizing phrases, temporal references, and even more quotation marks hopelessly nested within reiterating nests of still more marks; to delineate their respective and independently conducted interviews, colored quotation marks are used instead: "" = 1, "" = 2, "" = 3, "" = 4, "" = 5"". Where no quotations appear only the worst should be assumed: an interruption by someone other than one of the before mentioned persons, the reader or even the author who additionally, it must be stated, has done nothing more than lend together these gathered and rerelated bits so as to here present a pretty peculiar and perhaps altogether alternate history of one October evening in East Texas.—MD   All typos and emphasis mine. The five quotation marks are actually in different colours in the book  It's been a few years since I read the book, but I didn't get the impression that the different narrators actually affect the way the story is told, where I would really expect an unreliable and in parts contradictory narrative. The text is simply broken into segments of various lengths (usually around one or two lines), each given to a different narrator. I couldn't even really extract any characterisations of the individual narrators, or match the five people described above with the five different colours.  Is this background story and the use of the five different quotation marks just a gimmick or can we actually extract additional meaning from who narrates what part? What about the italicised part in the above quote? Seeing how much effort Danielewski put into every single detail of some of his other works, I'd be surprised if the narrative wasn't assigned carefully to the individual narrators, so I'm wondering whether the additional meaning is actually there but was just lost on me due to not paying enough attention? "
413,"Is the haiku in ""You Only Live Twice"" by Bashō?","Ian Fleming's Bond novel You Only Live Twice has one of my favourite poems:     You only live twice   Once when you're born   And once when you look death in the face.   According to the Wikipedia article, this is merely  ""in the style of ... Bashō."" There are claims that this haiku is actually by Bashō (this Time.com article, for example). Is the haiku really by Bashō, or did Fleming pen it himself?  If it is by Bashō, what is the original Japanese version? "
414,What differences in attitude can be seen in the text of Twilight and Midnight Sun?,"Stephenie Meyer's four-book Twilight series has an unofficial and lesser-known companion novel, Midnight Sun, which retells the story of the first novel Twilight from Edward's point of view instead of Bella's. Meyer never completed this book, but a draft version was leaked on the internet and has since been made freely available on Meyer's website. According to Wikipedia, the reason Meyer never finished this project was due to her own change of heart about the story:     If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely.   It's unclear from this quote exactly how and why Meyer's attitude changed, but clear that it did. Authorial intent aside, however, I'm curious about how, if at all, this change in attitude comes across in the actual text - whether it could be guessed or deduced at all from a close reading.  Are there differences in tone between Twilight and (the published part of) Midnight Sun which correspond to the author's change of heart about the story?  In other words, does the text of Midnight Sun differ in its portrayal of the Cullens, or any other characters, from the text of Twilight? "
415,Why are there so many references to Moneylenders and Jews in 19th century fiction?,"In 19th century fiction, there are a lot of references to moneylenders as ""Jews"".  For example, in ""Framley Parsonage"", by Anthony Trollope, Lord Lufton says ""the pocket-books of the Jews are stuffed full of his dishonoured papers"".  What is the purpose of these references? Would 19th century readers have assumed that the moneylenders were all Jewish, or would they have taken this for a careless reference to moneylenders in general? "
416,Understanding preemptive penance and absolution,"In Philip Pullman's novel The Amber Spyglass, we're told that the Consistorial Court has developed doctrines of ""preemptive penance and absolution"":     ""Father President,"" said Father Gomez at once, ""I have done preemptive penance every day of my adult life. I have studies, I have trained--""      The President held up his hand. Preemptive penance and absolution were doctrines researched and developed by the Consistorial Court, but not known to the wider Church. They involved doing penance for a sin not yet committed, intense and fervent penance accompanied by scourging and flagellation, so as to build up, as it were, a store of credit. When the penance had reached the appropriate level for a particular sin, the penitent was granted absolution in advance, though he might never be called on to commit the sin. It was sometimes necessary to kill people, for example; and it was so much less troubling for the assassin if he could do so in a state of grace.   I have a few questions about these doctrines:   Is this a reference to a real-life doctrine in a real-life religion? Are these doctrines compatible with real-world Christianity? What does the fact that these doctrines exist tell us about the Consistorial Court and the ""wider Church""?  "
417,"Why did the characters in ""No Exit"" agree to torment each other?","Once the characters in No Exit realized that they were placed there to torment each other, why didn't they refuse to do so? When Joseph says ""eh bien, continuons"" (""very well, let's get on with it"") at the end, is he implicitly consenting to participate in this? What's the significance of his agreement (or at least lack of refusal) in Sartre's overall philosophy? In the context of the story (and Sartre's philosophy), could the characters possibly have refused and what might have happened if they had? "
418,What rough beast slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?,"   Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity.       Surely some revelation is at hand;Surely the Second Coming is at hand.The Second Coming! Hardly are those words outWhen a vast image out of Spiritus MundiTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desertA shape with lion body and the head of a man,A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,Is moving its slow thighs, while all about itReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.The darkness drops again; but now I knowThat twenty centuries of stony sleepWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?    Yeats says basically everything in this poem except what the rough beast it is. So what's the answer?  "
419,Political allegory in Lukyanenko's Watch series?,"The Watch series by Sergei Lukyanenko describes the often bloodless struggle between the Night Watch and the Day Watch. It's a sort of cold war in which each side is only permitted to attack members of the other side if they break the Treaty in some way, this rule being upheld by the Inquisition which stands above both Watches.  There's a great deal of discussion throughout the books of the nature of the Watches and the struggle between them. Anton's - and by extension, the reader's - nuanced perception changes quite a lot during the course of the series. After just having read a long conversation in Twilight Watch between Anton and Gesar about this, I was struck (not for the first time) by the thought:  can the Night and Day Watches be interpreted as some kind of political allegory?  I don't know much about the author's political views, but negativity towards America and the west comes across several times in the text, so perhaps the Watches can be seen as symbolising the two sides in the Cold War? Or perhaps they represent different political factions within Russia? (Again, I know nothing about Russian politics, so this may be a stupid suggestion.)  I'm looking for answers based on connecting clues from the text to actual facts about politics. Authorial-intent answers with quotes from Lukyanenko would also be welcome, but please don't post answers just based on your own political views unless you can back them up with something more concrete. This is a literary question, not a political soapbox. "
420,Did Viktor Frankl ever publish his manuscript?,"I am currently in the middle of Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. Twice thus far, he mentioned a manuscript that he brought with him to Auschwitz, and lost there.  When he first arrives in camp, and the prisoners' belongings are confiscated:     No one could yet grasp the fact that everything would be taken away.      I tried to take one of the old prisoners into my confidence.   Approaching him furtively, I pointed to the roll of paper in the inner   pocket of my coat and said, ""Look, this is the manuscript of a   scientific book. I know what you will say; that I should be grateful   to escape with my life, that that should be all I can expect of fate.   But I cannot help myself. I must keep this manuscript at all costs; it   contains my life's work. Do you understand that?""   Viktor E. Frankl. Man's Search for Meaning. 1959. Translated by Ilse Lasch, Beacon House, 2006. Part I, p 14  Frankl was not able to keep his manuscript. Later, he attempted to reconstruct it from memory while still in the camps:     To avoid these attacks of delirium, I tried, as did many of the   others, to keep awake for most of the night. For hours I composed   speeches in my mind. Eventually I began to reconstruct the manuscript   which I had lost in the disinfection chamber of Auschwitz, and   scribbled the key words in shorthand on tiny scraps of paper.   p 35  Did Viktor Frankl ever publish this manuscript? Where can I find it? "
421,What view of marriage is presented in Jude the Obscure?,"Thomas Hardy's gut-wrenching tragedy Jude the Obscure includes a lot of discussion of the concept of marriage, from various different characters, some of whose views even change over the course of the novel.  In some ways, married relationships are portrayed as unloving and unsuccessful (Jude and Arabella, Sue and Mr Phillotson), in contrast to the 'freer' nature of a non-marital relationship. On the other hand, Jude and Sue face many difficulties due to being unmarried, and perhaps their lives would have ended up better if they had got married. Is there any consistent underlying message here?  Overall, what view of marriage does Jude the Obscure promote - positive or negative? "
422,Did Twain mean the coin should be enlarged or not?,"In Twain's quote about government's ostensibly trusting in God and asserting that on their currency, I have seen it reproduced both this way:     But I think it would better read, ""Within certain judicious   limitations we trust in God,"" and if there isn't enough room on the   coin for this, why enlarge the coin.   ...and this way:     But I think it would better read, ""Within certain judicious   limitations we trust in God,"" and if there isn't enough room on the   coin for this, why, enlarge the coin.   The comma after the ""why"" changes the meaning entirely. Which is accurate?  In either case, it seems something is missing. If the first case, it would read better with a question mark:     ..., why enlarge the coin?""   ...and in the second case, with an exclamation mark:     ..., why, enlarge the coin!""   Which is right/accurate, or did he sometimes write/say it one way, and other times another? "
423,The literary study of scientific argument,"I just discovered the book The Literary Structure of Scientific Argument: Historical Studies, edited by Peter Dear (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991). To me, that seems like an oxymoron: how can scientific arguments be literary?  Is this just someone doing weird things, or is there actually an argument for treating scientific arguments as literary texts? "
424,Could Ozymandias be interpreted as referring to the power of the Church/pope?,"The poem's central line that establishes the theme of power:     ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:   Does the ""king of kings"" part happen to be a subtle reference to the English papacy by any chance? I don't know much about the European church system (not that I'm supposed to know anyway, given that I'm from South Asia), but it did come up in a few chapters of our History textbook. There were only 2/3 paragraphs at best on that topic and from what I've gathered, the Church used to wield more power than any king in Europe (I've no idea how much geographic area it spans). So basically the pope (the head of the Church) ruled over all the kings and could arguably be called the ""king of kings"". Sorry if I get anything horrendously wrong.  So, is Percy Shelley condemning the extent of the Church's power here? I'm aware this theory/interpretation is far too far-fetched to be what Percy really intended to convey, but it does explain the line somewhat.  Note  It seems that there has been an misunderstanding. All the answers below address whether the pope, at any point in history, used to be referred to as ""king of kings"" either informally or as an official title. But I never did suggest such a thing in the first place. I meant that because the pope had once been powerful I suppose calling him ""king of kings"" would not be too unreasonable. I was merely inviting the idea of the pope being a possible candidate for the ""king of kings"" Percy talks of here. I certainly didn't mean that the pope really could have ever been called so.  Again, don't get me wrong: I never claim the Pope is necessarily a good candidate for Ozymandias. I was simply suggesting the notion of that being possible to some extent. The very purpose of this question was opening this up to more interpretation. Note that I also say: ""I'm aware this theory/interpretation is far too far-fetched to be what Percy really intended to convey [...]"". I've admitted myself that I don't find the whole thing being very likely either. "
425,What were John Galt's criteria for being invited to Galt's Gulch?,"Those who are in Galt's Gulch are there by invitation only. Dagny crashed the gate, but was clearly still on the future invite list. However, I find it interesting who got invited to Galt's Gulch and why. The obvious invitees are the high-performing titans of industry such as Hank Rearden, Dagny, Ellis Wyatt, and Ken Danagger.   But the more-surprising invitees include the following:    the young brakeman of the Comet the nameless writer -- ""fishwife"" in the valley (possibly an autobiographical insertion) the young woman who owned the bakery shop and her two sons Kay Ludlow (the actress)   None of these were industrialists nor titans of industry. Though, we can safely assume that they were ideologically sound, which is to say they believed in meritocracy, capitalism, objective reality, etc. But if ideology is the only criterion, then is Rand suggesting that the few hundred people who lived in the valley were the ONLY people on earth with that ideology? Seems doubtful. Were they just lucky to have been discovered by one of the agents or a member of the valley? An elite few who had the right ideas and were lucky enough to know someone in Galt's secret network? "
426,Do the new characters ever wonder about olders muses of Robert Langdon?,"I was reading The Origin by Dan Brown, and wondered if Ambra Vidal ever thought about whatever happened to Sienna Brooks - Langdon's muse from Inferno? Or Sienna must have vetted Langdon knowing his past, did she ever wonder what happened to Sophie Neveu - Langdon's muse from The Da Vinci Code?   To be more specific, when a new character meets with Langdon, they might also remember his previous adventures but they never seem to mention... even in a casual conversation, and that makes me curious. Considering all Langdon novels are a journey, the new characters do not much muse over the previous stories or victories.  Also, the other way around .. does Langdon keep in touch with any of his previous muses? Except for Sienna, I think he ended on a decently good note with everyone including Sophie Nauve, Vittoria Vetra, etc. "
427,Is Hemingway too much (too difficult) to read for persons with no experience in reading novels?,"I have never really read novels in my life and I am 26 years old. I recently graduated with Masters in Math and now, when I have spare time, I want to start reading novels. Of course there are thousands of places where I can start but I am thinking about giving Hemingway a chance. The Old Man and the Sea has caught my attention.  My native language is Swedish but I am more or less fluent in English and I want to read in English.  I am wondering if Hemingway will be to difficult for me to understand fully? I don't remember doing anything in literature classes in High School. Do you think Hemingway is too much for a newbie, or should I be able to enjoy and understand his points? Thanks. "
428,"What is the literary origin of the ability to sense somebody else's powers or ""force""?","""The force is strong with this one"" is apparently a trope and its meaning has already been discussed in Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy SE. The Star Wars franchise started in 1977, but the ability to sense somebody else powers is also an element in Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea cycle, the first novel of which was published in 1968, almost a decade before Star Wars. In Earthsea, someone with magic powers (including witches) can sense whether someone else also has these abilities, even when they are underdeveloped. However, an untrained person who has this gift does not seem to have this ability.  Robert Heinlein's novella Magic, Inc. (1940) has a ""witch smeller"", but I am not sure this person has any magic or supernatural abilities similar to that of a witch. So it may not be an example of what I am looking for. All the other works listed in the article Supernatural Sensitivity in the All The Tropes Wiki are more recent than Le Guin's first Eathsea stories.   I don't know if Ursula Le Guin invented this trope; I assume it is older. So where does it come from? In other words, what is the oldest work of literature that use this trope? "
429,Where did the Deserters go?,"After Directive 10-289 went into effect, there were a large number of people who simply couldn't stand living under the circumstances created by the directive anymore and simply vanished. Most of them don't appear to have joined the Strike; at a minimum, when Dagny went to the Valley, Pat Logan (engineer of the Comet, and engineer on the first freight train on the John Galt Line) was apparently not there (even though on the face of it he seems like he'd be an excellent candidate for joining the Strike). Where exactly were they going, and how did they survive? Are there any clues in the book as to their ultimate fate? "
430,Story about school kids who go on a field trip to a fort,"Help me remember the name of this book from my youth.  I don't remember much about it but it was the story of a group of school kids who go on a field trip to a fort. I think something happens at the fort, like they are transported back in time and experience life in colonial (civil war maybe) time. They may have even taken part in resisting a siege. I know that isn't much to go on, but I'd love to find it and re-read it :)  Here are my responses to the Guide for this type of question:  When did you read the story, and how old was it?  I read the story when I was a kid, so I'd say at least 20 years ago, and I have no idea if it was an old book already at that time.  Medium and appearance  I do not remember what the cover looked like, but I remember it was a book, and not a magazine or a story from a textbook or anything like that.  My feeling was that it was a typical length for a YA book, probably no more that 200 pages.  What language did you read it in, and was it translated?  English, and I doubt if it was translated but you never know!  Where did you read this story?  It is very likely that I read this story either in the public library, or I checked it out from the library.  I did a lot of ""summer reading"" events when I was a kid and I took crap-tons of books out of the library in those days. "
431,"Meaning of this line from ""Birches""","I was reading ""Birches"" by Robert Frost. I am having difficulty in understanding the meaning of a line.  Please refer to this link for the full poem: [website]What is the meaning of this line:     They click upon themselves      As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored      As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.   What does ""click upon themselves"" mean? Does it mean that the trees collide with other trees and exhibit a to and fro motion or does it mean that the trees hit the ground and then return back to their original position? I could not understand how ""and turn many-colored/ As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel"". How do they turn many colored and does ""enamel"" here mean the ice covering the bark of the tree or the bark of the tree itself? "
432,What does the top of the bird-catcher's head look like?,"In The New Yorker issue of 13 February 2013, Brad Leithauser discussed some of Robert Graves's love poems, including the quatrain ""Love Without Hope"". (I think the poem is still copyrighted, even though it has been reproduced on many websites.)   The poem's second verse says the bird-catcher,     Swept off his tall hat to the Squire’s own daughter,    Leithauser comments (my emphasis),      Normally, the sweeping off of a tall hat would suggest elegance, but not here. (We know what the top of his head must look like.)   Really? Why is this worth mentioning? (If it's just an ordinary bunch of hair, why even mention it?) What would the top of the bird-catcher's head look like? "
433,Is Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 an unreliable narrator?,"In a recent discussion in on online course about How to Read a Novel, someone suggested that Winston Smith in Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four is an unreliable narrator. L. Kip Wheeler's glossary of ""Literary Terms and Defnitions"" defines unreliable narrator as     An imaginary storyteller or character who describes what he witnesses with surface accuracy, but misinterpets those events because of faulty perception, personal bias, or limited understanding. Often the writer or poet creating such an unreliable narrator leaves clues so that readers will perceive the unreliablity and question the interpretations offered. Examples of unreliable narrators arguably include ""Geoffrey the pilgrim"" in the  Canterbury Tales , the character of Forest Gump in the movie of the same name, and possibly Wilson in ""The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber.""    (Wikipedia has an article about the concept of unreliable narrator, with a list of examples.)  As a narrator, Winston Smith does not appear to be intent on hiding certain facts from the reader, so in what way can he be considered as an unreliable narrator? Or is he reliable after all? "
434,"In Early Modern English, how did 'see' semantically shift to mean 'note/record'?","John McWhorter PhD Linguistics (Stanford).  Words on the Move (2016). p. 86. Emboldening mine.       Commonly we are told that Shakespeare's language is    ""high,"" such that the challenge can be met by making a    certain effort. Related to this is the idea that Shakespeare's    language is poetic, requiring more effort to process than    the phraseology of Neil Simon. Then someone will say that    the language comes across best with careful acting technique,    ideally wielded by British people.     All claims except the one about Brits are true. However,    many will be nagged by a feeling that there is more to the    story, and there is. When, in Hamlet, Polonius opens his    farewell speech to Laertes (""Neither a borrower nor a lender    be"") with ""And these few precepts in thy memory / See thou    character,"" rising to a challenge can take us only so far. We    can indeed process precepts, thy, and thou with the aforesaid    rising. But what does Polonius mean by character? Neither    intonation, facial expression, being British, nor rising will    get across that in Shakespeare's time that word meant    ""write,"" as in the characters that one writes. Polonius is    telling Laertes, in short, ""Note these things well.""    Please compare the two emboldened imperatives.  I can understand how ‘character’ signified writing. But how did ‘see’ semantically shift to signify ‘note/record’? I.e., even after this explanation, this meaning of 'see' still feels bizarre. Can someone please make it more natural?   I tried [website]"
435,Erma before the greener grass,"I remember when Erma Bombeck's ""The Grass Is Always Greener over the Septic Tank"" came out.  Everyone was talking about and sharing copies of the book. It was probably the first non-Scifi work that got my attention. When her next work ""If Life is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I Doing in the Pits?"" came out, we all had to read it as well.    I know she had a column and a couple of books that where published prior to the The Grass... but I don't recall them getting the wider audience that followed the The Grass...  Did ""The Grass Is Always Greener over the Septic Tank"" promote her to name to general recognition? If so what was her following prior to that?   "
436,What does it mean to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword?,"In A Game of Thrones, Chapter 24, when Tyrion Lannister visits Winterfell on the way back from the Wall:     “Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as   long as he wishes to stay,” Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the   Lord. His sword was across his knees, the steel bare for all the world   to see. Even Bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an   unsheathed sword.   What did it mean to do so? Is this a point of medieval Western tradition of hospitality that's being referenced here, or something internal to the Seven Kingdoms that's as yet unexplained? "
437,How does the ring end up where Déagol found it?,In the Lord of the Rings series Sméagol/Gollum murders his friend Déagol for the ring.  It is also stated that Déagol found the ring in Gladden Fields.  How did the ring get there? And which book this is described in? 
438,"How is William Carlos Williams's affection expressed in ""The Red Wheelbarrow""?","In the poem ""The Red Wheelbarrow"" by William Carlos Williams, there is no specific mention of any person. However, he wrote that the poem ""sprang from affection"" for an old man named Marshall, to paraphrase. How does this affection for Marshall come through in the poem? Is it visible in the subtext of the poem? "
439,"Are quote marks used selectively in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" or do I have a bad scan of the book?","I've just begun reading The Handmaid's Tale and I'm a bit distracted by the usage (or non-usage) of quote marks in the version I have (ebook).  In the second chapter, the handmaid is describing her arrival at the house and her initial meeting with the lady of the house.    In the version of the book I have, none of this dialogue between the two women uses quote marks.  But later on, when talking with another handmaiden, there are quotes.    Is this a part of the printed version of the book or is this a scan error like some of the misspellings I see scattered about? In general, there aren't any missing characters, so it seems unlikely that they are so consistently missing.  If it is intentional on the part of the author, is there any explanation for this choice? "
440,Is there a canonical map of Thomas Hardy's Wessex?,"Most if not all of Thomas Hardy's novels are set in the fictional(ish) English region of Wessex. He uses many real towns and locations as settings, but gives them fictional names: for instance, Oxford becomes ""Christminster"" and Dorchester becomes ""Casterbridge"". (Both of these towns are in Wessex, which shows how massive that region must be.)  My edition of Tess of the d'Urbervilles includes a lengthy table mapping real locations to the fictional names they're given in the books. Presumably most of these correspondences can be deduced directly from the text of the novel, by looking closely at the spatial relationships between different locations therein. Some of them also include wordplay which makes the connection obvious.  More interestingly, another of my Hardy books (possibly The Mayor of Casterbridge) includes a map of the region of Wessex, divided into subdomains with names such as Near Wessex, Outer Wessex, and East Wessex. (I'm guessing here, since I can't remember the exact phrases, but most of them were in the form ""something Wessex"".)  My question is: how canonical is this map? Or more generally, what canon information is available on the exact boundaries of Wessex within the real England?  Did Hardy himself ever draw a map of his Wessex, or write out a table of correspondences between real places and the names he used for them in his books? "
441,Why did SAQ get re-translated?,"Some Answered Questions was first published into English in 1908, but was ""extensively retranslated"" in 2014. Why was a retranslation needed?  I assume it has to do with the dual origin of the English and Persian interview notes, and the relative (un)reliability of the English source. That'd mean the new edition draws on both the Persian and English originals but I can't find any confirmation of this--and if it's so, why didn't they also retranslate the 1908 French version? It's a semi-authoritative religious text, so this sort of thing does matter. "
442,Why did Jo consider Ned and Jack to be failures?,"In Jo's Boys in chapter 5, it is stated,      Jack and Ned sent regrets and best wishes, and no one mourned their absence; for they were among what Mrs. Jo called her failures.   Why were these two in particular considered to be failures? From the second chapter of Little Men (as well as other incidents in the book), we know that Jack is a greedy dastard, so I'd expect that vice to be what Jo is disapproving of. In Ned's case, chapter 2 of Little Men says he is a bully. But are we expected to believe that he continues to be a bully?  In chapter 15 of Jo's Boys, it is stated,      ...while good-hearted Ned traveled all the way from Chicago to press their hands and say, with a tear in his eye: ‘I was so anxious to hear all about the dear old boy, I couldn’t keep away.’    The text describes Ned as kind-hearted, so one might expect that he has improved somewhat. For that matter, the other times Jack is mentioned in Jo's Boys don't seem to paint him negatively. So why does Jo consider them failures?  "
443,Did Lady Macbeth communicate signs of her instability prior to the blood scene?,"I'm looking back on Macbeth, and I'm wondering something that's piqued my interest again. There's a very well-known scene in Macbeth: the blood-spot scene, the hand-washing scene, and other such names. In it, Lady Macbeth goes... somewhat insane:     Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?--Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.     Before this point, though, I'm struggling to figure out whether Lady Macbeth was foreshadowed to break under stress. She's mostly been removed from the focus of the play at this point, but Shakespeare draws our attention back to her with the intent to communicate that she, too, suffers for her crimes.  Was any breakdown of sanity foreshadowed or hinted at earlier in the play? Is there something I just missed, or is this supposed to be as sudden as it is in practice? "

445,"Did Strugatsky brothers ever comment on ""predicting"" the Kasparov-Karpov World Chess rivalry?","In the foundational novel of their Noon universe, ""Noon, XXII century"" (""Полдень, XXII век""), published in 1961, Strugatsky brothers ""predicted"" the notorious Kasparov-Karpov World Chess rivalry and championship:     Задача получила название «Буриданов баран». С молодого мериноса был снят биологический код по методу Каспаро-Карпова в тот момент, когда этот меринос находился между двумя кормушками с комбикормом. Этот код в сочетании с некоторыми дополнительными данными о баранах вообще был введен в КРИ. От машины требовалось: а) предсказать, какую кормушку меринос выберет, и б) дать психофизиологическое обоснование этого выбора.  (Google Books link)   (Стругацкий А.Н., Стругацкий Б.Н., ""Полдень. ХХII век"", ""ЧАСТЬ ЧЕТВЕРТАЯ. БЛАГОУСТРОЕННАЯ ПЛАНЕТА"" - ""3. ЗАГАДКА ЗАДНЕЙ НОГИ)      The task was called ""Buridan's sheep."" A young male sheep had his biological code taken using Kasparo-Karpov method at the moment when the Merino was between the two feeders. This code, combined with some additional generic data on the rams, was fed to KRI system. The task was: a) to predict which the feeder Merino would choose, and b) give a psycho-physiological rationale for this choice.   (A.N. Strugatsky, B.N. Strugatsky, ""Noon, XXII Century."" ""Part Four - comfortable planet."" - ""3. The mystery of the hind legs"". Translated by myself)   Did the authors ever comment on that ""prediction""? Did they take credit for it, Nostradamus-style?

446,Why are there no elevators in the silo in Wool?,"The silo is very large, with more than one hundred floors. There are people whose whole jobs are to transport things up and down through the silo itself. I feel like with everything else they created, they'd find elevators useful. (Especially because the climb can take days, depending how far you need to go, which is part of the plot in one part.)  Is there an in-universe reason for why they went with just stairs? (Maintenance concerns, maybe?)  "
447,What is the oldest literary award?,"The Wikipedia page for literary awards lists inauguration dates for international awards, and of those the earliest of those is the Nobel Prize in 1901. However, I don't know about non-international awards, nor does the page for the Nobel Prize indicate it is the first prize in literature. Apparently the oldest prize for British literature is the James Tait Black Memorial Prize from 1919.  So, what is the oldest literary award given on a regular basis (international or not, not necessarily still running)? Was there anything before the Nobel Prize? "
448,"Was ""First They Came ..."" a poem in German?","As I mentioned in another question, I have seen inconsistencies in the recounting of the poem, First They Came .... This led me to look it up and find out that the English poem comes from a collection of interviews. I understand that it is based on speeches, but was it ever delivered as a poem in German? Was that prior to its English publication? "
449,Why did Miep Gies write Anne Frank Remembered in English instead of Dutch?,"Miep Gies was one of the persons who helped Anne Frank's family and several other people hide in the ""secret annex"". She also managed to retrieve Anne Frank's diary after the inhabitants of the secret annex had been arrested.   Miep Gies later wrote Anne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped to Hide the Frank Family in collaboration with Alison Leslie Gold and published it in 1987, 40 years after the first publication of Anne Frank's diary.  Miep Gies originated from Austria, not the Netherlands, but had lived in the Netherlands since the age of nine. She was fluent in Dutch by the time the Frank family moved to Amsterdam. When I read the Dutch translation of Anne Frank Remembered, I could not find any reason or argument in it for writing the book in English instead of Dutch. I could not find anything about this on Alison Leslie Gold's webpage about the book, nor on the website MiepGies.nl (see e.g. New edition of book by Miep Gies and the FAQ). So why was the book written in English? I know that Alison Leslie Gold is American (and probably didn't know Dutch), which then leads to the question why Miep Gies collaborated with her instead of a native speaker of Dutch? "
450,What does Thomas More try to do with Greek puns in Utopia?,"Thomas More uses Greek puns such as Hythloday that means speaker of nonsense, etc. What is he trying to do? What difference would it make for Greek readers and non-Greek readers?  "
451,What do you call a break in rhyming in the middle of a book / poem for dramatic effect,"Here's what I'm trying to say.  I'm creating a children's book for a school project. I've been tasked to identify some literary devices used throughout the book.  There is a section of the book which I want to highlight because it represents a major event. There's rhyming throughout the book. However, when the major event happens, the rhyming suddenly stops to produce a dramatic and eerie effect. I'm having trouble identifying what exactly this is.  What would you call that break in rhyming? Would it be considered a literary device?       ...      They built houses and cities, what a marvellous sight.   Oh how amazing it was, it just felt so right.            *Rhyming stops*        But it all came down suddenly.   They had nothing left.   It all fell, like the trees they cut.        *Rhyming starts again*                   &emsp;&emsp;*Story continues and rhyming persists till     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;     end of book*      Thanks in advance.

452,"Was T. S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land"" plagiarised?","This Q&amp;A mention accusations of plagiarism levelled at T. S. Eliot in the context of his famous poem ""The Waste Land"". There seems to be a lot of information about this on the internet, for example Plagiarism Today and the linked Cracked article, but I couldn't easily distil the important points to understand what's going on here. What was the origin of these accusations? How prevalent have they been, and how much credit should we give them? What's the evidence for and against ""The Waste Land"" being plagiarised, and from whom? "
453,What was Fausts purpose?,"It seems like at the end of Faust II, he has realized what he should do. Shortly before that, he kills humans on his quest to help humanity. So what exactly is his new purpose, except that he has given up his power?   Was his whole journey just about experiencing different forms of things he would think he enjoys, to realize they aren't what he wants, and is happy just existing?  Or in other words, if he knew what he knows now at the beginning of the book, what would he have done? Continued his research? Nothing at all? Something completely different? "
454,"What is ""the dark simple curtain"" in Ted Hughes' ""Criminal Ballad""?","In the poem ""Criminal Ballad"", Ted Hughes describes a chain of tragedies happening in parallel with a man's simple moments of life. One of these is the following:     And when he ran and got his toy squealing with delight   An old man pulled from under the crush of metal   Gazed towards the nearby polished shoes   And slowly forgot the deaths in Homer   The sparrowfall natural economy   Of the dark simple curtain   I'm trying to understand how the images in the last two lines are related to each other. So, the ""sparrowfall"" image is easy:     ""'Sparrowfall' refers us to Matthew 10:29, where Christ is comforting   the disciples by telling them that God's providence [...] covers   everything, even the smallest details such as man himself would   forget. For Hughes, this is no comfort to the old man at his death.""   — Craig Robinson (1989). Ted Hughes As Shepherd Of Being, p. 61. Palgrave Macmillan.   Also, it might be helpful to note that Hamlet makes the same biblical reference, saying that ""there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow"".  Then, when reading Matthew 10:29, we can also see that the ""sparrowfall"" is given in the context of commerce, and thus we can understand the meaning of ""natural economy"":     Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.   — Matthew 10:29, King James Bible   But what does a ""dark simple curtain"" have to do with it?  "
455,How could Francisco d’Anconia work for Reardon without breaking his oath?,"When Hank Reardon was finally ready to join the Strike, he found that Francisco had already been working for him as a furnace superintendent - and, characteristically, as a very good one.  Clearly, the main reason Francisco was there was so that he could be sure to be at hand when Reardon was ready. With that said, how could he do even that without violating his oath to the Strike?  The other strikers either went to the Valley full-time right away (e.g. the ""later"" strikers like Roger Marsh and Ellis Wyatt), retired if they had the savings to do so (e.g. William Hastings), or worked unskilled jobs (e.g. Owen Kellogg, John Galt). At one point, Francisco was even forced to (reluctantly) decline Hank Reardon's job offer on the grounds that it would violate his oath. So, why does he do so now? "
456,Is Paul Fry correct in saying that modern hermeneutic approaches largely developed due to the Protestant Reformation?,"In lecture 3 of his Introduction to the Theory of Literature Yale Open Course, Prof. Paul Fry makes the following claim:     ... the notion of hermeneutics arises primarily in religion first, specifically in the Christian tradition, but that isn’t to say that there hasn’t been, that there wasn’t long before the moment at which hermeneutics became important in Christianity, that there wasn’t centuries’ worth of Talmudic scholarship which is essentially also hermeneutic in nature–that is, to say concerned with the art and basis of interpretation.      What gave rise in the Western world to what is called “hermeneutics” was in fact the Protestant Reformation. And there’s a lot of significance in that, I think, and I’ll try to explain why. You don’t really puzzle your head about questions of interpretation, how we determine the validity of interpretation and so on, until A) meaning becomes terribly important to you, and B) the ascertainment of meaning becomes difficult. You may say to yourself, “Well, isn’t it always the case that meaning is important and that meaning is hard to construe?” Well, not necessarily. If you are a person whose sacred scripture is adjudicated by the Pope and the occasional tribunal of church elders, you yourself don’t really need to worry very much about what scripture means. You are told what it means. It goes without saying therefore what it means. But in the wake of the Protestant Reformation when the question of one’s relationship with the Bible became personal and everyone was understood, if only through the local minister, to be engaged with coming to an understanding of what is after all pretty difficult–who on earth knows what the Parables mean and so on, and the whole of the Bible poses interpretative difficulties–then of course you are going to have to start worrying about how to interpret it. Needless to say, since it’s a sacred scripture, the meaning of it is important to you. You do want to know what it means. It can’t mean just anything. It’s crucial to you to know exactly what it means and why what it means is important.   Is this an accurate description of where hemeneutics came from? For example, is his implication that the Roman Catholic Church played little to no role in the development of Western hermeneutic methods correct? "
457,Was Francisco d'Anconia's deliberate destruction of his competitors counterproductive to the purpose of the Strike?,"Related: Why was Francisco d&#39;Anconia amused by Ellis Wyatt&#39;s imminent demise?  When describing what a playboy Francisco d'Anconia had supposedly become (including throwing wild and ridiculously expensive parties, his supposed womanizing, etc.), we find the following passage:     ... [Dagny Taggart] read the accounts of the business ventures he undertook at length intervals; the ventures were spectacularly successful and ruined his competitors, but he indulged in them as in an occasional sport, staging a sudden raid, then vanishing from the industrial scene for a year or two, leaving d'Anconia Copper to the management of his employees.   It turns out, of course, that he was actively destroying his company the entire time, as well as several of his competitors, Taggart Transcontinental, the Phoenix-Durango, Ellis Wyatt, and a host of other businesses.  One particularly notable example was the San Sebastian Mines incident, which both Dagny and Jim Taggart later described as a ""rotten swindle."" When Dagny went to see d'Anconia to confront him about the incident, she accused him of knowing full well that the mines would eventually be nationalized (and were of little value anyway):     ""You knew, before you bought that property, that Mexico was in the hands of a looters' government... you knew that they'd seize those mines sooner or later. What you were after is your American stockholders.""   ""That's true."" He was looking straight at her, he was not smiling, his face was earnest. He added, ""That's part of the truth.""...   ""You had exhausted every other form of depravity and sought a new thrill by swindling people like Jim and his friends, in order to watch them squirm. I don't know what sort of corruption could make anyone enjoy that, but that's what you came to New York to see, at the right time.""   ""They certainly provided a spectacle of squirming on the grand scale. Your brother James in particular.""   ""They're rotten fools, but in this case their only crime was that they trusted you. They trusted your name and your honor.""   Again, she saw the look of earnestness and knew with certainty that it was genuine, when he said, ""Yes. They did. I know it.""   ""And do you find it amusing?""   ""No. I don't find it amusing at all.""   He was, however (as pointed out in the linked Q&amp;A), vastly amused by the destruction of the Mexican Planners, and even more amused by the fact that Ellis Wyatt was going to be wiped out. He was also fully aware that the Phoenix-Durango railroad was wiped out as a direct result of his actions, and that Dan Conway had been forced into retirement.  Given that part of the point of the Strike in the first place was to prove that looter governments would eventually collapse when they were deprived of people to enable them, was the fact that Francisco d'Anconia (and, for that fact, Ragnar Danneskjöld) was deliberately destroying the economy contrary to that goal? "
458,What is the significance of naming the djinni Bartimaeus?,"In the Bartimaeus trilogy, the main character is the eponymous djinni Bartimaeus, a demon/spirit from ""the Other Place"" who is cheeky, witty, boastful, and at times surprisingly deep.  Bartimaeus, however, is also the name of a man in the New Testament of the Bible. What's the connection there? Does the name in Jonathan Stroud's novels come from this Biblical Bartimaeus, or from somewhere else? Why? "
459,Where and how did James Joyce condemn Hamlet as a failure?,"Earlier this year, someone asked Why did T.S. Eliot make a statement that 'Coriolanus' was Shakespeare's masterpiece and that 'Hamlet' was an artistic failure?  If the Wikipedia article about William H. Quillian's book Hamlet and the New Poetic (1983) is to be believed, both     T. S. Eliot and James Joyce condemned the play [i.e. Shakespeare's Hamlet] as a ""failure.""   Wikipedia's ""source"" for this claim is the following statement in the book Sixteen Modern American Authors: A Survey of Research and Criticism since 1972 (Duke University Press, 1989) (see Google Books):     In ""Hamlet"" and the New Poetic: James Joyce and T. S. Eliot (Ann Arbor, Mich., 1983), William H. Quillian analyzes the literary response to Hamlet in the decade from 1911 to 1922. Quillian demonstrates the enormous and positive hold that Hamlet exerted on the literary imagination of the nineteenth century before examining the ""fundamental shift in orientation of critical inquiry"" represented by the ""condemnation of the play as an artistic failure by Eliot and Joyce.""   Joyce held a number of lectures on Shakespeare's Hamlet in Triest in 1912, but according to the Joyce Museum in Triest (emphasis mine),      these lectures are no longer extant, but based upon the surviving notes we can see that Joyce read extensively and that his treatment also included a discussion of Elizabethan England and Shakespeare’s life and other works. Much of this material undoubtedly found its way into the ‘Scylla and Charybdis’ episode in Ulysses.   The James Joyce Centre in Dublin quotes a few contemporary articles about the first lectures, that they were mentioned in Giacomo Joyce and that     the lectures are likely to have provided some of the material about Shakespeare and particularly about Hamlet that pervades Joyce’s Ulysses.   People have pointed out that Stephen Daedalus is presented as a Hamlet figure (e.g. in Stephen Daedalus as Hamlet in Ulysses) but I have not been able to find evidence that James Joyce considered Hamlet a failure. "
460,Opposite of accismus in Julius Caesar,"A preliminary definition: accismus is a rhetorical device in which the rhetor turns down an offer for something that he/she earnestly desires (usually in order to come off as humble/temperate/etc).  Earlier today, I read the following passage from Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, in which Brutus appeals to the Roman public just after assassinating Caesar. He says     ...as I slew my best lover [Caesar] for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.   The gullible crowd, of course, cries “Live, Brutus, live, live!” It struck me that this rhetorical strategy is, in some sense, the opposite (or converse) of accismus - rather than turning down something that he wants, Brutus makes an offer that he does not want to be accepted.  Of course, Brutus is the most honorable and sincere character in Julius Caesar, so this tactic may not have been deliberate. However, we can see it in use even in everyday conversation when one person offers something to another person not because they sincerely want them to have it or have that person’s best interests in mind, but because they want to seem generous. For example:     Person A: I’m really upset; my grandmother died this weekend.      Person B: Wow, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help?   Clearly, there’s nothing Person B can do to help, but she’s offering anyways.  My question is this: does anyone know of a common or technical name for a rhetorical device in which one makes an offer that one does not hope or expect will be accepted, in order to reap the social benefits (or boosted ethos) that results from offering? "
461,Identify a Children's Book about a character who eats all his groceries on the way home,"I'm trying to identify a book I used to read as a child (90s-00s) that I just barely remember. It was for young children, and I believe each page had a sentence or two along with an illustration. It might have even been part of some kind of children's anthology. I don't know if it was published around the time I was a child, or before. It seems very likely that it was published sometime between 1990 and 2000.   It's driving me crazy, and I really want to remember what it was called!   I think the main character was an animal of some kind, likely a bear, a dog, or a hippopotamus.   In the story, the character realizes he has no food in his kitchen, so he drives up a hill in his car (I think it was red?) to the grocery store. There, he buys lots of food and puts it in his car.   Then, I think the food weighed down his car too much for him to drive it, so he begins to eat some of the food so that he can drive the car. He ends up eating all of the food by the time he gets home. I distinctly remember in one of the illustrations he's drinking a bottle of ketchup with a straw.  I think the book ended with him back where he began, in his kitchen realizing he has no food (because he ate it all on the way home).   Can anyone identify this story?  "
462,Why didn't The Last Battle mention Susan's reaction to her family's death?,"In The Last Battle, several of Susan's close relatives (including all of her siblings) were killed on the same day in a train crash. The book merely mentions that she was no longer a friend of Narnia, and that she was in a particularly silly phase of life where she only cared about parties. The fact that the book refers to that in the present tense implies that Susan still felt that way (even after the train crash).  Why did she apparently persist in that even after the death of all of her siblings on the same day? Why didn't that make her reconsider, and why doesn't the book note her reaction to the event? This seems like a highly abnormal reaction to that kind of a personal tragedy at a minimum.  Or was Peter merely unaware of Susan's current mental state when he stated that she's no longer a friend of Narnia (given that he couldn't exactly visit earth to see how she was handling the whole thing)? But, if that's the case, how do we account for C. S. Lewis's comments on her being in a particularly silly phase of life? "
463,How does Emeth's presence in Aslan's Country in The Last Battle fit in with the rest of C. S. Lewis's theology?,"In The Last Battle, Emeth was a soldier from Calormene who worshiped Tash. Apparently, he thought that Tash was basically like Aslan, so Aslan interpreted Emeth's worship of Tash as actually being worship of him. Aslan tells Emeth in chapter 15 that ""I take to me the services which thou hast done to Tash... if any man swear by him and keep his oath for the oath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him.""  Obviously, Emeth ends up going to Aslan's Country.  What's the theological significance/basis of this? How did this reflect C. S. Lewis's broader views on salvation? Does Lewis think that sincerity is ""enough"" for salvation? "
464,Was C. S. Lewis condemning nuclear weapons in The Magician's Nephew?,"Aslan says the following in The Magician's Nephew:     ""It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as the Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things. And soon, very soon, before you are an old man and an old woman, great nations of your world will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than the Empress Jadis. Let your world beware. That is the warning.""   The first line could imply that whatever secret hadn't been discovered yet, but it could also mean that it had been discovered, they just hadn't used it yet. Was Lewis thinking of a particular invention (e.g. nuclear weapons or other WMD), or was he thinking of a hypothetical future invention? If it was the former, is Lewis claiming that nuclear weapons and/or other WMD are intrinsically evil?  Also, was Lewis thinking of a specific tyrant (perhaps Josef Stalin)? Or does the fact that he uses plural (tyrants) indicate that he's thinking of several different tyrants?  Are these necessarily the same people (i.e. is the person who discovers/uses the equivalent of the deplorable word necessarily one of the tyrants)? "
465,Why does Emmanuel Goldstein's book in 1984 have a title page?,"I was rereading 1984 when I noticed something amiss in this passage:      A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart easily, as though the book had passed through many hands. The inscription on the title-page ran:   THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM by Emmanuel Goldstein   Distracted by the wear-and-tear of the book, by the afterglow of his initiation into the brotherhood, Winston fails to ask:  Why does a copy of the most-hated book by the most-hated author still have its title-page? In full capital letters? A title which arouses instant suspicion and would damn the holder if anyone even glimpses at it?   My personal belief is that George Orwelle's' intends to foreshadow that, the Brotherhood as described by O'Brien, is a fabrication.     You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others. Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense.    If the organization as described by O'Brien actually existed, one member in the brotherhood would have expurgated the title-page, or replaced the inscription with something far less obvious and offensive. They don't have the luxury of religious reverence towards their book, they can't treat it like a bible; they would have taken a basic-- and safe-- precaution.   Regardless of the Inner Party's motives, whether it was as an oversight or their way of strengthening Winston's entrapment-- leaving the title in the book seems like a masterful way to quietly foreshadow O'Brien's planned betrayal.  Or am I wrong in assuming that level of caution is needed? Would the real-or-imagined Brotherhood actually be fine with leaving that title-page in their book? Why? "
466,"What explains Maxim Kammerer's superhuman physical condition in ""Prisoners of Power"" (aka ""The Inhabited Island"")?","Throughout the novel, Maxim is shown to have an almost superhuman physical condition, easily performing unthinkable feats, which include, but aren't limited to   Being able to run for a very long time without fatigue Being able to carry a (heavy) armed man while running Reflexes considerably faster than those of the Inhabitants of Saraksh, able to dispatch ~10 men within a few seconds Incredible resistance to radiation - able to swim in a radioactive river, and eat a radioactive fish with no harmful consequences Able to survive 7 (?) bullets from a very close range directly to his torso; at least 2 of them should be fatal as per an assessment given later by a doctor   The list may be amended, but this is the general shape of things. The novel is set in the 22nd century, and Maxim implies all humans are considerably improved physically by that time (he also states later in the novel that prolonged exposure to the climate of Saraksh has weakened him).  However, the novella Space Mowgli (aka The Kid, ""Малыш"") is set in the same time period (in-universe), and its characters do not seem to be as developed physically as Maxim (if they were, they wouldn't be as challenged when playing with the Kid), which leaves two possibilities:   Only the Free Search Group members are as physically developed, possibly due to some tampering with their bodies and stuff (for which there's no evidence in what I've read so far). It's an inconsistency in the writing, because Prisoners of Power and Space Mowgli were written separately in different years (were they? I'm not sure).    How to understand this? "
467,Is there a relationship between Edward VI and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow?,"In my office there is a guy named ""Ed"".  When he is not around, some of the other guys say to those who ask for him that ""We are Ed-less"".  It sounds like an Irish accent saying ""headless"".  I wondered if there was part of the Ichabod Crane story, ""the Headless Horseman"", that drew from a historical ""Edward"".  Does it?  I found this on wikipedia: [website]My thoughts were:   Ichabod means ""glory is lost"" and Edward summarized the charges against Somerset as ""ambition, vainglory, ..."", and noted at his uncle's death that ""[he] had his head cut off"". Ichabod's rival is the younger, Abraham 'Brom Bones' Van Brunt. Edward's father was Henry VIII, quite the father with his many wives, (arguably a veritable Abraham), and the legitimate antecedent to the throne.  Just as the line of Henry won, the line of Brom bones won.   The primary competition in the time of Edward was the war on Scotland called ""the rough wooing"", and the primary competition in the legend is the wooing of Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy farmer.   These have the ""weak smell"" of a connection, but I am no literary scholar, nor am I deeply familiar with the history of Edward Tudor.  If I did not know the history of the cold war between the US and Russia, and the lyrics to ""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer"", then I would not know the strong connection of one to the other, likely driving unconscious connection and extraordinary popularity of Gene Autry's version the song, released in 1949, about 2 years after the start of the cold war.  I'm wondering if Sleepy Hollow worked in a similar way, but about a 150 years earlier.    Is there a similar theme of slight transformation of a previously known story, and story elements to improve relevance and impact of the story that connects Sleepy Hollow and Edward Tudor? "
468,"Why are Jill and Tim getting... intimate in ""Out of the Shelter""?","In the beginning of David Lodge's Out of the Shelter, right before      Jill and her mother are killed by the bomb,    Jill and Tim are getting a little intimate... at the age of what looks like six.      &mdash; You're not going away tomorrow, are you Daddy? said Jill, keeping her arms round his neck so he couldn't stand up straight.   &mdash; Not straightaway, no, my precious.   &mdash; Not ever?   &mdash; You have a nice sleep now, my pet, or you'll be too tired to play with me in the morning.   &mdash; Can Timothy sleep in my bunk?   &mdash; We usually let them, said Auntie Nora.   &mdash; I suppose it's all right, if he's going to marry you, said Uncle Jack, and the grown-ups laughed.   [...]   The guns sounded faint now, a long way off. He pulled down his pyjama trousers and Jill wriggled beside him as she pulled up the skirt of her nightie. Then he felt her cool soft fingers on his thing and with his own finger he felt for the little crease between her legs. He was warm and safe and sleepy. He hoped that there would be another raid the next night.   Why are Jill and Tim doing this? What's the point of this scene? "
469,How do publishers determine how much to charge for audiobooks relative to their printed version?,"Amazon.com prices for a few random books as of 10/5/2017:  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - paperback [tex]17.89, audio CD $38.98  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - paperback [tex]16.41, audio CD $28.46  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - [tex]17.06 audio CD  The War of Art - paperback [tex]9.79 (slightly cheaper)  The two obvious criticisms of what I have above are the fact that these are the Amazon.com prices (rather than the publisher price), and that this is a limited number of books (so it may not represent overall trends).  I don't have any hard statistics on this, but it seems to me that that audiobooks (with some exceptions) tend to be dramatically more expensive than the print edition of the books. Why is that?  This seems to hold true even with electronic versions (e.g. purchases from Audible.com or iTunes), so the physical cost of producing the CDs doesn't appear to entirely explain the cost differences.  I'm also not convinced that the additional cost of creating the audiobook in the first place entirely accounts for its price. I do understand that the publisher needs to recoup the cost of producing it in the first place in order to make it worthwhile to sell it, but it seems like that cost would be distributed among a large number of people (at least for popular audiobooks like Harry Potter). Also, the marginal cost of producing additional units it relatively low - selling 2 million units isn't twice as expensive as selling 1 million units. Finally, the cost of producing the goods in the first place isn't really related to the price that people are willing to pay for it.  With that said, what is the logic behind these prices? How do the publishers typically price audiobooks relative to paper and hardcover books and why? How does this compare to Amazon.com's pricing?  My understanding is that Amazon.com does dynamic pricing, so my guess is that they're doing some kind of regression analysis to get an objective function relating price to profit somehow and then doing single-variable optimization on that. But this doesn't really explain how they came up with the approximate price range to begin with, or how the publishers came up with the list price. "
470,Understanding this sex scene in A Song of Ice and Fire,"I'm reading A Song of Ice and Fire, and there's a sexually explicit scene where Jon Snow and Ygritte have sex. Jon does something, and afterwards Ygritte says:     Afterward, she was almost shy, or as shy as Ygritte ever got. “That thing you did,” she said, when they lay together on their piled clothes. “With your . . . mouth.” She hesitated. “Is that . . . is it what lords do to their ladies, down in the south?”      “I don’t think so.” No one had ever told Jon just what lords did with their ladies. “I only . . . wanted to kiss you there, that’s all. You seemed to like it.”      “Aye. I . . . I liked it some. No one taught you such?”      “There’s been no one,” he confessed. “Only you.”      “A maid,” she teased. “You were a maid.”    I don't really get what this conversation is about. Why does Ygritte ask about ladies in the south? "
471,Why does Dune have such fundamental changes to major religions?,"In the Dune series, various religions have undergone drastic transformations. Judaism seems to be largely ""intact,"" but both Christianity and Islam appear to have been substantially mixed with Buddhism. For example, Wikipedia's list of religion in Dune includes Mahayana Christianity, which it describes as     A hybrid of Mahayana Buddhism and Christianity, which presumably interpreted Jesus Christ as a Buddha.   Given that virtually all branches of Christianity regard Christ as God, this seems like a rather fundamental change. Islam doesn't seem to be all that amenable to hybridization with Buddhism either.  Why did so many of the religions of Dune appear to have been mixed with Buddhism at some point? And how does it account for such fundamental changes to the religions? Did this reflect a poor understanding of what doctrines of Christianity and Islam were important on Herbert's part? "
472,Do authors who translate their own works tend to do accurate translations?,"Closely related: Accuracy of a translation: how to forge an opinion?  Several authors, such as Samuel Beckett, periodically translated their own works. Are their translations generally regarded as accurate? Do people tend to find them more - or less - trustworthy than translations done by professional translators?  Have there been any examples of authors who did translations that included major changes to the work? "
473,"What does ""And others, whose breasts love the feel of scapulars,"" mean in Baudelaire's ""Damned Women""?","   Et d'autres, dont la gorge aime les scapulaires,      Qui, recélant un fouet sous leurs longs vêtements,      Mêlent, dans le bois sombre et les nuits solitaires,      L'écume du plaisir aux larmes des tourments.   In english:     And others, whose breasts love the feel of scapulars,      Who, concealing a whip under their long habits,      Mingle, in the dark woods and solitary nights,      The froth of pleasure with tears of torment.   I can understand the last 2 verses, but I don't understand the first 2. Are these women in some kind of cult? Are they sadomasochistic nuns? Is it symbolical?   Could anyone explain this to me? "
474,"Is there a direct parallel to actual social prejudices for each color in ""The War Between the Classes""?","In The War Between the Classes, the class sets up four levels of classes: Blue, the highest class; Dark Green, the lower high class; Light Green, the higher low class; and Orange, the lowest of the low.  Is there a direct parallel to actual social prejudices for each color? E.g., Orange representing African Americans? Or Blue representing the white population?  Can we draw a parallel for each color?

475,How to envisage 'battlements of the escarpment',"Please help me to understand the following sentence from The Sign and the Seal by Graham Hancock.     A soft afternoon breeze, laden with the fragrance of distant deserts, blew through the tawny canyons beneath me, circulated amongst the ravines and foothills, and soared on eagles' wings across the first battlements of the escarpment   ""The first battlements of the escarpment"" puzzles me the most. There are no 'battlements' (no fortifying construction in sight judging by context). A very prolonged slope is present in the scene as a geological feature. I guess that the 'battlements' has some indirect, idiomatic (?) meaning here. Is this correct? It is difficult for me to perceive the literary beauty of the sentence without comprehending details. Adding that 'battlements' and 'escarpment' have (imho) very similar meaning. "
476,"Meaning of ""The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice"" in Byron's Don Juan","From Byron's Don Juan:     It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,        That cocking of a pistol, when you know   A moment more will bring the sight to bear        Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;   A gentlemanly distance, not too near,        If you have got a former friend for foe;   But after being fired at once or twice,   The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.     What is the meaning of this? I looked up the meanings of Irish in Wiktionary, but remained a bit puzzled.   The ear becomes ""more filled with anger/passion""? What is ""less nice""? Maybe the ear is clipped by the bullet, and becomes malformed?  "
477,"Meaning of ""such as had not staid long with her destiny"" in Byron's ""Don Juan""","From Byron's Don Juan:     Thus lived -- thus died she; never more on her        Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made   Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,        Which colder hearts endure till they are laid   By age in earth: her days and pleasures were        Brief, but delightful -- such as had not staid   Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well   By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.     What is the meaning of the phrase in bold?  ""Such days, brief but delightful, had not staid long, thanks to her (tragic) destiny""?  "
478,"Is the Harry Keller character in Andrew Macdonald's racist novel ""Hunter"" a follower of Rudolf Steiner?","In the racist novel Hunter (1989), written by United States neo-Nazi William Luther Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, the character Harry Keller opines in Chapter 30 as follows (emphasis added):     ""Our aim is to keep the race from going down the drain, if we can. More than that, it's to get the race back on an upward path again, to get it back to work preparing the way for a higher race to come (....)""      ""We identify with our race, with an idealization of our race - more than that, with the process of which our race is the principal agent, the process of higher organization, the process which is the active principle of God.""   The idea of an Aryan race evolving into a higher future race appears in the work of ""theosophist"" Helena Blavatsky and is an important part of the ideology of the ""anthroposophist"" Rudolf Steiner. Note that the emergence of a new race is different from the strengthening of an existing supposedly ""higher"" race that was supported by Cambridge-educated eugenicists Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, even when the ""higher"" one causes the ""lower"" one to become ""extinct"", as Galton advocated. Keller specifically talks of a ""path"", of a divine ""process"" of ""higher organization"", and of preparing the way for a future ""higher race"" which is not simply an existing race made stronger or that has ""extinguished"" ""lower"" races.  Is Keller a follower of Rudolf Steiner? If not, is Macdonald giving him some other specific and recognisable strand of racist ideology? "
479,"Meaning of ""from crowns to kicks"" in Byron's Don Juan","From Byron's Don Juan:      Just now a black old neutral personage   Of the third sex stept up, and peering over   The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,   And capabilities, as to discover   If they were fitted for the purposed cage:   No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,   Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,   Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,         As is a slave by his intended bidder.   'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;   And all are to be sold, if you consider   Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features   Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,   Some by a place -- as tend their years or natures;   The most by ready cash -- but all have prices,   From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.     What is the meaning of from crowns to kicks? From the top of your head to the tips of your toes? Or ""ranging from a crown (say, made of gold) to a pocket or wallet full of money""? The Merriam-Webster dictionary provided me with the ""pocket, wallet"" meaning for kick.  I never knew about this meaning of ""kick"".  "
480,"Why is a cuckolded husband ""fit for heaven"" in Byron's Don Juan?","Canto 5, stanza 154, from Byron's Don Juan:     His majesty saluted his fourth spouse        With all the ceremonies of his rank,   Who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,        As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;   These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,        To save the credit of their breaking bank:   To no men are such cordial greetings given   As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.     What is the meaning of made them fit for heaven?   Why would a cuckolded husband be ""fit for heaven""?   (According to the plot, ""his majesty"" is a sultan who has been cuckolded by one of his wives: she ordered Don Juan bought on the slave market and brought to her in female disguise) "
481,"Why is the last title in Proust's ""Search For Lost Time"" not consistently translated as ""Time Found Again""?","Marcel Proust wrote a seven-volume French novel called A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. The original French title of the last volume was Le Temps Retrouvé.  It seems to me that in these titles Proust intended an allusion to one of the aphorisms that Ben Franklin included in his book Poor Richard’s Almanac:     Lost time is never found again.   In the French translation of Franklin's book, Feuillets du Bonhomme Richard, this aphorism is translated as:     Le tems perdu ne se retrouve jamais.   All of the important words in this translation also appear in Proust’s titles, and the meaning of the titles seems to resonate the meaning of the aphorism. This supports the conclusion that Proust was alluding to Franklin’s words as they appeared in the Feuillets du Bonhomme Richard.  If that’s right, and Proust intended to allude to Franklin’s words, then it would seem natural that the English translations of the titles should revert to Franklin’s words. The titles should be translated The Search For Lost Time and Time Found Again.  Why should they be? Suppose that a French author wrote a book called The Sound And The Fury, and that an English translation was to be published. It would be common sense to call the English translation The Sound And The Fury rather than Noise and Rage, even if Noise and Rage was an equally accurate translation of the French title. The reason it would be common sense is that the French title suggested to French readers some connection to Hamlet’s soliloquy, and the best English title would preserve this suggestion, as The Sound And The Fury does, but as Noise and Rage fails to do. Of course other titles might actually be chosen, and perhaps for good reason; but common sense would suggest The Sound And The Fury.   In the case of Proust’s books, common sense did not prevail. In English translations published over the years Proust’s last title, Le Temps Retrouvé, has been rendered variously:   Finding Time Again The Past Recaptured Time Regained   This strikes me as strange. Why did the English translations not use Franklin’s words?  One possibility is that they did not believe, and perhaps did not even consider, that Proust was alluding to Franklin. Another possible reason would seem to be that they did believe that Proust was alluding to Franklin but thought other phrases made better titles.  Apparently, evidence relevant to this question might include:   logical reasoning the words of Proust and his editors, translators and publishers, perhaps expressed in diaries, correspondence or even advertising similar words attributed to other authors before Franklin's time, or contemporary with him, suggesting that the idea (that lost time cannot be found again) was already a commonplace and that the similarity in wording (between Franklin’s aphorism and Proust’s titles) is a meaningless coincidence  "
482,Can you explain the financial situation of Edward and Elinor Ferrars in Sense and Sensibility?,"First, let me start by saying that English is not my first language; thus, I am really struggling to understand the language used in such classic novels as those of Jane Austen's.  I've just finished reading Sense and Sensibility. I find it hard to understand the income of Edward and Elinor after they married. As I understand (I might be wrong) Elinor brought 3 thousand pounds into her marriage, but I am not quite clear how much Edward was bringing. I think he was left with just 2 thousand, but, in the last chapter, there is this line,     What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was not her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a year, not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.   So did Edward have 2 or 10 thousand pounds? What would be the interest of his money combined with Elinor's? And plus with the maximum of 250 pounds per year from his work, how much income did they both enjoy? And was it enough to live on? "
483,"What is a ""fetish man"" in African tribal culture?","I'm translating Robert E. Howard's short story ""The Hyena"". It was published in 1927. There is a character called Senecoza and Howard (and the protagonist) always refer to him as ""the fetish man"". And this guy can turn himself into a hyena, but the reader only learns this fact at the end of the story. Now, I know ""fetish"" means idols or power objects. But I'm not sure what a fetish man is exactly. Is he someone like a voodoo priest? Does he do magic? This is the only bit of information I could manage to find:      A fetish man was thought to be more than human; he was divine, even infallible. Thus did chiefs, kings, priests, prophets, and church rulers eventually wield great power and exercise unbounded authority.   The Uratia Book   I have a vague idea, but I want to know more because I have to come up with a proper translation for the term. So if anyone has further information, I would love to hear it. Thank you in advance. "
484,Meaning of a stanza in Byron's Don Juan,"Canto 6, stanza 52, from Byron's Don Juan:      Dudù, as has been said, was a sweet creature,        Not very dashing, but extremely winning,   With the most regulated charms of feature,        Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning   Against proportion -- the wild strokes of nature        Which they hit off at once in the beginning,   Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,   And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.     What is the meaning of this all in plain English - especially the part in bold?    My attempts at deciphering this:    She had a symmetrical face (""regulated charms of feature"")? Hm.. Or, to the contrary, her face and body were not symmetrical?   Painters fail to reflect such ""asymmetrical charms"" in their paintings? In comparison, they fail to reflect ""faces that sin against proportion"".  Painters ""hit off"" = ""describe in few characteristic strokes of a brush"" - in the beginning of their work upon a portrait.  What does ""that strike"" refer to? The strokes left on the canvas by the painters ""strike"" the viewers as very interesting/beautiful?  The phrase ""still are like"" leaves me completely baffled. Such strokes on the canvas, reflecting the irregular but characteristic features, are all alike, no matter who is being painted?    I've reread the stanza many times but I cannot get a grip on its meaning. Once I think I understand some particular phrase, the general meaning starts to crawl apart because it fails to dovetail with other phrases. "
485,Was Jonas Willard inspired by anyone in particular?,"In Isaac Asimov's short story “Gold”, Laborian is clearly a self-insertion of Asimov himself, and the story in the story is Asimov's own book The Gods Themselves.  I'm wondering though, what about the other major character in this short story?  Is the film producer Jonas Willard invented completely from scratch?  Or did Asimov get inspiration for that character from someone, such as a contemporary real world film producer or director?  The character is described in a positive way in the end, so I'm wondering if Asimov is indirectly complimenting someone from the real world with this unusually self-reflecting story. "
486,"Why is this poem by Paul Auster entitled ""Spokes""?","The poem ""Spokes"" by Paul Auster (of which you can read the first few verses here, or the whole poem here if you have Jstor access) seems to be about things in nature - birds, plants, eggs. The only mention of a ""hub"" and ""wheel"" are in the third-to-last verse:     Into the hub the shell implodes,    Persists in a pun of loam and rock,    Rising as stick, to invade, to drive    Out the babble that worded its body    To emerge, to wait for future    Blows-city in root, in deed, unsprung, even out    Of the city. Get out. The wheel    Was deception. It cannot turn.   I don't really understand the meaning of this poem, either literally or metaphorically, so as a first step to increasing my comprehension and appreciation: why is the poem called ""Spokes""? What do wheels, and their spokes and hubs, have to do with the process of nature as described in the poem? "
487,"Why did the alexandrine become the ""natural"" metre for French verse drama, whereas English renaissance drama adopted the iambic pentameter?","We previously had a question asking Were all of Shakespeare's plays fully in iambic pentameter?, but of course, it wasn't just Shakespeare who used iambic pentameter; it became the prevalent metre in English poetry and drama around the middle of the sixteenth century.   In French poetry and verse drama, the French alexandrine was the dominant metre from the 17th through the 19th century.   Is there any linguistic or other verifiable reason for this difference in preferred metre? Note: I don't believe it has anything to do with heartbeat. "
488,"Scanning the line ""And every spirit upon earth"" in Thomas Hardy's ""The Darkling Thrush""","In the Thomas Hardy poem ""The Darkling Thrush"", one line seems to scan quite jarringly compared to the even iambic meter of the others:     The land's sharp features seemed to me   The Century's corpse outleant,   Its crypt the cloudy canopy,   The wind its death-lament.   The ancient pulse of germ and birth   Was shrunken hard and dry,   And every spirit upon earth   Seemed fervorless as I.   All of these lines have a nice clear even rhythm, save only ""And every spirit upon earth"".   The natural way I would read this as prose would be:     And every spirit upon earth   But that has two adjacent stressed syllables and sounds weird in the context of the poem. The best way to make it fit in with the surrounding lines would be:     And every spirit upon earth   But the word ""upon"" normally has the stress very firmly on the second syllable.   Which of these is the better way to scan the line? Perhaps it was intended to stand out from the rest by its different rhythm for some reason? Or perhaps ""upon"" was pronounced with the stress on the first syllable in Hardy's time? Any light thrown upon this would be much appreciated. "
489,"What does ""Printed for..."" mean?","Sometimes, when I see old books on Archive.org, I see mysterious ""Printed for..."" and can't understand what does it mean.  For example, here is a link to 1817 reprint of Le Morte D'Arthur, prepared by William Upcott.  At the title page, you can see this:    In normal text:     London:   Printed from Caxton's Edition, 1485,   for Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, Paternoster-Row.   By Thomas Davison, Whitefriars.   1817   So, Davison is a publisher, who lived in Whitefriars.  But who are these Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown? And what does Paternoster Row mean in this context? "
490,"What's the origin of the rhyme ""My friend Billy had a ten foot willy""?","A simple rhyming song which I heard growing up and which still gets stuck in my head every so often:     My friend Billy had a ten foot willy.   He stuck it through the neighbour's door. OR He showed it to the girl next door.   She thought it was a snake,   Hit it with a rake,   And now it's only four foot four.   A little searching on the internet has convinced me that this is a somewhat well-known ditty, at least in England, so not just made up by someone I knew.  What is the origin of this song? Where and when did it first appear, and is there any hint of an original author?  (I've found the same question asked on another forum, Who Wrote The Naughty Rhyme ""My Friend Billy Had a Ten Foot..."", but without any serious answers (the top answer ""My mate did. Yours sincerely, Billy."" is absolutely hilarious and absolutely useless). I've also found an article crediting it to one James ""Nipper"" Jenkins, but given that the same site has an article ""Pfizer cuts research into Alzheimer's, but can't remember why - more soon"", I'd consider it somewhat less than reliable.) "
491,"Meaning of ""pig who sees the wind"" in Byron's Don Juan","From Byron's Don Juan:     Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,   Are things immortal to immortal man,   As purple to the Babylonian harlot:   An uniform to boys is like a fan   To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet   But deems himself the first in Glory's van.   But Glory's glory; and if you would find   What that is -- ask the pig who sees the wind!   At least he feels it, and some say he sees,   Because he runs before it like a pig;   Or, if that simple sentence should displease,   Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,   A schooner, or -- but it is time to ease   This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.   The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,   Like a bob-major from a village steeple.     As I understand, the stanzas describe a pig that sees (feels) the wind and ""he"" (the pig) runs in the direction the wind is blowing. But what is the meaning of all this?    Why should a pig that feels the wind know something about Glory?   "
492,"Meaning of ""Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault"" in Byron's Don Juan","From Byron's Don Juan:      The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on       To take a battery on the right; the others,   Who landed lower down, their landing done,       Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:   Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,       Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,   O'er the entrenchment and the palisade,   Quite orderly, as if upon parade.        And this was admirable; for so hot       The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,   Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot       And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.   Of officers a third fell on the spot,       A thing which victory by no means boded   To gentlemen engaged in the assault:   Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.      So when a huntsman stumbles over something, he blames his hounds. But how does that explain that ""since 33% of the officers died in the attack, this was a sign that the army was to be victorious""?     These two observations seem unrelated to me. Am I missing something?   "
493,"Meaning of ""which some months the same still is"" in Byron's 'Don Juan'","From Byron's Don Juan:     By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,       And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,   Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon       We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his   Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon       Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):   Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,   And could be very busy without bustle;     What is the meaning of this phrase?

494,Where is the object in this clause in Byron's Don Juan?,"From Byron's Don Juan:     But those who scaled, found out that their advance       Was favour'd by an accident or blunder:   The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance       Had palisado'd in a way you'd wonder   To see in forts of Netherlands or France       (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under) --   Right in the middle of the parapet   Just named, these palisades were primly set:        So that on either side some nine or ten       Paces were left, whereon you could contrive   To march; a great convenience to our men,       At least to all those who were left alive,   Who thus could form a line and fight again;       And that which farther aided them to strive   Was, that they could kick down the palisades,   Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.     I first thought that ""Ignorance had palisadoed cohorns there, just like you may see in forts of Netherlands"".   But why is there the possessive s after ""cohorn""? Okay.. let's try to assume that ""Cohorn's ignorance"" is subject in this clause. This ""ignorance"" had ""palisadoed"" something - but what exactly?   And ""palisades not higher than grass blades""? What is he talking about? I can't wrap my mind around this, and thus I fail to understand these three lines. What do they mean, in plain English? "
495,Are the words 'putter' and 'chop' some kind of mimetic words or what in this context?,"I've come accross the expressions 'putter, putter!' and 'chop, chop' in the novel 'The Arrangement' by Elia Kazan. I need interpretation. Here is the paragraph:     He'd continue his joking, fixing me with that eye, a god in malevolence as well as in power, his eyebrows hard as scimitars, and he'd demand, ""How much money did you make today?""    Now what kind of goddam question was that to ask a kid just starting high school? He'd glare at me so it was impossible for me to answer, my lips were so dry. But he'd drink his oozou, nibble pieces of that crusty goat cheese, and wait. ""Putter, putter,"" he'd say, referring I suppose to the evidence of my nerves.   ...     But my father had one more blast for me. He'd serve himself and my mother, he'd serve my younger brother, Michael, and then me. As he gave me my plate, he'd look at me with such disappointment, such profound disillusionment-oh God, it hurt! Then he'd say, ""Don't worry, my boy, I expect nothing from you, Shakespeare! Putter, putter! Chop, chop! I expect nothing. I need nothing.""   "
496,"Why does Tom Sawyer forget what ""ransom"" means?","In Chapter XXXIII of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Tom explains ""ransom"" to Huck.  But in Chapter II of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom has no idea what ransoming is.  Is this just Twain forgetting what his character knew?  Or perhaps Twain is breaking continuity to be able to include the humor/satire of the ransom discussion? "

498,"Meaning of ""And do not drop in for an after-loss"" in Shakespeare's sonnet 90","Sonnet 90 by Shakespeare:      Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;   Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,   Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,   And do not drop in for an after-loss:   Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,   Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;   Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,   To linger out a purposed overthrow.   If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,   When other petty griefs have done their spite,   But in the onset come: so shall I taste   At first the very worst of fortune's might;      And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,      Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.     The website Shakespeare-sonnets.com has this to say about the phase:     drop in for an after loss - the phrase is not properly understood. It may be a gaming metaphor, or, in view of rearward, conquered, overthrow, onset, loss, which follow, a military one. SB gives an extensive note with details of slightly later examples from gaming and warfare. The general idea seems to be that of an unexpected loss resulting from a sudden hazard or cast in a game, or an unforeseen development after a battle, when the result was already supposedly determined. The modern meaning of drop in, 'to call on unexpectedly, or casually' is not relevant here, and is not attested until much later.   I still don't understand the meaning. I'd be grateful for any answers with ""plain-English"" interpretation.   For instance, what is ""drop in"" here? Who (or what) is doing the dropping? To which word does the preposition in relate?    My brain fails to come up with any meaning of the phrase, and thus slides back to something akin to ""and do not suddenly appear .."".   "
499,Why did John Galt explain how to fix the torture device?,"Consider the following segment from Atlas Shrugged:     ""But I don't know what's wrong with it."" The man sighed, bewildered.   ""I don't  know what to do.""       ""It's the vibrator that's out of order,"" said a voice behind them;   they  whirled around; Galt was struggling for breath, but he was   speaking in the brusque, competent tone of an engineer. ""Take it out   and pry off the aluminum cover. You'll find a pair of contacts fused   together. Force them apart, take  a small file and clean up the pitted   surfaces. Then replace the cover, plug it back into the machine—and   your generator will work.""   In the passage above, Galt explains to his tormentors how to fix the torture device that had broken and they knew not how to fix. Although the irony makes a powerful statement, Galt is in fact violating his sacred creed by giving his enemies the tools of his own destruction.  As proof, Galt earlier says:     I am the first man who would not do penance for my virtues or let them   be used as the tools of my destruction. I am the first man who would   not suffer martyrdom at the hands of those who wished me to perish for   the privilege of keeping them alive.   So it seems like he is violating his principles in fixing the torture machine for them. Why did he do it? Was it merely an irresistible literary device for Rand that ""the real John Galt"" wouldn't have done? "

501,"What does ""layering of roles"" mean in this sentence?","What does ""layering of roles"" precisely mean in the following sentence quoted from Pirandello and the Crisis of Modern Consciousness by Anthony Francis Caputi?     For the generation of Neveux, Jean Giraudoux, and Jean Anouilh, the term “Pirandellisme” meant “pure intellectual game,” and Pirandellian structures meant characters seen as a layering of roles.  "
502,What is Ayn Rand's view of marriage and children?,"It's difficult not to notice that the vast majority of heroes in Atlas Shrugged are unmarried and have no kids.    Dagny Taggart - unmarried, no kids John Galt - unmarried, no kids Francisco - unmarried, no kids Hugh Akston - unmarried, no kids Ellis Wyatt - unmarried, no kids Quentin Daniels - unmarried, no kids (many others)   There are a few notable exceptions:   Rearden is married but his wife is a malicious looter and his brother is a mooch and a weasel. Ragnar Danneskjöld is married to Kay Ludlow, and there are a few children in the valley.   But there is certainly a trend and commonality that the heroes don't have families. Why is this? Is Rand anti-family? We know she was happily married, but I believe had no kids. Perhaps family connections in Atlas would have presented plot difficulties? Is she making a statement that families get in the way of industrial achievement? "
503,History of Pale Fire's Criticism,How did Pale Fire's interpretation and analysis develop through time? Had there been continuous critical attention towards it and what did Nabokov himself say about the work?   It is quite a substantial and curio-like piece of literature. Did anyone manage to decipher it in different ways from its publication towards now? What was it compared to? (Italo Calvino springs to mind) 
504,What is the metre of this poem by Emily Bronte?,"I really like the following poem by E. Bronte:     High waving heather 'neath stormy blasts bending,   Midnight and moonlight and bright shining stars,   Darkness and glory rejoicingly blending,   Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending,   Man's spirit away from its drear dungeon sending,   Bursting the fetters and breaking the bars.      All down the mountain sides wild forests lending   One mighty voice to the life-giving wind,   Rivers their banks in their jubilee rending,   Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending,   Wider and deeper their waters extending,   Leaving a desolate desert behind.      Shining and lowering and swelling and dying,   Changing forever from midnight to noon;   Roaring like thunder, like soft music sighing,   Shadows on shadows advancing and flying,   Lighning-bright flashes the deep gloom defying,   Coming as swiftly and fading as soon.   I like the rhythm of it, the rhyme, but I am a bit rusty since last time I ""studied"" poetry was in high school. Is it iambic? What is the metre? What else is some interesting characteristic to notice about it?  I have been looking for an answer online to no avail. A link with more info would also be appreciated! "
505,Did Jean Rhys recognize her fictional portrait in Ford Madox Ford's *When the Wicked Man*?,"Jean Rhys's affair with Ford Madox Ford, and its effects on her marriage to Jean Lenglet as well as on Ford's relationship with Stella Bowen, have been variously cataloged by each of this foursome:   In Quartet aka Postures (1928), Rhys depicted Ford and Bowen as Hugh and Lois Heidler; Stephan Zelli is Lenglet, and Rhys herself is the protagonist, Marya Zelli. Ford followed soon after with When the Wicked Man (1931), portraying Rhys as Lola Porter, a drunken journalist who takes advantage of the generosity of Joseph Notterdam (Ford) and his wife Elspeth (Bowen). Lenglet wrote an autobiographical novel, called variously In de Strik, Barred, and Sous les Verrous, published 1932 in Dutch and English, and 1933 in French.  Finally, Bowen's 1941 autobiography, Drawn from Life, provides her take on the affair.    Rhys herself translated the manuscript of Sous les Verrous into English. In his article ""Jean Rhys and the Dutch Connection"" (Journal of Modern Literature vol. 11, no. 1, 1984, pp. 159–173), Martien Kappers-Den Hollander has pointed out that Rhys made several changes: for example, cutting out all references to the character representing Bowen and softening the portrayal of her own counterpart. Lenglet in turn used the English translation as the basis for his Dutch translation. The French version, however, used his original manuscript. So by comparing the French original to the English translation, and by considering the changes Rhys made, we can gauge Rhys's reaction to Lenglet's portrayal of the affair.  Rhys refused to read Bowen's Drawn from Life, on the very sensible grounds that ""I was quite certain that Stella's opinion of me wouldn't be pleasant to read"". This is mentioned in another article by Hollander, ""Measure for Measure: Quartet and When the Wicked Man"" (Jean Rhys Review, vol. 2, no. 2, 1998, pp. 2–16). In the footnotes to this second article, Hollander says that Rhys eventually did read Arthur Mizener's biography of Ford, The Saddest Story (London: The Bodley Head, 1971), which draws upon Stella's account of the affair. Rhys was predictably upset at how Bowen depicted her.   I have been unable, however, to find any evidence either way whether Rhys ever read When the Wicked Man.  Do we know whether Rhys ever read Ford's novel and recognized herself in it? If so, what was her reaction to this fictionalized representation?   "
506,"What's the source of Michelangelo's quote: ""Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.""?","Many quote Michelangelo as saying that ""trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle."" For example, the following passage is from the book Self-Help; with Illustrations of Character and Conduct by Samuel Smiles.     Michael Angelo was one day explaining to a visitor at his studio, what he had been doing at a statue since his previous visit. ""I have retouched this part—polished that—softened this feature—brought out that muscle—given some expression to this lip, and more energy to that limb."" ""But these are trifles,"" remarked the visitor. ""It may be so,"" replied the sculptor, ""but recollect that trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.""   Where did Smiles get this anecdote from? Did Michelangelo really say this? If so, wouldn't he've said it in Italian? I'd like to know the exact words he used. "
507,"What did Twain mean by the ""Creedmoor aim""?","In a letter to his friend William Dean Howells recounting the heroic exploits of John T. Lewis, Mark Twain wrote the following in 1877:     Lewis, the prodigious … saw the frantic horse plunging down the hill toward him on a full gallop, throwing his heels as high as a man’s head at every jump. So Lewis turned his team diagonally across the road just at the “turn,” thus making a V with the fence. The running horse could not escape that, but must enter it. Then Lewis sprang to the ground and stood in this V. He gathered his vast strength, and with a perfect Creedmoor aim he seized the gray horse’s bit has he plunged by and fetched him up standing!   What is this ""Creedmoor aim"" he refers to? Is it a reference to the Creedmoor rifle range in Queens, New York?  "
508,"The origin of Tolkien's use of the term ""hobbit""","In a footnote on page 29 of The Lay of Aotrou &amp; Itroun Verlyn Flieger notes     the word korigans appears in the 1891 compendium of folklore known as The Denham Tracts (Vol. II, p. 79) where it is in the same word-list as the first recorded use of the word hobbits, another term which Tolkien put to good use in his own work.   However, in the Letters, Tolkien says     the etymology [of hobbit]: 'Invented by J.R.R. Tolkien'   (this in letter 316, to the editor of the Oxford English Dictionary)  And in letter 25 says      I have no waking recollection [...] of any Hobbit bogey in print by 1904   and that     hobbit-names [are] from Obvious Sources proper to their kind   Is this an issue of the origin of the term versus the origin of the creature, or is something else at play here? How did the term 'hobbit' originate, and how did the idea of the 'halfling' originate, especially with respect to Tolkien? "
509,"Why does Liesel ignore Max at first in ""The Book Thief""?","In The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, Liesel Meminger and Max Vandenburg have an interesting relationship: at first, Liesel ignores Max and is hesitant to to talk to him. Then, for some reason, the two begin to get closer and closer and form a tight bond.   Why does Liesel ignore Max at first? Was it because she felt that Max replaced her brother? Was it because of how unexpected it was to hide a Jew in the house? Or was it something else?  "
510,"Can the social commentary in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" be applied to the present?","Recently, I have picked up ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" after reading glowing reviews of the book.  However, as I read the book further, I felt that I have completely misunderstood the points it was trying to make - rather, I did not understand them at all. After some research, I have found the most common explanation: the book is a kind of commentary on the society in the US at the time.  This argument does not seem to be particularly fulfilling. After all, if all it was is a commentary on the 1970s, why the appraisal that the book still receives? The fact that it was adapted to a movie almost 30 years later tells me the same.  Perhaps I am missing a crucial point of the book, which didn't seem to contain any plot. That alone is not a big problem, as there are many books without a clear narrative, but combined with the style of writing it made reading this book a challenge.  What is it that makes this book so appealing even now? Can the commentary in it be applied to today's society and if yes, in what way? "
511,Is there a hidden meaning in the name of Captain Foulenough?,"The Brideshead Revisited features a side character, a certain Captain Foulenough. In Russian translation his last name is rendered as Буремглой, obviously referring to a Pushkin's line     Буря мглою небо кроет      (The storm covers sky with darkness)   It is a famous poem, known by every Russian fourth-grader.  The search for foul enough in a similar context yields An Island, by Edwin Arlington Robinson:     a storm foul enough   I trust the translator; I am sure she came up with such rendering for a reason. On the other hand, I doubt that Robinson was known in 1945 England as much as Pushkin in Russia.  The question is, did Waugh intentionally attach a hidden meaning, and did he expect this hidden meaning to be understood by an average reader? "
512,"What is the meaning of a complex sentence from ""The Hedgehog and the Fox""?","I'm new in English and I want to understand this sentence from Isaiah Berlin's The Hedgehog and the Fox:     ""Rousseau must have strengthened, if he did not actually originate, his growing tendency to idealize the soil and its cultivators — the simple peasant, who for Tolstoy is a repository of almost as rich a stock of 'natural' virtues as Rousseau's noble savage.""    What does ""the simple peasant"" refer to in this sentence?    What is the meaning of ""a repository of almost as rich a stock of 'natural' virtues as Rousseau's noble savage""?  "
513,Purpose of realistic literature,"In the 19th century, why did literary realism start? I mean it in contrast to romanticism. Why did writers stop to express their ideals and conflicts in their works? I think it might be because none of them came true. But what did the new way of depicting the reality bring to them? This almost scientifically objective or very satirical way of writing. What was the purpose of such literature?    I apologize if my question is not clear, I had a hard time formulating it. "
514,"Who is ""Luna"" in Byron's ""To Mary, On Receiving Her Picture""?","Here are the fourth and fifth stanzas of ""To Mary, On Receiving Her Picture"" by Lord Byron:     Here, I behold its beauteous hue;       But where's the beam so sweetly straying,   Which gave a lustre to its blue,       Like Luna o'er the ocean playing?      Sweet copy! far more dear to me,       Lifeless, unfeeling as thou art,   Than all the living forms could be,       Save her who plac'd thee next my heart.    In the fourth stanza, Byron mentions the blue eyes of his beloved. He asks where is the beam of her eyes sweetly wandering? Then he says, ""Like Luna o'er the ocean playing"". What does ""Luna"" mean? In the fifth stanza, he says that the copy of her picture is even more dearer to him. Then he says, ""Lifeless, unfeeling as thou art"". Does it mean that the painting is lifeless and dull, for Mary might have been lively and vivacious as a person or does it mean that Mary is lifeless and unfeeling just an inanimate object such as a painting is? Then he says, ""Than all the living forms could be, Save her who plac'd thee next my heart."" What could it possibly mean?  "
515,"What does ""wisdom that is so often loudly preached"" mean in the Parable of the King and the Maiden?","In the first paragraph of ""The Parable of the King and the Maiden"":     Suppose there was a king who loved a humble maiden and whose heart was unaffected by the wisdom that is so often loudly preached.   What does ""wisdom that is so often loudly preached"" mean here? Does it mean the king didn't listen to other people who thought he's wrong about the girl? "
516,Was Victor Frankenstein an aristocrat?,"I know that Frankenstein's family were rich enough for him to take frequent vacations, but were they titled nobility? And if they were what title or titles did they hold? "
517,"In ""Our Lady of the Tall Trees,"" who is the Lady, and what is the song trying to say about her?","I've decided to ask this question here, in light of the consensus that songs seem to be on-topic. I've tried to keep it to lyrics because there's been some debate about whether the music of a song is on topic or just the words.    Cahalen Morrison and Eli West released an album called ""Our Lady of the Tall Trees."" The titular song (lyrics), however, contains a somewhat unclear purpose. I'm having trouble determining if the song is intended to just be as carefree and jovial as it sounds, or if there's some deeper meaning that I'm missing.   This starts with a pretty simple question: who, exactly, is the Lady of the Tall Trees? The song doesn't really seem to want to go into any level of detail. All it has to say about this topic is...:     ...Our lady of a lot   Said our lady of this and that   And other things that we forgot        ...Our lady of the not   Wraps herself in rice and greens   And other fancy things she bought   This makes the song somewhat difficult to understand, particularly when it comes to any point that the song might be trying to make surrounding who she is and what she's doing. On the other hand, I could be trying to read a song that just seems to be quietly jovial, and nothing more.   How should I be understanding who the Lady is, and what does it mean to the song? "
518,What happened at the end of The Giver?,"At the end of The Giver, Jonas and Gabe head down through the snow to a place where there is music.      Downward, downward, faster and faster. Suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that below, ahead, they were waiting for him; and they were waiting, too, for the baby. For the first time, he heard something that he knew to be music. He heard people singing.   Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.   This ending is kind of confusing. What happened? Did he travel back in time, as implied by the line 'of space and time'? Where did they end up?  Where did they go and how did they get there? "
519,How accurate are the laws in Theodore Boone?,"In Theodore Boone, John Grisham mentions several laws, such as about putting flyers on poles, drunk driving, and other random laws. How accurate are these? Are real laws, anywhere?  Examples:     Theo pressed on, ""The law clearly states that permits must be approved for posters and flyers dealing with politicians and people who are running for office, but not for anything else. These flyers are legal as long as they are taken down within ten days. That's the law.""       The Abduction, chapter 4   ...      ""What was his BAC?""   ""What?""   ""His blood alcohol content.""   ""Oh, that. Does point zero nine sound right?""   ""Yes. The limit is point zero eight, so he's in trouble. First offense?""   ""Why heavens yes, Theo...   ...   ""Some of the cops like to scare people. Your brother will not get ten days. He'll pay a fine of six hundred dollars, lose his license for six months, go to driving school, and a year from now his record can be expunged. Did he spend the entire night in jail?""   ""Yes. I can't imagine...""   ""Then there's no more jail time...       Kid Lawyer, chapter 22  "
520,"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and Wayfarers All","In The Wind in the Willows, Kenneth Grahame's magisterial work, the first half of the book is mostly given over to the adventures of Mole and Ratty (although we are introduced to Badger and Mr. Toad). It ends quietly in chapter 5 (Dulce Domum), with Mole (accompanied by Ratty) finding his old and long-neglected home.  The second half of the book, quite rightly, deals with the amazing (and I suspect highly embellished) adventures of Mr. Toad, of which I am sure you are entirely familiar. However, embedded in these stories are two highly reflective chapters, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Wayfarers All.  Chapter 7 (The Piper at the Gates of Dawn) deals with Mole and Ratty's frantic search for Otter's missing son, Portly. They eventually find him on an island, sleeping at the feet of the demigod, Pan, who Grahame personifies as the protector of animals, and they give him due worship. This indicates that the animals follow a far more ancient religion than the Christianity hinted at in chapter 5 (Dulce Domum). Ratty is thoroughly taken up with the experience, so Mole rows him and Portly back home.  Chapter 9 (Wayfarers All), deals with Ratty's restlessness, and his desire to expand his horizons, and explore a world of which he has little knowledge. He chances on another rat (a true rat, rather than a water vole), and they strike up a conversation. The rat is actually a sailor who has decided to give up the sea and settle down, but he regales Ratty with tales of far-off lands, and Ratty decides that this is the very life for him, and tries to abandon his home (and his friend) and take to the sea. Fortunately, Mole realises that something is wrong and manages to rescue him from his mania.  Now, what are these chapters for? Why did Grahame write them? Are they just intermezzi in a three-act comic opera about Toad, or is there some other significance? As a child, I found The Piper at the Gates of Dawn utterly enchanting, but Wayfarers All bored me, and I usually skipped it. Now that I am well into my middle-age, I can see the relevance of it, and I wish that I had been more adventurous in my youth, but when I was a child, its meaning was lost on me, so what is it doing in a book intended for children?  A related (and perhaps more important) question is: are there any parallels in adult fiction, preferably (but not necessarily) pre-dating this book (first published in 1908)? If so, what purpose do they serve, apart from providing a counterpoint to more exciting chapters? "
521,Does Stellan smoke cinnamon tobacco or chocolate tobacco?,"In the first book of The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica, Here There Be Dragons, Stellan Sigurdsson is told to have smoked a special mix of cinnamon and tobacco.     ""Yes, I can.  It's a tobacco of some kind.""   ""A cinnamon tobacco,"" said John. ""A special mix.""   But later, in The Shadow Dragons (book 4), he's mentioned as smelling of chocolate tobacco.     An instant later he could smell that familiar chocolate-tobacco mixture, as his old mentor and teacher stepped down from the frame.   Is this an error (possibly in my copy only) in the book?  Or is he mentioned as smoking both? "
522,Did Borges invent the idea of writing reviews/summaries of imaginary literary works?,"In reading short stories by the great Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges, I've noticed a repeated theme: many of these stories are written in the style of a review or summary of a much larger and more intricate work, which is wholly imaginary. This seems to be Borges's way of sharing all the awesomely bonkers ideas he comes out with for books, without actually having to go to the effort of writing these massive books himself.   The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim: a review of a 21-chapter book of the same name by the fictional Bombay attorney Mir Bahadur Ali. Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote: a brief description of the complete works of the fictional novelist Pierre Menard, followed by a more detailed study of his attempt to rewrite Don Quixote. A Survey of the Works of Herbert Quain: a brief description of the complete works of the fictional Irish author Herbert Quain. The Garden of Forking Paths: a spy story surrounds the essential philosophical issue of the eponymous work by the fictional philosopher Ts'ui Pen.   Was Borges the inventor of this curious style of storytelling? Or were there other, earlier authors who established the literary technique of creating a story idea but instead of telling it in full, only summarising it and leaving the reader tantalised? "
523,How much weight is given to authors' intentions in literary analysis?,"When people analyze literature, one of the first things people seem to do is look for interviews or quotes from the author where the author describes the meaning they intended their text to have.   My question is: when academics and professors of literature analyze texts, how much weight do they give to authorial intent? Is intention ever used as evidence when discussing the meaning of a text? I would be happy with a brief summery of the various scholarly views on this matter (with citations); there's no need to write a PHD thesis as an answer. "
524,"Are ""choose your own adventure"" books literature or games?","This question concerns ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books. These are books that start out as a normal story, but then ask the reader to make a choice. (The book will say something to the effect of ""turn to page 8 if yes, page 9 if no""). In this fashion, the story expands like a tree.   It seems to me that there are two different ways to think about choose your own adventure books.  The first is to treat choose your own adventure books as a collection of multiple versions of the same story. Let's take a hypothetical story with one choice: do you (the reader) enter the magical portal that takes you to Narnia? At this choice, two versions of the story are created: one where the reader enters Narnia and one where the reader doesn't. If a story has a lot of choices, then a lot of different versions of the story are created. While the different versions of the story can be compared, the act of the reader choosing isn't considered in the analysis of the stories' meaning. In this sense, choose your own adventure games are essentially the same as traditional literature.  The second way of looking at ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books is by analyzing them as games. This means looking at questions like ""how to readers make choices"", or ""how does the act of making a choice affect the meaning of the story.""   My question is: how do scholars and theorists of literature think about ""choose your own adventure"" books? Where do they fall on the literature game spectrum that I just outlined? If there is a debate among scholars, I would accept an answer that outlines the different perspectives in this debate. "
525,What are the Guardians guarding?,"In The 39 Clues: Cahills vs Vespers, Atticus Rosenbloom's mother tells him that they are 'Guardians'. What are they guarding? I don't think that it can be the different pieces of the Doomsday Device, because nobody knew where those were. i.e, the Marco Polo book was buried in Rome.  What are they guarding? "
526,"Meaning of the title ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?""","Horace McCoy's title They Shoot Horses, Don't They? is also       the last sentence of the book. When the policeman asks Robert why did he shoot Gloria, he answers that sentence.   What is the meaning of this enigmatic sentence? How is the crime related to horses? "
527,Whatever happened to the Lurker Files?,"The Lurker Files was a web-serial running between 1996 and 1997. In Wintervale University, the mysterious ""Lurker""'s power is the anonymity and malleability of online activity - he assumes others' identities in chat rooms; entraps and blackmails students to do his bidding; and in general, brings to life a variety of dangers to the brave new world that was The World Wide Web of the '90s.  The series was originally written by Scott Ciencin for four books (Faceless, No Fear, Nemesis, and Incarnate). The first three of these were also printed and sold by Random House.  At the time, readers were urged to try and figure out the Lurker's true identity. In the last chapter written by Ciencin, we get:      The Lurker hesitated for a long moment--then removed the Dethboy mask.      Gia couldn't believe what she was seeing. She stared long and hard into the Lurker's face.      ""Now you know,"" the Lurker said.   -- but the reader does not get to learn the Lurker's identity.  From this point, the series was continued by Marc Cerasini (Apparition, Triad, Clandestine). The books got kind of wonky under Cerasini, veering from web-focused thriller/mystery into SF/F.  From October 1997 to January 1998, readers were exhorted to ""Get ready for the Lurker Files finale!"". However, the finale never came, and the Lurker's identity was never revealed.  What happened to the Lurker Files? Why was the series never concluded, and the Lurker's identity never revealed? Did something happen behind the scenes -- perhaps relating to the switchover between Ciencin and Cerasini? "
528,What is Hobbes?,"In the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson, Calvin is a boy. He has a tiger friend, who's... a little ambiguous. Is he a doll or a real tiger or a figment of his imagination? To Calvin he appears real, and to everybody else he looks like a stuffed toy.  Is Hobbes real or not? "
529,What is a Pooh?,"Winnie the Pooh is our favorite ball of fluff that likes to eat honey in the Hundred-Acre Wood... but where does he get his name from? Specifically, where does ""Pooh"" come from?  I know that Winnie comes from a real bear that was the pet/mascot of a Canadian Army solider/battalion that was named after the city of Winnipeg. The bear eventually ended up in the London Zoo.  A.A. Milne took his son Christopher Robin to the zoo where Christopher fell in love with Winnie and eventually named is own stuffed bear the same. That toy bear later became the inspiration for the Winnie the Pooh series.  However, this does not explain where ""Pooh"" comes from, especially since in-universe he is always called just ""Pooh"" or ""Pooh Bear"".   So where does the Pooh name come from?  Side bar (not part of the main question): Considering this was a children's series and ""Pooh"" is close to ""poo"" which is short for ""poop"" which is a euphemism for excrement, did ""poo"" mean the same thing back in 1926 as it does today?  If it did, did A.A. Milne take this into consideration when naming his character? "
530,"When and why did the practice of reading ""Address to a Haggis"" at Burns Night dinner originate?","Many people and institutions around the world hold Burns suppers on or close to Burns Night, 25 January. Part of these events is the traditional reading of Robert Burns's ""Address to a Haggis""1, during or after which the haggis is sliced open and served.  What's the history of the reading of this poem at Burns suppers? How and why did the practice first begin, and how far back does it go? Clearly it's a Burns poem about food, and therefore suitable for a Burns supper, but is it the only one, or is there more to it than that? I'm curious about this tradition, since it's one of few occasions I've been to where the reading of a poem (other than grace) is an important part of a meal.  1 Which I'd always thought was called ""Ode to a Haggis"". Am I wrong, or is this an alternative title? "
531,"What are the ""old euphemisms"" in The Great Gatsby?","In chapter 6 of The Great Gatsby, Nick describes Daisy's reaction to the people of West Egg:     But the rest offended her—and inarguably, because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place.” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.   I'm interested in the part in bold, which says that Daisy was ""appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms"".  What are the ""old euphemisms"" being referred to?  I've wondered about this for years.  A euphemism is where you use one word as a substitute for a more offensive word.  But I don't think Fitzgerald is referring to literal euphemism here.  I have one theory: perhaps he means that rich people have upper-class families have a way of masking their hedonistic tendencies.  The new-money people of West Egg, on the other hand, are more ostentatious about their hedonism.  Is this what Fitzgerald is talking about? "
532,What is the relevance of the essays in Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'?,"War and Peace is regularly interspersed with essays -- something that I have not seen anywhere else in literature. How significant are these essays? They obviously help in exploring the themes and messages of the novel, but how do they fit in the definition of fiction?  Large sections of the novel, especially the second epilogue, are philosophical discussions instead of a narrative. So I wondered whether this novel should be considered fiction, non-fiction or an amalgamation.  "
533,Why were these animals used to represent the different countries in Maus?,"In Art Spiegelman's Maus, he represents different people from different countries as different animals. For instance, he represents the Jews as mice, the Germans as cats, the Polish as pigs, the Americans as dogs, and the French people as frogs. How were these choices representative of the different countries?   I mean, the Jews/mice and the Germans/cats is easy - they were hunted like cats hunt mice. But why the others?  "
534,Was FitzGerald the first to collect the poems of the Rubaiyat together?,"According to Wikipedia:     Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyám is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and numbering about a thousand, attributed to Omar Khayyám (1048–1131), a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer.   Was Edward FitzGerald the first to collect these poems together and publish them in a unified work, or had there been previous published volumes (in any language) of collected works of Omar Khayyám? I'd always assumed the Rubaiyat was the magnum opus of Khayyám himself, rather than being gathered together long after his death by someone else, but am I wrong? "
535,Did Frodo want Bilbo to die?,"I was reading in the first volume of the Lord of the Rings recently, and ran across this quote when Gandalf and Frodo are talking about the Ring for the first time after its true nature has been discovered.     ""There wasn’t any permanent harm done, was there?"" asked Frodo anxiously. ""He would get all right in time, wouldn’t he? Be able to rest in peace, I mean?""   What did Tolkien mean by ""rest in peace""?  Evidently, in modern terms it usually refers to death, but was that what Frodo was referring to, or was this a foreshadowing of Bilbo's journey across the sea? "
536,"Why does John Winthrop compare the Massachusetts Bay Colonists to ""a city upon a hill""?","John Winthrop's sermon ""A Model of Christian Charity"" (which you can read online) is an extraordinarily famous sermon, which is referenced by American politicians to this day.  In this sermon, John Winthrop compares the American colonists to ""a city upon a hill"":     We shall find that the God of Israel is among us, when ten of us shall be able to resist a thousand of our enemies; when He shall make us a praise and glory that men shall say of succeeding plantations, ""may the Lord make it like that of New England."" For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world. We shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the ways of God, and all professors for God's sake. We shall shame the faces of many of God's worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us till we be consumed out of the good land whither we are going.    What point is John Winthrop trying to make here by referencing ""a city upon a hill""? How would this have been interpreted by his audience?   I'm asking this question because this passage tends to be interpreted by modern audiences as one of the first instances of American exceptionalism. I'm trying to get a sense of whether that is an after the fact interpretation or a reflection of how the sermon was interpreted at the time it was created. "
537,What's the symbolism in The Twelve Days of Christmas?,"The popular Christmas song ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" has many different versions, but they're usually something along the lines of the following (final verse, which includes all the others):     On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me:   Twelve drummers drumming,   Eleven pipers piping,   Ten lords a-leaping,   Nine ladies dancing,   Eight maids a-milking,   Seven swans a-swimming,   Six geese a-laying,   Five gold rings,   Four calling birds,   Three French hens,   Two turtle doves,   And a partridge in a pear tree.   What do these choices of gifts symbolise? What's the deeper significance of each of the twelve types of people, animals, or objects? I seem to remember reading about a Christian significance (the twelve drummers are the twelve apostles, the four calling birds are the four evangelists, and so on). Wikipedia also mentions an interpretation in terms of Catholic catechism, but also cites a source claiming that this is incorrect. I'd be interested in seeing both the evidence for and against this Catholic interpretation, and also any other reasonable interpretation of the song. A good answer would list several different possible symbolic meanings and summarise evidence for/against each one. "
538,Why Did Doyle Choose 221B Baker Street?,"221B Baker Street. One of the most famous addresses in literature. But why?  Was there any reason Sir Arthur Conan Doyle chose this particular address as the residence of his famous protagonist? Did he have any links to that part of London?  EDIT: I've been told the house didn't exist at the time, but the street existed, and maybe the number 221 has other significance in his life. "
539,"Does V reference Stanislaw Lem's ""His Master's Voice"", and if so, why?","I've recently been reading and re-reading Alan Moore and David Lloyd's V for Vendetta. After having skimmed through it multiple times and settling a few questions I had about the continuity, only one question remains. In volume I, chapter 2, The Voice, on page 13 the following conversation occurs:       ... they eradicated some cultures more thoroughly than they did others.   No Tamla and no Trojan. No Billie Holiday or Black Uhuru...   Just His Master's Voice. Every hour. On the hour.   We'll have to see what we can do about that...   Italics authors', bold emphasis and choice of capitalisation mine  V says ""his master's voice"", which is also the title of the novel by Stanislaw Lem.  I can see that V is most likely talking about the order in which the citizens of post-war Britain live - the oppression, constant surveillance, fascism, etc. V's primary goal throughout the novel is to make people raise their heads and pave their own way with their own decisions, as opposed to their masters' voice.  But still I find the choice of words here peculiar. Having skimmed through Lem's novel's description on Wikipedia I can see that it is not exactly about the same things as V for Vendetta. There is a bit about ""criticizing Cold War military and political decision-making as corrupting the ethical conduct of scientists"", but as I said, this is not what V for Vendetta is about.  So here comes my question: is this quote a conscious reference to Stanislaw Lem's His Master's Voice? If so, how exactly are the two books linked? If not, what explains this choice of words (for instance, ""their master's voice"" would be more suitable, I think)?     I would appreciate if spoilers from Lem's novels be tagged as such  "
540,Was Twain the first author to write of Zombies?,"Although the word is not used, Twain's zany novel of title-frenzy and mad-scientist capitalistic schemes The American Claimant (sequel to The Gilded Age) describes the intent by the megalomaniac Mulberry Sellers to ""materialize"" dead people for use as cheap labor. He intends to contract these would-be minions of his out as policemen and soldiers and such, thus saving city and national governments big money while reaping a giant profits for himself.  Is this 1892 novel the first to include ""zombies"" among its characters?  Actually, these ""zombies"" never really materialize - they remain figments of Mulberry's overfertile imagination; yet still, as far as the concept goes, is this the ""advent of the zombies""?  If so, Twain was not only ahead of his time, again, but a case could be made that he foresaw the inroads that robots would make into the labor market (if you stretch or conflate ""zombies"" to ""robots""). "
541,Are there any recorded discrepancies between The Odyssey as oral tradition and The Odyssey as Homer transcribed it?,"The Odyssey began as oral tradition, and was later transcribed by someone we now call ""Homer."" Disregarding the Homeric Question concerning the identity of the person who transcribed these works, it recently occurred to me...  Since The Odyssey began as oral tradition, it must naturally have evolved over time. Transcription of oral tradition is an imperfect process, and having been passed by memory and by oral education, small changes are bound to accrue. Additionally, any specific player/orator has control over their performance, and individual changes as an individual deemed necessary are also likely.  It also seems plausible that multiple copies of at least parts of The Odyssey should exist: that ""Homer"" and Homer alone should feel the need to write them down seems counter-intuitive and inexplicable. It would be surprising to me to learn that only Homer bothered to write any portion of The Odyssey down.   At a minimum, if multiple people had versions of The Odyssey in their memory that differed from Homer's, I'd expect to find an account of that somewhere. There are a great number of ways that changes and differences could have been recorded and retained; that none of them seem to be mentioned anywhere confuses me.  Are there different copies of parts of The Odyssey, or is Homer's version the only known evidence of this oral tradition? If so, are there major differences between them, or are written versions largely consistent with the one presented by Homer? "
542,How much did Eddie Willers understand about his situation by the end of Atlas Shrugged?,"From the opening lines of Atlas Shrugged at the beginning of chapter 1:     ""Who is John Galt?""      The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked straight at Ellie Willers, mocking and still - as if the question had been addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him.      ""Why did you say that?"" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense.      The bum leaned against the side of the doorway; a wedge of broken glass behind him reflected the metal yellow of the sky.      ""Why does it bother you?"" he asked.      ""It doesn't,"" snapped Eddie Willers...      Eddie Willers walked on, wondering why he always felt it at this time of day, this sense of dread without reason. No, he thought, not dread, there's nothing to fear: just an immense, diffused apprehension, with no source of object. He had become accustomed to the feeling, but he could find no explanation for it; yet the bum had spoken as if he knew that Eddie felt it, as if he thought that one should feel it, and more: as if he knew the reason.   To what extent did Eddie learn why he felt that later, or why it bothered him so much? Why did he tell the bum that it didn't bother him when they both knew that it did? Who was Eddie trying to convince - the bum or himself? "
543,Vonnegut's writing style as time passed,"I've been reading a lot of Vonnegut recently, and I've noticed some interesting stuff. Slaughterhouse-Five or the Children's Crusade, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, and Cat's Cradle are similar to a novel in format, though Slaughterhouse Five is of course all ""out of order"" and in two of the three, Vonnegut breaks the fourth wall more than a few times.   On the other hand, Timequake is this weird combination of stream of consciousness, real life, and fiction, so you have no idea what the heck's going on. Semi-similarly, Wampeters, Foma, and Granfalloons (a collection of Vonnegut's talks and articles) go over all sorts of different topics, with little rhyme or reason (at least to my mind), feeling kind of stream of conscious-y as well.   Interestingly, looking at the dates the novels were published, it shakes out as follows:   Cat's Cradle - 1963 God Bless You Mr. Rosewater - 1965 Slaughterhouse Five - 1969 Wampeters, Foma, and Granfalloons - 1974 Timequake - 1997   That is, the later the book was published, the less like a normal novel the book is. Does this hold true for the rest of Vonnegut's books? Was this intentional? Why did this happen?  "
544,"Does Gale have a sadistic streak, or is he merely willing to be ruthless?","There are two particular incidents that I was thinking of in particular. First was his comment to Katniss prior to the first Hunger Games that killing people in the Arena wasn't really all that different than just hunting animals.  The second was his invention of bombs designed to maximize casualties. In particular, he designed a bomb with two blasts: one to kill/injure people and a second, delayed explosion so that when people rushed in to help the wounded it would kill them, too. Even after Katniss confronts him about this, he rationalizes it and doesn't appear to show much remorse about its potential effects.  At a minimum, these seem exceptionally callous. What accounts for his willingness to be so ruthless and to show such an indifference to the suffering of others? Is he sadistic, or is he merely willing to be ruthless? "
545,Can 'peripeteia' be a positive change too?,"Peripeteia is an unexpected reversal of circumstances or a turning point. In tragedy, this sudden change of circumstances is usually a negative one. Is it possible for peripeteia to be a positive one too? For example:     A guy named Peter has been working hard his whole life, but has never gotten any credit for his work. Unexpectedly, he starts getting the appreciation he deserves and gets a promotion or a raise.    Can the example I just used be called 'peripeteia'? My example was probably not the most radical one, though. I'm sorry if my english is bad, it isn't my mother language. "
546,What's it called when a short quote appears at the beginning of a chapter?,"I've read several novels (Cornelia Funke's Inkheart trilogy springs to mind, for example) in which each chapter is associated with a quote from some other piece of literature, which is usually somehow relevant to the events of the chapter. The same technique can be used with short story collections, the quotes being associated with individual stories rather than chapters (see Poe, for example).  Is there a name for this literary practice, or for the quotes themselves?  For example, I'd like to be able to say ""Poe often practised _____ by putting a quote just below the title in many of his short stories"" or ""What is the significance of the _____ quote for Chapter 17 in [book]?"" "
547,What should we make of the newspaper vendor in Atlas Shrugged?,"Related: How should we view Dan Conway?  First, a quote from the opening scene of the book:     ""Who is John Galt?""   The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and still - as if the question had been addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him.   ""Why did you say that?"" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense.   The bum leaned against the side of a doorway; a wedge of broken glass behind him reflected the metal yellow of the sky.   ""Why does it bother you?"" he asked.   ""It doesn't,"" snapped Eddie Willers.   Later, towards the end of Part 1, Chapter 3, Dagney Taggert encounters a newspaper vendor in the Taggart Terminal:     In the corner of the concourse, by the main entrance, there was a small newsstand. The owner, a quiet, courteous old man with an air of breeding, had stood behind his counter for twenty years. He had owned a cigarette factory once, but it had gone bankrupt, and he had resigned himself to the lonely obscurity of his little stand in the midst of an eternal whirlpool of strangers. He had no family or friends left alive. He had a hobby which was his only pleasure; he gathered cigarettes from all over the world for his private collection; he knew every brand made or that had ever been made.      Dagney liked to stop at his newsstand on his way out. He seemed to be part of the Taggart Terminal, like an old watchdog too feeble to protect it, but reassuring by the loyalty of his presence. He liked to see her coming... she stopped tonight, as usual, to buy a pack of cigarettes... ""   ""I like cigarettes, Miss Taggart. I like to think of fire held in a man's hand. Fire, a dangerous force, tamed at his fingertips. I often wonder about the hours when a man sits alone, watching the smoke of a cigarette, thinking. I wonder what get things have come from such hours. When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind - and it is proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.""...   After they muse about whether people do think these days, he continued:     ""I don't like the thing that's happening to people, Miss Taggert.""   ""What?""   ""I don't know. But I've watched them here for twenty years and I've seen the change. They used to rush through here, and it was wonderful to watch, it was the hurry of men who knew where they were going and were eager to get there. Now they're hurrying because they are afraid. It's not a purpose that drives them, it's fear. They're not going anywhere, they're escaping. And I don't think they know what it is that they want to escape. They don't look at one another. They jerk when brushed against. They smile too much, but it's an ugly kind of smiling; it's not joy, it's pleading. I don't know what it is that's happening to the world."" He shrugged. ""Oh, well, who is John Galt?""   ""He's just a meaningless phrase!""   She was surprised by the sharpness of her own voice... ""Why do people keep saying it? Nobody seems able to explain just what it stands for, yet they all use it as if they knew the meaning.""   ""Why does it disturb you?"" he asked.   ""I just don't like what they seem to mean when they say it.""   ""I don't, either, Miss Taggart.""   There are some interesting parallels here. First, the parallel phrase ""Why does it bother you?"" (the bum) vs. ""Why does it disturb you?"" (the newspaperman). Both Dagney and Eddie replied (Eddie ""snapped"" and Dagney replied ""sharply"").  Eddie denies that it bothers him at all, and Dagney says that it bothers her because she doesn't like what she thinks people mean by it.  The bum seems to be a permanent fixture of the streets (""pleas for dimes were so common on the streets these days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations"") and the newspaperman is a fixture of the Taggart Terminal itself.  Both the bum and the newspaperman have at least some degree of insight into the situation. The bum ""had spoken as if he knew that Eddie felt [the causeless uneasiness], and as if he thought that one should feel it, and more: as if he knew the reason.""  The newspaperman displays passive resignation to his situation, and the bum is described as having a ""cynical"" resignation to his situation. And yet the bum is described as ""intelligent.""  What do we make of these parallels? Are the characters supposed to be similar, or is there supposed to be a contrast?  The newspaper seems almost like a cross between Eddie Willers and Dan Conway in a weird sort of way.  Normally, passive resignation is seen as a bad trait, and the newspaperman's factory had gone bankrupt at least 20 years earlier. (The circumstances are never described, so it's not clear if it was due to incompetence or mismanagement on his part or if it was just bad luck or some other set of circumstances). With that said, he was aware of what was happening to people, didn't seem to share in their fear or purposelessness, and didn't like what was happening.  What are we to make of him? How did Ayn Rand want us to view him? "
548,Why does Sara frequently describe herself using derogatory words in Pack Challenge?,"Someone recommended Pack Challenge by Shelly Laurenston to me. It's erotica FYI--not really sure if this is the place for questions about that, but I thought I would try anyway. The main character has this obsession with the words slut and whore, and I'm starting to find it annoying     She glanced over at the clock on her night table. She still had a couple of hours before she had to be into work, but she just couldn’t face Zach when he woke up. He would, naturally, think her a big ol’ slut. Probably want to pass her around to his friends. And she couldn’t really blame him. She hadn’t merely thrown herself at the guy. She’d practically tackled him. The thought made her cheeks burn.   and     Finally she loosened her grip on him. But, to his surprise, she wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned her forehead against his chest. “When, exactly, did I become such a fucking whore?”      Now Zach was completely confused. “What are you talking about?”      “Me. I’m a whore.” Zach wasn’t sure if she wanted him to start calling her that during sex or if she was serious. Instead of potentially sending her spiraling into depression, he decided to go with her possibly being serious.      “Do you do this sort of thing with everybody in town?”      “No!” She looked up at him, completely insulted.      “Then you’re not a whore. Psychotic? Absolutely. Whore? No.   The main character appears to use the words ""slut"" and ""whore"" on every single page.   The Goodreads reviews are a mixed bag: some people seem to like the book and some people don't. The reviews that don't like the book all seem to mention the main character's use of the words ""slut"" and ""whore"". The reviews that are positive don't seem to mention it at all. I'm trying to understand the perspective of people who don't find this annoying.   Why does the main character use these words so frequently? "
549,What exactly happened with the glasses?,"The man who wrote the diary displays a very strange reaction to what (for me) appears to be a negligible accident - having his and his friend's (with whom he was kissing) glasses entangle and fall on the ground.  He picks them up, (some other woman comes in?), and he leaves in a hurry, despite him liking the woman he was together with at the moment, and her asking him to stay. He even goes as far as remarking that he felt as if he had stumbled upon a corpse in the darkness.  What was this scene about? Why did he leave her, and what did the glasses have to do with this? The whole story of the book hinges on this breakup, and yet the breakup isn't explained, even in the slightest detail. "
550,Why did Lillian Reardon appear to admire the Steel Mills?,"Shortly after their wedding anniversary celebration (p. 152 in my edition), Hank Reardon recalls Lillian coming down from New York on her own initiative to see his Mills:     [Hank] remembered the day when Lillian came from New York to his office, of her own sudden choice, and asked him to take her through his mills. He heard a soft, low, breathless tone - the tone of admiration - growing in her voice, as she questioned him about his work and looked at the place around her. He looked at her graceful figure moving against the bursts of furnace flame, and at the light swift steps of her high heels stumbling through drifts of slag, as she walked resolutely by his side. The look in her eyes, when she watched a heat of steel being poured, was like his own feeling for it made visible to him. When her eyes moved up to his face, he saw the same look, but intensified to a degree that seemed to make her helpless and silent. It was at dinner, that evening, that he asked her to marry him.   Why did she react that way to seeing the Mills? Why did intensifying it ""seem to make her helpless and silent""? Admittedly, she never could've matched his genius (a fact that she was well aware of), but then again, neither could Eddie Willers. Eddie Willers openly admitted that he couldn't match Dagney or Hank Reardon's talent, and yet he's a thoroughly moral character. Why is it that Eddie's respect for talent make him moral, and yet Lillian's (apparent) admiration of the Mills made her seem ""helpless and silent""? Why did she react that way to the Mills in the first place, and why didn't she continue to express admiration for the Mills later in the book? "
551,"Is ""The Good Work"" by Theodore L Thomas a commentary on any kind of real-world society?","While skimming through answered story-identification questions on another SE site to look for good short stories to read, I came across ""The Good Work"", written in 1959 by the American author Theodore L Thomas, and available to read here. It paints a grim picture of life in a future world, with a population of 350 billion, in which everyone lives on dull food called Standard Fare unless they can somehow, by some miracle, find a job. At the end of the story it transpires that the jobs people are given by the government are entirely useless; they only work for the sake of having work.  Is this story a commentary on any kind of real-world society? Either a society which actually exists or has existed, or a model proposed by political theorists of the time. My first thought, due to the header ""Loosener, Tightener, Socialism"" on the blog post linked above, was that it might be a satire on Soviet socialism, but I'm open to any plausible interpretation.  (A good answer might be based on comparison of the text of this story to such societies as described or actualised in the real world, or potentially on an analysis of the author's political views e.g. as expressed in his other writings.) "
552,"Before reading ""A Grain of Wheat,"" what historical facts and cultural context are useful to know?","I'm looking to read A Grain of Wheat, by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. However, I'm very unfamiliar with the history and culture of Kenya, to the point where I know practically nothing about it.   But I do know this: that the history of Kenya is long and complicated, and the culture of Kenya is, well, a culture. Absorbing it all before reading this book seems a little unnecessary, bordering on impossible.   My question, then, is: what should I already know (or familiarize myself with) before going into this book? Do I need geopolitical context? What key elements of Kenyan culture and history should I read about before I pick up this book? "
553,"What ""unspeakable conclusion"" was Amira's father about to reach?","The short story ""Seasons of Glass and Iron"", winner of the 2017 Hugo Award for Best Short Story, may be read in full here. I just read it last night, and a single passage confused me, in the story of how Amira came to be on her glass hill:     The king’s daughter read an unspeakable conclusion in her father’s eye, and in a rush to keep it from reaching his mouth, said, Suppose you placed me atop a glass hill where none could reach me, and say that only the man who can ride up the hill in full armor may claim me as his bride?   What was this ""unspeakable conclusion""? It can't be to marry her off to some prince, as he'd already said this was impossible for political reasons - nor can it be to put her on the glass hill, since that was her proposal to forestall him. "
554,How much of the sequel to the Princess Bride was written?,"As mentioned on Wikipedia, in some later editions of The Princess Bride, the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby, which Goldman said was a  sequel, appears at the end.  A sequel was never realized, and one might argue that he was never serious about Buttercup's Baby, though my impression from an interview (see also Wikipedia link) was that he seriously did want to write a sequel.   Is there any evidence that he wrote more of Buttercup's Baby than 1 chapter? All of Goldman's ""real-world"" stories about The Princess Bride (e.g., things about Morgenstern) are made up.  Is there any evidence that Chapter 1 of Buttercup's Baby was really intended to be the beginning of the sequel he wanted to write?   Note: I read the 25th anniversary edition, but do not have the 30th, which according to Wikipedia has hints about a sequel plot, so I do not know what is in there, or if that was serious or just fantasy. "
555,To what extent did Defoe attempt to apply formal realism in Robinson Crusoe?,"I recently finished writing a paper on Robinson Crusoe for my English class on the rise of the novel. We had read the novel concurrently with excerpts from Ian Watt's The Rise of the Novel, in which he argued that the works of Defoe, Richardson (we then read Pamela) and Fielding - which Watt categorized as the early novels - used what he called ""formal realism"". Moreover, he stated that these were some of the first - if not the first - significant pieces of literature to do so.  Robinson Crusoe bears many hallmarks of formal realism (as I understand them):   The presentation of people and events as ""evidence"", to use Watt's phrasing. An attention to detail even in cases where it might seem overboard. For instance, some sections of Crusoe's journal seem . . . unnecessary. At the least, as we discussed, it's not clear that they're intended to advance the plot. The implication that this is an authentic presentation of the events as they occurred.   All of this has me a little curious as to the thought processes of Defoe and company (although I'll stick to Defoe, for simplicity). Was Defoe aware that he was using a new sort of realist techniques, and was this usage intentional? Put another way, are the indicators of formal realism in Robinson Crusoe part of an effort by Defoe, or just elements of the writing that were noticed long after the fact? "
556,"The proper way to count ""edition"" numbering","Let's assume there is some John Doe, who is an author of Some Book.  This book was published by Some Publisher in 1800, in 2 volumes. Then, it was published again in 1805, by the same publisher, with minor corrections.  And in 1810 it was published again, by the same publisher, but in 3 volumes, with images, preface, glossary, on handmade paper and in very limited quantity (only 300). And much more pricey, of course.  And this pricey ""version"" was published again, in 1815, by the same publisher, with minor corrections.  So...  Do we have 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions here?  Or do we have 1st and 2nd and again 1st and 2nd editions?  I have already read the Wikipedia article about ""edition"", and it seems this question could be answered differently, i.e. from the bibliographical point of view, and from the publisher's point of view, and the publisher's point of view isn't consistent.  But I'm not sure.  Please give me some light on it. Probably there exists some strong and rigid classification for it? "
557,Unabridged edition of Le Morte d'Arthur published before 1923,"In what edition of Le Morte d'Arthur, published before 1923, can I find the full, unabridged, uncensored version of Caxton's 1485 text?  Yes, I know, Heinrich Oskar Sommer's work is perfect, but it's too hard to read, for obvious reasons.  Probably F.J.Simmons edition? It has modernized spelling, and it says they used Upcott's* text and fixed it by comparing with Sommer's edition. But I'm not sure, because, as we all know, written words are not always true.  (I chose the year 1923 due to copyright reasons).    * Upcott's edition is much better known as Southey's edition, but in fact Southey just wrote the preface, and has nothing to do with the text itself. The text is based on Caxton's 1485 edition, but contains a lot of errors and some strange replacements. "
558,(Why) Is there a shift in style in Toll the Hounds?,"By and large, I have found the writing style in the Malazan Book of the Fallen to be consistent across the first seven novels. They were all written by Steven Erikson. However, I feel there is a distinct shift in style in the eight book, Toll the Hounds, also written by Erikson.  Toll the Hounds seems to feature numerous passages of a style similar to, for example, the concluding section of Book Two's Chapter 9:     Night seeps into Darujhistan, a thick blinding fog in which people   stumble or hide as they walk the alleys and streets. Some are drawn   like moths to the lit areas and the welcoming eternal hiss of gas from   the wrought iron poles. Others seek to move as one with the darkness,   at least until some damned piece of crockery snaps underfoot, or a   pebble is sent skittering. And everywhere can be seen the small   glitter of rodent eyes, or heard the slither of tails.      Light glows through shutters and bubbled glass windows, but never mind   the light and all peaceful slumber and discourse and all the rest such   illumination might reveal! Dull and witless the expectations so   quickly and predictably surrendered!      [Followed by quick peeks on the actions of Lady Challice, Torvald Nom,   a guard, an ironmonger (?), Harllo Jr and a Great Raven, and this   final passage:]      And this was a night like any other, a skein of expectations and   anticipations, revelations and perturbations. Look around. Look   around! On all sides, day and night, light and dark! Every step taken   with the firm resolve to believe in the solid ground awaiting it.   Every step, one after another, again and again, and no perilous ledge   yawns ahead, oh no.      Step and step, now, step and step &mdash;   I'm not sure what to call this sort of writing, but it generally features:   a quick third-person overview of a bunch of characters, flowery descriptions of the scenery, and exhortations to the reader to do something (look at, or appreciate the irony of, or take pity on, something or the other) a short length (2-3 pages at most)   This sort of writing is not unusual in itself*, but I don't think the previous 7 books had many, if any, instances of it, whereas Toll the Hounds has multiple such instances - and I am not even halfway through it! Personally I find such sections tedious, making the entire book far more hard reading than the others.  Is there a noticeable change in Erikson's writing style in this book? If so, what triggered it? Has he talked about it somewhere?    * It reminds me of 19th - early 20th century writings, for some reason. Dickens? O'Henry? "
559,Is there an annotated edition of 'It Can't Happen Here' for non-American readers?,"I recently read Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel It Can't Happen Here. The novel appeared on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books after the 2016 USA presidential elections, along with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and, lower down the list, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and Orwell's Animal Farm.   In an article in The New York Times Book Review titled ""Reading the Classic Novel That Predicted Trump"", professor Beverly Gage (who did not necessarily choose the article's title), wrote,     “It Can’t Happen Here” is a work of dystopian fantasy, one man’s effort in the 1930s to imagine what it might look like if fascism came to America. At the time, the obvious specter was Adolf Hitler, whose rise to power in Germany provoked fears that men like the Louisiana senator Huey Long or the radio priest Charles Coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the United States. (...)   In 1935, Lewis was trying to prevent the unthinkable: the election of a pseudo-fascist candidate to the presidency of the United States.   The persons mentioned in the book are partly real and historical—e.g. Huey Long, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Charles Coughlin—, partly fictional, e.g. the presidential candidates Berzelius ""Buzz"" Windrip (Democrate) and Walt Trowbridge (Republican).   The book mentions a number of persons, organisations, etc. that modern readers are usually not familiar with, such as OGPU (the Soviet Union's secret police at the time), Julius Streicher, Béla Kun, Salvemini (actually Gaetano Salvemini) and Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West.  The book also mentions many persons, organisations, etc. that non-American readers may not be familiar with, e.g. Frank Buchman, Lothrop Stoddard, the Townsend Plan, the NRA (no, not that other NRA), FERA, the YMHA, GAR, Caspar Milquetoast. The abbreviations are not expanded; many of the names are probably also unfamiliar to many American readers today.  The book also mentions many authors and book titles (novelists etc.); it is up to the reader to figure out how these names are relevant in the context where they are mentioned (which is almost impossible if you are not familiar with their works).  It is usually clear whether a name is fictional or not, especially if you know a bit about the history of English literature. Wikipedia can be a great help, but the lists of names can become really long, for example when in chapter 22, Lewis lists celebrities and journalists that get arrested: Raymond Moley, Frank Simonds, Frank Kent, Heywood Broun, Mark Sullivan (not identifiable on Wikipedia), Earl Browder, Franklin P. Adams, George Seldes, Frazier Hunt, Garet Garrett, Granville Hicks, Edwin James (presumably this one) and Robert Morss Lovett. This is a single enumeration on the same page (p. 219 in Penguin's 2017 reprint).   So there's a lot of name dropping and it is rather tedious to look up every unfamiliar or half-familiar name and book title just to make sure you aren't overlooking any hidden meanings and allusions. For this reason, I would like to know if there is an annotated edition of Sinclair Lewis's novel It Can't Happen Here that would meet the following criteria:   For every name, organisation or book title that is real, this should be mentioned. Readers can then safely assume that the other names are fictional.  For every author or book title where the content of the work would clarify something that is said in the book, the annotations should explain what information is relevant in that context. The same applies to politicians and the ideas they represented. E.g. who was Gaetano Salvemini (p. 202)?  If events described in the novel have a historical parallel in Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy or Stalin's Russia, this should be explained. For example, both a BBC journalist and a French journalist visiting the USA during Windrip's presidency note that the people are perfectly happy; they don't seem to know that the country has both labour camps and concentration camps, and they don't comment (or did not notice?) on racist policies.   Goodreads lists an annotated Kindle edition (ASIN: B00751IMZM), but I can't find a trace of it on Amazon, so I don't know whether it fits my criteria. (The Kindle version from Signet Classics doesn't appear to have annotations.) "
560,Is there any significance to the races of mates and harpooners in Moby Dick?,"To my best knowledge, all four boatmates in Moby Dick are white men from the New England. The boatmates are the men in charge of the small whaling boats.   Ahab - Quaker(?) from New England, possibly Nantucket. Starbuck - a thoughtful and intellectual Quaker from Nantucket. Stubbs - a good-humored, easy, and careless man from Cape Cod. Flask - A short, stout man hailing from Martha's Vineyard.   The harpooners in each boat are all non-white. Each is a harpooner for the corresponding boatmate above.   Fedallah - a Zoroastrian Parsi from India. He prophesies the end of Ahab. Queequeg - from a fictional island called Rokovoko in Polynesia,  Tashtego - a Wampanoag native American from Martha's Vineyard, and a personification of the hunter. Daggoo - from a coastal village in Africa with a noble bearing and grace.   The descriptions of their characters come from a Wikipedia article.  Is there anything from Herman Melville's writings that explain why the men in charge of each boat is white while the men holding the harpoons are non-white?  If there is no commentary by Melville himself, is there any literary analysis that might provide insights into why he chose these characters? "
561,What is the meaning of this sentence from A Retrieved Reformation?,"This is a line from O. Henry's A Retrieved Reformation.

What is ""clemency foolishness""? Does it mean foolish enough to do offense that is not easily pardoned or anything else? "
562,Why is Dervish so rich?,"In the Demonata series by Darren Shan, Grubbs's uncle Dervish (introduced in the first book and a major character from there onwards) is very rich: he lives in a mansion with all mod cons, has teams of lawyers to handle the situation at the end of book 1, and so on. As Grubbs puts it in book 3:     (my uncle—he mucho reeeech)   Where did all Dervish's money come from?   Did he inherit a huge pile of cash? But his brother, Grubbs's father, never seemed to be on the same financial level as Dervish.   Did he earn it all himself somehow? But he's not that old (in his thirties, I'd guess, though I don't remember for sure), and our glimpse of his younger self in book 2 doesn't seem much like an up-and-coming business mogul or the like.   Maybe this is elaborated upon somewhere in book 1? This is the only book I don't actually have to hand (since I borrowed it from the library years ago before buying the rest). "
563,"Meaning of ""With Ismail's storm to soften it the more"" in Byron's ""Don Juan""","Canto 8, stanza 68, from Byron's Don Juan:      So much for Nature: -- by way of variety,   Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!

What is the meaning of ""all game and bottom"", especially of ""bottom""? ""All game"" means ""quite willing to meet his death"", I think. What does ""bottom"" mean (or ""all bottom"")?    I looked in the dictionaries, but haven't found any suitable meaning. My only guess is quite weak - that he fell ""bottom-most"" and all the others fell upon him, or maybe that those who killed him fell upon him. But that is apparently not the case.   "

566,What makes the writing style of The Dynasts so distinctive?,"Reading Poetry Foundation's page on Thomas Hardy, I came across this description of his epic drama The Dynasts, set during the Napoleonic Wars and published in 1904-1908:     Hardy also pioneered a new kind of verse. According to John Wain’s introduction to the 1965 St. Martin’s Press edition of the dramatic poem, in composing The Dynasts Hardy took “one of those sudden jumps which characterize the man of genius. ... He wrote his huge work in accordance with conventions of an art that had not yet been invented: the art of cinema.” The Dynasts, following this view, is “neither a poem, nor a play, nor a story. It is a shooting-script.”   What about the writing of this story makes it so distinctive? In what sense is it cinematic? What exactly makes it so different from other poems, plays, and stories of the time? "
567,Story of a divided kingdom?,I have been trying to remember a short story I heard some time ago. I'm hoping someone can shed some light on the name of the story.  I know very little of its origin. I'm not sure if it was originally a book and the narrative and details provided are very vague so I will preemptively apologize.  I have put parts of the story that I am (even more) unsure of in parentheses.  The story went something like this:  There is a king (who is paranoid of losing his power?) who gradually divides his kingdom into smaller and smaller sections (this may have been contrasted with a (previous king or king in another kingdom?) who is kind and wise). Eventually everyone is contained in their own one person cell (to stop a rebellion?). (Something happens with an old man? or some young child that has only know life in one person cells?). The citizens are then freed (can't recall how).  I can't remember the punchline of the story.  I know it's a bit of a long shot but any help is much appreciated. 
568,"Is Jim Taggart's claim that Dagny ""never felt anything"" parallel to Philip Rearden's claim that Hank never suffered?","From the scene early on in Atlas Shrugged where Dagny Taggart told her brother Jim that she had canceled his order with Associated Steel in favor of purchasing Rearden Metal track instead:     [Dagny] had turned to go, when [Jim] spoke again - and what he said seemed bewilderingly irrelevant. ""That's all right for you, because you're lucky. Others can't do it.""   ""Do what?""   ""Other people are human. They're sensitive. They can't devote their whole life to metal and engines. You're lucky - you've never had any feelings. You've never felt anything at all.""   Philip Rearden later demanded that Hank give him a job. During the course of their discussion, he stated:     ""You haven't any feelings. You've never felt anything at all. You've never suffered!""   It was as if a sum of years hit Rearden in the face, by means of a sensation and a sight... You've never suffered, the dead stare of the eye was saying, you've never felt anything, because only to suffer as to feel - there's no such thing as joy, there's only pain and the absence of pain; only pain and the zero, when one feels nothing - I suffer, I'm twisted by suffering, I'm made of undiluted suffering, that's my purity, that's my virtue - and yours, you the untwisted one, you the uncomplaining, yours is to relieve me of my pain - cut your unsuffering body to patch up mine, cut your unfeeling soul to stop mine from feeling - and we'll achieve the ultimate ideal, the triumph over life, the zero!   The phrases are clearly parallel. Was Hank's realization basically what Jim Taggart was saying here - ""you've never felt anything at all"" meaning that only to suffer is to feel?  Also, the text says that Jim's comments ""seemed bewilderingly irrelevant"" (which seems to imply that they actually weren't irrelevant after all). How does Hank's realization here make it Jim's comments relevant? "
569,"Meaning of ""was given to her favorite, and now bore his"" in Byron's Don Juan","From Byron's Don Juan:     While this high post of honour's in abeyance,        For one or two days, reader, we request   You'll mount with our young hero the conveyance        Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best   Barouche, which had the glory to display once        The fair czarina's autocratic crest,   When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,   Was given to her favourite, and now bore his.

570,Why did the waiter send Varajou where he did?,"In Guy de Maupassant's short story ""The Wrong House"" (available on Project Gutenberg along with all of Guy de Maupassant's short stories), Quartermaster Varajou wishes to find a brothel, and asks a waiter in the local pub in the small town of Vannes:     “The girls, ah! ah!”   “Yes, the girls, where can one find any here?”   “Girls?”   “Why, yes, girls!”   The boy approached and lowering his voice, said: “You want to know where they live?”   “Why, yes, the devil!”   “You take the second street to the left and then the first to the right. It is number fifteen.”   Varajou follows these directions and ends up at      the house of the Judge of the Supreme Court.   Why did the waiter direct him to this house? It seems unlikely to have been a deliberate prank, so presumably the waiter misinterpreted Varajou's request. What did he think he meant? Or did Varajou simply take the wrong turning, going left from the cafe instead of right? "

573,"In Mansfield Park, why did Maria Bertram and Henry Crawford get together?","I just finished reading Mansfield Park, and so far after (5 books) it is my favorite. However there are some things which I may unintentionally skip over.  I understand that Maria was a selfish person who thought she herself could do no wrong. However I believe that she must have known that leaving her husband and going with Henry Crawford would be frowned upon. I don't understand why she would do this. I don't think selfish is a good enough reason since she was of high birth and proper education. Is there any other reason that I might miss in the book?  Also the last chapter gives me the impression that Henry was still in love with Fanny (I love her too) even right up to the moment when he went off with Maria. So why did he do it? He knew Maria was married. He knew Fanny's opinion of him was softened, and he still loved her. So I don't understand why he would do something like this? "

I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and   docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy   part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to   every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even   thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy   creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel,   whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss,   from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good;   misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”   The monster calls Victor his ""natural lord."" What exactly does this title mean?  "
578,When did people begin to regard Gulliver's Travels as a children's book?,"Jonathan Swift published Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of several Ships in 1726 as a satire on human nature. Wikipedia also adds,     Published seven years after Daniel Defoe's wildly successful Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability.   This is not the typical stuff that children's books are made of, but today, Gulliver's Travels is typically included in lists of children's books, especially the parts situated in Lilliput and Brobdingnag.   When exactly did people begin treating Gulliver's Travels as a children's book? The Wikipedia articles on the book itself and Jonathan Swift don't provide information about this, and a search about the book's reception history did not help either. There are a number of online articles and blogposts that point out that the back was not written as a children's book, but they don't say when the change in perception occurred. See for example Gulliver’s Travels Wasn’t Meant to Be a Children’s Book And More Things You Didn’t Know About the Literary Classic on the Smithsonian's website, and, in German, Gullivers Reisen. "
579,How many Elizabethan or Jacobean manuscripts of Shakespeare sonnets have come down to us?,"When Thomas Thorpe published Shake-speares Sonnets [sic!] in 1609, the sonnets (or at least a subset of them) had already circulated in manuscript for some time. Francis Meres already mentioned these circulating manuscripts in his Palladis Tamia, published in 1598.  Some of the sonnets had previously been published by William Jaggard in 1599 in the anthology The Passionate Pilgrim. However, of the 20 poems in this anthology, only five are considered authentically Shakespearean.  We don't know with certainty what sort of manuscript Thorpe used for the 1609 edition of the sonnets, but scholars now regard him as a reputable publisher. William Jaggard is less reputable, both because of The Passionate Pilgrim and the False Folio of 1619. His access to manuscript of authentic Shakespeare sonnets must have been limited.  Since the sonnets had circulated privately in manuscript form, it is worth asking whether any such manuscripts have survived. If yes, how many of them? And were any sonnets more popular than others?  Note: The question title intentionally reads ""manuscripts of Shakespeare sonnets"" instead of ""manuscripts of Shakespeare's sonnets"", because such manuscripts may have been incomplete. "
580,"Why was ""Notre Dame de Paris"" changed from ""Notre Dame of Paris"" to ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" when it was re-published in English?","In the foreword to my copy of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Elizabeth Massie writes this:     Victor Hugo's early novel, Notre Dame de Paris, published in 1831 and set in medieval Paris of 1482, was the work that made his reputation outside his native France. First translated into English in 1833 by William Hazlitt the Younger as Notre Dame of Paris, the novel was released only a few months later in a second translation as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and has been known to English speakers by this title ever since.   Why was this title changed? Why not keep the title more accurate to the original French title? "
581,What does this passage of 1984 mean?,"   There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.       He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up.       He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two guards.       'Room 101,' said the officer.       The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials.       He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already. With him were the guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, O'Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened. Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare, understood, forgiven.    What is the ticking instrument, and why is he swallowed up into a pair of eyes? Why is Julia and Mr Charrington with him and what is the dreadful thing that was skipped over? "
582,What was the first book that taught readers how to analyse and interpret literature?,"Books about literaty theory have a long tradition; Aristotle's Poetics dates back to the 4th century BC. Books about how to write literature also go back a long way, for example, Horace's Ars Poetica (around 19 BC). And, of course, people have been studying and commenting on literature for many centuries. However, since many questions on this site are about the analysis or interpretation of literature, it seems worth asking when people (presumably academics) started teaching others how to do this.  In the English-speaking world, I assume that this started with the establishment of literature departments at universities during the 19th century. According to E.D.H. Johnson, writing about the Department of English at Princeton (my emphasis),     Until well through the nineteenth century, English studies at Princeton, as elsewhere, were regarded as incidental to preparation for the ministry, law, or public life, and as a result instruction concentrated on grammar and composition, rhetoric, and elocution.   He continues,     Although the Rev. James W. Alexander, Professor of Belles- Lettres, delivered in 1838 what should probably be regarded as the first course of lectures in English literature, official recognition of this subject in the College catalogue had to wait until 1864 when John S. Hart was listed as ``Lecturer on English Literature.''   According to Paul Watt (""Criticism in late nineteenth-century England: Towards the regulation and reform of a profession in crisis""), writers in 19th-century England found that the quality of criticism had declined significantly, so      By the 1880s, however, concrete plans were hatched by English newspaper editors, intellectuals and critics—as well as assertive newspaper readers—to lift the standard of criticism in England. The highest priorities were the establishment of training programs for aspiring critics and the formulation of principles and methods to guide them.   This seems to imply that such ""principles and methods"" did not exist in the 1880s, even though some literature departments had been established by that time. For example, in Scotland:     The Chair of English Language and Literature at Glasgow University was established by the Universities Commission of 1858, its first Professor being John Nichol (1862-1889), making it one of the oldest Chairs in English Literature in Britain. Although English Literature had been taught in the University in one form or another for a century already by such well-known figures as Adam Smith , the first holders of the Chair of English Language and Literature had little precedents to follow, and none had ever attended a class in English or held a degree in the subject. These men determined the content and direction of the English class. Notable early occupants of the post included Andrew Cecil Bradley (1889-1900) and Walter Raleigh (1900-1904).   (A. C. Bradley is still remembered for his influential work Shakespearean Tragedy, published in 1904 and reprinted many times.)  But none of the above sources, nor the Wikipedia article Literary criticism make mention of books that teach readers how to analyse and interpret literature. So what was the first such book? Note that I am not interested in books that explain literary theory, but books like Terry Eagleton's How to Read Literature and How to Read a Poem. "
583,"Meaning of ""How can one admire a girl...so young she doesn't know how to bite her fingers""","In a book of short stories by Maasthi Venkatesa Iyengar, translated from Kannada to English, there is a story set in colonial India in which two male characters are discussing marriage. One character asks a second character why he wouldn't marry a young girl, as was the custom at that time.     ""I need to find the right girl. I know an officer who got married only six months ago. He is about thirty and his wife is twenty-five, I am told. They will be able to talk lovingly to each other. Let's say I married a very young girl. She may take my words spoken in love as words spoken in anger....If one gets married, it should be to a girl who is mature. Otherwise, one should remain a bachelor. That's why I am not marrying now.""      ""Is there any other reason?""      ""A man should marry a girl he admires. What we have now are arranged marriages. How can one admire a girl with milk stains on one side of her face and wetness on the other, or so young that she doesn't even know how to bite her fingers?""   I need help understanding the bolded text, or why biting (or not biting) one's fingers is an indicator of extreme youth or immaturity.  I have found the same question on other Q&amp;A sites but I don't understand the answers. "
584,"Why are pronouns used in this way in Nalo Hopkinson's ""Shift""?","I just read the short story ""Shift"" by Nalo Hopkinson, which is freely available online. It's a modern, Caribbean-themed story inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest.  One thing which confused me on the first reading was the use of pronouns. The story starts off written in the second person:     “Did you sleep well?” she asks, and you make sure that your face is fixed into a dreamy smile as you open your eyes into the morning after.   But then, not long after this, there are some paragraphs written in the first person:     She tell me say I must call her Scylla, or Charybdis.   I didn't notice this pronoun switch at first, and when I did, I foolishly assumed it was an inconsistency in the writing. Turns out Nalo Hopkinson is a much better writer than that: for the paragraphs in second person, ""you"" refers to Caliban, while Ariel is ""she""; for those in first person, ""I"" refers to Ariel, while Caliban is ""he"", and ""you"" is used to address the readers.  My question is: why switch pronouns in this way? It's confusing on a first read - you only slowly realise that there's more than one viewpoint character - although it's all perfectly consistent once you figure out the pronoun scheme and treat the two types of paragraph separately. What does this stylistic choice add to the story? "
585,"What does ""mannered whimsy"" mean?","What does ""mannered whimsy"" mean in the following passage taken from Eucharist and the Poetic Imagination in Early Modern England by Sophie Read?     Marvell does, it is true, come off better from this particular   comparison: Crashaw's little bit of mannered whimsy cannot compete   with the liquid grace of Marvell's simile, even if one acknowledges   that this crystallisation (or, perhaps more accurately here, this   dissolution—Ricks's choice of term recalls once more the bon-bons of   fond critical memory) is a deliberate rhetorical ploy.   (More context available via Google Books.) "
586,Why is the colour of Caliban's girls important?,"I recently read Nalo Hopkinson's short story ""Shift"", which is freely available online. The central character is a reimagining of Shakespeare's Caliban, a Caribbean black man who finds white women to turn him into whatever they want him to be. For some reason, it seems only white women (""golden girls"", as he calls them) will do:      The kisses of golden girls are chancy things. Once, after the touch of other pale lips, you looked into the eyes of a golden girl, one Miranda, and saw yourself reflected back in her moist, breathless stare.     You pass another beautiful golden girl, luxuriantly blonde. She glances at you, casts her eyes down demurely, where they just happen to rest at your crotch. You feel her burgeoning gaze there, your helpless response. Quickly you lean and kiss the shoulder of the woman you’re with. The other one’s look turns to resentful longing. You hurry on.     There’s a young black woman sitting on a bench, her hair tight peppercorns against her scalp. Her feet are crossed beneath her. She’s alone, reading a book. She’s pretty, but she looks too much like your sister. Too brown to ever be a golden girl. She looks up as you go by, distracted from her reading by the chattering of the woman beside you. She looks at you. Smiles. Nods a greeting. Burning up with guilt, you make your face stone. You move on.    The phrase ""golden girl"" is repeated multiple times in the story, referring to Caliban's love interests or potential love interests. He dismisses the young black woman for being ""[t]oo brown"".  Why is Caliban only interested in white women? How does this aspect of the story tie in to the underlying racial tensions which are hinted at throughout? "
587,"What does ""advertisements in mother-of-pearl letters upon the glass-covered back"" mean here?","I would like to know what ""advertisements in mother-of-pearl letters upon the glass-covered back"" means in the following sentences:     She glanced through the fly-specked windows of the most pretentious   building in sight, the one place which welcomed strangers and   determined their opinion of the charm and luxury of Gopher Prairie—the   Minniemashie House. It was a tall lean shabby structure, three stories   of yellow-streaked wood, the corners covered with sanded pine slabs   purporting to symbolize stone. In the hotel office she could see a   stretch of bare unclean floor, a line of rickety chairs with brass   cuspidors between, a writing-desk with advertisements in   mother-of-pearl letters upon the glass-covered back. The dining-room   beyond was a jungle of stained table-cloths and catsup bottles.    Sinclair Lewis, Main Street, Chapter 4   Carol (a librarian at St. Paul Library) and Kennicott (a doctor at a small town called Gopher Prairie), got married and came to their house in Gopher Prairie, Kennicott's hometown, after their honeymoon trip. Even before they unpacked their belongings, Kennicott excused himself for an hour to see how the things were going at his office, leaving Carol alone. Lonely, Carol went outside for a walk, and looked around the buildings in the town. Then she spotted a hotel named Minniemashie House and looked inside.  In this part, I could not imagine how advertisements looked like. Were the advertisements made of real mother-of-pearl? Or were they just written on the glass so that the letters looked like mother-of-pearl? I just could not imagine this part.  I would very much appreciate your help. :) "
588,"What does ""snow in the crevices of a boggy bank"" mean here?","I would like to know what ""snow in the crevices of a boggy bank"" means in the following sentences:     Her cheek near his sleeve, she studied a dozen village pictures. They   were streaky; she saw only trees, shrubbery, a porch indistinct in   leafy shadows. But she exclaimed over the lakes: dark water reflecting   wooded bluffs, a flight of ducks, a fisherman in shirt sleeves and a   wide straw hat, holding up a string of croppies. One winter picture of   the edge of Plover Lake had the air of an etching: lustrous slide of   ice, snow in the crevices of a boggy bank, the mound of a muskrat   house, reeds in thin black lines, arches of frosty grasses.    Sinclair Lewis, Main Street, Chapter 2   Carol, a librarian at St. Paul Library, and Kennicott, a doctor in a small town called Gopher Prairie, went tramping together. After a walk, sitting on a bank, Kenicott persistently persuaded her to marry him and settle down in Gopher Prairie, saying that it was the nicest town in the world. He even brought some pictures of the town to show her.  In this part, I could not understand what were the ""crevices"" of a ""boggy bank."" Does ""boggy"" mean that the bank resembled a bog? And how can there be crevices in the bank...?   I would very much appreciate your help. :) "
589,What do the locations mentioned in First Love mean?,"Gwendoline Riley's novel First Love (2017) is about the relationship of the female narrator, Neve, with Edwyn, and how the type of relationships she had with her mother and (especially) her abusive father play a role in it. Neve and Edwyn live in Edwyn's flat near West Brompton station in London. Edwyn grew up in Isleworth in west London. Neve mentions that ""[her] parents' old flat was in Chiswick"", also in West London. (Chiswick apparently has had some interesting residents, such as Alexander Pope, W. B. Yeats, Ugo Foscolo, Camille Pissarro, E. M. Forster and currently Peter Brook.)   From Edwyn's point of view, Neve comes from ""the North"": she grew up in Liverpool (Gwendoline Riley was born there) and studied in Manchester (like Riley); she also lived in Glasgow for a while. At the start of the novel, Neve's mother lives in Garston (Liverpool). In the chapter about her father's funeral, she mentions relatives living in Aigburth and Speke (both in Liverpool).   Names of suburbs, areas and streets are typically mentioned without specifying in which city they are, although that normally becomes clear when you read on. What is not clear, especially to someone from outside the UK, is whether these place names carry any special connotations, e.g. are they upmarket or (more likely?) working-class suburbs? Have they been neglected or are living conditions improving? Or am I completely barking up the wrong tree by looking for this type of information and associations?  The book does not contain any dates (as far as I can remember), but I assume the ""present"" is roughly 2017, when the book was published, and since the main character is in her mid-thirties (barely younger than the author herself), she must have grown up in Liverpool between 1980 and the late 1990s. The only clearly datable reference can be found in a passage where Neve thinks back to a past relationship and says that, at that time, she had bought tickets for the documentary Of Time and the City by Terrence Davies, which was released in 2008.  There are a number of reviews of First Love and relevant interviews, but they don't give me the information I'm looking for:   Gwendoline Riley interview: First Love, The Skinny, 08.03.2017.

590,"What does ""nuh"" mean here in ""Shift"" by Nalo Hopkinson?","In reading ""Shift"" by Nalo Hopkinson, I came across this paragraph:     In my mother and father, salt meet with sweet. Milk meet with chocolate. No one could touch her while he was alive and ruler of his lands, but the minute him dead, her family and his get together and exile her to that little island to starve to death. Send her away with two sweet-and-sour, milk chocolate pickney; me in her belly and Caliban at her breast. Is nuh that turn her bitter? When you confine the sea, it don’t stagnate? You put milk to stand, and it nuh curdle?   (emphasis added)   I'm unsure what the ""nuh"" means in the two bolded sentences. It sounds rather like ""no"", but it's obviously not just a pronunciation difference; replacing ""nuh"" with ""no"" doesn't really make sense, especially in the first instance.  What does ""nuh"" mean in this context? "
591,"Why, at the begining of the tale Jealous Twins, does the storyteller frame the story?","The Verba Africana website is a fantastic website that publishes recordings, transcriptions, and analysis of African oral literature.  One of the stories published on the site is called Jealous Twins; it is an Ewe tale.   One of the interesting things about the story is that it follows a formula. The storyteller begins by framing the story as something not to be taken seriously:     ye ŋutinya yia gblɔ ge       I am going to tell this story   ne ɖeviwo abe fefe fefe ene       to children as a play   The storyteller then does a call and response with the audience: she says ""Listen to a story"" and the audience responds with ""Let the story come.""  Then, the characters are introduced with ""The story moves and lands on a man and the wife,"" and finally the narrative begins.  Some of the phrases used to frame this story (e.g. ""the story moves and lands on [characters]"") are used in another Ewe tale recorded on the site: Headless Crabs.  Why are these stories framed in this particular way? What effect does this framing have on the story? Why is this framing a convention of Ewe oral literature? "

What is meant here by ""halter""? Is an obscure or antiquated meaning of that word being used here? If so, what is meant by it? Or is it a typo, and it should be ""weather"" instead of ""halter?  The context might suggest that, because Twain had just lamented the rain, the thunder, and the lightning, so ""weather"" would make sense here; but ""halter"" appears in at least two places where this sketch has been recorded: In the venerable gutenberg rendition of it here, and in another online source here.

594,Is there any textual evidence that this death in Deathly Hallows symbolized the end of childhood?,"In the beginning of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, we see that Hedwig is killed by the Avada Kedavra curse.     ""No - HEDWIG!""   The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the bottom of the cage.   ""No - NO!""   Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, chapter 4   J. K. Rowling has stated that this symbolizes the death of childhood. However, is this supported by anything in the books? Is there anything to assume that this is representative of the death of childhood, and not just a random death? "
595,Was Wolf Hall originally written in the first person?,"When reading Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall, I noticed that the protagonist, Thomas Cromwell, is referred to as often as possible simply as ""he""/""him"" rather than by his name. This includes in contexts where ""he"" would more naturally be read as referring to someone else: many times when reading such sentences, I would 'stumble', misreading who the pronoun was referring to, and have to go back and reread the sentence with the correct interpretation. For example:      He sees three elderly Lowlanders struggling with their bundles and moves to help them. The packages are soft and bulky, samples of woolen cloth. A port officer gives them trouble about their documents, shouting into their faces. He lounges behind the clerk, pretending to be a Lowland oaf, and tells the merchants by holding up his fingers what he thinks a fair bribe. “Please,” says one of them, in effortful English to the clerk, “will you take care of these English coins for me? I find them surplus.” Suddenly the clerk is all smiles. The Lowlanders are all smiles; they would have paid much more. When they board they say, “The boy is with us.”      -- Chapter 1   At first glance, I read this as the port officer lounging behind the clerk, or maybe someone else lounging ... I was completely confused about who was doing what. Only when I reached the end of the paragraph, ""The boy is with us"", did I realise that Tom must have helped the Lowlanders in some way, and then I went back and worked out that it was him lounging behind the clerk/port officer and signalling to the merchants. There were many other (probably better) examples throughout the book, but I've given my copy away to charity and Chapter 1 is the only excerpt I can find on the internet.   (This was part of what made me condemn Wolf Hall, despite its Man Booker Prize, as simply a poorly written book: if the reader keeps stumbling and having to go back and reread sentences because their intended meaning is different from their most natural meaning, that's usually a hallmark of bad writing.)  It struck me that this excessive use of pronouns would have made much more sense if the book was written with first-person narration. If Cromwell had been a first-person protagonist, there would never have been any confusion about whether the pronoun referred to him or someone else - it would have been ""I""/""me"" and not ""he""/""him"". Thus, I came to the conclusion that the book was originally written in the first person and then hastily and somewhat shoddily edited into third-person narration, changing too many of the ""I""s into ""he""s instead of ""Cromwell""s.  Is there any more evidence to support this conclusion? Acceptable evidence might be either more textual clues suggesting that early drafts of the book were written in the first person, or possibly a statement from the author (if the author says it wasn't originally first-person narration, I'd take that with a pinch of salt, but if she says it was, I'd be inclined to believe her). "
596,What does Tiriel's blindness symbolize?,"In Tiriel, it's mentioned several times that Tiriel is blind, first in Chapter I, line 27:     Look at my eyes, blind as the orbless skull among the stones!   And later again in Chapter II, lines 61-65:     Soon as the blind wanderer enter’d the pleasant gardens of Har,   They ran weeping, like frighted infants, for refuge in Mnetha’s arms.   The blind man felt his way, and cried: ‘Peace to these open doors!   Let no one fear, for poor blind Tiriel hurts none but himself.   Tell me, O friends, where am I now, and in what pleasant place?’   As well as several more times afterward.   My immediate thought when I first read Chapter I was that it symbolized his lack of empathy (i.e. metaphorical blindness to the feelings of others), which led his sons to revolt and throw him out, but he does seem genuinely sad that his wife, Myratana, has died. Also, the arc of the story didn't seem to quite fit this reading. His lack of empathy doesn't seem to ever come back to bite him in a straightforward way: he gets exactly what he wanted, killing all his children with his curse; his brothers Ijim and Zazel remain in exile where he put them; and he dies as he wanted, cursing his own father, Har, for creating one set of laws meant to apply to everyone. Aside from the rebellion of his sons, everything pretty much seems to go his way.  What does the blindness signify? "
597,"In Neil Gaiman's ""The Sandman"", what do the Three Sisters represent?","The Three Sisters - the Hecatae, the Fates, the Kindly Ones - are ubiquitous in Neil Gaiman's The Sandman (and in other works). They appear in the first volume to give Morpheus three answers:    and then appear in almost every volume, in one aspect or another, until finally they appear as the Kindly Ones and       bring ruin to the Dreaming and force Morpheus to give up his existence.   Morpheus describes them as obeying the oldest rules, in the same way he does. The Three-in-One appear to be a fundamental force in the Universe.  And then there's this panel after the events described above - to me, it appeared as Neil Gaiman's monologue, reflecting on the plot of The Sandman.    It is never explained what exactly they are, which brings me to the question - what do the three sisters symbolise? The inevitability of fate? Some sort of higher power? Determinism? Taking the responsibility for own actions? "
598,What is the origin of this contradictory poem?,"Does anyone know where this poem originates from:     One fine morning in the middle of the night,      Two dead men got up to fight,      Back to back they faced each other,      Drew their swords and shot one another.   I suspect it is from the Victorian era but would be interested to know if it has any definite origins?  Bonus: Are there more of this type of poem and is there a name for this genre of poem? "
599,Who was the old man in Platonia?,"In The Shadow Dragons, the party that sets off from The Flying Dragon via trump gets stuck in an ""endless expanse of whiteness"":     It was an endless expanse of whiteness. There was no distance, no perspective. Just infinite space. Except for the old man.   The old man is dismissive of the group, until he sees Rose:     The old man didn't reply, but merely regarded them with disdain—until his eyes fell on Rose.          To the companions' great surprise, his mouth dropped open in shock, and his eyes, cold a moment before, suddenly filled with tears.        ""Rose,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. ""How can you be...?   He appears to have a watch similar to Alvin Ranson (and his fellow time travelers):     [...] he opened the pocket watch, which bore no dragon on the cover, and was fesooned with several more dials and buttons than John's own watch.   He then describes the area they are in as ""Platonia"", and mentions something called the ""Quorum"":     ""A new zero point, and here, in Platonia!  This must be brought before the Quorum.""   Rose doesn't recognize him, and when questioned about how to leave (to get to the Keep of Time), he abruptly tells them to try the trump again, and walks away.  However, before they leave, he tells Rose:     ""And Rose,"" he added, ""try to think well of me in the future—and in the past.""     Who is he? All we know is that he's an old man, lives (or at least exists) in a place called Platonia, and is either a member or acquaintance of a group called the Quorum. Who is he, or who does he represent? "
600,"What of the knight of the Empty Helmet, and how does he comport himself at Castle Rhack?","The epilogue of Suldrun's Garden, the first book of Jack Vance's Lyonesse series, is a sort of literary equivalent of a ""next time"" teaser in a TV series. More than summarising the events so far and describing the current state of affairs, it asks rhetorical questions about what will happen next. Many of these questions act as foreshadowing for significant events in later books:      Tamurello, fearing Murgen, refers Casmir to the wizard Shan Farway. In their plotting they use the name ""Joald"" and both fall silent.   Foreshadows the Joald cataclysm at the end of book 3.    What of Glyneth, who loves Watershade and Miraldra, but yearns for her vagabond life with Dr. Fidelius? Who will woo and who will win her?   Foreshadows Glyneth's otherworldly adventure at the end of book 2.    Aillas is King of South Ulfland and now he must reckon with the Ska, who wage war against the world. When he thinks of the Ska he thinks of Tatzel, who lives at Castle Sank. He knows a secret way into the fortress Poelitetz: how will this knowledge serve him?   Foreshadows both the Tatzel escapade in book 2 and part of the war at the end of book 3.    Who nets the turbot who swallowed the green pearl? Who proudly wears the pearl in her locket and is impelled to curious excesses of conduct?   Foreshadows the first chunk of book 2, about the green pearl.    And what of the knight of the Empty Helmet, and how does he comport himself at Castle Rhack?   Wait, what the heck is this all about?   As far as I remember, having read all three books several times, neither the ""knight of the Empty Helmet"" nor ""Castle Rhack"" is ever mentioned anywhere else in the trilogy. But it seems beyond weird to introduce a character only for the sake of asking a teaser question about him which is never resolved or even mentioned before or since. Is this the most blatant violation of Chekhov's Gun I've ever seen, or is there some other mention of or reference to this person that I've missed?  In short: I give up. What of the knight of the Empty Helmet, and how does he comport himself at Castle Rhack? "
601,What does Dream's ruby represent?,"In Volume One of The Sandman (Preludes and Nocturnes), Dream is held captive for 70 years. After escaping and taking vengeance on his (only surviving) captor, he returns home, to the Dreamworld. Finding it in disarray, he realizes that he needs to recover his ""tools,"" his totems of power, so that he can make things right again. He mentions that he has ""placed too much of [himself] in the tools,"" implying that his tools (ruby, pouch of sand, and and helm) contain parts of his power and, perhaps, his being.        The Sandman #2 ""Imperfect Hosts"" page 16  He decides to quest for his lost tools, spending most of the volume in that pursuit.  After recovering his pouch and helm, Dream attempts to recover his ruby from a Justice League storage house (#5 ""Passengers""). However, he is knocked out when he touches it, because John Dee modified it during his years of using it. While Dream is out, Dee takes the ruby, and wreaks global havoc with it for one day (#6 ""24 Hours"").  When that day is over, Dream asks Dee to return the ruby to him so he can attempt to fix all the things that Dee has broken. Dee, however, refuses, and threatens to kill Dream with the ruby.        The Sandman #7 ""Sound and Fury"" page 5  During that conversation, Dream says a little more about his relationship with the gem:        The Sandman #7 ""Sound and Fury"" page 4  Dream takes the battle to the Dreaming, where Dee appears to destroy Dream with the ruby; actually, he destroyed the ruby and transferred the power inside it back to Dream.        The Sandman #7 ""Sound and Fury"" page 20  What does the ruby represent? There's a lot going on around this ruby: it is an object that was created by an anthropomorphic personification of dreams, invested with his power and part of his being, that was stolen from him, rendered unusable to him, used to wreak global chaos, destroyed in an attempt to kill its creator, and ultimately returned its power to Dream.  I am not very well-versed in mythology, but I am fascinated by the ruby and Dream's relationship with it. I would appreciate answers that involve mythology (as Dream has connections to mythology), but answers with other sources are also acceptable. Like I said, there's a lot going on with this gem, but answers don't need to explain all of it (good answers, like scientific theories, will explain as many facts as possible; the more things explained the better). "
602,What's the significance of the witches' name change in Sandman?,"As mentioned in another question, the three witches are very significant in The Sandman. While that other question asks for their significance in general, I have a much more specific question to ask.  In issue #2 (""Imperfect Hosts""), Dream returns to his home after escaping captivity on Earth. Finding things greatly changed from how he left them, he realizes that he must recover his tools and fix things. He summons the Hecateae, and calls one of them by name. This kicks off a discussion about how the witches prefer to be called.           Dream: ""Lady Atropos, you have found me out. I DO want   something.""        Crone: ""Atropos? No. Not now. You might as well call me the   Morrigan!""       Allmother: ""She's right, my ducks. Might as well call us   Tisiphone, Alecto, and Magaera -- and that takes us back, eh?""        Maiden: ""Might as well call us Diana, Mary, Florence and   Candy. Ha ha! Uh, sorry.""        Dream: ""For me, you will always be the three graces, ladies.""        Voice off-panel 1: ""Flatterer!""        Voice off-panel 2: ""Ooh, he's the clever one!""        Dream: ""So what should I call you?""        Maiden: ""I'm Cynthia.""        Crone: ""She's Mildred. I'm Mordred. Stupid name. I   ought to be Morgaine.""      Allmother: ""It wasn't my fault. I just got them confused,   was all!""   The Sandman #2 ""Imperfect Hosts,"" page 19  (Note: another version of this panel, provided by Gallifreyan, records only three names, leaving out Candy)  When Dream finally asks them for help, he addresses them by other names:           Dream (to the young witch): ""MAIDEN, there was a POUCH of SAND. It was   stolen from me.""        Dream (to the kindly older witch): ""I SEE. Then your question, ALL   MOTHER. My HELM -- what happened to it?""        Dream (to the oldest witch): ""CRONE. A final question, for you. My STONE,   my DREAMSTONE, my RUBY MOONSTONE. Who has THAT now?""   The Sandman #2 ""Imperfect Hosts,"" page 21  So I have, essentially, two questions about this exchange.  1. What is the significance of the name change?    As I understood it, Dream called them by names that he was likely using for millennia. Did they change names because of the general weirdness that happened during Dream's 70 year absence? I infer from the Crone's statement (""Atropos? No. Not now."") that the names were changed from what they were before (""not now"" as in ""not anymore"").  Does this name change have a deeper meaning?  2. What do the different names represent?  I am not very well versed in mythology; these names don't mean much to me. I was able to find some things during my preliminary research for this question:   I found that Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone are the names of the Erinyes. (Found that by searching Wikipedia for ""three witches comics,"" and finding a mention of the Erinyes on a page about a volume of The Sandman that I haven't yet read) I found that the Morrigan is a figure from Irish mythology, a ""phantom queen"" who represents fate. The most relevant result that I found by searching the web for the ""Diana, Mary, Florence and Candy"" was this page, which is very light on the background for these names. I'm also confused about how the Maiden gave four names for three persons.   In summary: Why did the three change their names now, and what do those different names mean? "
603,"In ""The Accidental"", was it really Amber who did this?","Warning: contains unmarked spoilers.  Ali Smith's The Accidental is about the Smart family (Eve, Michael, Magnus, and Astrid) and a woman, Amber, who seemingly appears out of nowhere at their holiday home and has a dramatic effect on each of their lives. The book is split into twelve main parts: a ""beginning"", ""middle"", and ""end"" for each of Astrid, Magnus, Michael, and Eve respectively.  After Amber leaves at the end of the ""middle"" section, the Smarts return to their real home to find it bare: thieves have completely ransacked the place. The implication is that Amber was to blame:     Months later he remembered that she knew   where the house keys were kept, after this game–   in the bedside cabinet. Months later, too,   he thought about the wanting her with shame   and not a little wryness, like a clue   right under his own nose, a clue that came   and went and told him exactly what he needed,   plain as abc, and he’d refused to read it.      -- middle, Michael        The real world was elsewhere, like she was.      Imagine her, systematically emptying things room by room, shifting them through the front door and across the pavement into a van in the dead of night. She was in league with someone, a man, surely. She had to be. She'd need someone to help move the heavier things; you'd need someone to help you clean up afterwards.      -- middle, Michael   But is there really enough evidence to say that Amber robbed them after she left, or could it have been a coincidence? Or is the point that it's supposed to be ambiguous and we can never know? Given the significance of all the character interactions in the book, I'm sure that whatever the answer to this question is, it will tie in metaphorically to the relationships that form the core of the story.  This is a significant question to ask, because the answer to it may change our view of Amber. Was she merely a thief taking advantage of the family, and her lasting influence on their lives an accident, or was she somehow sent by Providence, an odd stranger, as Eve is to the other family at the very end?  Was Amber involved in the ransacking of the Smarts' home or not? "
604,What is the plot significance of the discovery of Dunstan and the money?,"Warning: major spoilers follow for the plot of Silas Marner.  In George Eliot (Marian Evans)'s novel Silas Marner, the eponymous weaver's life goes through several significant stages:   his years-long period of living alone and hoarding gold; the miserable period immediately after his gold is stolen; his time of happiness after Eppie comes into his life.   The two most major life-changing events which happen to him during his time in Raveloe are of course the theft of his gold and the arrival of Eppie. Each of these has a huge effect not only on his way of living but even on his personality.  Towards the end of the novel, he gets some closure on the first of these events, when his gold is returned to him and the thief identified. But wouldn't his life would have gone on in pretty much the same way if this had never happened? Or is the recovery of the money and Dunstan's body somehow more momentous than just to make Silas realise how little the gold matters to him now?  How does the revelation in chapter 18 make the story different from what it would have been if the theft had remained a mystery? "
605,Did the event in Jim's foreword actually happen?,"In Jim Butcher's foreword in the short story collection Shadowed Souls, he discusses an event in which a pack of coyotes surrounds his home in an attempt to prey on his pet dog.  This story seems a bit farfetched to be real, and I wouldn't put it past Jim to make up such a story just to have a little bit of umph for a book.  So, has Jim Butcher expressed whether this story about the coyotes is real, made up, or somewhere in between?  If it is made up, does he explain WHY he made it up? "
606,Was the sealed letter ordering Hamlet's death a Biblical reference?,"Is the sealed letter that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern carry that orders Hamlet's execution a deliberate reference to the Biblical King David having Uriah the Hittite carry a letter to Joab ordering his death?     In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah. And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.” So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men. Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And some of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also. (2 Samuel 11:14-18, NIV)   If so, how likely would it have been that Shakespeare's original audience would've understood the reference? "

608,Does GRRM have a habit of making meta statements?,"One passage from A Dance with Dragons has got me wondering how GRRM leaves clues for his readers.      He tried to count the pennies nailed to the old oak, but there were too many of them and he kept losing count. What’s that all about? The Blackwood boy would tell him if he asked, but that would spoil the mystery. - Chapter 48, Jamie I   I myself have claimed that it is but a mere wish tree. However, as I went down the rabbit hole, it seems there is a theory that this is George's way of telling his readers not to ""spoil the mystery"".   Now, there is a fair bit of unexplained mysteries and magic going on in A Song of Ice and Fire, but in my experience we are left to draw our own on conclusion, or receive some form of statement from Martin in an interview. At times he will even affirm that we should be patient and that not all the mysteries will be solved.   However, these statements are coming from an -out-of-universe perspective. My question is, does Martin make a habit of making these kind of meta-statements in-universe? "
609,Where did Saruman know Frodo from?,"Near the end of The Return of the King, the last Volume of the Lord of the Rings, the hobbits return to the Shire.  There, they meet Saruman and his follower Grima (Wormtongue).  When Saruman attempted to slay Frodo, failing because of the Mithril coat, Frodo replies,     'No, Sam!' said Frodo. 'Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt   me. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was   great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands   against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would still spare   him, in the hope that he may find it.'   My question, however, relates particularly to Saruman's reply to these words:     Saruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred. 'You have grown, Halfling,' he said. 'Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel.  You have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and now I must go hence in bitterness, in debt to your mercy. [...]'   What period in time is he referring to when he says that Frodo has grown?  To my knowledge, the only time he has met Frodo up to this juncture is when they crossed him on the way to Rivendell from Gondor after the burial of Theoden.  Did Saruman know Frodo from the Orthanc stone?  Since when does Saruman feel that Frodo has grown wise and cruel? "
610,What parallels can be drawn between Don Reba and Beria?,"From the afterword of Hard to be a God:     On the advice of I. A. Efremov, we renamed the Minister of the Defense of the Crown Don Reba (he had previously been Don Rebia—an overly simple anagram, in the opinion of Ivan Antonovich.)      -- 2015 translation   While I enjoy anagram puzzles, I wasn't even going to attempt one in not only a foreign language but a less familiar alphabet, so I remained puzzled about what anagram this was referring to, until @Gilles pointed out in chat that of course Rebia (Ре́бия) would have been an anagram of Beria (Бе́рия), the most famous and long-standing chief of the Soviet secret police. The reference is clear: Don Reba is also a chief of secret police, also ruthlessly responsible for the detection and punishment of thousands of so-called traitors.  Other than the name, what similarities can be drawn between the character of Don Reb(i)a and the real-world figure of Beria? I'm interested to see how far the comparison goes, and how clear it is from the text of the novel, without using anagram games, that Don Reba was based on Beria. "
611,"How can ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" be read as a commentary on Scotland?","In the Wikipedia page for Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, one of the mentioned interpretations of the story is as a symbolic representation of Scottish nationalism vs union with England. This seems to stand out among other more natural interpretations involving human nature and Victorian social commentary. Checking the sources of that section, I found this Guardian article, which says:     In this view, the moral focus of the story is the Scottish character, burdened by dual nationality (Scottish and British), caught between two tongues (Scots and English), its instinctive spontaneity repressed by a Calvinistic church - the very church that once came between Stevenson and his father, and caused a split in the family. Edinburgh is a city starkly divided into two: the foggy old town up on the hill, once the site of colourful crimes such as bodysnatching and of public hangings in the Grassmarket; and the splendid New Town to the north, on the other side of the then newly laid railway tracks. In Glasgow, where I grew up, the common perception of Edinburgh was of a cloudy inner life (old town) shielded by a genteel exterior (New Town). It was - how could you avoid saying so? - a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of place.   This seems fairly weak evidence in itself. Many cities have a dual nature such as ""old city"" vs ""new city"", not only Edinburgh. But of course a news article isn't the place to look for detailed literary analysis. So I pose the question here:  How can Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde be read as a representation of Scottishness? Can this reading of the story be well supported from the text, and does it have a strong history in the world of Stevenson criticism? "
612,"What's the evidence for ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" being secretly set in Edinburgh?","Stevenson's famous novel Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is set in London, but some critics have claimed that it would seem to fit better in Stevenson's native Edinburgh, almost as if he wrote a story set in Edinburgh and then just changed the names to London ones. For example, as quoted in this answer:     I have often wondered why the Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was set in London instead of Edinburgh. Utterson is a very Scottish sort of lawyer; Lanyon is a very Scottish sort of doctor; and the metaphysical speculation that allures Dr. Jekyll to his doom is decidedly more Scottish than English. Furthermore, the tale might most appropriately be conceived as happening among the gloomy doorways and mysterious wynds that undermine the tall, decaying lands which darkly overhang the High Street of Edinburgh. Possibly Louis may have felt that Mr. Hyde could lose himself more easily among the shifting crowds of a vaster and less centred city. It is more difficult to hunt a villain down in London than in Edinburgh.      -- Clayton Hamilton, On the Trail of Stevenson (1915), New York: Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.; p. 61    This quote, for example, says that the story seems like one set in Scotland, but doesn't really provide any edivence for its claims. (How are Utterson and Lanyon ""very Scottish"", or the metaphysical speculation? Why is it more ""appropriate"" to imagine it in Edinburgh than London?)  What evidence in the story supports an Edinburgh setting as more apt than a London one? "
613,Romance Novel about Paint Company CEO,"I read part of a book a number of years (8?) back.  It was a romance novel about the CEO of a paint company who marries a Russian (?) Chemist because of passport stuff.  Kinda like a reverse of The Proposal.  It may have been set in Seattle.    The book was a paperback in Novella length, written in English.  The book was probably relatively new at the time. "
614,"How is Kimberly Clark a ghost in Janssen's ""A Recurring Dream""?","In the short story ""A Recurring Dream"" (from Unusual Stories from Many Lands by Arlo T. Janssen), a character called Kimberly Clark is accused of being a ghost by an old man.     The man opens the door a little and looks at her. ""What do you want here?"" he asks. ""Why don't you go away?""   Kim doesn't know what to say. But she does want to talk to him.   ""I—I see—I see that this house is for sale,"" she stammers.   ""Yes it is. But I'm sure you don't want to buy it!""   ""Why do you say that?""   ""Because—uh—because a ghost hunts this house.""   ""A ghost haunts this pretty little house?""   ""Yes, it comes almost every night now.""   Kim tries hard to think of something to say. ""Do—uh—do you know who the ghost is?"" she stammers.   ""Yes, I do now.""   ""Who is it?""   In a loud whisper he exclaims, ""It's you!"" Then he closes the door.   I didn't understand why he calls her a ghost or why his house is on sale. "
615,"Does Joyce, in Finnegans Wake or Ulysses, link the sound form ""hoe"" to ""whore""?","Does Joyce, in Finnegans Wake or Ulysses, link the sound form ""hoe"" to ""whore"", as in the current day ""ho""?  For example, is it probable that Joyce intended the (additional) modern day pun in the following line [Finnegans Wake p.g. 5.9]?       Hootch is for husbandman handling his hoe.    In Ulysses standalone ""ho"" appears 29 times, of which 24 occur in Circes, but all appear to be standard usages. ""hoe"" appears but once. This excludes portmanteau usages such as ""hother’s"".  The prevalence of ""ho"" in Circes (a chapter of whores) suggests Joyce may have been onto this association. Perhaps for censorship reason? Does any Ulysses buff know more about this? Here are a few example.     MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I’ll   write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to   raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a   signed and stamped receipt.      BOYLAN: (Clasps himself.) Here, I can’t hold this little lot much   longer. (He strides off on stiff cavalry legs.)      BELLA: (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.   and     THE CROPPY BOY: Horhot ho hray hor hother’s hest.   and my favourite, if the pun holds,     (Private Carr and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics   bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond   cropped polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close   to the redcoats.)      PRIVATE COMPTON: (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.      PRIVATE CARR: (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!   Since this sound form is so prevalent in Finnegans Wake it would be important to know if Joyce is using this association or not.  I have searched Google Books and can find no contemporaneous usage (the 1930s or before), so suspect perhaps not. I have also search some of James's love letters to Nora, and while ""whore"" indeed appears, ""ho/hoe"" does not. I could not find it in Shakespeare either.   Has anyone commented on this before in the literature? Does such a usage appear in any of Joyce's earlier works? Do any such usages appear anywhere before the 1930s?  Is this the sound form for whore in any other language?   Note the the sound form ""hoer"" from the Dutch is different to ""hoe"". Finnegans Wake is riddled with foreign words, especially (but not inclusively) from the Germanic, Scandinavian, Greek and Latin languages, so all such variants of ""whore"" appear in the text. All those close to ""whore"" end in an ""r"" of some sort, while ""ho/hoe"" does not.   I have found an example [p.g. 20.35] in Finnegans Wake that suggests he was very close to making the leap, where ann is the ""whore"" river-wife [think Molly] of the aforementioned husband manhandling his hoe.     Flou inn, flow ann. Hohore!   Research reveals to ""ho"" gained popularity in the 60s, which is 30 years too late.   Demonstrating that Joyce was onto ""ho""-""whore"" in the Circe chapter of Ulysses, would, of course, completely answer this question, and I would absolutely accept such an answer without it have any discussion of Finnegans Wake.       I have accepted Laurel's answer, thereby ensuring full bounty award, since (1) that answer is as correct as we know at this date, and (2) I required a line drawn in the sand. I have opened (and cross-referenced) a related question Where in Ireland, if anywhere, at the time of James Joyce, would “hoe” and “whore” sound similar enough to pun? on our sister site English Language &amp; Usage    "

Many years later,  Alecco - now an experienced young doctor who has studied with the greatest specialist in Vienna - is asked to provide a second opinion on one of Mehmet Bey’s cases. At the end of the story, Mehmet Bey rejects his opinion, saying     Cast your memory back and answer me this question: Knowledge is good, but what is the use of knowledge without honesty?   In response, Alecco withdraws his diagnosis.   Why does he do that, and what is the significance?

The Macrobes promptly demand another head; Withers and Straik promptly kill Filostrato in order to supply it with one. Eventually, they realize that the Head will just demand another Head, and they promptly turn on each other.  That being said, why did the Macrobes make this demand? Why the gratuitous killing of people that were working for them? "
619,"Meaning of the slash (""/"") in dialog in Ernst Toller's ""Die Wandlung""","I have to translate German playwright Ernst Toller's drama Die Wandlung. In this drama, Toller uses slashes in the dialogues of some characters to separate the sentences, like this:     KRIEGSTOD: Zuviel des Lobs, Herr Kamerad. / Ihr Misstraun schien mir unerklärlich, / Ich bin's in Bürgerkreisen zwar gewohnt. / Drum möchte ich von Herzen gern Sie überzeugen. / Wenn Sie gestatten, lass ich aufmarschieren.     From what I know, the slash is used in literature to separate verses of a poem when written in body text. I have also asked my teacher, a professional translator specialised in literature, and she told me that she has only seen the slash in this context. But in this case there is no poem, there is not even a rhyme, so I don't understand the purpose of this punctuation mark here and I can't translate the text properly. Has anyone ever encountered the slash in a similar context?  Maybe it is something only play-related. Could it have something to do with the way the actors have to act this scene or these characters? "
620,Is this sentence in The Count of Monte Cristo supposed to refer to Fernand or to Albert?,"In Chapter Seventy-Eight of The Count of Monte Cristo Albert shows Monte Cristo the following article from the newspaper:     A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand, in whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.   Albert is offended by this because he thinks it is a reference to his father. As he tells Monte Cristo:     ""It signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian name is Fernand!""   Monte Cristo tries to convince Albert that no one will make the connection:     ""Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person? and who cares now about Yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823?""   Yet Albert is unconvinced, and he goes to demand that Beauchamp issue a retraction of the article. At one point in the conversation Beauchamp says:     Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it, although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on my honor, that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me, and although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand?”   To me this seems to be essentially the same argument given by Monte Cristo – while Albert's father the Count of Morcerf is indeed named Fernand, that is not enough to make people think that the Fernand spoken of in the newspaper is in fact Albert's father.  However, in the edition containing notes by Keith Wren of Kent University, the following note appears on the last sentence above:     Fernand clearly incorrect: Dumas means Albert   I am having trouble understanding this. The sentence seems to make perfect sense using the name Fernand, as Beauchamp is saying that no one will recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand (despite Fernand being his actual given name). To replace Fernand with Albert would seem to make no sense – Beauchamp would be saying that no one would recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name Albert, which has nothing to do with what was written in the newspaper.  Am I missing something here, or is this note just wrong? "

624,"What does Forster mean by ""Suspicion in the Oriental""?","I'm Asian and read p. 114 of Critical Terrains: French and British Orientalisms by Lisa Lowe, but I'm still baffled by this quote at ThoughtCo. It feels too broadly generalized (and a shade politically incorrect?!?).     Suspicion in the Oriental is a sort of malignant tumour, a mental malady, that makes him self-conscious and unfriendly suddenly; he trusts and mistrusts at the same time in a way the Westerner can not comprehend. It is his demon, as the Westerner's is hypocrisy.      — E. M. Forster (1924), A Passage to India, chapter 32.    What's meant by ""suspicion""? Like how Eurosceptics are ""suspicious"" of the EU? How does ""suspicion"" make Orientals ""self-conscious and unfriendly suddenly""? ""he trusts and mistrusts at the same time in a way"" - huh? This looks like a contradiction? Why can't the ""Westerner"" ""comprehend"" this synchronous trust and mistrust? Why is the Westerner's ""demon"" ""hypocrisy""? Orientals can be hypocritical too.  "
625,"What did Charlotte Brontë mean by ""you would not be without friends”?","I lighted on this quote on BookRiot:     [Helen Burns] went on— “If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.”      — Charlotte Brontë (1847), Jane Eyre, chapter 8.   This forum thread has diverse interpretations:      Just listen to the applauses of your own conscience and forget about the rest.     I think it means that even if the whole world hated you because you were evil, but you in your conscience feel you are not, then probably you would have friends who would feel the same way about you.      I think it means that some people are their only best friends. It reminds me of Rudyard Kipling's 'If'. It may be a sign of strength in times of hardship if you are a leader making awkward decisions but it may also mean you are stubborn and just plain wrong like Lord Cardigan.     friends, with the ""s"" on the end makes it more than one. Being a friend to yourself is not correct by itself. But it is true. The truth is that yes, you would have friends. Even if they are animals. but not only to the animals but to all that you show yourself friendly to, most of them will be friendly back to you. Make sense?      This is an old story referred to Nasreddin Hodja - maybe one of the most well-known ones. In the original, Nasreddin Hodja, son and donkey (his famous donkey!) are the main figures of story. It implies that, whatever you do, there will always be somebody there not to approve of how you act. After all, in connection with the quote, one should know he/she is the one who can choose the rightest step for him/herself.      Even if you are righteous, you still can be left alone, without single friend. Although not entirely true, this quote does give some consolation :-)     Which of these are right? "
626,"How are ""sin and love and fear"" ""just sounds"" in Faulkner's ""As I Lay Dying""?","I lighted upon this quote from Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying on WikiQuote:     He did not know that he was dead, then. Sometimes I would lie by him in the dark, hearing the land that was now of my blood and flesh, and I would think: Anse. Why Anse. Why are you Anse. I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquefy and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out of the darkness into the vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without Me like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgotten the name of the jar. I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a and I couldn't think Anse, couldn't remember Anse. It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now. And when I would think Cash and Darl that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what they call them.      And so when Cora Tull would tell me I was not a true mother, I would think how words go straight up in a thin, line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other and that sin and love and fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. Like Cora, who could never even cook.      She would tell me what I owed to my children and to Anse and to God. I gave Anse the children. I did not ask for them. I did not even ask him for what he could have given me: not-Anse. That was my duty to him, to not ask that, and that duty I fulfilled. I would be I; I would let him be the shape and echo of his word. That was more than he asked, because he could not have asked for that and been Anse, using himself so with a word.      — William Faulker (1930). As I Lay Dying.    I don't understand how the emboldened phrase is true? I'm not a romantic and won't debate love, but let's focus on sin and fear.  I don't need to sin (like adultery or a criminal offense) or be directly unnerved by my phobia (like seeing my skin age to know gerascophobia) to know what sin and fear are? And I haven't forgotten these nouns! "

In the epilogue Anton's life-long friend Pasha wonders about the significance of this childhood experience:     “Anka,” Pashka said. “Do you remember the anisotropic highway?”   Anka frowned. “What highway?”      “Anisotropic. The one with the do-not-enter sign. Remember, the three of us went there?”      “I remember. It was Anton who said that it was anisotropic.”      “That was the time Anton went through the sign, and when he came back, he said that he found a blown-up bridge and the skeleton of a fascist chained to a machine gun.”      “I don’t remember that,” said Anka. “So what?”      “I often think about that highway nowadays,” said Pashka. “Like there’s some connection. The highway was anisotropic, like history. You weren’t supposed to go back. But he did go back. And stumbled on a chained skeleton.”   Ibid, pages 230-231.

635,Was Mrs Croft really an invalid?,"In Agatha Christie's detective story Peril at End House, was Mrs Croft really an invalid?  Or did she just pretend to be one?    We find out in the ending of the novel that Mrs Croft was a criminal.  She could get away with pretending, because she came recently from Australia, so nobody really knew her past history.  Pretending to be an invalid could give her an easy alibi, and indeed that method was used in at least one other Christie story.  However, the ending doesn't seem to reveal whether this was the case. "
636,Are there any motifs or symbols related to imperialism in Animal Farm?,"In my centennial edition of Animal Farm by George Orwell, his bio states that he joined the Burmese Indian Imperial Police stating,     In order to hate imperialism, you have got to be part of it.   In Animal Farm, George Orwell satirizes the Russian Revolution, which most definitely involved imperialist elements. Is imperialism satirized in Animal Farm? If so, how is it satirized? "
637,Is Sherlock Holmes religious?,"In this question, it is established that Sherlock Holmes, from the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was asexual and in explaining that it is stated that he showed very little emotion in general. This led me to wonder if he was religious in any of the books. Based on the text of the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, do we know if Sherlock Holmes was religious? If so, how was this displayed in his actions? "
638,Did Alfred Tennyson ever read The Last of the Light Brigade?,"The Last of the Light Brigade, by Rudyard Kipling refers to Alfred Tennyson and his poem, The Charge of the Light Brigade. Do we know if Alfred Tennyson ever read The Last of the Light Brigade? If so, what was his opinion of it? "
639,What is the origin of including formulas in a literary text?,"One of the most striking things about Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson was the fact that the novel's text was full of mathematical formulas.  In some ways, this approach resembles, for example, inclusion of in-depth military technology porn in Clancy-esque technothrillers. But mathematical formulas seem to take this ""professional knowledge"" approach to a wholly separate level.  Is there a tradition of including actual formulas in fiction books that deal with mathematically inclined characters and events and subjects? Or was Stephenson's work groundbreaking in that respect? "
640,Is the location of the land of the Houyhnhnms significant?,"As seen from the below map from the Wikipedia article, which is identical to the version of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, which I own, the land of the Houyhnhnms is directly below what we now call Australia. Is there any significance to that location? If so, why did he choose that location?  "
641,How do you pronounce Houyhnhnm?,"In Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, Gulliver travels to a land of Houyhnhnms. When I read, I like to hear the names in my head because it helps me to get into the story. However, I do not know how to pronounce Houyhnhnm. Do we have any guidance from Swift, the word's origins, or other sources for how to pronounce Houyhnhnm? If so, how do they recommend? "
642,Who do the inhabitants of Brobdingnag represent in Gulliver's Travels?,"In his answer to this question, Riker established that the islands of Lilliput and Blefuscu were representing England and France and it was satirizing the holy wars between them.   What was being satirized in the second part of Gulliver's Travels, in which Gulliver is among the inhabitants of Brobdingnag? Who or what do the inhabitants of Brobdingnag represent? "
643,Was Gulliver religious?,"In Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, there is little discussion of religion except for a passage from part 3, which reads,     To this I added another petition, “that for the sake of my patron the king of Luggnagg, his majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix: because I had been thrown into his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.”  When this latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a little surprised; and said, “he believed I was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt, whether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a Christian.   We never find out if Gulliver is in fact, Christian, but this is the only mention I could find in the book. Do we know whether he was Christian? Does Swift ever mention it in any of his letters? "
644,How are graphic novels different from comic books?,I always get confused between the terms comic-book and graphic novel. What makes a comic-book be referred to as Graphic novel? What is the difference between both of the terms? 
645,"For works translated by the original author, how common is it for additional translations to exist? What might these translation add?","Sorley MacLean was a Scottish poet who worked in Gaelic. This was the language of his poem, Hallaig, about the Highland clearances and how time changes our perception of history. However, he also provided an English translation. Here are the opening stanzas.     Time, the deer, is in the wood of Hallaig        The window is nailed and boarded   through which I saw the West   and my love is at the Burn of Hallaig,   a birch tree, and she has always been        between Inver and Milk Hollow,   here and there about Baile-chuirn:   she is a birch, a hazel,   a straight, slender young rowan.        In Screapadal of my people   where Norman and Big Hector were,   their daughters and their sons are a wood   going up beside the stream.     In 2002 famed poet Seamus Heaney offered a new translation. In parts, it is markedly different from the original although the broad meaning is preserved. Here is his version of the above text.     Time, the deer, is in Hallaig Wood        There's a board nailed across the window   I looked through to see the west   And my love is a birch forever   By Hallaig Stream, at her tryst        Between Inver and Milk Hollow,   somewhere around Baile-chuirn,   A flickering birch, a hazel,   A trim, straight sapling rowan.        In Screapadal, where my people   Hail from, the seed and breed   Of Hector Mor and Norman   By the banks of the stream are a wood     When I first read the translation, it struck me as almost rude: why would someone, even of Heaney's stature, feel they could do a better job of translating something than the original author?   On reflection, I am not aware of any other instances of a work translated by its original author being re-translated by other writers. Are there any? What additional insight might such re-translations offer? "
646,At which pole did Byrd's adventure take place?,"The Secret Lost Diary of Admiral Richard E. Byrd and The Phantom of the Poles book describes a mysterious journey of Admiral Richard E. Byrd during his flight to the Polar region of the world.  In the brief description at the Amazon website it's said he made a flight into the South Polar region. On another website it's said the exploration flight was over the North Pole.  Then in the content of the book, it also keeps shifting from the North Pole to the South, and back again.  Therefore, at which pole did Admiral Byrd's alleged adventure take place? "
647,What order should I read Thomas Pynchon's novels in?,"Thomas Pynchon is a writer famous for having dense and hard to read books, but is acclaimed for those books.  He wrote V., The Crying of Lot 49, Gravity's Rainbow, and others.  What order should I read his books?  His books are often read in specific orders, because all of them are hard to understand, and some books are easier than others.  What order should I read the books in to help them be easiest to understand? "
648,Is Judaism represented in the Narnia books?,"In C.S. Lewis's Narnia books, it's very clear that the Narnians are meant to represent Christianity, with Aslan symbolising Jesus (in fact, Aslan is literally Jesus in-universe), while the Calormenes are meant to represent Islam. Which invites the question: what about Judaism? (Yes, I know that other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, are practised more in the world in general than Judaism, but Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are the religions most likely to be familiar to Lewis and his western audience.)  I seem to remember reading somewhere that the dwarfs could be interpreted to represent Judaism, but I'm not sure what this was based on. At least in The Last Battle, the dwarves seem more like atheists than anything else, although the role of atheists could also be given to the Telmarines in Prince Caspian.  Were any characters in the Narnia books intended to represent Jews? "
649,Was the last Animorphs book rushed?,"The Animorphs were published from 1996 to 2001, with the last book in the series being titled The Beginning.  I read this book when it first came out and I was really disappointed with it.  It ended somewhat abruptly, starting a new story line that it had no intention of continuing, and in general felt rushed.  Was the last book rushed to production?  If it was, why? "
650,Were the footnotes included in the original text of the 1002nd Tale of Scheherezade?,"The short story ""The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherezade"" by Edgar Allan Poe details a great many wonders of the more modern world being described by Scheherezade to her husband, in terms familiar to them, in such a way that they would have sounded preposterous to people of their time.  In my edition of the Collected Works of Poe, this story comes with multiple footnotes to specify the exact nature as we know it of each wonder that Scheherezade describes. Footnotes are also included in, for example, this online version.  Are the footnotes part of Poe's original text of the story, identical since its first publication? Or were they added later by an editor seeking to make the story more easily understandable? "
651,Did Pilate have a vision of Woland/Satan?,"In ""Master and Margarita"", after hearing from Berlioz that Jesus was a fictional character, Woland starts to describe the meeting between procurator Pilate and prisoner Yeshua Ha-Notsri, saying that ""he was there, hiding"".   I always assumed that he indeed was somewhere in the background, but then I've found this fragment, that describes Pilate reaction, when shortly after deciding to let Yeshua go (well ""imprisoning"" him in procurator's mansion), he finds that Yeshua is also accused of questioning Cesar's rule:      Pilate another parchment.        'What else is there? ' enquired Pilate and frowned.        Having  read the further evidence  a change  came over his  expression.   Whether it  was blood flowing back into his neck and  face or from something   else that  occurred,  his skin changed from yellow to red-brown and his eyes   appeared to collapse. Probably caused by the increased blood-pressure in his   temples, something happened to the Procurator's  sight. He seemed to see the   prisoner's head vanish  and  another appear in  its place,  bald and crowned   with a spiked golden diadem. The skin  of the forehead was split by a round,   livid  scar  smeared  with  ointment.  A  sunken,  toothless  mouth  with  a   capricious, pendulous lower  lip. Pilate had  the  sensation  that the pink   columns of his balcony  and the roofscape of Jerusalem below and  beyond the   garden had all vanished, drowned in the thick foliage of cypress groves. His   hearing, too,  was  strangely  affected--there  was a  sound  as of  distant   trumpets,  muted and threatening, and  a nasal voice could clearly be  heard   arrogantly intoning the words: ' The law pertaining to high treason . . .'   Is that supposed to be a vision of dead Yeshua (but then ""golden diadem""?), the ascension of Yeshua-as-Jesus (but then I've never heard about mutilated Jesus described as ""toothless"") or maybe it is Woland/Satan that Pilate sees? "
652,In what way was Dr. Robert Stadler based on Robert Oppenheimer?,"Wikipedia describes Dr. Robert Stadler from Atlas Shrugged as follows:     A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons. To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the ""man who knew better"" but chose not to act for the good.   (It cites Ayn Rand's journals as a source for these claims, which I unfortunately do not have access to at this time).  In what way was Stadler based on Oppenheimer? Since Stadler's defining characteristic was being the man that knew better, did Ayn Rand view Oppenheimer in the same way? What did Oppenheimer know better than to do - work on nuclear weapons? (Wikipedia seems to imply as much). If so, why did she oppose his involvement with that?  I can see how Project X was analogous to nuclear weapons in one sense, but Dr. Stadler was only loosely aware of the project (although he was admittedly ignorant largely by his own choice) whereas Oppenheimer personally supervised the research into the nuclear bomb, so does this analogy ""break down"" at some point?  What's the exact nature of the analogy between Stadler and Oppenheimer? Is Wikipedia's assessment of the analogy accurate? "
653,"Did Ayn Rand interview Robert Oppenheimer, and if so, how did she use the material?","This is a follow-up question to this question. I thought that it was better to post this as a second, related question though to avoid the original question from being too broad.  Wikipedia describes Dr. Robert Stadler from Atlas Shrugged as follows:     A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free.

To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the ""man who knew better"" but chose not to act for the good.   Is this accurate? Did such an interview take place? If so, what was the subject of the interview, and what did they talk about?  Did Ayn Rand use the material from the interview? If so, how, and on which project?  Did Rand believe Oppenheimer to be evil at the time that she interviewed him, or did she only come to that opinion later? If she believed him to be evil at the time, why did she interview him? Was Oppenheimer aware of her opinion of him? If so, why did he consent to the interview? "
654,"Why did Robert Stadler claim that John Galt was ""probably a second assistant bookkeeper somewhere""?","When Dagney Taggert went to see Dr. Robert Stadler at the State Science Institute, in explanation for his mistrust of humans and human reason, he told the story of his three students:     ""These three men, these three who held all the hope which the gift of intelligence ever proffered, these three from whom we expected such a magnificent future - one of them was Francisco d'Anconia, who became a depraved playboy. Another was Ragnar Danneskjold, who became a plain bandit. So much for the promise of the human mind.""   ""Who was the third one?"" [Dagney] asked.   He shrugged. ""The third one did not achieve even that sort of notorious distinction. He vanished without a trace - into the great unknown of mediocrity. He is probably a second assistant bookkeeper somewhere.""   I realize that Ayn Rand couldn't reveal that his third student was John Galt at that point, but why did he say that?  Dr. Stadler had shown considerable degree of obliviousness (both feigned and real - he appeared to be only dimly aware of the statement issued by Dr. Floyd Farris, he had to be reminded that Taggart Transcontinental was building a new branch line from Rearden Metal, and he pretended not to know about the properties of Rearden Metal); he appeared to have lost much of his will for personally investigating things at that point (such as Floyd Farris's activity). Was he simply too oblivious to know the phrase ""Who is John Galt?""  Alternatively, is he kidding himself about it being a different John Galt? (I have a vague recollection that that's the case from later in the book, but I can't remember exactly where). Or is he lying? And why didn't he actually state John Galt's name? "
655,"What does Stephen Dedalus mean: ""History is the nightmare from which I’m trying to awake”?","Source: How to Read Novels Like a Professor (2008) by Thomas C. Foster. p. 247 Middle.       The big, often very uncomfortable, ideas run rampant in those disquieting categories, “minority” and “postcolonial” fiction. That’s nearly inevitable. How can a novel by an African American or African Caribbean writer not take stock of the legacy of slavery and racist mistreatment? How can an African or Indian novel, or any other from a former outpost of empire, not speak to, among other things, the experience of oppression or the chaos that so often follows when the oppressor withdraws? Chinua Achebe has a famous essay of complaint against Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, itself a pretty dense little novella of ideas, but his better rejoinders are his fiction from Things Fall Apart forward. The essay states his ideas; the novels embody them. History, as I suggest elsewhere, is the one inescapable fact. Stephen Dedalus’s “History is the nightmare from which I’m trying to awake, [bold mine]” is merely a sign of his callowness. Writers as outwardly different as Salman Rushdie, R. K. Narayan, Kiran Desai, Caryl Phillips, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Louise Erdrich, and Edward P. Jones have in common the making of fiction filled with ideas in response to what history has handed them. [...]   I haven't the time (or erudition!) to read Ulysses yet, but what does the bold mean? Trying to awake from history appears silly to me, because history (however nightmarish) can't be changed.  "
656,What's the significance of the stanza about V for victory in Tony Harrison's V?,"I'm working through the long poem ""V"" by Tony Harrison (available here). The narrator is describing the graffiti scrawled by football supporters, with ""V"" denoting ""versus"", as in ""Leeds V [another team]"". In the middle of this, he stops to draw a contrast with a different kind of V written up in public:     Half this skinhead's age but with approval   I helped whitewash a V on a brick wall.   No one clamoured in the press for its removal   or thought the sign, in wartime, rude at all.   Presumably this V, in the context of the war, stands for Victory. My question is ...  What is the point of this stanza about the old V as contrasted with the new V?  What does it say about the 'skinhead' graffiti artist or the narrator's perception of him, or about the narrator himself? Why is it included, and what does it add to the poem? "
657,"Meanings of the Kenyan dialect words used in ""A Grain of Wheat""?","I've started reading A Grain of Wheat by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (available here), and it contains quite a few of what I assume are Kenyan dialect words. Not enough to make it unreadable for me - most of them are roughly guessable from context - but I feel like knowing their precise meanings might increase my understanding or appreciation of the text. For example:   jembe and panga - some kind of agricultural tools? shamba - a piece of land, perhaps? Uhuru na Kazi - Google tells me that this phrase means ""freedom and work"", but in the book it seems to have a deeper cultural meaning which I feel is important but don't understand. micege, mikengeria, bangi - some kind of plants?   All of these and more just from the first two chapters of the book. I'd like to find a comprehensive list of the dialect words used in the book with their meanings. Does such a list exist anywhere already? If not, I would award a bounty to any answerer who compiles one themselves from the book.  Partial answers are acceptable - I'd be grateful for help with any of these words, especially ""Uhuru na Kazi"", which seems to have some significance in the story. "
658,Tom and Nick's meeting in the Great Gatsby,"At the end of Gatsby when Tom and Nick meet, after their conversation Nick states that Tom:      ""went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace — or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons — rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.""   I have a few questions:   Why didn't Nick tell Tom it was Daisy, not Gatsby in the car. (and does Tom already know that)? Why does Nick say he is: (My friend told me it has something to do with character but I don't understand it)      ""rid of my [his] provincial squeamishness forever.""  What is the significance of Tom walking into a jewelry store?  "
659,"Did Thomas Hardy's books get more miserable with time, and was this because of his own life?","Thomas Hardy is best known for his tragic romances, novels which are really miserable and depressing to read. However, not all of them are equally so:   Far From the Madding Crowd, one of his first novels, actually has a happy ending for the main characters! The Mayor of Casterbridge ... I didn't finish this one, but in spite of its often gut-wrenching twists and turns, at least some of the main characters end up contentedly married. Jude the Obscure, Hardy's last novel, is the most heartbreaking and emotionally rending book I've ever read, and I consider it a great survival feat simply to force oneself to finish reading it.   Is there a clear trend to the tragic in Hardy's writing over time? I've only read a few of his novels, so I can't really say whether this conclusion is correct or a hasty one based on too few data points.  If so, why? Can we work out a reason for the change in the tone of Hardy's writing, based on events in his own life? Did his personal life get worse over time, inspiring more pessimism in his writing? "
660,Is Ozma a lesbian character?,"Throughout the Oz books, we see that Ozma has several indicators of perhaps being gay: She never takes a boyfriend, she has a... erm... very close friendship with Dorothy, and some people claim that she is in a relationship with Dorothy in book six.  She was also a boy for the large majority of her childhood, so perhaps her transition wasn't as smooth as it appeared to be?  Ozma being lesbian is also a popular theory on the Internet — see here.  Is there anything in the text to indicate that Ozma is gay? "
661,"In which countries was ""The Story of Ferdinand"" banned?","On the Wikipedia page for The Story of Ferdinand, it says this:     The book was released nine months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, and was seen by many supporters of Francisco Franco as a pacifist book.[8] It was banned in many countries, including in Spain (where it remained banned until after Franco's death).[7] In Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler ordered the book burned (as ""degenerate democratic propaganda""), while it was the only American children's book available for sale in Stalinist-era Poland.[7]   (emphasis mine)   Going to the reference marked [7], which is The Washington Post, there's this:     In Nazi Germany, Hitler burned the translation for being ""degenerate democratic propaganda."" When Berlin fell in 1945, 30,000 copies were immediately printed and freely distributed among the children in a mission of peace. In its 50 years, it has been translated into 60 languages and is said to have sold at least 2.5 million copies world-wide. It has been pirated -- and rewritten -- in the Soviet Union. It was the only American children's book available in Stalinist Poland, and a square in Warsaw has been renamed ""Ferdinand."" It remained banned in Spain until Franco's death.   ...but I don't see anything about the 'many countries' that the Wikipedia page claims that it was banned in.  Is this Wikipedia page accurate, that it was banned in many countries? Which countries has it been banned in? "
662,How significant is Schopenhauer's philosophy in Buddenbrooks?,"In Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, in part 10, Thomas Buddenbrook finds himself reading a treatise on philosophy, which elevates him above his day to day care to a level where he can see the pettiness of this life and how death should be welcomed as it erases the singular person. However, this state soon escapes him and he goes back to his complacent life as a merchant. The book is never named, but appears to have been Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation.  Is there some deeper significance to this episode, beyond underlining just how stifled Thomas has become through him feeling compelled to continue the family business? To what extent could readers have been expected to recognise the book as Schopenhauer's treatise when Buddenbrooks first came out? "
663,Why did all of the Taggart Transcontinental engineers volunteer to drive the first train on the John Galt Line?,"Early on in the book, the engineer running the Comet stopped for hours at a broken signal and spent hours waiting for someone to tell him what to do.  However, later we see that almost every engineer working for Taggart Transcontinental volunteered for the first run of the John Galt Line (and that numerous other staff members volunteered for other positions as well). The only exception were 3 who were incapable of doing so for various reasons (e.g. the fact that one of them was in jail for reckless driving).  I suppose that it's possible that the aforementioned engineer of the Comet was either one of the three or had left the company by then, but there's a good chance that he was one of the people to volunteer. Even if he wasn't, odds are there were plenty of people like him who volunteered.  That being the case, Dagney decided who got to drive it by randomly drawing a name. There's no indication that either her or Eddie had done anything to screen out the obviously bad engineers. She drew one of the best engineers on the line, but that appears to be more luck than anything else.  Why did all of the engineers volunteer? And why would Dagney leave the selection to chance? "
664,Why and how is Mr. Thompson based on Harry S. Truman?,"Wikipedia's list of characters in Atlas Shrugged describes Mr. Thompson as follows:     Mr. Thompson is the ""Head of the State"" for the United States. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on President Harry S. Truman, and that she deliberately decided not to call him ""President of the United States"" as this title has ""honorable connotations"" which the character does not deserve.   In what way was he based on Harry S. Truman? Why Harry Truman in particular? "
665,Seeing the world through green-tinted glasses,"   people thus situated, who have warm imaginations, generally amuse themselves by conjuring up an idol of perfection to which they attach all kinds of merit, probable or improbable. They invest the first face or figure that takes their fancy, with these imagined charms, no matter whether they accord or not, and then fall in love with the image they have created—whilst the delusion under which they labour, makes them see every action of the beloved object under a false light; just as people wearing green spectacles fancy the whole creation tinged with emerald.   This is, of course, an obvious allusion to the Emerald City in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. Except that it was written in 1827, a few decades before Baum was born, by Jane C. Loudon, in The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (available online).  It could be a coincidence, but I wonder. Have other authors suggested people with red glasses seeing a world made or rubies, and people with yellow glasses seeing a world made of citrine? Or was Frank making a reference to Loudon? Or were they both part of a larger movement, and if so is it purely an arbitrary tradition or is it based on some symbolism of emeralds?  How does the literary history of green spectacles match that of rose-colored glasses?  (Note that I'm asking why emeralds and not other gems. The association between emeralds and green, and the symbolism of gems as precious and nice-looking, are obvious.) "
666,Analyzing the end of Gatsby,"I'm trying to understand the end of Gatsby, and my friend told me that the end of Gatsby relates to the American dream. Can someone help me the analyze the end of Gatsby? What I have analyzed so far:    'Gatsby's wonder' - I think this means how he was hoping to be with Daisy and was stuck on that idea (did he ever stop trying to be with her - if so, when)? The last sentence's meaning: So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. The valley of ashes and how it relates to the American dream.   Are there other important ideas that I am missing in my analysis? If so, can someone guide me on the right path? "
667,When was young Cosette's bedtime?,"While the song ""Come to Me"" was probably not intended as a treatise on astronomical timekeeping or 19th-century French child-rearing, some of Fantine's lines (taken at face value) fit together for a remarkably specific implication about her daughter's bedtime. Cosette is roughly 8 years old at this point.     it's past your bedtime   So the bedtime is earlier than the ""now"" of the song.     soon it will be night ... Don't you see the evening star appearing?   So ""now"" is twilight, just after sunset.     Don't you hear the winter wind is crying?   And it is winter, so we know that sunset is relatively early. Because in this period I believe clocks were set locally by the sun rather than by time zones, the sun would be highest at noon and would set no later than 6 pm in the winter. The lines seem to fit together like a logic puzzle.  Is the month of Fantine's death known? Once source puts it in December, another in March -- both consistent with the ""winter"" reference. At the latitude of Montreuil-sur-Mer, sunset would be about 4:15 pm in December, reaching 6 pm in March. The expectation for 8-year-old Cosette to be in bed before 6 pm, and possibly much sooner, seems unreasonably early.  There are many potential ways to explain the apparent implications:   Fantine is emotional and hallucinating as she dies, and her time references are not precise. Fantine has not been caring for Cosette day-to-day and may not know what a reasonable bedtime for her child would be. ""Bedtime"" might mean the time to begin getting ready for bed -- although in modern English it seems to refer to ""lights out"". Attempting a scientific interpretation of the lyrics is inappropriate. Or maybe the lyrics are actually telling us something interesting, that children in this time and place did go to bed very early by modern standards, perhaps due to the need to get up and perform chores well before dawn.   Is there any literary or historical insight on the interpretation? "
668,How did Snape figure out the stuff he had written in his Advanced Potion-Making book?,"The first thing that we're actually shown is Snape's modifications to the Draught of Living Death potion. Some of his modifications, like crushing the bean instead of cutting to release more juice, seem like reasonable things to try. Even adding juice from 1 extra bean seems like a reasonable thing to try.  However, the stirring directions (7 times clockwise, 1 time counterclockwise) seems absurdly specific. The directions say to stir twice clockwise. How do you get from ""stir twice clockwise"" to ""stir 7 times clockwise and once counterclockwise""? How did he know to do 7 times rather than 6 or 8? Yeah, I know that 7 is a magically significant number, but 1 (the number of counterclockwise stirs) isn't, and neither is 2 (the number of stirs in the original directions), so really, I could ask how either of them came up with any of their numbers for stirs - it seems quite arbitrary.  Also, his Levicorups spell shows multiple attempts to get it right. How did he ""figure it out"" - guess at the incantation or something? What might his previous experiments have looked like, and what were the results likely to have been? Presumably, they had some effect given that he had written them down, but the fact that he crossed them out implies that successive attempts were better somehow. Better how, though?  TL;DR How did Snape figure out the stuff he had written in his book? "
669,"Why does the narrator ask to ""give me some time"" in ""Brand New Day"" by Ryan Star?","From Brand New Day by Ryan Star contains the following lyrics:     I stayed in one place for too long   Gotta get on the run again   I saw the one thing that I want   Hell bent, get outta bed   I'm throwing rocks at your window   You're tying the bed sheets together   They say we are dreaming too big   I say this town's too small      Dream   Send me a sign   Turn back the clock   Give me some time   I need to break out   And make a new name   Let's open our eyes   To the brand new day   Why does the narrator need more time?

672,"What do people mean when they refer to a work as ""Dostoevskian""?","I hear this term thrown around a lot, in connection to a variety of different works. They don't all share the same central themes, though - at least not necessarily. But they do all tend to be connected in a pretty basic way: they're all fairly grim.  Online definitions circularly say that ""Dostoevskian"" means ""in the style of Fyodor Dostoevsky,"" which isn't particularly helpful.  What aspects of his works are typically specifically referred to by this term? Do people mean to say that a work is nihilistic, or explores seemingly irrational behavior? Or do they mean something else entirely? "
673,Why did Calaf offer Turandot the deal?,"In Puccini's Turandot, after Calaf successfully answers her riddles, Turandot begs her father not to make her marry him. (That's pretty rich given that the opera implies that she had at least 26 people killed for not being able to answer the riddles, but that's an issue for a different question). In response, Calaf states that he wants her to love him too and offers to call the whole thing off if she can discover his name by dawn. Why does he offer this? I understand that he wants her to love him, but why does he think that that would help? "
674,Who was Francisco d'Anconia thinking about when he asked John Galt to send word about Dagny?,"After Dagny Taggart crash-landed in the Valley, most people thought she was dead. Hank Rearden, Francisco d'Anconia, and others spent a lot of time frantically looking for the wreckage of her plane.  Francisco stopped in the Valley briefly to tell John Galt what had happened and what he was doing (at which point John showed him Dagny).  After realizing that she was alive, he asked John if they could send word that she was alive ""in case anyone felt like I did"" about Dagny's death (I don't have the exact quote in front of me).  I always assumed that he was referring to Hank Rearden, who he presumably knew by then loved Dagny. Was he also referring to Eddie Willars? Did he know that Eddie had feelings for Dagny too, or just that they had been friends for a long time? Who was Francisco referring to here? "
675,What was the real-world inspiration for the Kingsguard?,"George RR Martin's fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire takes a lot of inspiration from real-world history: Hadrian's Wall becomes the Wall in the North, Yorkists and Lancastrians become Starks and Lannisters, and the French Foreign Legion (maybe?) becomes the Night's Watch. What about that other organisation of men who take oaths for life and swear to celibacy, the Kingsguard?  Is the Kingsguard based on or inspired by any real-world organisation?  Answers based on quotes from GRRM, compelling similarities, or any other good evidence will be welcomed. "
676,Morality of the ending of The Midwich Cuckoos,"   Note: major spoilers follow! (If that wasn't already clear from the title.)   I was having a discussion with someone yesterday about John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos, specifically its ending, and we couldn't agree on the morality of the final act.  What is the moral of the story? When Zellaby sets the bomb to kill all the Children, is this an act of heroism or of murder? Is he ridding the village (and the planet) of a threat which would eventually have destroyed us, or is he killing dozens of sentient creatures just because they were superior to us? "
677,Are Songs of Experience and Songs of Innocence actually songs? Or is the word song a metaphor?,"William Blake's Songs of Experience and Songs of Innocence have the word ""song"" in their title. Why is that? Are they actually songs? Or is the word ""song"" a metaphor for something else. "
678,Bright or brightly?,"A little known fact is that William Blake was a talented musician who would sing his poems. Unfortunately no sheet music of his poems exist, meaning the actual melodies he specifically used are unknown. But musicians have adapted Blake's poetry into song, and through that we can get glimpses of the music of Blake's poetry.  I'm interested in Sherri Poterfield's adaptation of William Blake's The Tiger. I found a really nice recording of a performance of Poterfield's piece on YouTube; listening to the video will give a better sense of the piece than reading the lyrics.  One of the things that interests me is that while the very first line of Blake's text is:     Tiger tiger burning bright   Poterfield made the decision to begin with:     Tiger tiger burning brightly   What is the reason for that change? "
679,What is Bob Dylan's definition of literature in his Nobel Prize lecture?,"Bob Dylan's Nobel Literature Prize Literature starts off with the following paragraph:     When I first received this Nobel Prize for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature. I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. I'm going to try to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.   He does, in fact, go about it in a rather roundabout way, describing various books and their influence on him and his music.  He concludes with the following paragraphs:     So what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, that's all that's important. I don't have to know what a song means. I've written all kinds of things into my songs. And I'm not going to worry about it – what it all means. When Melville put all his old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story, I don't think he would have worried about it either – what it all means.      ...      When Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld – Achilles, who traded a long life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory –  tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. ""I just died, that's all."" There was no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is – a king in the land of the dead – that whatever his struggles of life were, they were preferable to being here in this dead place.      That's what songs are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, ""Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story.""   Is he making the argument that song lyrics can be literature (in spite of being primarily a performance literature) in the same way that Shakespeare is literature in spite of being intended to be performance?  What can we infer about Bob Dylan's definition of literature from this lecture? "
680,"Why did the main character in ""Hand of Fate"" by the Rolling Stones believe that he was going to prison?","In The Hand of Fate by The Rolling Stones, the main character gets in a gunfight with a man over his ex-wife. He killed the guy, claiming that he was just defending his girlfriend against her violent, alcoholic ex-husband. He promptly fled, believing that he would go to prison over the incident if he was caught.     The hand of fate is on me now   It pick me up and knock me down   I'm on the run, I'm prison bound   The hand of fate is heavy now   I killed a man, I'm highway bound   The wheel of fortune keeps turning round   Turning round, turning round   I should have known it was a one horse town      My sweet girl was once his wife   He had papers the judge had signed   The wind blew hard, it was stormy night   He shot me once, but I shot him twice   The hand of fate is on me now   It pick me up and it kicked me right down   Kicked me right down   Kicked me right down      I had to save her life   Yeah, I gunned him twice   Yeah, and I watched him die, watch out boy   Yeah, I watched him die   What, exactly, are the papers that the judge had signed, and why did her ex-husband have them? Is this referring to divorce papers, or some other papers that the ex-husband had acquired?  Also, does the line that ""He shot me once, but I shot him twice"" imply that this was also self-defense, or was the main character the instigator here?  If the main character really was acting in self-defense and/or defense of her like he claimed, why did he think that he would go to prison over the incident?  "
681,"What does ""I'll be D.D. before I have done!"" mean?","I was reading Jude the Obscure, and I came across this line in Part First, VI:     ""...I must save money, and I will; and one of those colleges shall open its doors to me&mdash;shall welcome whom now it would spurn, if I wait twenty years for the welcome.   ""I'll be D.D. before I have done!""    What does this mean? What is ""D.D.""? "
682,"Why is ""The Chimney Sweeper"" in Songs of Innocence rather than Songs of Experience?","The Chimney Sweeper from Songs of Innocence opens like this:     When my mother died I was very young,   And my father sold me while yet my tongue   Could scarcely cry 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!   So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.   I must admit that I'm very new to William Blake's material, so I hope I'm not missing something obvious, but I'm slightly baffled as to why this is a ""Song of Innocence"" rather than a ""Song of Experience."" Or is the loss of innocence the point of the poem? Is Blake being ironic in categorizing it as a Song of Innocence? "

First he was running towards him, and then near the end we come to know that he is in a cab. Is it that him taking the cab isn't shown? "
684,Why did Lilith help the factory if she wanted Manson destroyed?,"In Rachel Rising #38 the readers learn that Lilith once met a banker she had known some 60 years before that, and her acquantance with said banker helped save the factory she worked at.  But why would she do that? Firstly, she hates Manson and wants to see it destroyed for good. Secondly, she seems to hate humanity in general, so helping anyone doesn't look like the sort of thing she'd do. And yet, she quite intentionally saved the factory from being closed, in a town she hates most.   Why? "
685,"What are the ""mind-forged manacles""?","From ""London"", a short poem in William Blake's Songs of Experience collection (free to read online):     In every cry of every man,      In every infant’s cry of fear,   In every voice, in every ban,      The mind-forged manacles I hear:   What are the ""mind-forged manacles""?  I think understanding this should be the key to appreciating the whole poem. The first verse is mostly scene-setting, and the last two are about specific examples of misery in London. The phrase ""mind-forged manacles"" seems to be the core of this poem. How are the metaphorical manacles forged by minds - and by whose minds? The people's themselves, or their oppressors'? "
686,How old exactly was Rachel during the witch hunt in Manson?,"When the readers learn the true version of the event from James, he says Rachel was but a child (15? 12?) during those events.  But Rachel is very old. Her ""reboot"" mechanism has her come back to life with an amnesia (almost) every time she dies. Does it also make her come back in a younger body? How else can it be explained that Rachel (presumably having lived initially to the same visible age as Lilith) was a child during the witch hunt? "
687,What sort of bookshops sell The Works of Aristotle?,"In the beginning of The Great Divorce, C.S. Lewis' narrator states:     However far I went I found only dingy lodging houses, small tobacconists, hoardings from which posters hung in rags, windowless warehouses, goods stations without trains, and bookshops of the sort that sell The Works of Aristotle.   I am assuming he means the bookstores were basic and catered to the needs of schoolchildren.  Are there any other thoughts on what sort of bookshops sell The Works of Aristotle?  To what purpose might Lewis refer to Aristotle at this point in the book? "
688,1984 - What does O'Brien mean by this sentence?,"While Winston is being held prisoner, O'Brien walks in the room for the first time and the conversation goes something like this:     Winston: They got you too!      O'Brien: Yes, they got me a long time ago.   Does this mean that O'Brien, like Winston, was once a rebel, but was caught and converted? If so, how come O'Brien hasn't been shot already? We learn in the book that even if people are reformed, they still get killed. "
689,"In 1984, did Julia ever reach room 101? If so, what was her worst fear?","While O'Brian is torturing Winston, he reveals that Julia betrayed Winston almost immediately. Does this mean that she never reached room 101? If she did reach it, do we have any hints as to what her worst fear might have been?  "
690,How autobiographical are Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books?,"The Little House series of books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, including perhaps the most famous Little House on the Prairie, tell the story of her childhood in the American West.  How autobiographical are they, really? How closely do they stick to her real experiences, and how much of the writing is embellished or made-up incidents?  (I'm mostly asking about the 8-9 original books written by LIW herself. The books written by other authors after her death presumably have much higher fiction-to-fact ratios.) "
691,What does it mean to ask 'what is the subject of this poem'?,"I read a poem called ""Vigil strange I kept on the field one night"" by Walt Whitman (reproduced below). One question I was asked about this poem is 'what is the subject of this poem?' For my understanding, it seems to ask 'what is the theme of this poem', so my answer is 'friendship and camaraderie in time of war', but it is wrong. The correct answer is 'reminiscence'.  I am wondering what the 'what is the subject of this poem' means. Doesn't it mean 'themes' of the poem?   "
692,"The personification process in ""The City Born Great""","On the recommendation of BESW, I recently read the short story ""The City Born Great"" by N.K. Jemisin. Set in New York, it's all about the 'birth' of a city, and the struggle of these cities against some vague 'Enemy'. The (unnamed) protagonist struggles to help New York to 'breathe' and be 'born', with the help of a man named Paulo, who apparently personifies the city of Sao Paulo. At the end of the story, the protagonist himself has taken on this adviser role in another city, and he now seems to personify New York.  How does this personification process work? So many questions are raised - how did his role change from midwife to bearer of the city's soul? how did he become rich after the transformation? will he still have a normal human lifespan, and if so what happens to the city when he dies? - which, as far as I can tell, are left unanswered in the story. So my question is, first, is any of this actually answered somewhere that I've missed - and if not, why is so much left unanswered? What does it add to the story to not explain these things to us? "
693,Why did people feel like Howard Roark didn't see them?,"Shortly after he was expelled from the Stanton Institute of Technology, Hoard Roark has the following encounter with Mrs. Keating:     He stood looking at her. She knew that he did not see her. No, she thought, it was not that exactly. He always looked straight at people and his damnable eyes never missed a thing, it was only that he made people feel as if they did not exist.   Later, in his interaction with the Dean, the Dean had a similar feeling.  Why was that? None of the characters in Atlas Shrugged, We the Living, or Anthem were described like that (even major heroic figures like John Galt). Why was Roark in particular described like that? "

Is there evidence to suggest that Danny the Champion of the World is a Romani (Gypsy)? 
696,"What is the significance of the ""suffocation scene"" at Tchermashnya in Brothers Karamazov?","I'm re-reading The Brothers Karamazov and was struck again by a strange scene whose meaning isn't immediately clear to me.  In ""Lyagavy"", Part 3, Book 8, Chapter 2 of The Brothers Karamazov, Mitya rushes to Tchermashnya at the underhanded suggestion of Samsonov, in a desperate attempt to come up with money. Finding Lyagavy drunk, he decides after an unsuccessful effort to speak to him that he needs to stay the night until Lyagavy becomes sober. In the middle of that night, he awakes with a searing headache and realizes that he almost died because of the fire fumes:     But his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hours or more. He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could have screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his head ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him.      At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the forester's room. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya's surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he did go to see to it.      “But he's dead, he's dead! and ... what am I to do then?” cried Mitya frantically.      They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on Lyagavy's head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said grumpily:      “It'll be all right, now.”   Mitya eventually goes back to sleep, and (as far as I know) the incident goes no further and is never mentioned again.  Dostoevsky is such a purposeful writer that I have a hard time believing that this is just a throwaway incident. Is there any special significance, symbolic or otherwise, to this event? Is it only meant to exacerbate the extreme mental turmoil Mitya is going through at the time? "
697,"Fairy tale story in two parts: ""as I first heard it"" and ""when I wanted to know more""","I read this book some years ago, probably around 2010, though it was definitely older than that. It had a fairly short and simple title, of the kind one might expect to find on a fairy tale: ""The Lost World"" or ""The Princess's Journey"" or something in that vein. My copy was hardback, the cover mainly white with a stylised drawing running across both back and front, featuring a few people, one rather prominently on the front, and a landscape with mountains.  At first I thought it might have been written by Philippa Gregory, but I checked through her bibliography and couldn't see it there. The author's surname definitely began with an early letter in the alphabet (A to H) - I remember that from where the book was in my bookcase - and it was probably written by a woman. Edit: on further reflection, I think the author may have been called Maria, with a surname starting with G and possibly Gl.  I don't actually remember much of the plot. It was a typical fairy-tale-ish type story: a princess going on a quest? meeting a poor boy in a forest? that kind of thing. The really memorable and distinctive part was that the story was told twice in the same book: once in a relatively short and simple way, prefaced by ""this is the story of [title of book] as I first heard it"", and then again in a longer way with more details included, prefaced by ""this is the story of [title of book] as it was told to me when I wanted to know more"". In their essential details, both stories were the same, but there may have been some actual differences between them as well as just extra material in the second retelling.  What was the name of this story? I'm sure I'll know it when I see it, but it's still eluding me. "
698,"How much does ""The Parable of the Old Man and the Young"" differ from the original Bible story?","The poem ""The Parable of the Old Man and the Young"", usually attributed to Wilfred Owen although much of it was written by Siegfried Sassoon, is a slight retelling of the Biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (see Genesis 22) in such a way as to turn it into an allegory of the First World War.  Not counting the chilling last two lines, how much does this poem differ from the Bible story? I've looked at this version of Genesis 22, but of course there are many versions and translations of the Bible which must have various slight differences between them. I'm interested in how much of the wording of the poem was designed to be WWI-specific. For example:   clearly ""took the fire with him, and a knife"" is not specifically part of the war allegory, as almost exactly the same words appear in the Genesis link above; I suspect that ""parapets and trenches"" is a war reference, and that all Abraham builds in any version of the Bible story is an altar; what about, for instance, ""belts and straps""? Do they appear in some version of the Bible story, or are they meant to represent the uniforms worn by young conscripted soldiers?   Most of all, I'm interested in ""the Ram of Pride"". In the Bible story, Abraham sacrifices a ram instead of his son. But does the symbolic identification of this ram with Pride have any Biblical background, or is it an invention of the WWI poets? "
699,How many were going to St. Ives?,"The traditional nursery rhyme/riddle ""As I was Going to St. Ives"" appears to have a simple answer  Q. How many were there going to St. Ives? A. Just the traveller.  But is this what the author originally intended? Surely he could have met the man, the wives and the menagerie traveling in the same direction, not least because a single unencumbered man/woman could undoubtedly move faster than a family and several thousand cats. "
700,How did the man going from/coming to St Ives have seven wives?,"Wikipedia indicates that the classic riddle ""As I was Going to St Ives"" was written at some point in the 1700s or 1800s.     As I was going to St Ives   I met a man with seven wives   Bigamy, however has been illegal in the UK since at least the 1600s and prior to that, a breach of ecclesiastical law.  Why is this man's bigamy not noted upon by the author? Is there any indication why (or how) he even had seven wives in the first place?       As I was going to St Ives   I met a man with seven wives   He was promptly arrested   For a breach of the Bigamy Act 1603   And subsequently executed.  "
701,Why is there a focus on the atmosphere in The Fall of the House of Usher?,"In The Fall of the House of Usher, Edgar Allen Poe has several spots where he talks about the gloomy, cloudy, atmosphere:     As I looked at the house, it seemed to me that it was being wrapped in a strange vaporous cloud. A mystic fog seemed to rise from the decaying trees and nearby swamp until it covered the gray stone walls.        A furious gust of wind entered and nearly lifted us from our feet. It was a tempestuous yet strangely beautiful night. Clouds hung thickly about the turreted roof of the house. The wind blew in violent gusts, pausing now and again. The clouds were tossed about, coming together and then being blown apart before our eyes. The lowest surfaces of the moving clouds and the tree trunks all about the house were bathed in an eerie glow. Yet no moon shone; no stars twinkled; no lightning flashed. What then was this strange, unnatural light that seemed to be circling about the old mansion?   What is this all about? Is there a reason for this crazy weather, or is it just to enhance the creepy feeling of the story? "
702,"In Beatrice and Virgil, why does Erasmus kill Mendelssohn?","In Yann Martel's Beatrice and Virgil, there is a bizarre scene where Henry's dog, Erasmus, gets rabies and attacks Henry's cat, Mendelssohn. Because of this, both characters need to be killed: Mendelssohn because of the injury sustained in the attack and Erasmus because he has rabies.   What's bizarre about the scene is that although the vet claims the dog had rabies, there is virtually no logical explanation for how the dog could have gotten rabies. From page 161:     How their dog, who was supposed to have been vaccinated, caught rabies, which turned out to be the diagnosis, was a question that neither the vet nor the shelter were they had got him could answer. There are all kinds of wild animals in big cities that have rabies, he was told. Worse even: the plague. But proper sanitary conditions prevent the spread of these diseases and they don't normally jump to pets. Perhaps the vaccine had failed. Henry wondered if Erasmus could have contracted rabies at the taxidermist's store. The notion was ridiculous; nonetheless, it trotted in his head.   The even stranger thing is that the death of Erasmus and Mendelssohn, although clearly important to Henry, is not mentioned once later in the book. The mystery is never resolved.  I have two questions about the scene. First, on a practical note, is there ever a conclusive explanation for why Erasmus gets rabies? (It's very possible that the explanation is intentionally mysterious). Second, what is the meaning of this scene, and how does it contribute to the message of the rest of the book? I expect answers to answer both questions, in large part because they are interrelated; you can't answer one without considering the other. In other words, if your answer is just that this scene represents an improbable event, you also have to explain why this improbable event is such an important scene in the novel. "
703,Why did the police go to The Orchard Keeper?,"In Cormac McCarthy's The Orchard Keeper, the eponymous old man is visited by the cops. They do not get a warm welcome.  Why did they go there at all, and why was the old man so hostile to them?  I might have just missed the fact that it was spelled out in the book, but if not, there are three possible reasons I can see for the cops to want to question him:   They might have found the moonshine hidden on his property They might have found the body hidden on his property They might have discovered that the government ""tank"" on his property was shot up   The first one is perhaps most likely, because we know the police were investigating the moonshine case after they found a lot of liquor in the car in the creek. If that's the case, though, I don't understand the old man's hostility, unless he himself believed they were there for one of the other two reasons.  It could've been the second reason (we already know some kids had found the body before the old man did), but if I recall correctly the body disappeared at some point before the cops came (although I don't think I understand who moved it).  If it were the third reason, which I guess is also likely, why did he respond with such hostility? Surely his crime, in this case, wasn't too egregious? What was the ""tank"", exactly? "
704,"How did they track Llewelyn Moss in ""No Country for Old Men""?","How is Llewelyn Moss tracked by Chigurh and the Mexicans in No Country for Old Men? I'm asking several clarifying questions here, but I'm really just wondering what I missed about the tracking device(s) (were there more than one?).  Llewelyn made a dumb decision when returning to give water to the surviving cartel member in the beginning of the story, and he knows that. But why, after he finds the tracker in the satchel, does he stay in the hotel overnight even though he knows his pursuer knows where he is? (In the film, Chigurh arrives right after Llewelyn finds the tracking device, so no issue there, but in the book he goes back to bed.)  How do the Mexicans find Llewelyn at the motel first? Do they also have a tracker?  And how does Chigurh track Llewelyn and the girl at the end? Wells did say that Chigurh had other ways to find him, but what was he referring to? "
705,Where did the name Nimitseahpah come from?,"In the January 2004 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, they ran a story called ""Nimitseahpah"", by Nancy Etchemendy. 'Nimitseahpah' is the name of the Paiute statue that's part of the story:     ""It has a powerful name. Nimitseahpah. The Paiutes never say it aloud.

706,Are keteks based on some form of real-life poetry?,"In Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive novels, the chapters are grouped into parts, the titles of the parts combining to form a ketek. For example, in the first book, The Way of Kings:   Above Silence The Illuminating Storms Dying Storm's Illumination The Silence Above   Combined:     Above silence, the illuminating storms &mdash; dying storms &mdash; illuminate the silence above.   The ketek is described in the endnote:     The above sample is noteworthy as it is a ketek, a complex form of   holy Vorin poem. The ketek not only reads the same forward and   backward (allowing for alteration of verb forms) but is also divisible   into five distinct smaller sections, each of which makes a complete   thought.      The complete poem must form a sentence that is grammatically correct   and (theoretically) poignant in meaning.   Are keteks (the form: palindrome [allowing for conjugation, etc.], n [≥2] thoughts) based on some real-life form of poetry, or are they purely fictional? "
707,"Is there any evidence that this character in Harry Potter was a double agent all along, prior to the revelation?","Warning: MASSIVE spoilers ahead. If you haven't read the last Harry Potter book, but plan to do so, turn back now    Throughout the entire Harry Potter series, there was one character who was the comic 'bad guy' - designed to be disliked. This of course is Snape.   We think that he is a Death Eater, working for Voldemort, with a personal disliking of Harry.   However, in the final book in chapter 33 'The Prince's (Snape's) Tale', that all changes.  Our entire view of Snape changes, and we learn he isn't who we thought he was. He wasn't working against Dumbledore and for Voldemort, but actually the other way round:     ""Hide them all, then,"" he croaked. ""Keep her—them—safe. Please.""   ""And what will you give me in return, Severus?""   ""In—in return?"" Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, ""Anything.""   ...        ""Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked,   ""Are you intending to let him kill you?""   [Dumbledore]: ""Certainly not. You must kill me.""   ...        ""Severus Snape wasn’t yours,"" said Harry. ""Snape was Dumbledore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother.""     We learn all this when Harry sees the memories he gave him just before he died.  This is possibly the biggest twist in the entire Harry Potter series. It shocked many, and seems completely unexpected.  But maybe it shouldn't have been so unexpected...  Was there any evidence prior to the revelation that Snape is actually a 'double-agent' and not who we thought he was? "
708,"Why is ""waistcoat"" modified by ""leering"" in the poem “A German Requiem""?","In the fifth line from the third stanza of ""A German Requiem"", the word waistcoat is modified by leering. I can understand waistcoat is personified as a person here. Is this person the priest? And why is this person leering? I cannot get any clue from the context. So I was thinking maybe there are some cultural background behind this?  Below is the stanza:     How comforting it is, once or twice a year,   To get together and forget the old times.   As on those special days, ladies and gentlemen,   When the boiled shirts gather at the graveside   And a leering waistcoat approaches the rostrum.   It is like a solemn pact between the survivors.   They mayor has signed it on behalf of the freemasonry.   The priest has sealed it on behalf of all the rest.   Nothing more need be said, and it is better that way-   Here is the link to the poem.

709,Why does Portia say this in The Merchant of Venice?,"In Act III Scene 2 of The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare,      Portia : One half of me is yours, the other half yours. Mine own, I would say; but if mine then yours.   Roughly translated it means ""One half of me is yours, and the other half—my own half, I’d call it—belongs to you too. If it’s mine, then it’s yours, and so I’m all yours.""  Why doesn't Portia directly say that she totally belongs to Bassanio? Why take this ""curved route"" to end up at the same place ? "
710,Does Portia subconsciously influence Bassanio's choice of casket?,"When Bassanio is about to make his choice of the three caskets at Belmont - a choice upon which rests his chances of marriage to Portia - she calls for music and singing while he ponders.     Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself      SONG.   Tell me where is fancy bred,   Or in the heart, or in the head?   How begot, how nourished?   Reply, reply.   It is engender'd in the eyes,   With gazing fed; and fancy dies   In the cradle where it lies.   Let us all ring fancy's knell   I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.      -- The Merchant of Venice, Act 3, Scene 2, Lines 64-73   Is this song an attempt by Portia to influence Bassanio subconsciously towards lead?  The meaning of the song is about ""fancy"", superficial liking; it suggests that what appeals to the eye is not necessarily what is truly valuable. And in a subtle piece of wordplay, the first three lines of the song all rhyme with ""lead"". Portia is already in love with Bassanio, although she dare not admit it, and she's certainly clever enough to set up such a scheme, in order to prod him towards choosing the right casket but still maintain plausible deniability. On the other hand, perhaps I'm reading too much into this, and underestimating Portia's honour and dedication to the rules imposed by her late father. "
711,"Given Anton's attitudes expressed to Budakh, why did Earth start Progressors?","In conversation with Doctor Budakh - and later Arata, Rumata (Anton) basically states the Earth's - and his personal - party line about non-interference with foreign cultures:     — Что ж, — сказал он, — извольте. Я сказал бы всемогущему: «Создатель, я не знаю твоих планов, может быть, ты и не собираешься делать людей добрыми и счастливыми. Захоти этого! Так просто этого достигнуть! Дай людям вволю хлеба, мяса и вина, дай им кров и одежду. Пусть исчезнут голод и нужда, а вместе с тем и все, что разделяет людей».   ... — Бог ответил бы вам: «Не пойдет это на пользу людям. Ибо сильные вашего мира отберут у слабых то, что я дал им, и слабые по-прежнему останутся нищими».   [I'm paraphrasing here, not direct-translating, for brevity - DVK]     It won't help the people to give them enough nourishment, housing and   clothes - the strong will take the goods from the weak, and the weak   will stay in poverty.    — Я бы попросил бога оградить слабых,   «Вразуми жестоких правителей», сказал бы я.   — Жестокость есть   сила. Утратив жестокость, правители потеряют силу, и другие жестокие   заменят их.        It won't help to protect the weak by making the strong weaker, as the   new rulers who are harsh will arise to replace the ones you made   weaker.      — Накажи жестоких, — твердо сказал он, — чтобы неповадно было сильным   проявлять жестокость к слабым.    — Человек рождается слабым.   Сильным он становится, когда нет вокруг никого сильнее его. Когда   будут наказаны жестокие из сильных, их место займут сильные из слабых.   Тоже жестокие. Так придется карать всех, а я не хочу этого.        It won't help to punish the harsh ones, as the ones just less weak   than them will arise and turn harsh, requiring to punish everyone.      — Тебе виднее, всемогущий. Сделай тогда просто так, чтобы люди   получили все и не отбирали друг у друга то, что ты дал им.   — И это   не пойдет людям на пользу, — вздохнул Румата, — ибо когда получат они   все даром, без трудов, из рук моих, то забудут труд, потеряют вкус к   жизни и обратятся в моих домашних животных, которых я вынужден буду   впредь кормить и одевать вечно.        It won't help to just give everything to everyone, as humans will just   turn to cattle, forever dependent on the god who gave them the   abundance.      Не давай им всего сразу! — горячо сказал Будах. — Давай понемногу,   постепенно!   — Постепенно люди и сами возьмут все, что им   понадобится.        There's no point in giving things bit by bit, as humans will achieve   that progress on their own.      Будах неловко засмеялся.   — Да, я вижу, это не так просто, — сказал   он. — Я как-то не думал раньше о таких вещах… Кажется, мы с вами   перебрали все. Впрочем, — он подался вперед, — есть еще одна   возможность. Сделай так, чтобы больше всего люди любили труд и знание,   чтобы труд и знание стали единственным смыслом их жизни!   Да, это мы   тоже намеревались попробовать, подумал Румата. Массовая гипноиндукция,   позитивная реморализация. Гипноизлучатели на трех экваториальных   спутниках…   — Я мог бы сделать и это, — сказал он. — Но стоит ли   лишать человечество его истории? Стоит ли подменять одно человечество   другим? Не будет ли это то же самое, что стереть это человечество с   лица земли и создать на его месте новое?    Будах, сморщив лоб,   молчал обдумывая. Румата ждал. За окном снова тоскливо заскрипели   подводы. Будах тихо проговорил:        And it won't do to mind-wipe everyone and turn them into Earth-model   communars. Since basically it's the same as killing them and replacing   them with earthlings.      — Тогда, господи, сотри нас с лица земли и создай заново более   совершенными… или еще лучше, оставь нас и дай нам идти своей дорогой.    — Сердце мое полно жалости, — медленно сказал Румата. — Я не могу   этого сделать.   TL;DR: doesn't matter what you as Earth do, the only two ways are to let people's society develop on their own and progress at their own pace; OR, replace them wholesale with a new society.  Given that set of views (not an unreasonable one), what changed so that, a mere couple of decades later, in the same Noon universe, Progressors - whose whole core goal is antithetical to what Anton expressed - are working everywhere in the universe - including, as per ""Waves Extinguish the Wind"" Arkanar itself, where Toyvo Glumov worked as a Progressor.

712,Is the old man still alive at the end of The Tell-tale Heart?,"In The Tell-tale Heart, we see the madman does kill the old man:     But for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not bother me. I knew it would not be heard through the wall. Finally the beating stopped. The old man was dead.   I moved the mattress away and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone, dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there for many minutes. There was no beat. He was certainly stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.   But at the very end, we see that he hears the heart beating again:     ""Villains!"" I shrieked at the police officers. ""Do not pretend to me any more! Do not mock me any more! I admit everything! Tear up the planks - here, here! It is the beating of his hideous heart!""   So: Did he actually die? Is he hearing the heart beating for real, or is this his crazy, guilty, conscience?  "
713,"What is the relevance of the title of Nalo Hopkinson's ""A Raggy Dog, a Shaggy Dog""?","I've just read Nalo Hopkinson's short story ""A Raggy Dog, a Shaggy Dog"" (available for free online from Apex Magazine). It's an odd, quirky tale about an orchid-loving lady who's constantly setting off the fire alarms and sprinkler systems in the flats where she lives, and the orchidnated rat which she ends up sending off on a mission to find her soulmate.  My question is: how does the title connect to the story?  ""A Raggy Dog, a Shaggy Dog"" is a quote from the poem ""My Dog"" by Emily Lewis, a contributor to Ellen Bailey's poetry website. I've read the poem, but I'm still struggling to see its relevance to the Hopkinson story. There's a small pet-like animal in the story - namely, the rat - but Tammy isn't looking for it; she's sending it on a mission. She also treats her orchids like pets, but again she's not looking for them like the narrator of the dog poem. So where's the connection? "
714,"Does 'literary fiction' neccessarily have to be reality-based, or can it have fantastical themes/elements?","There seems to be a great deal of ambiguity or confusion regarding the definition of ‘literary fiction’. Particularly, it is never really made clear to me whether literary fiction can also be speculative fiction at the same time.   On one hand, ‘literary fiction’ is often defined or talked about in such a way that suggests it has to be based on real life (i.e.: ‘serious’ fiction). But, at the same time, I have come across some definitions that say literary fiction can be ‘cross genre’ (unlike other types of fiction).   So which is it?  The main problem I have with a reality-based definition of literary fiction is that it seems obvious to me that speculative fiction, such as fantasy, romance, sci-fi (especially futuristic) and horror (especially psychological horror), can easily achieve and fulfill the sorts of things that ‘literary fiction’ is usually defined as fulfilling; such as a deep examination of the human condition, presenting a new philosophical outlook, beautiful prose, and so on. Even if most books in these genres don’t do this, there are many that do. Would they therefore be classified as ‘literary fiction’? Or are they excluded because they are speculative and not reality-based? "
715,"What does ""Am I sick?"" mean in this context?","I would like to know what ""Am I sick?"" means in the following sentences:     “I mustn't! I mustn't! I'm nervous this afternoon.

But as soon as they arrived, Carol was deeply disappointed at the town's ugliness and the house's dismalness. Nevertheless, she ceaselessly tried to liven herself up, but when she looked out the window towards the ash pile at the back of the church, she finally gave way.   In this part, I wonder whether the expression ""sick"" here literally means that she was ill (from tiredness or whatever), or that she suffered from hyperemesis, since she was talking about bearing children in this text. But I could not be sure whether ""sick"" could mean ""hyperemesis"" in itself, and was worried that it might be my overinterpretation, so I wanted to ask you.  I would very much appreciate your help. :) "
716,"When is ""fe"" used in Nalo Hopkinson's ""Shift""?","The word ""fe"" is used three times in the Nalo Hopkinson short story ""Shift"":     When my mother who wasn’t my mother yet approach the man who wasn’t my father yet, when she ask him, “Man, you eat salt, or you eat fresh?” him did know what fe say.        That was the right answer. For them that does eat fresh, them going to be fresh with your business. But this man show her that he know how fe have respect.        “At least me nah try fe chat like something out of some Englishman book.” I make the wind howl it back at him: “At least me remember is which boat me come off from!”   In context, and backed by the Dialect Dictionary (that I've never used before and have no idea how accurate it is), it looks like it's a Jamaican dialect word for ""to"".  My confusion arises from the fact that this isn't used consistently for ""to"". For instance, right after the first quote, there's this:     After his tutors teach him courtly ways from since he was small. After his father teach him how to woo. After his own mother teach him how to address the Wata Lady with respect.   Here we see ""to"", as opposed to the immediately preceding ""fe"".  What's the reasoning behind where ""fe"" is used? Does this imply something about the state of the character at that time? "

She seemed then but half as large as they had supposed;   a fragile child who must be cloaked with understanding kindness.   “Psychic,” the girls whispered, and “spiritual.” Yet so radioactive   were her nerves, so adventurous her trust in rather vaguely conceived   sweetness and light, that she was more energetic than any of the   hulking young women who, with calves bulging in heavy-ribbed woolen   stockings beneath decorous blue serge bloomers, thuddingly galloped   across the floor of the “gym” in practise for the Blodgett Ladies'   Basket-Ball Team.    Sinclair Lewis, Main Street, Chapter 1   Carol, a student at Blodgett College, had a very slight and thin body. So her friends regarded her as a fragile child, but she was more adventurous than any active young women in her college.

719,What's the significance of the name Loyola?,"As soon as I started reading Nalo Hopkinson's short story ""The Reverse Cheshire Cat"" (freely available to read online), the name ""Loyola"" jumped out at me. Surely this must be a reference to Ignatius of Loyola, a Catholic saint and the founder of the Jesuit order. There are a lot of things called Loyola in the world, but I'd wager nearly all of those were named after him, mostly by Jesuits.  But what's the relevance of Ignatius of Loyola to this short story?

Prof chuckled. “Bet there’s a story there.”   But this is the only time in the story the name is mentioned.

722,What’s up with Slothrop the paedophile?,"Sexual child abuse features centrally in Gravity’s Rainbow. While the sexual abuse of children is certainly a valid topic for a novel, I have become more and more disturbed by Pynchon's handling of Slothrop and Bianca. While I can justify the centrally themed child abuse in Lolita and Finnegans Wake, I am less sure about Gravity's Rainbow.      Slothrop was sexually abused as a child by Laszlo Jamf, as part of an experiment involving inducing erections in the kid. It turns out that Slothrop's father had ""sold"" him, for Jamf's experiments, to pay for Slothrop's education. The entire novel is in essence Slothrop's response to this childhood horror and it's consequences.   Then Franz Pökler, at the  Zwölfkinder,   fantasizes incest with his daughter  Ilse, who is permited annual summertime visits, although Franz doubts the girl who visits is really is Ilse. Instead of acting on the fantasy, he becomes ""Ilse""'s ""father"".  I feel that there is no problem with Pynchon's handling of these first two examples.   But then there is Bianca!   Slothrop meets Greta Erdmann, the actress, who is looking for her lost daughter, Bianca. They head for Swinemünde, where  Bianca is supposedly on a boat. The Anubis arrives and Greta and Slothrop board, where they find an giant orgy. Slothrop and Greta participate. Slothrop catches sight of Bianca, who is eleven or twelve, ""a knockout."" Mother (Greta) and daughter (Bianca) then perform a public S/M act, with the mother fairly brutally slapping the little girl’s bottom, which Bianca seems to enjoy. Slothrop dreams about Llandudno, ""where Lewis Carroll wrote that Alice in Wonderland."" Bianca appears at his bedside, ready and willing. They have sex.  All very titillating and unreflective.  After sex, she asks him to escape with her: ""I'm a child, I know how to hide. I can hide you too."" Slothrop leaves without her and Bianca is lost again.   The only possible reflection demanded for our participation, is that later, Slothrop, when listening to Margherita's story, is overcome by nausea, but it is not even clear at what.  What is the reader to make of Slothrop and Bianca? What is the purpose/meaning/role behind Slothrop and Bianca? Or is this an example of Pynchon's  ""proto-fascism"", as he describes some of his writings in Slow Learner? "

724,"Why is Allen Ginsberg's ""Howl"" dedicated to Carl Solomon specifically?","The poem ""Howl"" by Allen Ginsberg (which can be read online) is partly a savage general commentary on society and partly an expression of solidarity for the institutionalised fellow writer Carl Solomon.  Part I of the poem describes many writers and artists of the time, with whom Ginsberg was acquainted - including, but not only, Carl Solomon. Part II is a dark vision of society - a rant about the evil and despair Ginsberg saw all around him. Part III is entirely addressed to Carl Solomon, every line beginning with ""I’m with you in Rockland"" (Rockland being a mental asylum where Solomon was kept).  My question is: why was Solomon so special to Ginsberg? Obviously they knew each other and Ginsberg sympathised with Solomon's plight, but he also knew many of the other unfortunate suffering souls referred to in Part I - what made this particular one more worthy of an ode than the rest?

725,How can we explain the porter's order of events in The Arabian Nights?,"In  The Arabian Nights, translated by Husain Haddawy, the following chronology appears in The Story of the Porter and the Three Ladies on the 28th night (my emphasis):     She walked before him until she stopped at the door of a house, and   when she knocked, an old Christian came down, received a dinar   from her and handed her an olive green jug of wine...      the porter lifted the basket and followed her until she stopped at the   fruit vendor's...      Then she stopped at the butcher's...      The porter, wondering at all these purchases, placed his basket on his   head and followed her until she came to the grocer's...      The porter carried his basket and followed her until she came to the   dry grocer's...      The porter carried the basket and followed her until she came to the   confectioner's...      She smiled and walked ahead until she came to the druggist's...      (p. 80-81)   Thus, the order of places that the porter visited was:     Old Christian > Fruit Vendor > Butcher > Grocer > Dry Grocer > Confectioner >   Druggist.   However, on the 37th night the porter recounts the events as follows (my emphasis):     ""Mistress, you know that the reason I came to this place was that I   was hired as a porter by this shopper, who led me from the vintner to   the butcher, and from the butcher to the greengrocer, and from the   greengrocer to the fruit vendor, and from the fruit vendor to the dry   grocer, then to the confectioner, to the druggist, and finally to this   house.      (p. 104)   Thus, according to the porter the order was as follows:     Vintner > Butcher > Greengrocer > Fruit Vendor > Dry Grocer >   Confectioner > Druggist.   This is clearly different from the order mentioned above. For a visual aid, here are the two orders next to each other:     Old Christian > Fruit Vendor > Butcher > Grocer > Dry Grocer > Confectioner >   Druggist.      Vintner > Butcher > Greengrocer > Fruit Vendor > Dry Grocer >   Confectioner > Druggist.   I think it is safe to assume that the old Christian from the first version is the vintner from the second version, and that  the grocer from the first version is identical with the greengrocer from the second version, so those discrepancies are taken care of. However, in the first version the fruit vendor was visited between the vintner and the butcher, while in the second version the fruit vendor was visited between the greengrocer and the dry grocer.  What is the explanation for this discrepancy?   Is this simply an issue with this particular translation? Is it an authorial error? Is it meant to be part of the story that the porter changed (or forgot) the events? Is it just to see if the reader is paying attention? Something else?   Has anyone else ever noted this discrepancy and possibly tried to explain it? (A very quick Google search did not turn up anything.) "

728,Why the title Far From the Madding Crowd for the Thomas Hardy novel?,"The title of Thomas Hardy's novel Far From the Madding Crowd presumably comes from this famous phrase in Thomas Gray's poem ""Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard"", but I can't really see the connection between these two pieces of literature. Of course both are set in rural England, but pretty much all of Hardy's stories are set in his beloved ""Wessex"", so why title this one in particular after a famous poem about the English countryside?

Everything else is marketing.""","Heard from a BitCoin motivational speaker:     Oscar Wilde said, ""Speaking the truth that somebody wants you not to publish is journalism. Everything else is marketing.""   However, we all know that Oscar Wilde also said (or was that Abraham Lincoln?) not to believe everything attributed to him on the Internet.  The word ""marketing"" makes me think it's from the second half of the 20th century or later. Googling for ""everything else is marketing"" turns up a lot of hits, but in a variety of unrelated contexts:     Bread and Water. Everything else is marketing.      At its base, ""Sales"" is when money changes hands; everything else is ""Marketing"".      Time Controls Risk; Everything Else is Marketing.   This piece attributes to Peter Drucker the sentiment ""business has only two functions — marketing and innovation."" It seems like this idea might be the original root of the ""X is Y; everything else is marketing"" snowclone, but I'm not sure.  Is this actually a well-known quotation from anyone in particular?  Where did it come from? "
730,Has Nalo Hopkinson had pets which influenced her writing?,"In at least two of Nalo Hopkinson's short stories that I've read, the main characters are women with an interest in ... unusual creatures. Namely, ""Can't Beat 'Em"" (Marisella keeps a 'glup', a sort of sink drain monster, so that she can consume it to become immortal) and ""A Raggy Dog, a Shaggy Dog"" (Tammy loves her orchids, and keeps a rat which is slowly being taken over by an orchid growing inside it). I'm curious whether this element of her writing was inspired by any unusual pets of her own.  What pets has Nalo Hopkinson had? Did they influence her writing at all? "
731,Origin of Dry Bone in Nalo Hopkinson's Midnight Robber,"Nalo Hopkinson's novel Midnight Robber contains a story entitled ""Tan-Tan and Dry Bone"". It is one of the many elements from Caribbean culture that Hopkinson draws on in the novel. Hopkinson's novel is not the only book that draws on this specific element from Caribbean culture; see for example Anancy and Mr. Dry-Bone by Fiona French, published in 1991.  However, what is the exact origin or source of inspiration of the story? More specifically, is it just one story or a set of stories involving the same figure? Is it native to one specific island in the Caribbean or West Indies or is it more widely known? "
732,Why was Far from the Madding Crowd first published anonymously?,"I recently learned that Thomas Hardy's novel Far from the Madding Crowd was first published anonymously in Cornhill Magazine. As far as I know, publishing novels as monthly serials was reasonably common in those days (see Dickens, for example), but why wouldn't he put his name on it? Unlike Marian Evans, who used a male pseudonym for her novels, Hardy didn't have to struggle against the sexism of the day. Was there another reason for him not to use his real name?  Why did Hardy publish Far from the Madding Crowd anonymously? "
733,Does the Abrahamic God exist in the Cthulhu Mythos?,"In several Cthulhu Mythos stories, incantations are made that seemingly reference Hebrew terms for the Abrahamic God. For example,     Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova      Adonai Sabaoth...   from The Case of Charles Dexter Ward by H. P. Lovecraft  Here, we have apparent references to:   אדני אלהים (Adonai Elohim, ""My Lord God"") אדני יהוה (Adonai YHWH, ""My Lord YHWH"") אדני צבאות (Adonai Sabaoth, ""My Lord of Armies"")   Also, we find elsewhere,     Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth   from The Dunwich Horror by H. P. Lovecraft  Is there an Abrahamic God in the Cthulhu Mythos? Obviously such a deity would not likely be omnipotent as he is portrayed in the Bible, Quran, and other Abrahamic writings in our world, but is there any indication that a specific god is responsible for the stories that eventually evolved into the Abrahamic religions, or that the Bible and related texts as they exist in the Cthulhu Mythos are intended to reference a specific god that actually exists in that universe (whether or not those texts are fully accurate at describing such god)? "
734,Why do Major Barbara and Undershaft shake hands?,"In George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara, I came across the following conversation which culminates with Barbara and her father Colonel Undershaft shaking hands:     BARBARA. No. Will you let me try?      UNDERSHAFT. Well, I will make a bargain with you. If I go to see you   to-morrow in your Salvation Shelter, will you come the day after to   see me in my cannon works?      BARBARA. Take care. It may end in your giving up the cannons for the   sake of the Salvation Army.      UNDERSHAFT. Are you sure it will not end in your giving up the   Salvation Army for the sake of the cannons?      BARBARA. I will take my chance of that.      UNDERSHAFT. And I will take my chance of the other. [They shake hands   on it]. Where is your shelter?   Does Barbara make a bet with Undershaft? If yes, does she ultimately win or lose? "
735,"Meaning of ""rubber"" as a verb in O. Henry","   ""I'm one of the Sole Sanhedrims and Ostensible Hooplas of the Inner Pulpit,"" says I. ""The lame talk and the blind rubber whenever I make a pass at 'em. I am a medium, a coloratura hypnotist and a spirituous control.""   -- O. Henry, ""Jeff Peters as a Personal Magnet""   It appears that the word rubber is used as a verb in this sentence. And as far as I know in this context it is intended to mean ""to [regain the ability to] move/walk/limp/etc."" and so on. But searching through the online dictionaries I have not been able to find a fitting definition for the verb to rubber.  Is this some kind of beginning-of-the-century American slang that never made it into ""official"" dictionaries? Or am I misinterpreting its usage? "
736,"Why the title ""Agunot"" for S. Y. Agnon's short story?","S. Y. Agnon's first influential story is ""Agunot"" - in fact, his chosen name ""Agnon"" comes from the same word.  The word ""Agunot"" is the plural form of the word ""Agunah"", which is the term for a woman whose husband has vanished or left without either dying or giving her a get (official divorce document), leaving her, essentially, stranded - she is still technically bound to her husband, unable to re-marry, but she either can't know if he's alive or has no way of obtaining a get.  What, then, does this have to do with the story ""Agunot""? There is no case of an Agunah in the story itself.  What is the importance of the title ""Agunot""? "
737,Why does the boy-next-door raise objections about the racist remarks that the others are making?,"Why does the boy-next-door raise objections about the racist remarks that his yippie friends make in the introductory chapters? Bateman does it twice in quick succession as if to show the reader that he stands out, is separated from his social circle:     “You spin a dreidel, Preston,” I say calmly, “not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.”   “Oh my god, Bateman, do you want me to go over to the bar and ask Freddy to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes?” Preston asks, truly alarmed.  “Some… latkes?”   “No,” I say. “Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.”   And again, see his reaction to the racist anecdote about Pearl Bailey:     Van Patten gives him high-five. Even Price laughs.   “Oh Christ,” I say. “That’s awful.”   ""Why?"" Preston says. “It’s funny. It’s humor.”   “Yeah, Bateman,” McDermott says. “Cheer up.”   “Oh I forgot. Bateman’s dating someone from the ACLU,” Price says. “What bothers you about that?”   “It’s not funny,” I say. “It’s racist.”   “Bateman, you are some kind of morose bastard,” Preston says. “You should stop reading all those Ted Bundy biographies.”   What's the purpose of this description, considering how utterly despicable and cynical he appears to be later in the story? "
738,"Are all editions of ""Joseph und seine Brüder"" (by Thomas Mann) the same?","There are several editions of Joseph and his brothers (original German Joseph und seine Brüder). Do all of them contain the same text? Or did Thomas Mann make some ""adjustments"" for some publishers? "
739,"Meaning of ""abandoned his grin to them"" in Ted Hughes' ""The Contender""?","In ""The Contender"" (a poem in Ted Hughes' Crow collection), there's a group of lines with peculiar syntax. Here are the lines:     He abandoned his grin to them his grimace   In his face upwards body he lay face downwards   As a dead man adamant   Trying to make a sense out of this syntax, let's try to change the structure and punctuate it:     He abandoned his grin to them, his grimace in his face.   Upwards body he lay, face downwards   As a dead man adamant.   But except for the fact that humans can't lay with their body (i.e, torso) turned upwards while their face turned downwards, this punctuation is not how Hughes reads it.   This is how it's read by Hughes (I would've uploaded the audio, but it's copyrighted):     He abandoned his grin to them, his grimace,   In his face upwards, body, he lay, face downwards,   As a dead man adamant.   So now it seems unintelligible: The word ""body"" seems to have no function, and in addition, it seems that the man in the poem lay with his face turned both upwards and downwards.  Can you suggest an interpretation of these lines? "
740,How is Hamlet different from a conventional Elizabethan revenge play?,"It is well known that Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy established the genre of revenge tragedy in Elizabethan drama. The play contains many elements such as the appearance of a ghost, a play within the play and madness that were frequently used in subsequent revenge tragedies.  Hamlet undoubtedly has the outer structure of a revenge tragedy but its extreme popularity makes me wonder whether it has certain features that are unusual in a conventional revenge tragedy? Is Hamlet's  tendency to procastinate one of them? Are there any others? "
741,"In ""Candide"", are Prussian officers recruiting for the Bulgarian army?","I am reading Candide as part of my A Level. In the story Candide is chased from his home and finds ""Two men dressed in blue"".  We later learn that they are trying to recruit him in the Bulgarian army.   There is a footnote that says ""These two men are wearing the uniforms of Prussian recruiting officers"".  So does this mean that Prussian soldiers are helping the Bulgarians?  I do know that Voltaire is representing the Prussians as Bulgarians in his book, so maybe this means that they are Bulgarian officers wearing uniforms like the Prussians to make his representation clear? "
742,Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Abstraction Analysis,"The Random House Teacher's Guide for The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks poses this question. Can you help to break down the question and understand what is being asked for?     Rebecca Skloot begins her book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks   with the following quote from Elie Wiesel:            We must not see any person as an abstraction. Instead, we must see in every person a universe with its own secrets, with its own     treasures, with its own sources of anguish, and with some measure of     triumph.         Analyze the book in light of this quote. Explain the various ways in   which both the scientific community and the media are guilty of having   viewed Henrietta and her family as abstractions. What are the   consequences of this perspective? How is Skloot’s different   perspective evident in the way she conducted her research and wrote   this book.  "
743,Does Holly Short get to say goodbye to her mom?,"I just finished re-reading the Artemis Fowl series, books 1-8. There were a couple of things that I seem to remember happening from the first time I read the series, a while ago, but that I didn't read this time through.   I'm trying to figure out if I am remembering wrong or if there was an extra section that I missed. I know there is extra content for the codes printed on the bottom of every page of the books, but I didn't find it there either.  What I seem to remember is that Artemis provides Holly with an opportunity to have a hologram-call back in time to speak to her mother, Coral Short, just before she dies in the submarine. They had done it that way so that time as they know it would not change, since her mother would not be able to prevent her death. I know she got to say goodbye to Commander Root, but I seem to remember this, too.  I also remember Artemis coming back from some time changes, seeing his parents, and finding that his brothers no longer exist.  Do either of these happen in any of the books or somewhere else? Or am I remembering incorrectly? "
744,"""The Apple Tree"" ending and the meaning behind it","I've recently been tasked with analysing ""The Apple Tree"" by John Galsworthy. I've had no major issues with understanding the text, but i really can't grasp the ending.     Up on the top of the hill, beyond where he had spread the lunch, over, out of sight, he lay down on his face. So had his virtue been rewarded, and ""the Cyprian,"" goddess of love, taken her revenge! And before his eyes, dim with tears, came Megan's face with the sprig of apple blossom in her dark, wet hair. 'What did I do that was wrong?' he thought. 'What did I do?' But he could not answer. Spring, with its rush of passion, its flowers and song-the spring in his heart and Megan's! Was it just Love seeking a victim! The Greek was right, then--the words of the ""Hippolytus"" as true to-day!   What exactly is going on here? Is he confused about what did he do wrong and blaming the goddess of love?  "
745,What is the effect of the stage directions in scene 6 of The Glass Menagerie?,"In Scene 6, page 50 line 27, there's the following stage direction:     Low drums sound   when the doorbell rings and Laura is required to open the door to let Jim and Tom in. What is the effect of this sound?   Is it able to relate to the theme of fear for Laura?  "
746,"Is there some cultural significance in the ""chhanna"" or metal bowl?","The Punjabi poem ""Chhanna, the Metal Bowl"" is about a ""flat-bottom metal bowl"" which is apparently some kind of family heirloom, ""filled with memories"". What's so special about a metal bowl? Is it only because it's been in the family for a long time, or is there some special cultural significance attached to it, perhaps some Punjabi tradition? What is ""the chhayapatra hovering in a nook"", and why is this word untranslated? "
747,"In A Tale of a Tub, in what sense does Martin stand between Peter and Jack?","Wikipedia has the following to say about Jonathan Swift's A Tale of a Tub (formatting added):     A Tale of a Tub is divided between various forms of digression and   sections of a ""tale"".       The ""tale"", or narrative, is an allegory of three brothers, Peter,   Martin, and Jack, as they attempt to make their way in the world.       Each brother represents one of the primary branches of Christianity in   the West.          Peter (named for Saint Peter) stands in for the Roman Catholic Church.   Jack (named for John Calvin, but whom Swift also connects to John of   Leyden) represents the various dissenting Protestant churches such as   Baptists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Congregationalists and Anabaptists.    The third brother, middle born and middle standing, is Martin (named   for Martin Luther), whom Swift uses to represent the 'via media' of   the Church of England.       What is meant by 'via media' of the Church of England? Why is the Church of England treated differently to the other Protestant branches? I.e., why three characters and not two? In what sense does Martin stand between Peter and Jack?   This question arises from my reading of Finnegans Wake, where the ""patterjackmartins"" play a key role. "
748,Why did the N.I.C.E. bother with Dr. Filostrato?,"Dr. Filostrato believed (incorrectly, as it turns out) that he had preserved the head of François Alcasan. Towards the end of the book, it's revealed that the Macrobes didn't really need Filostrato's setup in order to be able to use Alcasan's head.  That being said, why did the N.I.C.E. bother with Filostrato in the first place? Did they believe that they needed Filostrato's setup too? "
749,"Is the central relationship in ""Life in the Fast Lane"" coercive?","   He was a hard-headed man he was brutally handsome   And she was terminally pretty   She held him up and he held her for ransom   In the heart of the cold, cold city   He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude   They said he was ruthless said he was crude   What does the line ""She held him up and he held her for ransom"" refer to? Is this an enabler/enablee relationship (based on the ""She held him up"" phrase)? Or is this a coercive relationship of some kind (based on the ""he held her for ransom"" phrase)?  Is the double meaning here (""held him up"" like a robbery, and ""held her for ransom"" like kidnapping) deliberate? If so, is he basically presenting them as ""partners in crime"" here in one sense, or is there some other significance that I'm missing? "
750,Virginia Woolf's stance on literary canon,What was Virginia Woolf's take on literary canon? How does her book A Room of One's Own argue or imply that literary canon should be changed? 
751,What was the first novel written in the present tense?,"Although many novels are still written in the past tense, it seems that many other novels nowadays are written in the present tense. When did this begin?  What was the first novel written primarily in the present tense?  Some clarifications: I am referring to novels written mostly in the present tense, so a novel written in the past tense with a few present tense verbs sprinkled in does not count. I realize that ""novel"" does not necessarily have a clear definition; thus, there may be multiple answers.  I refer specifically to the English language. In this context, I would define the English language as beginning with ""Le Morte d'Arthur,"" which is also often considered the first English novel (which is why I begin here). Thus, I am talking specifically about English novels beginning with and following Le Morte d'Arthur. "
752,"What sort of ""relief of the poor"" is Thomas Deloney alluding to?","Thomas Deloney's Elizabethan novel Jack of Newberie is based on the life of the English clothier John Winchcombe or Jack of Newbury. In the second chapter, he marries for the second time. Deloney writes,     This wedding endured ten days, to the great reliefe of the poore that dwelt all about (...)   (If ten days seems long, remember Theseus words in Act V, scene 1 of A Midsummer Night's Dream: ""A fortnight hold we this solemnity, / In nightly revels and new jollity."")  What is Deloney alluding to? What sort of relief is he thinking of?  "
753,"Which of these sources is right about ""The Tempest""?","This is part of a quote by Ferdinand in the beginning of scene 1 of act 3 of ""The Tempest"":     But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,   Most busy, least when I do it.

Which is right and how should I interpret the sentence? "
754,What is a Cawdle?,"At the end of the first chapter of Thomas Deloney's Jack of Newbury, Jack's unnamed wife makes him a ""Cawdle"":     In the morning his wife rose betime, and merrily made him a Cawdle, and bringing it up to his bed side, asked him how he did?   (...)   And therefore forgiving each other all injuries past, having also tride one anothers patience, let us quench these burning coales of contention, with the sweete juyce of a faithfull kiss, and shaking hands, bequeath all our anger to the eating up of this Cawdle.   From the context, I assume a ""cawdle"" is some sort of dish. But what type of dish exactly?  When looking up ""cawdle"" on Wikipedia, I get the question, ""Did you mean castle?"" When looking up the term on Wiktionary, it gives me search results for ""candle"".  "
755,"Why is Seamus Heaney's ""The Cure at Troy"" so often quoted in political contexts?","The Cure at Troy is Seamus Heaney's translation and adaptation of Sophocles's Philoctetes set during the Trojan War. It seems to be very often quoted by politicians: most recently by British prime minister candidate Rory Stewart, but also according to Wikipedia:     The passage was quoted by Bill Clinton in his remarks to the community in Derry in 1995 during the Northern Ireland Peace Process, and by Joe Biden at the memorial service for Sean Collier, a campus police officer who was killed in the line of duty during the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings.   What is it about this work, or passage, that makes it so eminently quotable by politicians? Was Sophocles's play, or Heaney's translation of it, overtly political or clearly lending itself to such? Was it just that Bill Clinton knew the poem and others copied the idea from him?  I'm trying to approach this question from the point of view of literature, considering the play to see why it's used in this way, rather than considering the politicians to see why they used it. Hence posting here and not on Politics SE. "
756,"What is the figurative meaning of ""were you not borne at home""?","In the ""novel"" Thomas of Reading by Thomas Deloney, there is some sort of weaving or cloth making competition between the London weavers and a few clothiers from other towns (including one named Weasell). The relevant passage in Chapter VI goes as follows:     Alas poore fellows (quoth they [the London weavers]) your hearts are good, but your hands are ill.   Tush, the fault was in their legges (quoth another) pray you friend, were you not borne at home?   Why doe you aske (quote Weasell)?   Because (said he) the biggest place of your legge is next to your shoe.   What is the relevance of ""were you not borne at home?""? It appears to have some figurative meaning that I am not familiar with. "
757,Have any Elves explored Rhûn or the lands to the east?,"According to The Silmarillion and Tolkien's legendarium as a whole, the Elves first awoke in Cuiviénen, by a gulf in the Sea of Helcar. We learn that in The War of Wrath (Chapter 3, Quenta Silmarillion) and the times afterwards, many parts of the landscape were changed, and it is said that1 ""to Cuiviénen there is no returning"". Still, there is the possibility that some of the lands around it survived. It has even been hypothesized that the Sea of Rhûn is the remnant of the Sea of Helcar.  Are there any accounts of Elves (specifically, the Eldar, not the Avari) exploring Rhûn or the lands eastward, to try to find Cuiviénen and other ancestral lands? If so, were they successful?  1 Cuiviénen must have survived the War, as the Valar ""set a watch"" over it to protect the Quendi.    Meta-note:  I do understand that this is perhaps on the border of the site's scope, as I'm not necessarily asking about something that happened in The Silmarillion itself. However, I think this question is in the same vein as What are the Riddle Rules? or Is Judaism represented in the Narnia books? - questions about the universe - and is therefore on-topic. Feedback, though - including about downvotes or details specific to the book which I could add - is very much appreciated, as always. "
758,How much of a role does authorial intent play in modern academic literary analysis?,"In this question, I asked about how meaning gets into a work if not intended by the author. In researching that question, I ran across mention of ""authorial intent"". In reading about it, I learned that it went through phases of being very important to analysists and other phases where it did not matter at all. In modern academic literary analysis, how much of a role does it play? Is it only to backup previously made claims or does it ever form the center of fundamental arguments? "
759,Why didn't Bilbo put the ring on immediately?,"When Bilbo falls into Gollum's cave in The Hobbit and he finds the ring on the ground, why doesn't he immediately put it on? Is there any textual evidence suggesting he was scared or nervous of putting it on or did Tolkien make Bilbo not put the ring on so he could have his whole conversation/introduction with Gollum? "
760,"How was ""A Passage to India"" received in Britain and India?","E. M. Forster's A Passage to India was published in 1924, in the decade after the Indian independence movement really started to gather steam. Forster incorporated this into his novel, showing the strong emotions raised within the British and the Indian communities after an Indian Muslim is arrested for assaulting a British schoolmistress. What did the British and Indians of the time make of this novel? Were there any articles written about this novel, or books reporting on it? I've tried Googling for contemporary reviews, but I just end up with reviews of the movie, made in 1984, long after India became independent in 1947. "
761,What did Wodehouse say about writing in the first-person?,"P. G. Wodehouse is known as a consumate stylist, and a lot is known about how he plotted and wrote his novels. Did he ever say anything about his writing in the first person? I'm particularly curious about how he wrote ""as"" Bertie Wooster, who has a very distinctive writing style that differs in some ways from Wodehouse's own. Has he (or his biographers) written anything about how he developed Bertie's ""voice"" and then sustained it consistently across ten novels and over thirty short stories over 59 years? "
762,"Is Hamlet correct when he says ""it is an honest ghost""?",The Ghost in Hamlet claims to be Hamlet's father's spirit released from Purgatory.  Is it possible that the Ghost is lying?  Has it been sent from Hell to stir up mischief in Elsinore?  (The play does end with a body count of eight.) 
763,"Can I read the second book of ""In Search of Lost Time"" out of order if I can't find a good translation?","I want to read the In Search of Lost Time series out of order, because there is no good translation of the second book in my language.  Is it necessary to read the book series in order? Are they related? Do I miss anything if I read these books out of order? "
764,What occult references caused The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to be banned in the Soviet Union?,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fascination with spiritualism and the occult is well known. However, I was surprised to find out that his short stories collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was banned in the former Soviet Union, for ""occultism"":      Sherlock Holmes became hugely popular in the former Soviet Union, despite one short story collection, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, being banned in 1929 for supposed occultism.       ""Moscow honours legendary Holmes"", published: 2007/04/30 13:37:35 GMT, BBC NEWS -    [website]Were there specific references to the occult in the stories that irked the Soviet censors? Or was the collection banned only because its author was known to occasionally dabble in the occult? "
765,Identify a book about a boy who has hypnotic powers,"I remember this book fairly well. I'll try to provide what I remember about all points.  Cover  The cover was predominantly blue, with spirals across the whole thing. I think it had a person on it.  Author  It was written by one of the authors of the original the-39-clues series, so either    rick-riordan Gordan Korman Peter Lerangis Jude Watson Patrick Carman Linda Sue Park margaret-peterson-haddix   Publication date  It was fairly recent, so probably somewhere between 2009-2015.  Title  It was two words, one of which might have been 'A' or 'The'.  Story  There was a boy, who has discovered that he has hypnotic powers. He hypnotizes a hypnotist, which leads to him being accepted into an institute for researching hypnotism. I think the name of the institute started with a 'S'?  One day he's walking, and meets a guy who's also a hypnotizer (they called it bending I think). He's in charge of an organization of benders, who have all committed crimes with their powers, who are meeting in a restaurant or something. This guy tells him not to trust the guy who's in charge of the institute.  The main character (it's possible his name started with either Q, W, V, X, or J) goes back to the institute, where the guy in charge records him hypnotizing to vote for someone in an election, and then creates a virus that will go through the computers and hypnotize people. Our main character calls up the guy who he met and tells him that the bad guy rigged the election.  The guy comes to his house and discovers that main character's parents have been hypnotized to commit suicide if the main character tries to stop the bad guy, and they have to stop them from doing that.  So then the guy who he met (tree something?) gets his band of benders and goes to stop the rigging. The main character hypnotizes the guy who the bad guy has under control to drop out of the race. (I think that the guy who was going to be elected had the name of one of the main characters of the-shadow-children, but I'm not sure.)  In revenge, the bad guy hypnotizes the main character to jump off a roof or something, and they have to stop him. "
766,What is the meaning of the blue X in the Three Attic Whalestoe Letters in House of Leaves?,"In the middle of Appendix E of House of Leaves, ""The Three Attic Whalestoe Letters"", a mysterious blue ""X"" appears through the middle of an ""e"" on the page.  Click to view the whole of page 625 in context:        I've never actually figured this part of House of Leaves out. The Whalestoe Letters still remain something of a mystery to me. It's wholly possible that this is just a part of her insanity, but I'm inclined to think there's something internally metatextual about this, given the fact similar metatextual indicators appear elsewhere in the book, such as the airway indicators.  It also happens to be printed in the same shade of blue that ""house"" is, but I'm not really sure what to make of that.  Does anyone know what this blue X is supposed to connect with elsewhere in the book? Is it just a random stray mark that seems to have mysteriously placed itself dead smack in the middle of the page? What are leading theories on what I should make of this? "
767,What is meant by the reference to theology in The Death of The Author?,"I'm looking to clarify how I should interpret the following passage from The Death of The Author by Roland Barthes:     We know that a text does not consist of a line of words, releasing   a single ""theological"" meaning (the ""message"" of the Author-God),   but is a space of many dimensions, in which are wedded   and contested various kinds of writing, no one of which is   original: the text is a tissue of citations, resulting from the   thousand sources of culture.    What is meant by this passage from The Death of The Author and its reference to theology? Is he referring to a religious belief? My initial thought is that he is literally referencing a god. What do other people think? "
768,Why does Modesta Gómez demand payment from the indigenous girl?,"In Rosario Castellanos's short story ""Modesta Gómez,"" we see how a girl named Modesta with bright dreams for the future has them destroyed first by a wealthy family and then by her working-class husband.  Destitute and desperate, she becomes an ""ambusher"" (atajadora), someone who preys on a lower class – the ""Indians"".  These women attack the darker-skinned indigenous people on their way to market, beat them until they give up their goods, and then, as if to justify themselves, hand over a few coins as ""payment.""   Racial dynamics certainly are a key theme in the story, but normally when I think of racism, I think of unfairly discriminating against someone because of their skin color, or taking advantage of someone's low social standing for one's own gain.  Modesta Gómez's actions can certainly be characterized that way, but she goes even further – as she is assaulting an young indigenous woman in order to take her wool blanket, she yells:     You damn Indian!  Now you're going to pay me for everything!      ¡India desgraciada, me lo tenés que pagar todo junto!   I don't understand why Modesta is demanding payment – recompense? – from the girl.  Nowhere in the story do indigenous people persecute her in any way.  Yet it seems as if she is here blaming them for the crimes perpetuated against her by the wealthy and middle class.  Given that this line marks the climax of the story, I'm sure it's essential to the author's point.  Why does Rosario Castellanos have her protagonist demanding payment from the ""Indian"" girl?    English quotation from The Mexico Reader (2002), 552.  Spanish from Ciudad Real. "
769,What's the defining difference between a fairy tale and a fable?,"In Is a moral lesson a requirement for fairy tales?, the commenting crowd has pressed for clear distinguishment between whether fables or fairy tales are being discussed.  How do fables and fairy tales differ? What are their distinguishing features, and how will I know whether the story I am reading may be one or the other? "
770,"Is there a central theme in I, Robot?","In the book I, Robot by Isaac Asimov, the author wrote several short stories, all usually revolving about robots of different types.  It's possible to interpret the short stories with many different themes.  Is there a central theme that connects all of the short stories in the book?  If so, what is it? "
771,"How does a book become ""an American classic""?","It seems that, in passing, some books are referred to as ""an American classic,"" or ""one of the great American classics."" This seems like it's a whole subsection of what counts as ""classic literature.""  Oddly, while infrequently, certain books are debated, or people discuss which new book is going to be canonized as the next Great American Book, most of the books that we describe as ""classics"" are ones that nobody would bother to refute. Everyone seems to agree, or assume, that they are. Stuff like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, or The Jungle, or For Whom the Bell Tolls, or 1984, or Of Mice and Men, or The Great Gatsby...   Then we have the American classic authors, some of whom appear in that list: Mark Twain, Hemingway, Steinbeck, Fitzgerald...  Nobody disputes that these are ""classics"". But, how did they get labeled that way? Does somebody decide which books are classics and which aren't? Is there a process for canonization of the body of classical literature that I'm just not aware of?  If there isn't, then how did this terminology come about, and why is it so consistent everywhere you look in America?  "
772,"What is the ""heap of broken images"" in The Waste Land?","In T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land (which you can read online), T. S. Eliot claims that someone (probably either humankind or the reader) only knows ""a heap of broken images"".     What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow   Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,   You cannot say, or guess, for you know only   A  heap of broken images, where the sun beats,   And the dead tree gives no shelter,  the cricket no relief,   What is the ""heap of broken images""? What does it mean/represent? "
773,What does 'Gilead' mean in The Raven?,"Poe's poem The Raven contains the following words in the fifteenth stanza:     [...] tell me truly, I implore—   Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!""   What does 'Gilead' mean here? I've looked it up on the internet, but apparently the only places known as Gilead are real-life places in the Middle East - perhaps with some religious significance, but not literally Paradise. Why, then, does the narrator ask about ""balm in Gilead""? What is the significance of this question put to the raven? "
774,"What does ""The Edge of Doom"" mean?","The following stanza is from Robert Frost's Into My Own:     One of my wishes is that those dark trees,       So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,       Were not, as ’twere, the merest mask of gloom,       But stretched away unto the edge of doom.   (Emphasis mine.)  I am guessing that the ""edge of doom"" is referring to the end of time -- as in, The trees are stretching into the end of time and space. Is this reading correct? Where does the phrase the ""edge of doom"" come from? At first when I read it, I thought that the ""edge of doom"" was a dark reference (similar to ""mask of gloom""), but it seems to be closer to a wedding vow, such as ""Our marriage will last unto the edge of doom"". "
775,Is there any symbolism in Casey at the Bat?,Casey at the Bat is one of my all-time favorite poems.  I always thought it was just about baseball.  But is it?  Is there a metaphor or an allegory hidden somewhere in the last inning of a baseball game? 
776,"What are the ""dark Satanic mills"" in Blake's Jerusalem?","The short poem Jerusalem by William Blake - not to be confused with his much longer epic poem of the same title; I'm talking about the ""did those feet in ancient times"" one - contains the following lines:     And did the Countenance Divine,   Shine forth upon our clouded hills?   And was Jerusalem builded here,   Among these dark Satanic Mills?   What are the ""dark Satanic Mills""?  The obvious, and most literal, interpretation would be that they're meant to be the industrial mills which were appearing all over England around the time Blake wrote this poem, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. But I've heard other theories, such as that they're meant to represent churches (Blake was a ""radical Christian"" who had little time for the established church) or even the academic institutions of Oxford and Cambridge. I'm interested in seeing evidence for different interpretations here. "
777,Do we know what prompted Orwell to write 1984?,"I just read through Orwell's short essay, What is Fascism? In it, Orwell defines fascism (or doesn't) with two sentences:     Why, then, cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one — not yet, anyway. To say why would take too long, but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves, nor the Conservatives, nor Socialists of any colour, are willing to make.   This essay was published in 1944. So we know that issues of modern politics, particularly those surrounding the state of the world at the time of WWII, seems to have (unsurprisingly) been on Orwell's mind for some time before he wrote the book. 1984 was published in 1949, five years after the writing of this essay.  Did Orwell ever talk about what, specifically, motivated him to go from pondering on fascism to writing the actual book? "
778,"What is the argument for Kuni being a worthy leader, when all others fail?","The Grace of Kings is deeply concerned with the mechanics of power - who has it; how to get it; how to keep it; what price you pay for it.  Through its course, the book surveys a great many rulers and would-be rulers. In each case, the book portrays power as a corrupting force, that turns rulers to paths of indulgence and self-preservation -- which sooner or later devastate the society being ruled, destroying the ruler as well. The book also points out that those most drawn to power are often the ones who will wield it least wisely.  To all this, Kuni is an exception. His wisdom in ruling seems smooth and unquestioned. This is apparent at every point - from the complete lack of repercussions for the looting of Pan, under his command (compare to the harsh judgement of Mata's character we're supposed to accept, when he is forced to make human sacrifice to Tazu); all the way to the utopian portrayal of the kingdoms united under his rule:     The beggar's face fell at this news. ""Then it is even more generous of you to share food with a stranger. You're certain your parents will not mind?""      The boy laughed. ""There's no need to worry. King Kuni and Prime Minister Yelu ordered grain to be shipped from Gefica, and all of us have plenty to eat.      ""You like the king then? Even though he is not from Xana?""      ""We no longer speak of Xana,"" said the boy.      ""But that's your country!""      The boy shook his head. ""This is Rui, an Island of Dara.""   What is it that makes Kuni so exceptional? Why is he worthy and successful, when all the others are not? What is it that makes him able to navigate the minefield of rebellion, leadership, and power, without succumbing to all the same traps that every other leader in the book does? "
779,"In ""The Library of Babel"" is the ""cyclical book"" really God?","In the second paragraph of The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, the narrator says,     This cyclical book is god.   However, later in the story he says,     On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god.    In this second quote is he referring to the cyclical book in his reference to god or is he referring to the concept? If he is referring to the concept, is the cyclical book really God? "
780,"Why does Ruth breastfeed Milkman, and why is this considered scandelous?","I'm reading Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison for a class, and I'm confused by this.  An important part of Milkman's life story is that his mother (Ruth) breastfed him later than normal. It's how he got his name:     She felt him. His restraint, his courtesy, his indifference, all of which pushed her into fantasy. She had the distinct impression that his lips were pulling from her a thread of light. It was as though she were a cauldron issuing spinning gold. Like the miller's daughter--the one who sat at night in a straw-filled room, thrilled with the secret power Rumpelstiltskin had given her: to see golden thread stream from her very own shuttle. And that was the other part of her pleasure, a pleasure she hated to give up. So when Freddie the janitor, who liked to pretend he was a friend of the family and not just their flunky as well as their tenant, brought his rent to the doctor's house late one day and looked in the window past the evergreen, the terror that sprang to Ruth's eyes came from the quick realization that she was to lose fully half of what made her daily life bearable. Freddie, however, interpreted her look as simple shame, but that didn't stop him from grinning.   ...     “I be damn, Miss Rufie. When the last time I seen that? I don't even know the last time I seen that. I mean, ain't nothing wrong with it. I mean, old folks swear by it. It's just, you know, you don't see it up here much….” But his eyes were on the boy. Appreciative eyes that communicated some complicity she was excluded from. Freddie looked the boy up and down, taking in the steady but secretive eyes and the startling contrast between Ruth's lemony skin and the boy's black skin. “Used to be a lot of womenfolk nurse they kids a long time down South. Lot of 'em. But you don't see it much no more. I knew a family--the mother wasn't too quick, though--nursed hers till the boy, I reckon, was near 'bout thirteen. But that's a bit much, ain't it?” All the time he chattered, he rubbed his chin and looked at the boy. Finally he stopped, and gave a long low chuckle. He'd found the phrase he'd been searching for. “A milkman. That's what you got here, Miss Rufie. A natural milkman if ever I seen one. Look out, womens. Here he come. Huh!”   Later in Milkman's life, he is upset about this, but Ruth defends herself:     “You nursed me.”      “Yes.”      “Until I was…old. Too old.”      Ruth turned toward her son. She lifted her head and looked deep into his eyes. “And I also prayed for you. Every single night and every single day. On my knees. Now you tell me. What harm did I do you on my knees?”   I'm confused about:   Why does Ruth breastfeed Milkman? Why is this a scandal?  "
781,What image was in the Autostereogram?,"In a part of The Book of Mythicality by Rhett and Link, in the chapter about picking a fight (I believe), there's a couple of pages dedicated to an Autostereogram.  I've never been very good at these and I was unable to see the image.  What was the image?  Why was this particular image chosen? "
782,Did Ruth sleep with her father?,"I'm reading Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, and I'm also confused by this question. Malcom, Ruth's wife, claims that Ruth had sex with her dead father:     “In the bed,” he said, and stopped for so long Milkman was not sure he was going to continue. “In the bed. That's where she was when I opened the door. Laying next to him. Naked as a yard dog, kissing him. Him dead and white and puffy and skinny, and she had his fingers in her mouth.   Ruth claims that she didn't:     Milkman leaned his head against the cold handbar that was attached to the seat in front of him. He held it there, letting its chill circle his head. Then he turned to his mother. “Were you father when he was dead? Naked?”      “No. But I did kneel there in my slip at his bedside and kiss his beautiful fingers. They were the only part of him that wasn't…”   Who is right? "
783,"Book about ""lesser"" and ""greater"" magic, with main protagonist who learns both?","Can you identify this book? Here's what I remember of it...  A civilization had their home world ravaged by some kind of disaster.  Using ""Greater"" magic they made a portal to another world.  The story is about this civilization a long time after this disaster and there are two types of magic, ""Lesser"" and ""Greater"". Lesser magic is parlor tricks and small scale magic, whilst greater magic is capable of controlling the elements.  The main protagonist pursued a lesser mage and convinced the mage to teach him.  Sometime after he learned lesser magic, mages that study greater magic kidnap him after learning that he has the potential to learn greater magic (Greater magic is more rare than lesser).  The boy is taught how to use greater magic in a tower where he is unable to speak and is put through a harsh training that almost erases all aspects of what he learned as a lesser mage.  One thing that i remember about greater magic is their capacity to ""teleport""; every location that a mage wishes to go to must have a mural on the ground that the mage must go and memorize in order to return there.  I also remember something about an arena where the main protagonist (after learning both lesser and greater magic) goes to. In the arena is an old friend of his (?), and that person is fighting to the death against others. The main protagonist gets mad and uses his abilities as a mage to wreck the arena and to threaten/terrify the nobility that were amusing themselves using the arena.  At the end the main protagonist ends up making a giant school and proceeds to teach both lesser and greater magic in order to train students and make magic less ""taboo"" and rare.  Please tell me if anyone knows a story/series that fits this description and if you need more details I may be able to help. It has been a while since I read this book though so some details might be messed up. "
784,What does Jack do again in the Steely Dan song?,"""Do it again"" by Steely Dan starts with the following verse:     In the mornin' you go gunnin' for the man who stole your water   And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border   And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet   But the hangman isn't hangin' and they put you on the street   The following chorus is repeated after each of the three verses:     You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round   You go back, Jack, do it again   Second verse:     When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend   In a room with your two timer, and you're sure you're near the end   Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow   All the time you know she's smilin'; you'll be on your knees tomorrow   Finally, the third verse:     Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gamblin' man;   Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand   Your black cards can make you money so you hide them when you're able   In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table   What, exactly, is ""it""? What does Jack do again? Is it the thing named in the previous verse - i.e. the guy kills again after he gets off for the first murder, continues to be in relationships with women he knows are bad for him, and continues to gamble after swearing it off? "
785,"Are gender roles gone in the future in ""The Story of the Amulet"" by E. Nesbit?","When the kids go into the future in The Story of the Amulet, it looks like gender roles have perhaps disappeared. Some of the relevant quotes:     There was no one in the room, but in the next gallery, where the Assyrian things are and still were, they found a kind, stout man in a loose, blue gown, and stockinged legs.   The Story of the Amulet, chapter 12   Now, I may be interpreting this incorrectly, but in my experience a 'gown' is usually a type of dress, with the exception of a 'dressing-gown', which is more like a bathrobe. This could be incorrect, as I'm a modern American and the book is rather old and British.   More telling is this quote:     'Why, we're all working people,' said the lady; 'at least my husband's a carpenter.'      'Good gracious!' said Anthea; 'but you're a lady!'      'Ah,' said the lady, 'that quaint old word! Well, my husband will enjoy a talk with you...   The Story of the Amulet, chapter 12   This seems rather clearer:' lady'is a 'quaint old word', and both men and women work.   In addition, this young boy seems to be wearing a dress in this illustration:    Am I interpreting this correctly? Have gender roles disappeared in this future? "
786,"What does ""Maybe it's a Big Horse I'm Morporkian"" mean?","In Terry Pratchett's book Raising Steam, there is an explanation of the phrase ""Have seen the big horse"" where the author uses the sentence ""Maybe it's a Big Horse I'm Morporkian"". What exactly does this sentence mean? Can somebody explain it for me? "
787,"Why does pressure ""put people on streets""?","   Pressure pushing down on me   Pressing down on you no man ask for   Under pressure that brings a building down   Splits a family in two   Puts people on streets   In what sense does pressure ""put people on streets"", and why does it do that? Is this referring to ""the man on the street"" and implying that people are either going about the ""daily grind"" because of pressure, or that people are about to ""crack"" under the pressure of the daily grind?  The later line     Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking   seems to suggest the latter interpretation.  Or is there a completely different interpretation entirely? "
788,"How is the narrator ""learning to fly"" without wings?","The chorus to Learning to Fly by Tom Petty is as follows:     I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings   Coming down is the hardest thing   In what sense is the narrator ""learning to fly"" without wings?

789,"Why is the narrator ""free falling""?","Why is the narrator of ""Free fallin'"" by Tom Petty free falling?     Yeah I'm free, free fallin'   Why is the narrator ""free falling""?  Does ""free falling"" imply some form of destructive freedom or loss of control? "
790,Why the rubbish in Samuel Beckett's play Breath?,"Samuel Beckett's play Breath is thirty-five seconds long and consists of two cries. The script is online here.  Why does the script specify that:        Faint light on stage littered with miscellaneous rubbish.  Hold for about five seconds.      and      Rubbish.  No verticals, all scattered and lying.   What's the point of the rubbish? How does it relate the rest of the play? "
791,Retelling of Odysseus story with humour and anachronisms (audiobook),"I heard this in audio form, probably on a cassette or maybe CD, borrowed from a public library in England in the early noughties (2001-2006). I don't know how old it was, or whether or not it was an audio adaptation of a published novel. Essentially it was a version of the Iliad (I don't think it also included the Odyssey, but I'm not certain) retold for a younger modern audience.   It began with Odysseus as a young boy being attacked by a wild boar and rescued by his grandfather, who'd left the court after behaviour ""not fitting for a member of the royal family, eh?"" (I remember this phrase), and who teaches the young Odysseus the value of cunning. Later on, a huge crowd of princes are pressed together for some occasion - possibly the wedding of Helen and Menelaus, or a competition for Helen's hand? Odysseus is too small to push his way to the front, but he tricks Big Ajax into going somewhere else so that he can take his place. When Big Ajax realises he's been tricked, a fight breaks out. Agamemnon breaks it up and shouts that ""this isn't a football match"". When Odysseus pretends to be mad in order not to have to join the Trojan War, he shouts ""Plough the field! Plough the field! Plough the field!"" and ""Sow the seed! Sow the seed! Sow the seed!"" These lines I remember very clearly. During the voyage to Troy, Philoctetes is showing off his archery skill, shooting burning arrows off the ship and shouting things like, ""This one's for Hector! This one's for Paris! This one's for - AAAARGH!"" as he shoots the arrow into his foot. ""Who's AAAARGH?"" someone else inquires. ""Odysseus jogged me!"" Philoctetes yells. Later, when the smell of his gangrenous foot becomes unbearable, Odysseus is the one who tricks him into being stranded on Lemnos (""Oh, Lemnos! I thought it was Limnos! My mistake."")   I hope these details, and the specific quotes, will be enough for someone to identify this among the many Iliad retellings that have been published in the last few thousand years. "
792,Why doesn't Hamlet like improvisation?,"In Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Hamlet has a famous monologue about how to properly perform a play. During one portion of the monologue, he has some harsh words for people who improvise:     O, reform it altogether. And let those that play       your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;       for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to       set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh       too; though, in the mean time, some necessary       question of the play be then to be considered:       that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition       in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.   What's so bad about improvising? Does this passage reflect Shakespeare's view on the issue? "
793,Why is Richard a hunchback in Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Richard III?,"I'm watching Kevin Spacey's production of Shakespeare's Richard III.

So... why is Richard a hunchback? "
794,"Why would Image Comics publish ""Sunstone"", after it was released as a webcomic?","Stjepan Sejic's Sunstone was first published as a webcomic on his DeviantArt account (and is still available there), as was his Death Vigil. Linda Sejic's Blood Stain is published on her DeviantArt first, before being published by Image Comics.  Question is - why? Why would Image Comics publish something that has already been read by a lot of people online? Even if there are people who haven't read it, it's entirely possible they'll go to the artist's website and read the chapters there (legally and with the artist's blessing), instead of buying the published book (of course, the published version is more polished, but it's still the same).  Are those kind of (webcomic to print) comics profitable for publishing houses? (I only know of Image Comics doing this) Or is there some other motivation? "
795,Why is Richard portrayed without a hunchback in the 1955 Laurence Olivier adaptation of Richard III?,"If we go by the text of Shakespeare's Richard III, Richard has a hunchback. In Act I, scene 3, line 246, Queen Margaret describes Richard as a ""poisonous bunch-back'd toad."" And in act IV, scene 4, line 81 Queen Elizabeth also describes Richard as ""that foul bunch-back'd toad.""  However, in the 1955 Laurence Olivier adaptation of Richard III, it doesn't look like Laurence Olivier's character has a hunchback. There's a subtle padding around the back that makes Richard look slightly slouched, but it's very unemphasized compared to, say, the Kevin Spacey adaptation.  Why was this detail changed? Does this change make sense in the context of the themes of the play and what we know about the character of Richard III? "
796,What are the parallels between The Odyssey and The Time Traveler's Wife?,"Author Audrey Niffenegger chose to include an excerpt from The Odyssey at the end of her debut novel The Time Traveler's Wife:     Now from his breast into his eyes the ache   Of longing mounted, and he wept at last,   His dear wife, clear and faithful, in his arms,   Longed for   As the sunwarmed earth is longed for by a swimmer   Spent in rough water where his ship went down   Under Poseidon's blows, gale winds and tons of sea.   Few men can keep alive through a big surf   To crawl, clotted with brine, on kindly beaches   In joy, in joy, knowing the abyss behind:   and so she too rejoiced, her gaze upon her husband,   her white arms round him pressed as though forever.     On the surface, there is a straightforward comparison between the two works. Both include couples whose relationship can be characterized by the woman waiting faithfully for her male partner while he goes off on (largely unwanted) adventures.  Indeed, the female character makes this comparison herself during the novel. It strikes me that an author would be unlikely to go to the lengths of including an excerpt — and have a character draw attention to it — to illustrate something that obvious. Why was this particular passage chosen? Are there any deeper thematic and literary connections between the two works? "
797,What does it mean when spaces blow in Crow's ear cluelessly?,"In ""Crow Hears Fate Knock On The Door"", The lines ending the second part of the song are:     He walked, he walked        Letting the translucent starry spaces      Blow in his ear cluelessly   I'm trying to understand what did Hughes possibly mean in the last line:   What does it mean to blow ""cluelessly""? What could it be that the spaces are clueless about, unaware of?   Moreover, in the preceding lines, Crow is the one who seems clueless:     ""He plucked grass-heads [...] Waiting for first instructions.""       ""He found a dead mole [...] stared at the goblets, feeling helpless""   So the fact that after those line the ""spaces"" are depicted as ""clueless"" seems kind of off this song theme. "
798,"Is the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt a joke, or is it serious?","I'm watching two adaptations of Romeo and Juliet that take two different approaches to the play: Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film Romeo + Juliet and Zeffirelli's 1968 film Romeo and Juliet. There are some obvious differences between the two: one is set in 14th century Italy, and the other is set in the modern day. But there are some subtler differences between the two adaptations. In particular, I'm thinking of the very different approaches the two films take towards the fight scene between Mercutio and Tybalt, and Tybalt's death. I found clips of both scenes on Youtube: here's the 1996 version of the scene, and here's the 1968 version.  In the 1968 version, the fight is treated as some sort of extended joke. Mercutio and Tybalt do all sorts of comedic routines with their swords, all the characters are laughing (including Mercutio, Tybalt, and the extras), and it appears to be an accident that Tybalt kills Mercutio, judging by Tybalt's shocked expression. Meanwhile, in the 1996 version, the characters appear to be very angry. They're clearly trying to kill each other, and the ominous music adds to this feeling.  What justifies the differences in approaches here? Which portrayal goes better with what we know about the characters and the themes of the play? "
799,"In Cupid and Psyche, why does Cupid hide himself from Psyche?","In the myth, Cupid only comes to Psyche in the dark, so she doesn't know who he is or what he looks like.  What's Cupid's motivation for hiding his identity? Was he planning to do that indefinitely if Psyche hadn't disobeyed his order and took a peek at his face?  "
800,"Was Frankenstein was influenced by revolution, the pace of technological change and debates over racial equality?","The New Yorker has written a fantastic piece on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.   The following commentator writes:     Torn by revolution, gasping at the quick pace of technological change, divided by debates over racial equality, early 19th Century Europe produces a crop of batshit-crazy writers, and Mary Shelley. She writes a book that treats on themes of parenthood, which is completely misunderstood for two centuries.   I assume that the 'revolution' is the Industrial Revolution - because there isn't a political revolution at that time I can pin down.   My question is: Is there evidence to suggest that Frankenstein was influenced by revolution, the pace of technological change and debates over racial equality? "
801,How unreliable is the narrator in The Repairer of Reputations?,"Spoilers abound in this question about this sci-fi horror short, so you might want to read it at Project Gutenberg first.       The narrator of this story is eventually revealed to be insane. It is strongly implied that he is delusional, wearing a cheap metal circlet which he believes to be a crown. This calls into question the validity of much of his tale of Imperial conquest and ""suicide booths"".    However, there are two key points during the tale when things the narrator believes appear to be true.      First, he tells Hawberk that Wilde knows where to find a rare and valuable piece of armour. Second, it is implied that Wilde is quite correct to believe that Hawberk is a secret descendent of the ""Marquis of Avonshire"".    The first of these, in particular, would seem to me to suggest that the tale should be taken at face value, depriving it of much of its mystery, impact and value.  Is this a deliberate clue left by the author as to the narrator's reliability, and if so, why is it there? Or is there another way of interpreting this information which leaves the mystery intact? What other clues can we glean from the text about the truth of the narrator's tale? "
802,"What is the meaning of Blake's poem ""The Sick Rose""?","William Blake's very short poem ""The Sick Rose"", from his Songs of Innocence and of Experience, runs as follows:     O rose, thou art sick!      The invisible worm,   That flies in the night,      In the howling storm,      Has found out thy bed      Of crimson joy,   And his dark secret love      Does thy life destroy.   There's a surface meaning here about a rose being destroyed by parasites in the flowerbed (although I don't know what kind of worms ""fl[y] in the night, In the howling storm"" - does this line too have deeper significance, beyond specifying some particular members of the animal kingdom?) But the second verse at least has strong sexual undertones: the predator that destroys life with ""his dark secret love"" in ""thy bed [of] joy"" sounds a lot like a rapist or an incubus. I'm not sure what the rose symbolises in this reading of the poem though.  In short: what does this poem really mean? I feel like I'm seeing half of the direct surface reading and half of the deeper hidden meaning, but not fully grasping either of them. "
803,Richardson's Pamela: Letters addressed only to her mother,"I'm trying to write a critical commentary for the passage near the beginning of Pamela (letter XV) where she has her first 'Fit'. I've been trying to search for secondary criticism that discusses the instances where Pamela addresses letters only to her mother. Is there a reason she does this? It is her father who responds to the letters, so why would she set out to write just to her mother on certain occasions. I can't seem to find a pattern, can anyone else? "
804,"Why did ""the human race became a small committee surrounded by affectionate animals"" for Sartre in the Words?","What is Sartre's metaphor meaning in the Words when saying :     ""The  human race  became  a  small  committee  surrounded  by affectionate  animals.""   The context is when he begins to become familiar with all the writers of his grandfather's library. He tells us about his child perception of their duties : they had to write masterpieces as far as they were writers. Why should anyone praise them as far as they are only doing their duties, he asks as a child. As a narrator, now an adult, he acknowledges he got it all wrong about them. Are the small comitee the writers and the commoners the affectionate animals ?  He uses lots of references in this part of the book. He also talks about Charles V      when  I  was  told  that  Charles  V  had  picked  up Titian's  brush,  I  was  not  at  all surprised. What of  it ?  That  was  what  princes  were  made  for.   Which I don't get neither ...  "
805,Why was Francisco d'Anconia amused by Ellis Wyatt's imminent demise?,"At one point, Dagny Taggart confronts Francisco d'Anconia about what she believed to be his corruption. As part of that, they had the following exchange:     ""Do you... know Ellis Wyatt?""   ""Sure.""   ""Do you know what this might do to him?""   ""Yes. He's the one who's going to be wiped out next.   ""Do you... find that... amusing?""   ""Much more amusing than the ruin of the Mexican planners.""   Obviously, Francisco knew that Ellis Wyatt would presumably join the Strike (which he did). With that said, though, in what sense did he consider this amusing? "
806,"What does 'gonna send a flood' mean in ""This Is Me""?","I was recently listening to the One Voice Children's Choir's cover of ""This Is Me"" by Keala Settle:  [website]Part of the chorus goes like this:     When the sharpest words wanna cut me down   I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out   I am brave, I am bruised   I am who I'm meant to be, this is me   Send a flood of... what? What does 'I'm gonna send a flood' mean? "
807,"What does ""in the arms of Murphy"" mean?","From E. Nesbit's The Enchanted Castle, Chapter V, when Gerald is telling the policeman Johnson about the burglary he witnessed:     ""Was it you give the warning, and they sent for the police?"" Johnson was leaning eagerly forward, a hand on each knee.      ""Yes, that was me. You can let them think it was you, if you like. You were off duty, weren't you?""      ""I was,"" said Johnson, ""in the arms of Murphy --""      ""Well, the police didn't come quick enough. But I was there - a lonely detective. And I followed them.""      -- (text available on Google Books and Project Gutenberg)   What does he mean, ""in the arms of Murphy""? There's no character called Murphy in the book, as far as I remember, and it hardly seems likely to refer to Johnson's lover. I've tried searching for the phrase on the internet, but all I found was pubs called Murphy's Arms and coats of arms of families called Murphy. "
808,Consular Operations in Robert Ludlum’s books,"When reading “Bourne Identity”, closer to the end of the book an agency called  Consular Operations is introduced. Since I had never heard of such thing, I’ve searched, and discovered that it is likely fictional: “consular operations” as a phrase is relatively common terminology amidst diplomatic/foreign relations types, but no such agency appear to exist within or without U.S. Department of State. During my search I have also found that the agency appears more prominently throughout Ludlum’s works, such as in “Janson Directive” (soon to be a major motion picture).  Even if it is fictional, what could be Ludlum’s inspiration for such an agency? Are there historical examples of U.S. or other countries’ foreign ministries running their own undercover intelligence or special operations, and not merely providing diplomatic cover for their respective intelligence and CI agencies, such as CIA, GRU, MI-6 etc.?  As a side question, while looking it up I’ve discovered that Shadowrun role-playing universe also has Consular Operations agency. Given that Shadowrun was introduced in 1989, at the height of Ludlum’s fame, is it fair to say that it is a direct reference, or merely a coincidence? "
809,A lifetime of happiness: why could no man bear it? Why hell on earth?,"Primary Source: George Bernard Shaw. Man and Superman (1903), Act 1. Secondary Source: What's It All About? p. 104 Bottom.     [...] Finally, we surely have to accept that    uninterrupted happiness is beyond us. When George Bernard Shaw    wrote, 'But a lifetime of happiness! No man could bear it: it would    be hell on earth,' he was exaggerating the truth that unrelenting    happiness is not a natural or even healthy condition for human    beings.    Why does Tanner allege the intolerability of eternal happiness? Did Shaw believe this too?  "
810,"What is the pun in Kipling's poem ""The Three-Decker""?","In the poem The Three-Decker, by Rudyard Kipling, there is one line where the meter is slightly different from all the other lines. I Googled that line, not expecting to find anything, and Google Books came up with this from the magazine The Academy (1896).      The very last literary device (or vice) which we should expect to find Mr. Kipling using is the pun. Yet he is ever a dealer in surprises, and here in that delightful piece of fancy ""The Three-Decker"" (one of the four literary ballads in The Seven Seas), we came upon this distressing stanza:      By ways no Gaze could follow, a course unspoiled of Cook,   Per Fancy, fleetest in man, our titled berths we took   With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed,   And a Church of England parson, for the Islands of the Blest.""       The italics, we admit, are our own. We employ them in the hope   that Mr. Kipling may see his error emphasised, and repent.   So that answered my question about the discrepancy in the meter: Kipling did it for the sake of the pun.   But what is the pun? "
811,Is there any significance to Blake's choice of the name Lyca?,"The twinned poems ""The Little Girl Lost"" and ""The Little Girl Found"" from William Blake's Songs of Experience (available to read online) are about a little girl called Lyca who gets lost from her parents and ""seek[s] her Maker"" in the desert among the wild beasts, while her parents seek her and eventually meet God (?), who takes them to find her with the beasts ""In [his] palace"".  Is there any significance to the name Lyca? Given the religious themes in a lot of Blake's poetry, I suspect these poems may tell a version of some biblical story, or at least have some deeper meaning than a direct description of events. Does ""Lyca"" refer to some other character? "
812,Which Chesterton story is alluded in Childhood's End?,"In Arthur Clarke's Childhood's End, there is a small allusion to a Chesterton story when the characters Stormgreen and Van Ryberg discuss their theories about the nature of the Overlords (Chap. 4):     ""I admit, "" said van Ryberg, ""that some of my theories haven't been very    successful . But tell me what you think of this one. ""       ""Must I?"" sighed Stormgren.       Pieter didn't seem to notice.       ""It isn 't really my idea, "" he said modestly . ""I got it from a story of    Chesterton’s. Suppose the Overlords are hiding the fact that they've got nothing    to hide?""       ""That sounds just a little complicated to me, "" said Stormgren, beginning to take    slight interest .       'What I mean is this, "" van Ryberg continued eagerly . ""I think that physically    they're human beings like us. They realize that we'll tolerate being ruled by    creatures we imagine to be- well, alien and super-intelligent. But the human    race being what it is, it just won 't be bossed around by creatures of the same    species . ""       ""Very ingenious, like all your theories, "" said Stormgren. ""I wish you'd give them opus numbers so that I could keep up with them. The objections to this one... [they're interrupted when another character arrives in the scene] ""   Searching in google for chesterton history mentioned in ""childhood's end"", I did not found an answer. The only thing I found is this list of allusions from Shmoop, where Chesterton is shown, but not the specific story.  So, which Chesterton story is alluded in Childhood's End? Do Arthur Clarke said which story is that, or is it possible to someone more versed in Chesterton works to discover that? "
813,"Did George R. R. Martin Conceive Bronn as a Younger, Cynical Version of Illyrio Mopatis?","In A Song of Ice and Fire and the television series Game of Thrones, Bronn is a low-born ""sellsword"" (i.e. a mercenary) who, in the first few seasons of the television series, he is coupled with the high-born Tyrion Lannister. When Tyrion Lannister flees King's Landing, Bronn starts to assist Jaime in military campaigns.  Illyrio Mopatis is introduced in the first episode in the series as a wealthy man in Pentos.  But long before that, according to this History and Lore video Illyrio was actually a mercenary who took Varys under his wings, who was at that time a young thief; together they started a scheme that made both of them rich. Varys later leaves Illyrio to become an adviser to Aerys Targaryen in King's Landing.  So there are a few parallels (two couples; two sellswords, both of whom eventually become rich) and a few things that are inverted (Varys was in the service of former sellsword Illyrio; sellsword Bronn in the service of Tyrion Lannister). So here's my question: do George R. R. Martin's novels draw attention to such parallels and, if yes, what are they? "
814,Use of 'this crossly' in the 'A Roadside Stand' by Robert Frost?,"What does author want to convey by saying/using 'this crossly' as two instances in the poem? What do they signify/show?  Thanks to anyone who takes his time to help me out :)     The little old house was out with a little new shed   In front at the edge of the road where the traffic sped,   A roadside stand that too pathetically pled,   It would not be fair to say for a dole of bread,   But for some of the money, the cash, whose flow supports   The flower of cities from sinking and withering faint.   The polished traffic passed with a mind ahead,   Or if ever aside a moment, then out of sorts   At having the landscape marred with the artless paint   Of signs that with N turned wrong and S turned wrong   Offered for sale wild berries in wooden quarts,   Or crook-necked golden squash with silver warts,   Or beauty rest in a beautiful mountain scene,   You have the money, but if you want to be mean,   Why keep your money (this crossly) and go along.        The hurt to the scenery wouldn’t be my complaint   So much as the trusting sorrow of what is unsaid:   Here far from the city we make our roadside stand   And ask for some city money to feel in hand   To try if it will not make our being expand,   And give us the life of the moving-pictures’ promise   That the party in power is said to be keeping from us.        It is in the news that all these pitiful kin   Are to be bought out and mercifully gathered in   To live in villages, next to the theatre and the store,   Where they won’t have to think for themselves anymore,   While greedy good-doers, beneficent beasts of prey,   Swarm over their lives enforcing benefits   That are calculated to soothe them out of their wits,   And by teaching them how to sleep they sleep all day,   Destroy their sleeping at night the ancient way.        Sometimes I feel myself I can hardly bear   The thought of so much childish longing in vain,   The sadness that lurks near the open window there,   That waits all day in almost open prayer   For the squeal of brakes, the sound of a stopping car,   Of all the thousand selfish cars that pass,   Just one to inquire what a farmer’s prices are.   And one did stop, but only to plow up grass   In using the yard to back and turn around;   And another to ask the way to where it was bound;        And another to ask could they sell it a gallon of gas   They couldn’t (this crossly); they had none, didn’t it see?        No, in country money, the country scale of gain,   The requisite lift of spirit has never been found,   Or so the voice of the country seems to complain,   I can’t help owning the great relief it would be   To put these people at one stroke out of their pain.   And then next day as I come back into the sane,   I wonder how I should like you to come to me   And offer to put me gently out of my pain.     Original sources: [three] [scanned] [images]. "
815,Why does Kipling's poem ‘The Three-Decker’ differ between editions?,"Rudyard Kipling’s collection The Seven Seas (1896) contains the poem ‘The Three-Decker’, whose third verse is as follows:     By ways no gaze could follow, a course unspoiled of cook,   Per Fancy, fleetest in man, our titled berths we took   With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed,   And a Church of England parson for the Islands of the Blest.   The first couplet of this verse is made up of puns on the names of late 19th-century tourist agencies and operators, as described in my answer to Peter Shor’s question. But while researching this answer I noticed that editions of The Seven Seas have different text for this couplet. The original British edition (Methuen and Co., London, 1896) gives the version quoted above (page 135). But the U.S. edition (D. Appleton &amp; Company, New York, 1897) gives this verse as follows (page 119):     Carambas and serapés we waved to every wind,   We smoked good Corpo Bacco when our sweethearts proved unkind;   With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed   We also took our manners to the Islands of the Blest.   Several features of the replacement couplet are unsatisfactory or puzzling:   Waving serapés (Spanish–American shawls) makes sense, but waving carambas does not. Caramba! is a Spanish minced oath, so waving it requires a very loose sense of the word “wave” (or else it is surprisingly rude: caramba is a euphemism for carajo meaning penis). Kipling’s poem constructs an extended conceit between the Victorian three-volume novel (known as a three-decker) and a ship with three decks. Thus the ship is populated with tropes from these novels: “stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs” and so on. But considered as literary tropes, carambas and serapés seem to belong to Western fiction rather than Victorian melodramas. “Corpo Bacco” looks like Italian for “body [of] Bacchus”, presumably an oath (compare perbacco), but in the context of the replacement couplet it seems to be a kind or brand of tobacco. Is this some kind of joke?   If you search on Google Books for the phrase “Corpo Bacco”, there are (discounting duplicates) only two hits: Kipling’s poem in its U.S. edition, and the poem ‘Camp Song’ from The New Monthly Magazine for May 1853, signed ‘G.W.T.’ (perhaps George Walter Thornbury?):     Corpo Bacco! how we battled,     Camped and marched the wide world over.   Caramba! I’m like the Calmuc,     In my own land but a rover.   Can it be a coincidence that here we have caramba too?  A footnote explains that the italicized phrases in the poem are “oaths of all languages, picked up by the mercenary in different countries.” So in this poem “Corpo Bacco” and “Caramba!” make perfect sense: they are oaths picked up in Italy and Spain respectively. It looks to me very much as though the writer of the replacement couplet was pulling a prank by taking oaths from ‘Camp Song’ and sneaking them past the publisher by deploying them in misleading contexts.  My questions:   Who decided to change this couplet, Kipling or his U.S. publisher, and why? (Did they doubt that their U.S. readers would understand the puns?) Did Kipling even write the replacement couplet, or is it editorial meddling? Was it common for editors to rewrite parts of poems like this? Is there a connection to ‘Camp Song’ by ‘G.W.T.’?  "
816,"Terminology and examples for what George Orwell calls ""good bad poetry""?","Recently I bumped into an article where ""The Poetry Foundation’s president, John Barr, takes a look at what separates “serious” poetry from the rest"". Poetry being an art form, obviously no such definition will ever satisfy everyone, nor should it, but I still found the distinction made in the article interesting and worthy of consideration.     Yes, there is plenty of poorly written verse out there, but there is   also plenty of poorly written poetry—and sometimes the verse is the   better crafted.      Robert Service’s “The Cremation of Sam McGee,” with no help from the   critical establishment, is still going strong after a century, while   most early Yeats is read today only because it was written by Yeats.   To use verse as a pejorative term, then, is to lose the use of it as a   true distinction.      George Orwell gives us another way to think about this when he   describes Kipling as “a good bad poet.”      ”A good bad poem is a graceful monument to the obvious. It records in   memorable form—for verse is a mnemonic device, among other things—some   emotion which very nearly every human being can share.”      Into this same pot Orwell puts “The Charge of the Light Brigade,” the   work of Bret Harte—and presumably that of Robert Service. “There is a   great deal of good bad poetry in English,” says Orwell; by   implication, there is even more bad bad poetry.   What other well-known examples of such ""good bad poetry"" are there? Are there other concepts or names for this kind of thing, that might make the search easier? "
817,"What is the connection between the following two lines from ""A German Requiem""?","I think there must be some connection between the last two lines from the first stanza of ""A German Requiem"":     Yesterday the very furniture seemed to reproach you.   Today you take your place in the Widow's Shuttle.   I believe there must be some contrast between yesterday and today.  In another post on ELL, I asked the same question and received a comment which says yesterday the widow was alone with the furniture and today she is taking the shuttle with other widows. I think that helped my understanding. But I still want to dig a little deeper into the question.  Why did the furniture reproach her? Perhaps she sobbed too much so that even the furniture found it unbearable?  "
818,"Who is ""Reported Missing"" addressed to?","Anna Keown's poem ""Reported Missing"" is addressed to a World War One soldier by a first-person narrator who is desperately hopeful that he isn't dead. Here's the poem in full:     My thought shall never be that you are dead:   Who laughed so lately in this quiet place.   The dear and deep-eyed humour of that face   Held something ever living, in Death’s stead.   Scornful I hear the flat things they have said   And all their piteous platitudes of pain.   I laugh! I laugh! – For you will come again –   This heart would never beat if you were dead.   The world’s adrowse in twilight hushfulness,   There’s purple lilac in your little room,   And somewhere out beyond the evening gloom   Small boys are culling summer watercress.   Of these familiar things I have no dread   Being so very sure you are not dead.   What relation is the soldier to the narrator? A son? A husband? A lover? Something else?  Answers based either on a close reading of the poem itself or on outside information, e.g. about Keown's own life and family, would both be welcome. "
819,Why did Martin Eden live at night with the gods in a colossal nightmare?,"Re-reading Jack London's Martin Eden for my project, I've come across this passage:      Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and here he was at a higher pitch than ever.  All the hidden things were laying their secrets bare.  He was drunken with comprehension.  At night, asleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the day, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon the world he had just discovered.   Martin Eden, chapter XIII. Emphasis mine.   This appears right after Martin discovers Herbert Spencer, whose works will play a major role in Martin's later life.   I can understand the sentences before the one with highlighted bit; I can also understand why he ""went around like a somnambulist"".  What I can't understand is the ""nightmare"" and ""gods"". If ""nightmare"" is used in a literal sense here, why would he have nightmares at all, especially with gods?   If the nightmares are meant in a more symbolic sense, then what do they represent? It is stated in the book that Martin resented sleep, seeing it as a waste of time, and thus sleeping for only 5 hours a day (even trying sleeping for only 4 hours, but that was too hard).   I just don't see why Martin would experience anything negative in his sleep, since everything thus far has only been good for him - Ruth, studying, writing, and now Spencer.  "
820,Interpretation of a Churchill quote,"This isn't quite literature, but a quote from Winston Churchill:     History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.    Is he referring to the fact that he will be writing a history of the time he lived in (as he was a prolific writer of history)? Or, more that his actions will dictate the historical record? Perhaps it is both, but I'd like to know a bit more about why. "
821,Did Marge Piercy have experience with the mental health system?,"Marge Piercy's novel Woman on the Edge of Time presents a chilling view of the modern mental health system, by documenting the thoughts and experiences of a woman committed to a mental institution against her will.  Was the author basing her portrayal on real-life experience? Had she been involved with mental asylums or mental health therapy on any level in her own life - e.g. did she know someone who'd been committed? "
822,"What does Father Gur mean by ""And then you'll be given back!""?","During the dinner at the king's palace, Rumata has a conversation with Father Gur, the poet. Rumata offers him a copy of the poets work, in exchange for a promise to write something new:     “Very well put, Father Gur. By the way, is it still possible to find your book?”        “I don’t know… And I don’t want to know.”        “Just in case, you should know: one copy is in the metropole, in the   library of the emperor. Another is kept in the Museum of Curiosities   in Soan. The third is with me.”        Gur spooned some jelly onto his plate with a trembling hand. “I… don’t   know…” He looked at Rumata mournfully with his huge sunken eyes. “I’d   like to read it… reread it…”        “I’ll be happy to lend it to you.”        “And then?”        “And then you’ll give it back.”        “And then you’ll be given back!” Gur said sharply.   Hard to be a God, chapter 5. Emphasis mine.   I am confused by Father Gur's reply. In original Russian, the last two lines of the conversation are as follows (with bold part matching that in the translation):     — Потом вы вернете.        — И потом вам вернут! — резко сказал Гур.   A literal translation in this case is ""And then they'll give it back to you!"". While all three versions mean the same thing, I found the tone to be different, and it caused me to question the meaning of Father Gur's line.  When I read it in Russian, I assumed he was referring to future generations of poets that would be inspired by Father Gur's work. This thought of mine was prompted by an earlier line by Rumata:     “Look at your plate and keep eating. I’ll tell you who you are. You’re a brilliant storyteller, the founder of a new literary movement — the most fruitful one there is.” Gur’s cheeks slowly started to glow. “In a hundred years, and maybe even earlier, dozens of storytellers will follow in your footsteps.”   Ibid. Emphasis mine.   But then, Father Gur may be just too humble and skeptic to accept that possibility.  When reading the English translation, however, the tone suggested that Father Gur may somehow be referring to Don Reba, and persecution of artists in Arkanar, as if he was saying ""And then you'll be given back [after they kill me for possessing it]!"". This, I think, is supported by the line that follows immediately after:     Rumata shook his head.        “Don Reba really scared you, Father Gur.”   So which one is it? Is Father Gur telling that Rumata will be rewarded for lending Gur his book? Or is he telling that Rumata and Gur will be prosecuted for the possession of this banned work?    On a related note, today (15th of April) is the birthday of Boris Strugatsky, one of the authors of this terrific book! "
823,Are any of the countries in Hard to Be a God based specifically on particular real-life countries?,"Arkanar, Irukan, Soan, ... there are several countries mentioned and given at least some description and fleshing out in the book. Are any of these intended to be direct parallels of specific real-life countries?  I could see Arkanar being the USSR, especially since Don Reba is based on the Soviet figure Beria, but there could also be elements of the Spanish Inquisition in Reba's pogroms. Is there any evidence, either from the text itself or from interviews with the authors, for Arkanar or any of the other countries mentioned being modelled on particular countries in the real world? "
824,"Is the story of ""Tales in the Sand"" (or its form) faithful to traditional African stories?","In the prologue to The Doll's House (The Sandman #9 ""Tales in the Sand""), Gaiman tells the story of Queen Nada. Neil Gaiman is not African, nor (as far as I could tell) were any of the people who worked with him. Therefore, I wonder if the story of Queen Nada has a parallel in traditional African stories. If not that particular story, I'd still like to know whether the form of the story (outlined below) is a traditional one. (TL;DR section below)   The tale is told only once to each man, as part of a manhood ritual:   page 2 The story-teller and the boy travel together into the desert, and the story-teller commands the boy to find something.   page 3     Old man: Now you must go and find something, and bring it back to me.   And when you have brought it back to me I will tell you the tale.   While you are looking, I will make the fire.      Young man: But Grandfather...what must I find?    page 3     Old man: You will know when you find it.  Another form of the tale is told by women, in a language that they keep from the men.   page 1   page 24     Narration box: There is another version of the tale. That is the tale   the women tell each other, in their private language men-children are   not taught, and the old men are too wise to learn. And in that version   of the tale perhaps things happened differently. But then, that is a   women's tale, and it is never told to men.    Wikipedia does a good job of summarizing the tale:     [...] the tragic love between Dream and Queen Nada. Fearing the   consequences of loving an immortal, Nada spurns Dream. In anger, Dream   sends Nada to Hell, where she remains to the present day.   My Google searches for ""Queen Nada"" only returned pages dedicated to the comic book character. I did manage to find a page criticizing the gendered storytelling and the depiction of Africa by non-Africans (even though that author admits that they story told is told well even through these unlikeable means). That page does not contain any information about the specific tale, or its form.  TL;DR:  So, my questions are:     Is the story of Queen Nada one that is told in an African oral tradition? If yes, is there another, known version of the tale that was specific to women? If not, is the form of storytelling portrayed in ""Tales in the Sand"" loyal to traditional forms of storytelling in Africa?  "
825,"What word was used for ""anisotropic"" in the original Russian text of ""Hard to Be a God""?","In the beginning of Hard to Be a God, there is the matter of the skeleton chained to a machine gun.     ""An anisotropic road,"" Anton explained. Anka stood with her back to   him. ""Traffic can move only in one direction.""   This is also remembered by the characters later in the book:     “Anka,” Pashka said. “Do you remember the anisotropic highway?” Anka   frowned. “What highway?”      “Anisotropic. The one with the do-not-enter sign. Remember, the three   of us went there?”      “I remember. It was Anton who said that it was anisotropic.”      “That was the time Anton went through the sign, and when he came back,   he said that he found a blown-up bridge and the skeleton of a fascist   chained to a machine gun.”      “I don’t remember that,” said Anka. “So what?”      “I often think about that highway nowadays,” said Pashka. “Like   there’s some connection. The highway was anisotropic, like history.   You weren’t supposed to go back. But he did go back. And stumbled on a   chained skeleton.”        Hard to be a God, translated by Olena Bormashenko, Gollancz,   pages 230-231.   I had to look up the meaning of ""anisotropic"" when I encountered it in Hard to Be a God, but was amused to learn it again in chemistry class a short while later.  I wonder what word was used for ""anisotropic"" in the original, and whether the original word belongs more to science than to literature, as the English word does (Wiktionary, for example, lists only a mathematics/physics definition).  What word was used in the original Russian for ""anisotropic""? Does that word also usually carry a scientific definition?  I'm interested in this information mostly out of curiosity, and nothing else; however, it may have relevance to the interpretation of the symbology of that scene, asked about in the linked question.

826,When did the Rupert Bear stories start repeating themselves?,"Some years ago I used to collect Rupert Bear annuals. I had a huge collection going all the way back to the 1940s, with some gaps which I slowly filled in over the years, and every time I got a new book, it meant reading several new Rupert stories. So I was rather disappointed when at some point (some time in the noughties, I think) they published a new Rupert annual in which at least one of the stories was exactly the same as one previously published - the Yeti story from 1990, if memory serves. But now I'm curious about whether this had any precedent.  What is the history of reusing Rupert Bear stories? Was it ever done before? Has it become a regular thing in recent years, or did they do it once and then never again because of fan backlash? For that matter, what was the exact year I remember in which they (?) started reusing stories? "
827,Is the character of Randolph Henry Ash based on any particular Victorian poet?,"The novel Possession contains some spot-on mimicry of several different writing styles, including lengthy poems by two fictional Victorian poets. The character of RH Ash in particular feels as if there is some model, or models, for him. He has a very distinct style and a distinct set of interests (including naturalism and Greek and Norse myths).  Is he similar to Tennyson, or Browning, or some other real poet, or an amalgam?  Or is he purely Byatt's creation? "

829,What does Narcissa Malfoy's name say about her character?,"Many of the names in the Harry Potter series are chosen so as to reflect some trait of their character. For example: Sirius Black the black dog, Remus Lupin the wolf, Severus the severe teacher, Luna Lovegood the eccentric but caring friend, and so on.  Narcissa Malfoy's name seems to suggest that she's full of herself, but as far as I can tell, the main motivation driving her in the books is to protect her son, not herself. She sacrifices a great deal for Draco, even essentially betraying Voldemort for his sake in the end - surely ""maternal"" would be a better way of describing her than ""narcissistic"".  Why, then, the name Narcissa? What does this say about her character? Is there a narcissistic side to the way she's portrayed in the books which I've missed? "
830,How is the concept of cultural encounter treated in the short story “One Out of Many”?,"In the story ""One Out of Many"" by V.S. Naipaul, how is the concept of cultural encounter treated? I have a few questions about that:   Is the author aware of the cultural encounter theme?   How does he manifest that awareness? Are the main characters, mainly Santosh, aware of the cultural encounter theme?   What clues does he provide of such awareness, if any?   How does the usage of “clothes” highlight the theme of cultural encounter?   How does the usage of “contrasts” (present versus past, now versus then, here versus home) throughout the short story help in highlighting the theme of cultural encounter?  "
831,Was the Stung Man based on an existing character from Egyptian mythology?,"The Stung Man is the antagonist of Book of the Dead, the first TombQuest book. He's got an... Interesting backstory.     The Stung Man wasn't called the Stung Man at that point, not yet. Everyone gets their nickname for a reason.   As the pharaoh's men searched outside, the thief discovered that his hiding place was full of scorpions.   Alex tried to imagine it. Was there light in the cave, or was it the sound that first alerted him to the fact that something was wrong? By then it didn't matter, because they were on him. The thief was stung again and again, all over his body: his legs, his torso, his arms, his neck. His face.   He refused to call out.   He chose death over capture.   When they finally found him, he was swollen past recognition. His stubborn courage earned the pharaoh's grudging respect. The Stung Man was given a lavish burial and a story that would last thousands of years.   TombQuest: Book of the Dead, chapter 4   I know some Egyptian mythology and stories, but I've never heard of a story like this. Then again, I'm hardly an expert.   Is there any Egyptian story like this? Did Michael Northrop base his story off of anything? "
832,"In ""The Sandman"", what are nightmares for?","What purpose do nightmares serve in the world of The Sandman? In the second volume of The Sandman Library (The Doll's House), Dream spends most of his time tracking down and dealing with a number of errant nightmares (Brute, Glob, and the Corinthian). He refers to these as ""his creations"" many times, unforming some (to be reformed later) and banishing others (for a few thousand years, implying that they will eventually return).  What purpose do these creatures serve? Dream seems to take his ""job""1 very seriously; this seems to include caring for the well-being of sentient creatures -- the other main story of The Doll's House, for example, was that of the dream vortex, which posed a great danger to anything that dreamed, and Morpheus did his best to avert the impending disaster. In this volume, he also disbands and attempts to rehabilitate the Collectors.  One could argue that it's possible that while nightmares are not good for individual humans, they serve a greater purpose for humanity. The basis for that argument would be that the focus of Morpheus' care for sentient creatures appears to undergo some shift from humanity-only to include individual humans, and the nightmares were created long before Dream cared much for lone individuals. The only caveat that accompanies this interpretation is the apparent absence of a benefit for humanity in general. (At least, I don't see one.)  It cannot either be that nightmares are things that humans (or sentient beings) find in their minds, and that Dream does not remove -- in this universe, nightmares are the creations of the King of Dreams. They are things that he expressly created, for some purpose that escapes my understanding at the moment.  Do they serve some purpose in-universe? Are they just a plot device, or a metaphor? (Something else?)  When I searched Google, I was not able to find much about nightmares. The shared Wikia page for dreams and nightmares says (without a source) that ""Nightmares are beings created by Dream to populate his realm and to help him with various tasks."" This does not, however, explain what the purpose of nightmares is. TV Tropes seems to treat them all as mere ""Nightmare Fuel,"" but I think there should be a greater purpose in them, especially since Neil Gaiman is such a careful writer, and Dream is such a careful guardian.    1 I'm not sure what, exactly, that job is. In three volumes of The Sandman, I have yet to see a job description. Perhaps that will come later. "
833,Are quotes from a character technically quotes from the author?,"I was recently browsing for some quotes from a few of my favorite authors, and I noticed that in all the lists of ""Top Quotes by..."" were quotes from characters within the story.   I understand that yes, of course, the author came up with and published those words, but whom should the quote be attributed to?  Example:      The truth. It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.    Should the attribution go to Albus Dumbledore or J.K. Rowling?  I am not asking from ""formal usage"" point-of-view (which this post covers nicely), I am not writing an academic paper or anything like that... I am more interested in it as literary concept. To that end why would online stores be selling posters, coffee mugs, etc. with the quote attributed to the author, rather than the character? "
834,What does Manfred's character tell us about human consciousness?,"I'm currently reading Manfred by Lord Byron and my professor said something that I found interesting. In Act 1, Manfred introduces the idea of humans being 1/2 dust and 1/2 deity. Both link to the problematic consciousness of human beings.  Despite that we can create designs, technology, and other great things, we find ourselves unable to excerpt any sort of control over time due to our own mortality.  Thus, we are deities because of our minds, but we are dust because of our bodies.  I'm interested in how people interpret Manfred's character (and ultimately, Byron's ideology based off of this book) and what Manfred's character shows in human nature (if it shows anything at all).   So...   Do qualities of Manfred, the Byronic Hero, reflect how rioters and protesters behave today? If so... is Manfred an ""ideal"" human being because he defiant against Power? Is the book trying to establish a project in the real world to convince society to not succumb to Power?   "
835,English standard of the (Prose) Edda?,"Gustav Schwab‘s Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece (OT: Die schönsten klassischen Sagen des Altertums) is at least to the German audience the encyclopaedia of Roman and Greek mythology (despite its title). Gustav Schwab translated and adapted the most famous works (Aeneid, Iliad etc.) of the ancient world.   This is somewhat similar to Sioned Davies’ version of the old Welsh Mabinogion: It’s a modern adaptation (and translation) of the Welsh myths.  The Edda is the “bible” of Nordic and Icelandic myths. Does there exist an equivalent to the other two works (an English translation into Prose that is accepted as the standard encyclopaedia for Nordic Myths)? "
836,What was Dickens's attitude towards revolution?,"Charles Dickens wrote two ""historical novels"": A Tale of Two Cities, set during the French Revolution, and Barnaby Rudge, set during the Gordon Riots. I find it interesting that both of these books were set against a backdrop of violent uprising. Was Dickens particularly fascinated by that kind of setting, or was it just a coincidence? If the former, what was his attitude towards the idea of revolution (either as expressed via these two novels, or elsewhere in his writings)? "
837,"What is the origin of the name ""Frankenstein""?","The name ""Frankenstein"" is famous enough to have entered popular culture, even if people often get confused about whether it refers to the scientist or the monster. But where did Mary Shelley get this name from? Did it come from a particular real-life person, a local legend from somewhere in Europe, some significant hidden meaning? Surely it's more than just a random German-sounding name? "
838,"Is Ari an unreliable narrator, or is he oblivious?","At the conclusion to Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, by Benjamin Alire Sáenz, the title character Ari reaches the realization that he is romantically attracted to Dante -- where previously, he firmly rebuffed Dante's explicit interest in him.  The way he arrives at this isn't portrayed as feeling any romantic or sexual desire of his own. Rather, his overall ""platonic"" passion for protecting Dante is interpreted by other characters as more than what mere friendship would explain. Hearing this, Ari understands it to be true, and comes to the conclusion that he's been repressing his own feelings and desire.  Are we to understand that Ari has felt attracted to Dante, but has concealed that fact from us? Just as, for example, he explicitly tells us that he won't discuss whether he masturbates, or what he thinks about? Or, is this the first inkling Ari himself has of his attraction? Which would mean, for example, that he's lying when he tells Dante their kiss actually did work for him?  The difference between ""Ari admits feelings he previously kept concealed"" vs. ""Ari realizes feelings that are brand new to him"" seems immensely significant, but the way the book is narrated, the lines between the two are very, very blurry.  Are we to interpret Ari as an unreliable narrator, or has all his narration reflected his knowledge and feelings at the time of each scene? "
839,Why was Ophelia psychologically ill in the Shakespearean play Hamlet?,In the Shakespearean play Hamlet Ophelia became psychologically ill.  Was it because of Hamlet's behavior or how society treated her or what's the real reason behind her sudden illness?  Did Shakespeare leave any reference to the reason behind her illness? 
840,"What is the meaning of ""funny sort"" in Jerome K. Jerome's ""Passing Of The Third Floor Back""?","In ""Passing Of The Third Floor Back"" a short story by Jerome K. Jerome (available on Project Gutenberg) we have the following dialogue, without further explanation:     Mrs. Pennycherry pondered. “He’s not the funny sort, is he?”        Not that sort at all. Mary Jane was sure of it.   What are we meant to understand by ""funny sort""?  I feel that this must be some euphemism for some undesirable and unmentionable characteristic that was clearly understood by the characters, and would have made sense to British readers in 1904.  When we meet Mrs. Pennycherry's other lodgers, it would appear she was not over particular, provided they could pay, so who might she have been reluctant to accommodate? "
841,Was Jerome K Jerome politically active?,"Jerome K. Jerome's short story ""The New Utopia"" has a strongly anti-socialist and anti-democratic message.      I  had  spent  an  extremely  interesting  evening.    I  had  dined  with   some  very  ""advanced""  friends  of  mine  at  the  “National  Socialist   Club”.    We  had  had  an  excellent  dinner:  the  pheasant,  stuffed  with   truffles,  was  a  poem;  and  when  I  say  that  the  ’49  Chateau  Lafitte   was  worth  the  price  we  had  to  pay  for  it,  I  do  not  see  what  more  I can add in its favour.      After dinner, and over the cigars (I must say they do know how   to  stock  good  cigars  at  the  National  Socialist  Club),  we  had  a  very instructive  discussion  about  the  coming  equality  of  man  and  the   nationalisation of capital.      I  was  not  able  to  take  much  part  in  the  argument  myself,  be-   cause,  having  been  left  when  a  boy  in  a  position  which  rendered  it necessary  for  me  to  earn  my  own  living,  I  have  never  enjoyed  the time and opportunity to study these questions.   The first person narrator then fell asleep, and woke up in the future. His guide took him on a walk around the city, and said     “Why, I thought you understood that all men were now equal.  What would become  of  our  equality  if  one  man  or  woman  were  allowed  to swagger  about  in  golden  hair,  while  another  had  to  put  up  with carrots?    Men  have  not  only  got  to  be  equal  in  these  happy  days, but  to  look  it,  as  far  as  can  be.    By  causing  all  men  to  be  clean shaven,  and  all  men  and  women  to  have  black  hair  cut  the  same length, we obviate, to a certain extent, the errors of Nature.”    I said:   “Why black?”   He  said  he  did  not  know,  but  that  was  the  colour  which  had   been decided upon.   “Who by?” I asked.   “By THE MAJORITY,” he replied, raising his hat and lowering his eyes, as if in prayer.   Wikipedia says     He wished to go into politics or be a man of letters, but the death of his father when Jerome was 13 and of his mother when he was 15 forced him to quit his studies and find work to support himself.   Did he publicly support the Conservative party, or speak publicly about current political issues, other than in this story? "
842,"Is the man about to die in ""Meditation on the A30""?","John Betjeman's poem ""Meditation on the A30"" is about a man driving his car and fuming about his unloving wife. In the final verse, he finally turns to action:     ""You're barmy or plastered, I'll pass you, you bastard-   I will overtake you. I will!""   As he clenches his pipe, his moment is ripe   And the corner's accepting its kill.   Does the final line really mean the man is about to die in a car crash? This seems a bit 'off' thematically with the rest of the poem, but I can't think of any other interpretation of ""the corner's accepting its kill"". Is there another possible interpretation, or is there some foreshadowing of this, or does the poem really take a darker turn so abruptly at the very end? "
843,Why is John Betjeman's poem set on the A30 in particular?,"John Betjeman's poem ""Meditation on the A30"" is about a man who is fuming at his wife and driving recklessly. Everything described in the poem itself is fairly universal, could take place anywhere, so I'm wondering whether there's anything significant in the A30 specifically as the choice of setting.  The A30, also known as the Great South West Road, is the third longest road in Britain, the main route from London to the South West, to Cornwall, and ultimately all the way to Land's End. But why did Betjeman decide to use it in the title of his poem? Did this road have some particular significance in his life, perhaps? "
844,"Does ""The Soul selects her own Society"" by Emily Dickinson have a simile?","Here is the poem ""The Soul selects her own Society"" by Emily Dickinson.     The Soul selects her own Society —   Then — shuts the Door —   To her divine Majority —   Present no more —      Unmoved — she notes the Chariots — pausing  —   At her low Gate  —    Unmoved   — an Emperor be kneeling   Upon her Mat —      I’ve known her — from an ample nation  —    Choose One —   Then — close the   Valves of her attention —   Like Stone   The book SAT II Success: Literature which I use to prepare for the SAT exam (a multiple-choice test for high school students in the US) asks the following question about the poem:     Which of the following elements of style are not present in the poem?      (A) Metaphors   (B) Similes   (C) Grammatical irregularities   (D) Slant rhyme   (E) Figurative language    In my opinion, every choice is present: metaphors (""Valves""), similes (""[l]ike Stone""), grammatical irregularities (punctuation), slant rhyme (""pausing""/""kneeling""), and figurative language (this one includes metaphors and similes).  However, the book says otherwise. Here is an explanation for this question:     The correct answer is (B). Remember to pay special attention to the   word except in this question. “Chariots” and “Emperor” are clearly   metaphors for wealth and power, which makes choice (A) true. Dickinson   is known for her sharp, concrete images, like “Door,” “Chariots,”   “Gate,” “Mat,” and “Stone,” making choice (B) untrue because they are   not similes. Choices (C), (D), and (E) are clearly evident, and   therefore do not meet the criteria of exception. Choice (B) is the   right answer.     The book says that ""[l]ike Stone"" only includes an image of stone, but isn't it a simile? According to Wikipedia:     A simile (/ˈsɪməli/) is a figure of speech that directly compares two   things. Similes are a form of metaphor that explicitly use connecting   words (such as like, as, so, than, or various verbs such as resemble),   though these specific words are not always necessary.     So why is ""[l]ike Stone"" not a simile in this poem? "
845,"What work is titled ""Distresses of the Industrious Population""?","From George W. M. Reynolds' The Mysteries of London (1844–1845):     ""Ah!"" said the bookseller, after a pause; ""nothing now succeeds unless   it's in the comic line. We have comic Latin grammars, and comic Greek   grammars; indeed, I don't know but what English grammar, too, is a comedy altogether.   All our tragedies are made into comedies by the way they are performed;   and no work sells without comic illustrations to it. I have brought out   several new comic works, which have been very successful. For instance,   'The Comic Wealth of Nations';   'The Comic Parliamentary Speeches';   'The Comic Report of the Poor-Law Commissioners,'   with an Appendix containing the 'Comic Dietary Scale';   and the 'Comic Distresses of the Industrious Population.' I even propose to bring out a   'Comic Whole Duty of Man.'   All these books sell well: they do admirably   for the nurseries of the children of the aristocracy. In fact they are   as good as manuals and text-books.""   I can identify most of the references here, but I don't know exactly what is meant by ""Distresses of the Industrious Population."" I know that the ""industrious population"" is what we would today call the ""working poor,"" and that the Poor-Law Commission was charged with ameliorating their ""distresses""; but was there a specific work of literature, or report, or famous speech, that would have been immediately understood by Reynolds' use of the title ""Distresses of the Industrious Population""? "
846,"Interpretation of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J. D. Salinger","In ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J. D. Salinger, there are two topics that, in my opinion, are metaphors.  The first topic is the one of the ducks in the pond and where they go in winter. Looking on the web, it seems that there is some consensus on considering the ducks as an alter ego for Holden and its problems with his adolescence.  The second one, is the figure of the catcher in the rye. In this Wikipedia page, it says that:     This ""catcher in the rye"" is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the ""catcher"" and the ""fallen""; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher's symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.   I have my own interpretations of these two topics.   In my opinion (just as a reader, since my education background is in STEM), the ducks are all the boys and girls, like Holden, that have a particular sensitivity and predisposition for investigating and questioning the world around them. For them, it is more difficult to accept the adult's world when they are growing up (in the metaphor, to remain in the pond when the winter is coming). From this comes the question that Holden cannot solve: how can these particularly sensitive individuals survive to adolescence? When he asks to the taxi driver, the only answer he receives is about fishes. Obviously, fishes are different from ducks and they can survive the whole winter in the frozen pond. In this metaphor, fishes are like those children that seem to be better dealing with the problem of growing up because they do not question themselves about the adult's world: they accept it as it is without raising any problem, since for them it is totally natural. Moreover, during the night that Holden spend in the park, he looks for other ducks in the grass near the pond (therefore, just outside the society where other human beings live). He does not find any duck, he only risks to hurt himself falling in the pond. In my opinion, this means that individuals with this particular sensitivity are completely isolated from the society, for them it is hard to find people similar to them. Therefore, society seems to not understand the problem since it is not a common problem.  Again, my interpretation of the catcher is different from the proposed one. In my opinion, the cliff at the end of the field represents the possibility of mental illness during adolescence. Children are playing in the field during the childhood, but growing up they can have to face problems that can put at risk their own life. In this case, the catcher is not somebody that prevents the children from growing, but it is a person (maybe an adult?) that is fundamental in the development of the adolescent for surviving a period of struggle.    The question are: are these interpretations consistent with the whole novel? Is there an ""official"" interpretation? Is it different from mine and, if yes, how and why? "
847,Does the description of Eustace's parents fit some known stereotype?,"In the opening paragraph of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, C. S. Lewis introduces us to the (at this point in the story) singularly unlikeable character of Eustace Clarence Scrubb. About his parents, we read the following short summary:     He didn't call his Father and Mother ""Father"" and ""Mother"", but Harold and Alberta. They were very up-to-date and advanced people. They were vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotallers and wore a special kind of underclothes. In their house there was very little furniture and very few clothes on the beds and the windows were always open.   I remember being confused when I first read this as a child: ""vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotallers"" all seem like good things to me, and I was raised on such principles myself, but evidently we're supposed to have a negative impression of the Scrubb family. Looking back at it now, I'm guessing that Lewis was playing into certain stereotypes which contemporary readers would have recognised as signals of a certain ""type"" of family. Since their diet, dress sense, and furniture aren't really relevant to the story, this must be scene-setting in terms of environment and personality.  What stereotypes is Lewis trying to play into with this brief description? Or to put it another way, upon reading the above-quoted passage, how would contemporary readers likely have described or perceived the Scrubb family? I'm imagining an ""oh, right, they're X-people"" reaction, but what's X? "
848,Where was 'A Fallible Lecture' by Brian Patten originally published?,"Brian Patten is (or was) one of the Liverpool poets; in 1967 he co-published The Mersey Sound, one of the most successful poetry anthologies in the English language.   Brian Patten also wrote a text entitled ""A Fallible Lecture"" (sometimes incorrectly classified as a poem, even though it's clearly prose), which presents an irreverent look at the history of English literature. It begins with the following words:     Eng. Lit was established one sunny afternoon in 1386, when a gang of people went for a walk to a place called Canterbury. They had a great time, telling each other dirty stories, which a man called Chaucer wrote down, thereby establishing the fact that English Literature is based on a collection of dirty jokes. After Chaucer Engl Lit dozed off a little until a man called Shakespeare began writing plays about murder, mayhem and paranoic Danish princes.   It contains comments about Milton writing Paradise Lost, surviving the plague, blindness and the death of his two daughters, and then writing Paradise Regained. The Romantic poets die young, ""preferably in Italy"". Coleridge is described as waving dead albatrosses in people's faces. The text is funny if you get all the allusions (e.g. who is the ""shy librarian from Hull""?) but probably merely strange if you don't.  I once had a copy of the text but I can't find it any longer. (The above quotes are all from memory.) What I have never found out, however, is where this text was first published. I have used Amazon's preview feature to peek at the content of some of Patten's books but found only poems and children's literature. "

If I could reach from pole to pole   Or grasp the ocean with a span   I would be measured by the soul,   The mind's the standard of the man.   Since the poem begins with 'tis instead of it's, then I guess it was written during (correct me if I am wrong) the 18-19th century. It also appears to be very heartfelt and written by someone who might look a little different, perhaps of a different race? Does anyone recognise this poem? Is it in any way familiar? "
851,"70s or 80s Novel, Low IQ man finds/rescues young woman adrift at sea","Probably read in 70s or early 80s. Probably set in the Caribbeans or Florida Coast, or Gulf Coast. The book may have been a mystery or thriller/adventure type story. It was in English  A low IQ man (He is capable, just slow) probably in his 30s finds a girl adrift on a lift raft/or ship wreckage. She is badly burned on her back/backside/back of the legs. He takes her to his cabin/hut he has built on a small island or cove where he lives away from civilization. (He sails to the nearest town occasionally to buy staple foods. (He might have been a Vietnam Vet on disability allowance? Head wound with a plate in his head?)  I don't recall if she was burned when the small ship (cabin cruiser/yacht/sailboat) she was on was was blown up/caught fire, or went overboard and was very badly sunburned because she had been adrift with no protection for many days.  I believe the Protagonist of the story is looking for the girl (Police? or Private Detective?)  There are two scenes I distinctly remember from the story:  One - A day or two after he finding her, she drowsily wakes up but is still half out of it, in his hut lying on her stomach. She is in great pain from her burned back. He is rubbing some cream/lotion/oil on her and it is soothing most of the burning pain. He is chatting away talking to himself as he applies the ointment. She is mostly drifting in and out, not paying any attention to what he is saying until she hears him say something like ""cute burned baby butt"" and realizes she is naked and he is rubbing the ointment on her bare butt. Just as she starts to panic, he pats he butt, gets up and says something that makes her realize she is safe he is not assaulting her. (i.e. Thats enough now, I have to go fix some food? catch some fish? work on the boat?)  Two - The low IQ man is very physically fit and strong, but has a strangely dished in forehead. a few days later (Maybe the girl is telling him her story, or she is asking him about his, he starts getting very distressed or anxious. He stands up goes to the center pole or roof support of the hut, grabs it and starts slamming his head against the pole many times. (The rounded edge of the pole perfectly matches the dished in shape of his forehead) She freaks and finally gets him to stop. He says something like when the bad thoughts/voices get too bad he has to knock them out of his head. They bond together (She keeping him stable. and He hiding her while she heals.)  I think it Might have been a three way triangle/race story between:   The Protagonist (Police?/Private Eye?) who is looking for her, Whoever caused her to be in the ocean (destroyed her boat or threw her overboard) who realizes her body never turned up and is looking for her again. and the low IQ man/girl who are trying to avoid everyone.   I think the Protagonist knows the low IQ man and would looks out for him. (May have been together in the service) I think before he found the girl he used to come into town every couple months to go to the local bar and get drunk and get into fights or sleep with an ugly old prostitute. I think the protagonist used to occasionally bail him out or give him a place to sleep it off if he got into trouble. "
852,What is the difference between emotions and feelings in Wordsworth's Preface to Lyrical Ballads?,"In the Preface to the second edition of Lyrical Ballads (1800), Wordsworth famously wrote that     all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: (...).   He later adds (my emphasis):     I have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings:    it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion   is contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the tranquillity gradually disappears,   and an emotion, kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced,   and does itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition generally begins,   and in a mood similar to this it is carried on;    but the emotion, of whatever kind, and in whatever degree, from various causes,    is qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any passions whatsoever,   which are voluntarily described, the mind will, upon the whole, be in a state of enjoyment.    If Wordsworth had written, ""the emotion is contemplated till (...) the tranquillity gradually disappears, and feelings/a feeling (...) is gradually produced"", I would have understood ""emotion"" as the original experience and ""feelings"" as the derived or perhaps renewed experience that leads to the creation of poetry. But I can't see this kind of consistency in the above passage. To make matters worse, he also adds ""passions"" to the mix.  In fact, the Preface also provide arguments for considering ""feelings"" as the original experience, or at least closer to it. For example, Wordsworth writes (my emphasis),     Humble and rustic life was generally chosen, because, in that condition, the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic language; because in that condition of life our elementary feelings coexist in a state of greater simplicity, and, consequently, may be more accurately contemplated, (...).   Wordworth uses the term ""emotion"" only four times in the Preface, namely in the second quote above.   Looking at definitions of ""feelings"" and ""emotions"" in present-day psychological sources does not help clarify the difference. For example, in What's the Difference Between a Feeling and an Emotion?, Neel Burton makes the following distinction:   an emotional experience is brief and episodic; e.g. I am currently proud of X; an emotion can endure for many years and can ""predispose to a variety of emotional experiences, as well as thoughts, beliefs, desires, and actions""; e.g. I am proud of X; feelings is a broader term that covers both emotional experiences and physical sensations such as hunger and pain.   He adds that ""an emotion, being in some sense latent, can only ever be felt, sensu stricto, through the emotional experiences that it gives rise to, even though it might also be discovered through its associated thoughts, beliefs, desires, and actions.""   Looking back at the Preface, one might say that emotional exeperiences may be ""recollected in tranquility"" and so gave rise to a mood that is conducive to writing poetry. Wordsworth uses the word ""feelings"" for the psychological phenomena that are active in that mood, but that does not accord with Burton's definition.  In What’s The Difference Between Feelings And Emotions?, Debbie Hampton uses other definitions (my emphasis):     Emotions are lower level responses occurring in the subcortical regions of the brain, the amygdala, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortices, creating biochemical reactions in your body altering your physical state. They originally helped our species survive by producing quick reactions to threat, reward, and everything in between in their environments.      Feelings originate in the neocortical regions of the brain, are mental associations and reactions to emotions, and are subjective being influenced by personal experience, beliefs, and memories. A feeling is a mental portrayal of what is going on in your body when you have an emotion and is the byproduct of your brain perceiving and assigning meaning to the emotion.    Since psychology and neuroscience did not exist in the early 19th century, Wordsworth couldn't have come up with these definitions, but there is a parallel with the distinction between emotions as the original experience and feelings as the result of ""recollection"" that would have helped me make sense of Wordworth. Am I overlooking something in the Preface and does Wordworth really make a consistent distinction? If yes, what is it? "
853,Why are the chapters in The Bastard of Istanbul named after ingredients of ashure?,"The Bastard of Istanbul is a novel by Elif Şafak which explores Turkish and Armenian culture and history; you can read a summary and 9-page excerpt online. One of the questions from the ""reading guide"" at the above link intrigued me:     What is the significance of naming each chapter after an ingredient of the dessert ashure?   Aşure is a dessert eaten in both Turkey and Armenia (in the latter it is called anuşabur). It appears to have a lot of cultural significance, and it's mentioned explicitly both in The Bastard of Istanbul and in another of Şafak's novels. So I think this question is very interesting and worth exploring. Why are the chapters named after aşure ingredients, and does this tie into the themes of the story? "
854,What is the story of the woman who collected valueless things?,"In G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown short story, The Blast of the Book, he makes two references to a story (presumably allegoric) about a woman who collected valueless things. The references are not explained and from the context it seems that the reader is assumed to be familiar with this story.  The relevant quotes are:     I've often had to wait in your office, till you turned up; and of course I passed the time of day with poor Berridge. He was rather a card. I remember once he said he would like to collect valueless things, as collectors did the silly things they thought valuable. You know the old story about the woman who collected valueless things.   And:     He has nonsense notions of all sorts. About collecting useless things, for instance. Don't you know the story of the woman who bought the two most useless things: an old doctor's brass-plate and a wooden leg?   There seems to be some point being made with the reference to the old story, but without knowing that context it's hard to know what the point is. What is the original story about the woman? "
855,Is Mike an anarchist in *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*?,"In the later parts of Robert Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, we find out that Manny and Prof are motivated by their anarchist political beliefs.  They argue for these beliefs in the new parliment, and I think those beliefs took a big part of what motivated their active participation in the revolution.  Even in the earlier parts of the book, Manny explains some of his anarchist beliefs, but it's only in the later parts that tell how far he's willing to go to fight for them.  However, I am not sure about the motivation of Mike.  Is Mike also an anarchist by conviction?  If so, then that would have motivated him to participate in the revolution, just like it did for Manny and Prof.  But Mike didn't participate in the arguments in the parliment in the later parts of the book, or in creating the new free Lunar state in general.  This makes it more difficult to me to determine his true beliefs.  I can imagine hypothetical alternate motivations for Mike, rather than a deep conviction of anarchy.  He could have had no specific political preference, but went along with the other protagonist's plan to do something that was fun for him.  He could have felt personal sympathy with Mike and the Prof and supported them for that reason.  He could have just found the old government and the Warden so annoying or evil that he went through with the revolution to replace that, even if he didn't know what new government he wanted.  He could even have thought himself more powerful than the other characters (it would be a reasonable assumption), and was planning on a different endgame than an anarchist Luna, but still found the revolution a good strating strategy for whatever his goals were.  Thus, my question is, what is Mike's motivation for participating in the revolution?  In particular, what are his political or moral beliefs, and is he a convinced anarchist?  Note that I am not asking about Heinlein's own political beliefs.  That's a separate question that's partly covered by “How anticommunist was Robert Heinlein?” (on Sci Fi SE)  As usual, I'd like an answer supported by the book, or possibly by interviews with Heinlein or other books he wrote. "
856,What was Sydney Carton doing in France?,"I reread A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens recently and was struck at how coincidental it was that Sydney Carton just happened to be in France during the time Charles Darnay was accused the second time.  Darnay had been imprisoned for a year before that.  Why hadn't Carton gone during that time?  How did he know he'd be needed right at that moment?  If he was there for Darnay, why wasn't he at the trial where he was released before he was taken again?  Was he there on other business or just to support Darnay?  Did I miss something? "
857,"What does Hodgekins' ""Northerne speech"" mean?","In chapter IV of Thomas Deloney's ""novel"" Thomas of Reading, king Henry I of England is willing to grant the clothiers a few requests as a reward for their support during a military campaign in France. Hodgekins, a clothier from Halifax (Yorkshire), requests that the town of Halifax be allowed to hang thieves who steal ""Clothes"". While the king is saying he is willing to grant the request, Hodgekins interrupts him:     With that Hodgekins unmannerly interrupted the King, saying in broad Northerne speech, Yea gude faith, mai Liedge, the faule eule of mai saule, giff any thing will keepe them whiat, till the karles be hanged by the cragge. What the dule care they for boaring their eyne, sea lang as they mae gae groping up and down the Country like fause lizar lownes, begging and craking?   Most of this understandable, but not all of it (in bold):     (...) Yes, good faith, my liege, the foul eule of my soul, give anything [that] will keep them whiatt, till the karls/guys are hanged by the cragge (neck?). What the dule (or devil?) care they for boaring their eyes, so/as long as they may go groping up and down the country like false lizar lownes (i.e. loons), begging and craking (crying out loudly?).   ""Boaring their eyne"" posssibly means blinding them (the English verb bore is a cognate of German bohren), though I am not aware of this being a punishment for theft in medieval England. Who can fill in the gaps and confirm that my other guesses are correct? "
858,What sort of nemiphar's oil provided protection against torpedoes?,"In Robert Greene's novel Gwydonius; The Carde of Fancie (published in 1584) Clerophontes gives his son Gwydonius the following advice (italics from the original; bold by me):     Who so meanes to be a sutor to Circes, must take a Preservative, unlesse he will be inchaunted. He / that will fish for the Torpedo, must anoint his hand with the oyle of Nemiphar, least he be charmed, and who so meaneth to enter combat with vanitie, must first surely defence himselfe with the target of vertue, unless he meane to be a captive to care, or calamitie.   I have no idea what nemiphar means. It sounds like the French word nénuphar (water lily), but I don't see how oil from a water lily would provide protection against electric rays (who don't live in fresh water). Or am I misunderstanding ""torpedo""? "
859,What does ketha mean?,"At the end of chapter VIII of Thomas Deloney's Jack of Newbury, Jack has a discussion with his wife about a certain ""gossip"" (an archaic term for ""familiar acquaintance""), that he does not want to see in his house again. His wife says:     Leave her company? why husband, so long as she is an honest woman, why should I leaue her company? She never gave me hurtfull counsell in all her life, but hath alwaies been ready to tell mee things for my profit, though you take it not so. Leave her company? I am no gyrle I would you should well know, to bee taught what company I should keepe: I keepe none but honest company, I warrant you. Leave her company ketha? Alas poore soule, this reward shee hath for her good will. I wis, I wis, she is more your friend, than you are your owne.   What does ""ketha"" mean here?  It is worth knowing that the word or phrase ""ke-tha"" occurred in Act II, Scene 1 of Pericles, Prince of Tyre, namely in the First Quarto of that play. (Pericles was not included in the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays but was one of the plays in the 1619 False Folio.) The relevant lines go as follows (Per. = Pericles; 1. = First fisherman):     Per. What I haue been, I haue forgot to know;   But what I am, want teaches me to thinke on:   A man throng'd vp with cold, my Veines are chill,   And haue no more of life then may suffize,   To giue my tongue that heat to aske your helpe:   Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,   For that I am a man, pray you see me buried.   1. Die, ke-tha; now Gods forbid't, and I haue a Gowne   heere, come put it on, keepe thee warme: now afore mee a   handsome fellow : Come, thou shalt goe home, and wee'le   haue Flesh for all day, Fish for fasting-dayes and more; or   Puddinges and Flap-iackes, and thou shalt be welcome.   Editors emend ""ke-tha"" to ""quoth-a"" (i.e. quoth he), which is plausible, since the words ""Die, ke-tha"" may be spoken to the second fisherman. However, in the dialogue from Jack of Newbury, there is no third person, and the wife consistently uses ""you"" and ""your"" to refer to her husband, so ""ketha"" cannot plausibly be emended to ""quoth-a"" here. This leaves us with the question what it actually means.  "

"
862,Which part or quote in Cicero is Greene referring to?,"In Robert Greene's novel Gwydonius; The Carde of Fancie, one of the characters, Castania, uses the following words in her rejection of Gwydonius (italics from the origin; bold by me):     Better it is Gwydonius, to live in griefe, then to die desperately without grace: better to choose a lingering life in miserie, then a speedie death without mercie, better to be tormented with haplesse fancie, the with hellish fiends, for in life it is possible to redresse miserie. Tully, Gwydonius, in his Tusculans questions, discoursing of the happinesse of life and heavinesse of death, saith, that to live we obtaine it of the loving Gods, but to dye, of the unluckie destinies: meaning heereby, that life though never so loathsome, is better than death, though never so welcome: whereby I conclude Gwydonius, that to live carefully, is better than to die desperately.   The combination of ""Tully"" and ""Tusculans"" makes clear that Castania is referring to Cicero's Tusculanae Disputationes or Tusculan Disputations, but it is not clear whether she is quoting (more or less accurately) a specific passage or summarizing a larger section (or even a more general idea expressed in Tusculanae Disputationes. My first searches did not make me any wiser. "
863,What work or story about Lampana and Cleophila is Robert Greene referring to?,"In Robert Greene's novel Gwydonius; The Carde of Fancie, the character Melytta  has guessed that Castania has fallen in love. At the end of a long speech, she says to Castania (italics from the original),     But if in all these supposes I have mist the marke, and have not toucht the case of thy calamitie, unfolde unto me Castania, what the paine is that thus doth pinch thee, and assure thy selfe I will be so secret in they affaires, as ever Lampana was to her Ladie Cleophila.    What story is Melytta (or Robert Greene) referring to? I have tried several searches varying the spelling of both names but came out empty-handed. Or did Lampana guard Cleophila's secret so well that no one could write a story about it?   There is a Cleophila in The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, which Philip Sidney may have started writing in the late 1570s. However, I have not been able to find the name ""Lampana"" in that text.  "
864,"Story ends with son washing dishes, flinging dishwater outside in the cold","This short story was told by a narrator and was something about an unsavory man. I don't remember how he was unsavory exactly.   The only part I remember is the ending: the narrator is outside the UM's house, and is surprised to see the UM's son come outside with a pot of water -- he'd finished washing the dishes -- and he flings the hot water out into the yard, and it's steaming in the cold (snow?). The narrator was surprised that the son would even do the dishes. IIRC the house was in a rural area.  I believe it was written in English. I read it around 2008. It seemed to be written in fairly modern times, perhaps in the last 50 years or so. It was part of an anthology. I'm thinking it may have been part of a college literature class, but I can't swear to it.  That's about all I remember. Anyone know what this story is? "

869,How long had Bertha Mason been in the attic at the point of the events in Jane Eyre,"I am trying to work out how long Bertha Mason had been locked up by the time we reach Thornfield in the story. This is part of an argument I am working for work and I haven't been able to find a definite amount of time. Adding to this variations in timeline if we add Wide Sargasso Sea I have had some trouble working it out.  It can be assumed it's at the least around ten years since we know Adèle is just under ten years old. Mr. Rochester's travels that led to him meeting Celine were likely started after he had returned to England, with Bertha having already exhibited signs of her maladies back in Jamaica. From what I could gather it seems he locked her up as soon as he returned after the deaths of his father and brother.  Is this about right as accurate time for how long she had been in the attic? Anything else that I can look at to work out the timelines? I would prefer the answers mainly from the Jane Eyre text but will also accept anything that can help from Wide Sargasso Sea. "

After the widow and Jack, the priest tells her that the bridegroom (whom the widow simply invented) has not arrived yet. The widow answers (italics from the original),     Is it true (quoth the Widow)? I promise you I will stay no longer for him, if hee were as good as George a Green: and therefore dispatch (quoth she) and marry mee to my man Iohn.   What does it mean to be ""as good as George a Green""? Where does this expression come from? "

873,Did William Shakespeare hide things in his writings?,"I was reading Shakespeare's third sonnet, and I noticed something funny. I am going to put in bold all the capital letters in the sonnet itself.          Sonnet III         When fortie Winters shall beseige thy brow,    And digge deep trenches in thy beauties field,    Thy youthes proud liuery so gaz’d on now,    Wil be a totter’d weed of smal worth held:    Then being askt, where all thy beautie lies,    Where all the treasure of thy lusty daies;    To say within thine owne deepe sunken eyes,    Were an all-eating shame, and thriftlesse praise.    How much more praise deseru’d thy beauties vse,    If thou couldst answere this faire child of mine    Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse    Proouing his beautie by succession thine.    This were to be new made when thou art ould,    And see thy blood warme when thou feel’st it could.   There is an odd letter out, namely, the second W from ""Winters"". Since this is not the beginning of a line, then the capitalised letter can only be a reference to a name.  If I look at ""Winters shall"" I can see ""Winters shall"" to make ""Wi sha"" for ""William Shakespeare"" which is the name of the author who wrote this sonnet.    Is this a coincidence? Did William Shakespeare hide things in his writings? (I hope he did, because that would be cool.) "
874,Was the N.I.C.E. director modelled on H. G. Wells?,"Wikipedia claims that the character of Horace Jules in C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength - ostensibly the Director and boss of the N.I.C.E. organisation, in reality a figurehead manipulated by those truly in the know - was      in part a caricature of H. G. Wells   However, the reference for this claim is a link which supposedly gives a ""very detailed analysis"" but which leads me only to a login page.  What is the evidence for this claim? I'm interested to know if Lewis was really lampooning a fellow writer, and if so why. Does the character of Jules bear any resemblance to Wells or Lewis's idea of him? "

876,Origin of “walking to the end of the rainbow”,"I have a problem translating a particular idiom to an other language (Arabic if this is relevant). The idiom is as in the title: ""People of that age [middle aged people in their 40's] become little more than children. You drag the horizon of youth along with you, like the reverse of walking to the end of the rainbow.""  Every reference I found on the internet is about a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Whereas I can remember two other versions of it. The first being that a child reaching the end of the rainbow either turns them into the opposite sex or makes them an adult. Obviously the latter is the version intended by the author.  My question is: Are there any geographical or cultural distribution for these differences? Like American children believe that the rainbow will make them adults and the British children will find a pot of gold?    I asked this question on ELU and was told to ask it here.

879,Wizard's appearances in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"It's been a long time since I read the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but Wikipedia confirms my memory of events.  When the four protagonists appear individually before the Wizard, he has a different appearance for each of them:   The Scarecrow sees a beautiful woman The Tin Woodsman sees a monster The Cowardly Lion sees a ball of fire   But these are all jumbled.  It was the Scarecrow who was afraid of fire, the Woodsman who could not love, and the Lion who was afraid of monsters.  Was there a purpose to this?  Was it meant to imply that the Wizard was an idiot?  Some other symbolism that I just didn't see? "

Here are the lyrics:     I won't ever tell on you   Ever see me do   I wait forever for you        Figure out your problem with me is you   I won't be like you   Ever see right through   I wait forever for you       Figure out your problem with me is you   I won't ever tell on you   Ever see right through   I wait forever for you      Figure out your problem with me is you   You come running through      Figure out your problem with me is you   I won't ever tell   SOURCE: Google Lyrics   Any thoughts or insights are appreciated, also commentary on the song by Bjelland.

882,Is it common to reveal suspense in epilogue?,"According to the dictionary epilogue means     a speech or piece of text that is added to the end of a play or book,   often giving a short statement about what happens to the characters   after the play or book finishes.   When I read book sometime I skip epilogue section and finished my reading because it generally have details about what happens to characters and some other details.  But last time when I read 1st To Die by James Patterson, which is a suspense thriller, important details about the suspense were revealed in the Epilogue. The ""end"" of the book is really good one, and I was originally going to just finish the book and skip the Epilogue, but for some reason I continued with epilogue section. It turns out that there was a twist in the story and that actual suspense was revealed. If I didn't read epilogue, I would've missed actual reason for killing.  Is it common to reveal suspense or other important plot details in Epilogue section? Or is this just a new trend to add a conclusion in that section?  How important Epilogue is relating to the story?  I've read a decent number of suspense-thriller books and this is the only example I've seen so far where there was a conclusion added in Epilogue section. "

In her summary of the paper (n6, pp 6/7), Patterson states, without elaborating further, that:     it was in the sixth century that the body of Hermogenes’ work was divided into the sections now recognised.   Hence the question: what was the structure of Hermogenes’ Art of Rhetoric prior to this? "
884,How do Hamlet's thoughts and doubts about the afterlife affect him?,"In Hamlet, there are many references to the afterlife, god, and what the consequences of his actions are.  My question is this: Did Hamlet's pre-conceptions about the afterlife ultimately affect his choice to kill his uncle or not?  More specifically, why did Hamlet not kill Claudius when he had the perfect chance? Why did he then change his mind and wildly shove the rest of the poison in his mouth later? Why does Hamlet not feel the proper motivation to kill him beforehand?  A thorough explanation would be appreciated. "
885,"How can the mouse in ""If You Give A Mouse A Cookie"" repeat his actions?","From Wikipedia:     A boy gives a cookie to a mouse. The mouse asks for a glass of milk. He then requests a straw (to drink the milk), a mirror (to avoid a milk mustache), nail scissors (to trim his hair in the mirror), and a broom (to sweep up his hair trimmings)   Considering that the whole point of the book (and its sequels) is that the story is a neverending loop, how can the mouse repeat his actions? Shouldn't he get stopped by the trimming his whiskers part? After all, once they're trimmed, they're trimmed? "
886,Why is Sergeant Shadwell obsessed with nipples?,"One of the many recurring gags in Good Omens is Sergeant Shadwell's obsession with nipples. For example:   One of the first questions he asks Newt when recruiting him to the Witchfinder Army is how many nipples he's got. When Aziraphale recruits him in turn to help deal with the Adam situation, he asks suspiciously how many nipples this Antichrist has, and Aziraphale lies to convince him to help. Finally, when he ""pops the question"" to Madame Tracy, it's not a marriage proposal but the question of how many nipples she's got.   What is the significance of this obsession with nipples? Is it just something to make certain readers snigger? Is there actually a traditional connection between witchcraft and nipples? Something else I'm missing? Many of what seem to be meaningless jokes in Good Omens have actually turned out to be obscure cultural references, so I wonder if this is another such case. "
887,"Was C.P. Snow's ""The Two Cultures"" about Britain specifically or western culture in general?","I was reading the Wikipedia page on C.P. Snow's article/lecture/book The Two Cultures, about the divide between science and the humanities in academia. The Wikipedia page seems to have a contradiction, and I haven't got the original text to check, so I'm not sure which is right.  Firstly, at the beginning of the Wikipedia page:     Its thesis was that ""the intellectual life of the whole of western society"" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the sciences and the humanities – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.   Then later on, it says:     Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the British educational system as having, since the Victorian era, over-rewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek) at the expense of scientific and engineering education [...] By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age.   The quote marks around ""the intellectual life of the whole of western society"" suggests it's a direct quote, but surely Germany and America are also part of western society, and yet Snow apparently held them up as better examples than Britain in this respect. What was he really saying?  Did ""The Two Cultures"" condemn Britain specifically, or the west in general? "
888,"Vision of the future in Max Beerbohm's ""Enoch Soames""","Max Beerbohm's 1916 novelette ""Enoch Soames"" (available e.g. at Project Gutenberg) is the story of a man who sells his soul to the devil for the privilege of spending an afternoon in a library (the reading room of the British Museum) 100 years in the future, in the year 1997, so that he can see how he is remembered by posterity. (It wasn't worth it.) The author and narrator, Beerbohm, questions his friend Soames upon his return from the future:     ""That's right. Try to remember everything. Eat a little more bread. What did the reading-room look like?""   ""Much as usual,"" he at length muttered.   ""Many people there?""   ""Usual sort of number.""   ""What did they look like?""   Soames tried to visualise them. ""They all,"" he presently remembered, ""looked very like one another.""   My mind took a fearsome leap. ""All dressed in Jaeger?""   ""Yes. I think so. Greyish-yellowish stuff.""   ""A sort of uniform?"" He nodded. ""With a number on it, perhaps?—a number on a large disk of metal sewn on to the left sleeve? DKF 78,910—that sort of thing?"" It was even so. ""And all of them—men and women alike—looking very well-cared-for? very Utopian? and smelling rather strongly of carbolic? and all of them quite hairless?"" I was right every time. Soames was only not sure whether the men and women were hairless or shorn. ""I hadn't time to look at them very closely,"" he explained.   Soames has copied out a passage from a book, which tells us a little more about life in that fictional future (spelling reform and socialism):     From p. 234 of Inglish Littracher 1890–1900, bi T. K. Nupton, published bi th Stait, 1992:   Fr. egzarmpl, a riter ov th time, naimd Max Beerbohm, hoo woz stil alive in th twentieth senchri, rote a stauri in wich e pautraid an immajnari karrakter kauld 'Enoch Soames'—a thurd-rait poit hoo beleevz imself a grate jeneus an maix a bargin with th Devvl in auder ter no wot posterriti thinx ov im!

My question: The world of 1997 described here—bald heads, uniforms with numeric badges, and the rest—is obviously meant as parody. Can you identify the specific work(s) of utopian or visionary literature that most likely inspired it? (I'm not sure if we should be looking at works that were current in 1916 when the story was published, or in 1897 when it is set.)  "
889,"Why does Anastasia describe her reaction to Christian as ""irrational""?","I'm reading Fifty Shades of Grey. There's one passage that I don't understand:     I close my eyes and take a deep, purifying breath, trying to recover what’s left of my equilibrium. No man has ever affected me the way  Christian Grey has, and I cannot fathom why. Is it his looks? His civility? Wealth? Power? I don’t understand my irrational reaction.   On one hand, this seems like a stupid question. Anastasia spends the next paragraph talking about how handsome he is. On the other hand, Fifty Shades of Grey seems to be popular, and presumably the language has some role in its popularity.  Why does Anastasia describe her reaction as ""irrational""? Why can't she understand it? "
890,JKR says that Hermione shouldn't have married Ron. Is this correct?,"In an interview, JKR says that Hermione would not have married Ron:     She told the magazine: ""I wrote the Hermione-Ron relationship as a   form of wish fulfilment. That's how it was conceived, really.      ""For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more   to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione   ended up with Ron.      ""I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some   fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective   on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for   reasons of credibility.      ""Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not.""      The author said the duo would have likely needed relationship   counselling, while Watson herself also doubted the couple's potential   longevity.      ""I think there are fans out there who know that too and who wonder   whether Ron would have really been able to make her happy,"" Watson   told the Sunday Times.   Of course, in the books, Hermione does marry Ron and not Harry. So JKR's proclamation that Hermione would not marry Ron seems odd to say the least.  Based on what we know about the two characters, is this correct? Should JKR's word overrule the text of the books in this case? "
891,Why is it called Watership Down?,"I am an American, so to me the title ""Watership Down"" sounds like it is about a boat that is underwater, either a submarine or a sunken surface ship. I now understand that a down is a term for a hill in England (where the book is set), and 'down' makes sense as you read the book.    But why ""Watership""? Does this have a non-nautical meaning that I am not aware of?    Why wasn't a more lapine (rabbit) down or at least a less nautical word chosen for the name of the book?  "
892,Did Frodo have a prophetic dream?,"Right before Frodo and company head into the Old Forest, Frodo has this dream.      Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be   looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down   below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and   snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later. Then   he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a great   wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was   not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never   heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams.   Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees after   all. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the   air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone   on a high ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the tower and   see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower:   but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of   thunder.   Was this dream supposed to be in some way prophetic, foretelling his future sailing to the Undying Lands? Or was there another reason/outcome for this dream? "
893,Was Poe's The Pit and the Pendulum at all inspired by A Predicament?,"Poe's satirical short story A Predicament tells the story of a woman who is slowly decapitated by the minute hand of a large cathedral clock. In all its ridiculous, it was supposed to be a horror parody, a bit unlike much of the rest of Poe's writings. It was published in 1838; four years later, Poe published The Pit and the Pendulum, a serious and more elaborate short story where the protagonist narrowly escapes death at the hand of a swinging pendulum that comes closer and closer.  Given some of the similarities, I was wondering if Poe wrote The Pit and the Pendulum to further emphasize the absurdity of A Predicament and some serious works of the genre, or if he decided to write a serious story following a similar plot.   Did Poe ever comment on the similarities of the two stories? It's quite possible that he didn't, in which case I'd be absolutely fine with interpretations from the texts. Is there evidence from the stories that suggests that he intended the two to be alike? "
894,"In ""Sounder"", why is the dog the only character with a name?","The book Sounder strikes me as quite unique, in that it gives a lot of detail, and yet most of the characters, even main characters like the boy and his father, are not named. The only character with a name is the dog, Sounder. And yet this seems so natural, that I didn't even notice it the first couple times I read the book.  Is there any special significance to the dog being the only named character? Why do none of the other characters have names? "
895,What are the charactaristics of German Trümmerliteratur?,Trümmerliteratur is a literary movement that originated in Germany shortly after the Second World War. What are typical charactaristics of Trümmerliteratur?  How can a work that is Trümmerliteratur be recognized as such? 
896,"Why is the poem ""Yggdrasil"" placed where it is in House of Leaves, and which narrator included it?","At the very end of House of Leaves, there's a page:        The word ""Yggdrasil"" doesn't appear anywhere else in the book, and the index, which amusingly lists every word in the book and where it shows up (including some that don't), confirms this.  I've got a lot of questions about this poem.   Why does Danielewski bring this poem in quite suddenly on the last page of the book, without any clear callbacks to any other references in the book? As far as I'm aware, the notion of a world tree doesn't appear anywhere else, and the book doesn't contain clear allusions to Norse mythology as a whole.  Which narrator in House of Leaves are we supposed to interpret as the one who decided to include this page? Is there anything to suggest which one of them it should be? The poem is supposed to be interpreted as physically looking like the worldtree itself: the ""Ygg"" and dot at the top are the canopy, ""d/r/a/s/i/l"" makes the trunk, the poem forms the base. But... what is the large ""O"" supposed to mean at the bottom of the poem?  "
897,What is the distinction between Imagism and Symbolism as poetic movements?,"I have recently been reading about symbolism and imagism and they seem to me to be connected in that they were in some ways the opposite of each other, one being the movement to add greater symbolic meaning to poetry and the other being a movement to add greater precision in imagery, which is not necessarily non-symbolic. I see ways in which they are both the same and different, but I may be interpreting these wrong. So, what is the distinction between Imagism and Symbolism? How are they related? "
898,Is there any evidence the Party was atheistic?,"Generally, most totalitarian regimes in history have been atheistic, shunning any form of religion and creating a cult of mass worship towards the leader(s) of the government. Does this hold true for the Party in 1984, or does the Party endorse a religion? If so, what religion?  I've done some background research on this, and I've found that Orwell was strongly against anti-Semitism. From Wikipedia:     Writing in early 1945 a long essay titled ""Antisemitism in Britain,"" for the Contemporary Jewish Record, Orwell stated that anti-Semitism was on the increase in Britain, and that it was ""irrational and will not yield to arguments."" He argued that it would be useful to discover why anti-Semites could ""swallow such absurdities on one particular subject while remaining sane on others.""   ...     In Nineteen Eighty-Four, written shortly after the war, Orwell portrayed the Party as enlisting anti-Semitic passions against their enemy, Goldstein.    Thus, obviously the Party was anti-Semitic, but what religion does the Party does follow or encourage? I'm looking for answers supported by textual evidence. "
899,"If Tolkien disliked allegory, why are there so many allegorical readings of The Lord of the Rings?","There is a famous quote from J.R.R. Tolkien in which he states his hatred of allegorical writing.     ""I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always   have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.   I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability   to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse   applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the   reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.""   Yet many people have found The Lord of the Rings to be a very obvious allegory for the First World War, or less obviously for the industrial revolution, the atomic age or for the Christian faith.  It's possible that people may be putting a meaning onto the work that was not in the author's intention. But this seems unlikely given Tolkien's level of learning and the very clear parallels with the world war. Did he really not intend it as an allegory? If so, how does this square with his dislike of allegory? "
900,Do we know whether Hamilton's Federalist papers were ever edited or vetted?,"After reading through The Federalist Papers, I've come to the general conclusion that Hamilton's essays are, by and large, a stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'd be able to say exactly why, but after running the Papers through a word counter, it turns out that the average sentence length is around 30 to 40 words. The longest sentence in the Papers is actually 200 words:     The recommendatory act of Congress is in the words following: “WHEREAS, There is provision in the articles of Confederation and perpetual Union, for making alterations therein, by the assent of a Congress of the United States, and of the legislatures of the several States; and whereas experience hath evinced, that there are defects in the present Confederation; as a mean to remedy which, several of the States, and PARTICULARLY THE STATE OF NEW YORK, by express instructions to their delegates in Congress, have suggested a convention for the purposes expressed in the following resolution; and such convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing in these States A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT: “Resolved, That in the opinion of Congress it is expedient, that on the second Monday of May next a convention of delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose OF REVISING THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS THEREIN, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed by the States, render the federal Constitution ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION.   You don't have to read that. You probably shouldn't, honestly.   But this is by far not the only example of this sort of stream-of-consciousness meandering excess in the Papers. I know Hamilton was operating on a short time-scale when writing, drafting, revising, submitting, and printing these essays. But this smacks of a disregard for any sort of editing process.  This sort of leads me to wonder: were the Federalist Papers ever edited in a thorough and rigorous way? If so, by whom? And if so, what on earth were they checking for, and what changes did they make (if we know)?  I'm more interested in whether there is evidence that they were vetted by a third party, but if there's information on Hamilton's approach to self-editing that could be relevant, I'd count that, too.  "
901,Are hexagons directly connected to each other?,"In The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, the speaker describes hallways in between the hexagonal rooms as,     One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest.    So, he describes them as being narrow, but he does not describe them as small. However, the only English-language interpretation, I can find analyzing the organization of the hallways, assumes that the hexagonal rooms connect directly and therefore uses this to restrict the number of possible organizations. Also, the text never states that the hallway is straight, does not branch off, and is between only two rooms.   Is the interpretation used by the linked interpretation correct? Or can hallways connect multiple hexagonal rooms?   Does the original Spanish get more specific? "
902,How accurate are Rick Riordan's portrayals of ancient myths?,"The story of Cadmus and Harmonia as presented in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, is unique in claiming that Harmonia became mortal:     Cadmus wasn’t sure he should be stealing the dragon’s dental work, especially if he was already on Ares’s naughty list, but he did as Athena commanded. When he was done with his tooth farming, a bunch of super-elite skeleton warriors sprang from the ground, and these became the first soldiers in the new Theban army. Cadmus built his city. For a while, everything was copacetic. The gods even granted him a minor goddess for his wife—Harmonia, who was a daughter of Aphrodite and Ares. Harmonia became mortal to share her life with Cadmus, which was a pretty big honor.       ""Ares, The Manly Man's Manly Man"", Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, Rick Riordan   I realize Mr. Riordan's books target a younger audience, and this may seem like a minor detail in the grand scheme of making the myths accessible to youngsters. However, I feel it's a rather important one as Gods (and other immortals) turning into mortals is not something that happens in Greek mythology. The only story I know of that comes close is Castor and Pollux, yet not close enough, as the twins alternate between mortality and immortality. As for Harmonia, I checked several ancient versions of the myth, and she remains immortal in all.   Has Rick Riordan ever commented on how accurate his portrayals are intended to be? And given that several of the stories he presents may differ significantly from source to source, has he ever provided a list of sources he used in his research of the myths?     This was inspired by a Mythology Stack Exchange question: Are there any Greek myths of a god permanently turning into a mortal as punishment? "
903,"How do real-world languages exist in ""The Library of Babel""?","In The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, the narrator tells us:     He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections.    In this quote the speaker references Portuguese, Guarani, Yiddish, and ""Arabian inflections"". While the combinations of some of these terms are nonsensical, the terms themselves originate from real world places and languages. But The Library of Babel is supposed to take place in a universe all its own, so how does the speaker know what these languages are?  How do these languages exist in The Library of Babel? "
904,"In what order should the ""Cemetery of Forgotten Books"" series be read?","I have recently ordered the books from The Cemetery of Forgotten Books series. I know that I will be receiving The Angel's Game before The Shadow of The Wind since The Angel's Game was published after The Shadow of The Wind, and this makes me think that I should read them in publication order. However, I also know that The Angel's Game is a prequel to The Shadow of The Wind and sometimes I have found that reading a prequel first can be just as enjoyable.   So, would it be better to read The Angel's Game before The Shadow of The Wind? Additionally, in what order should The Cemetery of Forgotten Books series be read for the most enjoyable experience? "
905,"Who is the speaker in ""O Captain! My Captain!""","In ""O Captain! My Captain!"" by Walt Whitman, the speaker acts as if he has a close connection to Abraham Lincoln, saying:     My father does not feel my arm   This suggests that they are in such a relationship that Abraham Lincoln would have felt his arm and was a fatherly figure to the speaker.     But I with mournful tread,      Walk the deck my Captain lies,   Here he describes how while others are on the shore celebrating the metaphorical ship's victory while mourning, he has stayed on the metaphorical ship with Abraham Lincoln to mourn.   Who is the speaker? Is their relationship truly close or is it just the relationship between a citizen and the president? "
906,"Why is the robin ""sobbing""?","Blake's ""The Blossom"", part of his Songs of Innocence which you can read online, is a very short poem about a sparrow and a robin. The part about the robin reads as follows:     Pretty, pretty robin!   Under leaves so green   A happy blossom   Hears you sobbing, sobbing,   Pretty, pretty robin,   Near my bosom.   Why is the robin ""sobbing""? Apart from that it (almost) rhymes with ""robin"", of course. Do the birds in this poem symbolise something else, perhaps something human? The part about a ""cradle narrow"" made me think of a baby, which could also fit with ""sobbing"", but then what's the difference between the sparrow and the robin - do they symbolise two different babies, or what? "
907,"What metaphor(s) are represented by the mysterious figure in Charles Causley's ""Innocent's Song""?","The other day, I came across this rather sinister poem by Charles Causley, set to music.     Innocent's Song          Who's that knocking on the window,   Who's that standing at the door,   What are all those presents   Laying on the kitchen floor?          Who is the smiling stranger   With hair as white as gin,   What is he doing with the children   And who could have let him in?          Why has he rubies on his fingers,   A cold, cold crown on his head,   Why, when he caws his carol,   Does the salty snow run red?          Why does he ferry my fireside   As a spider on a thread,   His fingers made of fuses   And his tongue of gingerbread?           Why does the world before him   Melt in a million suns,   Why do his yellow, yearning eyes   Burn like saffron buns?          Watch where he comes walking   Out of the Christmas flame,   Dancing, double-talking:          Herod is his name.       It can be taken at face value as a poetic rendering of Herod's order for the murder of children at what would become Christmas-time.   However, several of the lines, particularly the reference to ""fuses"" and""melt in a million suns"" make it clear this is a metaphor. Apparently, Causley's work often shows a strong anti-war sentiment, which seems a likely interpretation. However, conflating it with Christmas and the murder of innocents seems an odd choice.  In addition, the un-named figure in the poem has a sense of the mythic about it, and the legends of South West England are another common theme in Causley's poems. This fits better with the Christmas setting, but seems to jar with the ""fuses"".  Are there additional interpretations that I have missed, and is there a central theme threading all the various metaphors together? "
908,"Is ""Fitter Happier"" by Radiohead referring to the perceived futility and ""entrapment"" of the middle-class suburbia lifestyle?","""Fitter Happier"" by Radiohead has the following lyrics:     Fitter, happier   More productive   Comfortable   Not drinking too much   Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week   Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries   At ease   Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats   A patient, better driver   A safer car, baby smiling in back seat   Sleeping well, no bad dreams   No paranoia   Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole   Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then   Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall   Favours for favours, fond but not in love   Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket   No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants   Car wash, also on sundays   No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate   Nothing so childish   At a better pace, slower and more calculated   No chance of escape   Now self-employed   Concerned, but powerless   An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism   Will not cry in public   Less chance of illness   Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat   A good memory   Still cries at a good film   Still kisses with saliva   No longer empty and frantic   Like a cat   Tied to a stick   That's driven into   Frozen winter ****, the ability to laugh at weakness   Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive   A pig in a cage on antibiotics   Not coincidentally, the entire thing is read in a robotic, synthesized voice. Clearly, this is referring to the ""deadening,"" entrapping effects of the lifestyle in question.  Wikipedia describes this as follows:     ""Fitter Happier"" is a short musique concrète track that consists of sampled musical and background sound and spoken-word lyrics recited by a synthesised voice from the Macintosh SimpleText application. The voice belongs to ""Fred"", a synthesised voice included with Macintosh computers. Yorke wrote the lyrics ""in ten minutes"" after a period of writer's block while the rest of the band were playing. He described the words as a checklist of slogans for the 1990s, and he considered the lyrics ""the most upsetting thing I've ever written"", and said it was ""liberating"" to give the words to a neutral-sounding computer voice. Among the samples in the background is an audio loop from the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor. The band considered using ""Fitter Happier"" as the album's opening track, but decided the effect was off-putting.      Steve Lowe called the song ""penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles"" with ""a repugnance for prevailing yuppified social values"". Among the loosely connected imagery of the lyrics, Footman identified the song's subject as ""the materially comfortable, morally empty embodiment of modern, Western humanity, half-salaryman, half-Stepford Wife, destined for the metaphorical farrowing crate, propped up on Prozac, Viagra and anything else his insurance plan can cover."" Sam Steele called the lyrics ""a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is the hum of a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be that we live in such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice.""   Is this song comparable to ""Hotel California"" in a way - you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave (""No chance of escape"")? Or am I missing the point? "
909,How did contemporary readers respond to coincidence in 19th century novels,"Reading 19th century literature in the 21st century, it is often striking how often the plot turns on often quite outrageous coincidences. Frequently this happens when a relatively small cast of characters interact over a lengthy novel.  To take two examples, the Creature in Frankenstein kills Victor's brother and friend without knowing who they are; and the narrative of David Copperfield spans at least two decades in which no more than ten major characters work for each other, live with each other, drown at sea together, or just generally turn up in the same place together without any convincing explanation.  Did contemporary readers just accept this? Were they put off? Was the coincidence necessary to reassure them that it wasn't real in some way? "
910,Has there been any criticism of Bryan Smith's depiction in The Dark Tower series?,"At some point during The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower Roland's ka-tet has to save Stephen King, who ultimately seems to be a representation of one of the tower's beams, from getting hit by a car during one of his walks.  This part, like others of King's depictions, seems to be a largely autobiographical fictionalization of King's real accident in 1999. In fact, apart from the ka-tet's intervention and the ultimate reason for the accident, it even seems to depict the driver and the circumstances leading to the accident quite similarly to how they supposedly happened in reality.  It does, however, not paint the driver Bryan Smith in an all too favourable light, being basically a reckless stoner and coward. While the circumstances of the accident and maybe even his characterization don't seem all too far from reality and after what he did Bryan Smith sure shouldn't have much reason to complain, it raises some moral questions about King treating his accident publicly at the expense of Bryan Smith this way, especially in light of Smith already being dead by then (he died in 2000, on King's birthday actually).  So has there ever been any public criticism of how derogatorily King depicted this real person in the story? Is this just ignored because it is ultimately only a fictionalization? Or was it ignored because it doesn't spread too far from reality? Or has Bryan Smith just not been seen in the moral position to complain after what he did? (I might well have interpreted his depiction as more derogatory than it was, though.) "
911,Is it common practice for cover art to be designed without direct input from the author?,"in the last day or so there's been something of a furore over Terry Goodkind's public criticism of the cover art on his latest novel, Shroud of Eternity. He made a post on Facebook ridiculing the cover art, which has received a lot of attention and a direct response from the understandably offended illustrator, Bastien Lecouffe-Deharme:    (image source)  Goodkind's eventual response to the storm of criticism he received included the following paragraph:     My dissatisfaction with the art isn't the artist's fault, of course; the art was commissioned and directed by the publisher.      The intention of our contest was to instead encourage my publisher to devote more thoughtful consideration with the artwork they wrap around my books.   A previous post by Goodkind on social media, coming in between the two Facebook posts linked above (which I can't find directly now - perhaps it's been deleted - but it can be seen quoted e.g. here), says:     Bastien, we never worked together. I've never met nor have I ever even spoken with you. We've never exchanged a message before today. And I never told you what to create for this cover. All of that was between you and the publisher.   Goodkind's responses suggest that the cover art was worked out between the publisher and the illustrator, without consulting him (the author). Without judging the rights or wrongs or who said what or indeed anything about this particular case, I'm curious about whether this is common practice in today's novel publishing industry.  Is it common practice in publishing for cover art to be designed without direct input from the author?  Notes/clarifications:   I'm asking about situations where the author is still alive. If it makes a difference, assume first publication rather than a new edition of an existing novel.  "
912,Is the Crimson King's first attack on Stephen King based on a real experience from the author's childhood?,"In The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah Eddie and Roland pay a visit to Stephen King in 1977, after learning that he apparently wrote about Pere Callahan's story. In order to learn what is really going on and how King knows about Roland and the Tower, he hypnotizes him, which leads to King telling about an event from his early childhood, where he had to saw wood in the barn of his uncle and was attacked by a group of little red spiders coming from dead chickens, only to be saved by Eddie and Cuthbert Allgood.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""In  the  barn.""  King's  voice  dropped.  His  lips  had  begun  to  tremble.  ""Auntie  sent  me  out  because we tried to run away. [...] Me and my brother Dave. They caught us and brought us back. They said we were bad, bad boys."" [...]   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""That was your punishment.""   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Yes."" A tear welled in the corner of King's right eye. It slipped down his cheek to the edge of his beard. ""The chickens are dead. [...] Uncle Oren says it was avian flu. Their eyes are open. They're . . . a little scary."" [...]   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You couldn't leave the barn?""   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Not  until  I  saw  my  share  of  the  wood.  David  did  his.  It's  my  turn.  There  are  spiders  in  the  chickens.  Spiders  in  their  guts,  little  red  ones.  Like  specks  of  red  pepper.  If  they  get  on  me  I'll  catch the flu and die. Only then I'll come back. [...] I'll be a vampire. I'll be a slave to him. His scribe, maybe. His pet writer. [...] The Lord of the Spiders. The Crimson King, Tower-pent.""   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Christ, Roland,"" Eddie whispered. He was shuddering. What had they found here? What nest had they exposed? ""Sai King, Steve, how old were you — are you?""   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm seven."" A pause. ""I wet my pants. I don't want the spiders to bite    me. The red spiders. But then you came, Eddie, and I went free."" He smiled radiantly, his cheeks gleaming with tears.   Apparently this early experience was the first moment where Stephen King was tempted or attacked by the Crimson King in order to drag him and his creative powers onto his side and where he was ultimately drawn to the ways of Gan instead by Eddie and Cuthbert.  What I wonder is how much this event actually resembles a real event, or even trauma, from Stephen King's childhood. Many parts of the finctionalized King's story in The Dark Tower seem autobiographical to some degree. Was all of this childhood story just made up or does this resemble a real sitaution that happened to Stephen King? Could we even go as far as this experience, if it happened, influencing the imagery of the Crimson King as a big red spider or was that just retrofitted into the existing, possibly less traumatic, real memory?

913,What does 'trusting sorrow' mean here?,"I read the poem 'A Roadside Stand' by Robert Frost, and I have accumulated a few questions through the poem. So, I will be posting some questions from the same poem, if you can please answer my other questions as well. Thanks to all :)  Here, in this paragraph what does Robert Frost mean by 'trusting sorrow'? Is this usable with the same meaning in daily life?  Here you can read the whole poem. Below I have given the particular paragraph.     The hurt to the scenery wouldn't be my complaint   So much as the trusting sorrow of what is unsaid:   Here far from the city we make our roadside stand   And ask for some city money to feel in the hand   To try if it will not make our being expand,  "
914,What does the word 'Avernus' mean in Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu?,"Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu, Chapter 7:     The first change I experienced was rather agreeable. It was very near the turning point from which began the descent of Avernus.   On Wikipedia it says Avernus is an ancient name for a crater in Italy, but that doesn't seem to fit exactly. I looked it up on Google Ngrams too:    The word was very common in the 19th century. Does anyone know what it means? "

They've never seen the sun, but she has. Refusing to believe that it will appear on Venus that day, they lock her into a cupboard, and only remember her - with shame - after the sun has already been and gone.  Was there any real event which inspired this story? E.g. in Bradbury's own childhood, or those of his kids or other people he knew? "

Robert Frost says that the good-doers enforce benefits on the rural farmers, soothe them out of their wits and teach them how to sleep they sleep all day. Here I want to know a few things.   First, How do they enforce benefits? I mean, in what possible way? What possible benefits are being talked about here?   Second, How do they soothe them out of their wits by enforcing benefits?  Last, and most important, How do they make them sleep how they sleep all day? I mean, do they don't work in the day? How do they make them to not work in the day?  I know a little bit about what the poet actually wants to say, but I have very blurred information. So, it will be of grrrrrreat help if someone could elaborately answer the questions I put :) Really, Thanks a looooooot to anyone who makes any efforts :D     It is in the news that all these pitiful kin   Are to be bought out and mercifully gathered in   To live in villages, next to the theatre and the store,   Where they won’t have to think for themselves anymore,   While greedy good-doers, beneficent beasts of prey,   Swarm over their lives enforcing benefits   That are calculated to soothe them out of their wits,   And by teaching them how to sleep they sleep all day,   Destroy their sleeping at night the ancient way.

918,Where is Momo set?,"Every time I start to read the opening paragraphs of Michael Ende's Momo, I think for a moment ""wait, is this set thousands of years ago and I forgot?"" before realising those paragraphs are only backstory to explain the existence of the amphitheatre. Given the modern technology such as cars in the story, the main part of the book is clearly set in at least the 20th century.  Another interesting question is where is it set. The author is German, but many of the characters' names (Beppo, Guido, Salvatore) sound more Spanish or Italian. Is there more evidence, perhaps in minor textual details or even extratextual commentary by the author, to support any particular setting? "
919,Is Ellsworth Toohey just giving the same speech over and over again?,"In a labor meeting, Ellsworth Toohey said the following:     ""... and so, my friends,"" the voice was saying, ""the lesson to be learned from our tragic struggle is the lesson of unity. We shall unite or we shall be defeated. Our will - the will of the disinherited, the forgotten, the oppressed - shall weld us into a solid bulwork, with a common faith and a common goal. This is the time for every man to renounce the thoughts of his petty little problems, of gain, of comfort, of self-gratification. This is the time to merge his self in a great current, in the rising tide which is approaching to sweep us all, willing or unwilling, in to the future. History, my friends, does not ask questions or acquiescence. It is irrevokable, as the voice of the masses that determine it. Let us listen to the call. Let us organize, my brothers. Let us organize. let us organize. Let us organize.   Later, at the inaugural meeting of the ""youth group"" he organized for architects and allied professions, his speech included the following:     ... You are crusaders in the cause of the underpriviledged and the unsheltered. Not by what we are shall we be judged, but by those we seve. Let us stand united in this spirit. Let us - in all matters - be faithful to this new, broader, higher perspective. Let us organize - well, my friends, shall I say - a nobler dream?   This actually sounds remarkably like the previous speech. Is he basically just giving variants of ""let us organize"" speeches over and over again to different audiences? "
920,Was Ellsworth Toohey's public speaking style modeled after Harold Laski?,"The first time that Peater Keating hears Ellsworth Toohey speak, it's described as follows:     It was not a voice, it was a miracle. It unrolled as a velvet banner. It spoke English words, but the resonant clarity of each syllable made it sound like a new language spoken for the first time. It was the voice of a giant.      Keating stood, his mouth open. He did not hear what the voice was saying. He heard the beauty of the sounds without meaning. He felt no need to know the meaning; he could accept anything, he would be led blindly anywhere.   According to Wikipedia, Toohey was at least partially inspired by Harold Laski, and Ayn Rand even attended some of his lectures as part of her research for the book.  With that said, was Harold Laski actually as good of a public speaker as Toohey is described as being? Was Rand basing Toohey's speaking style on Laski's speaking style, or on someone completely different? Or was his speaking style not inspired by anyone in particular? "
921,What does Gulzar actually mean by saying that Earth can hide a river inside?,"The poem ""The Magical Earth"" by Gulzar (from Green Poems, 2014) contains these lines (in the English translation by Pavan K.

Does he mean 'slow death'? How could we put him 'gently' out of his pain?      No, in country money, the country scale of gain,   The requisite lift of spirit has never been found,   Or so the voice of the country seems to complain,   I can't help owning the great relief it would be,   To put these people at one stroke out of their pain.

923,"Understanding the usage of ""Philosophy"" in Uncle Vanya","In ""Uncle Vanya"" by Chekhov, I noticed a usage of the word ""philosophy"" that seemed out of place.     ASTROFF. A woman can only become a man's friend after having first   been his acquaintance and then his beloved—then she becomes his   friend.      VOITSKI. What vulgar philosophy!   And      HELENA. It is tedious, yes, and dreary! You all abuse my husband and   look on me with compassion; you think, ""Poor woman, she is married to   an old man."" How well I understand your compassion! As Astroff said   just now, see how you thoughtlessly destroy the forests, so that there   will soon be none left. So you also destroy mankind, and soon fidelity   and purity and self-sacrifice will have vanished with the woods. Why   cannot you look calmly at a woman unless she is yours? Because, the   doctor was right, you are all possessed by a devil of destruction; you   have no mercy on the woods or the birds or on women or on one another.      VOITSKI. I don't like your philosophy.   While the word makes sense, it seemed like an awkward usage.  Was there any particular purpose to the using that particular word, like a historical, culture, etc. context? Or is it just an artifact of translation? "
924,"Why does the Czech translation of ""Till we have faces"" mean the opposite?","The title of the book Till we have faces by C. S. Lewis is translated into Czech language as Dokud nemáme tvář. I would translate that into English literally as ""While we don't have a face"" or ""Until we don't have a face"", which is not very clear. But in both cases, it is the opposite of the original English name.    EDIT (based on comments): The Czech world dokud can be translated as both until or while. I know that in English until and while is not the same.  My presumption, that the translations means the opposite is based on the fact that in one language the title is about having a face, while it is about NOT having a face in the other.  Why would that be? Does it make sense somehow? Or is it just a mistake? "
925,Was Shakespeare inspired by Olaus Magnus when writing Macbeth?,"One important plot point in Macbeth is that the King feels invincible due to the prophecy that      Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until   Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill   Shall come against him.   (Act 4, Scene 1)   This, of course, happens in the final act, in the form of the soldiers under Malcolm who have cut branches from the wood where they made camp (Act 5, scene 4).  This is similar to a story told by Olaus Magnus in his work on Swedish history and society, Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus, printed in 1555: The Swedish king Hachonis are making war against the Danish king Sigaro, and are camping in a forest. The soldiers are ordered to cut branches and advance slowly on Sigaro's castle. A messenger tells Sigaro that a wood is advancing on his castle, and he interprets this as an omen that his death is near, and he is indeed slain in the following battle. (Book 7, chapter XX; AFAIK, neither of these kings have much if any basis in reality).  In my admittedly limited search for other potential sources I have not found anyone suggesting anywhere else where Shakespeare could have gotten it from.   Is there any evidence for or against Shakespeare taking this story out of Olaus Magnus? Is there any other source to which it is commonly attributed?  Here is a scanned version of the Historia in Latin with a wood cut of soldiers moving with a forest. "
926,What is the Neverending Story's moral about power?,"In Michael Ende's brilliant novel The Neverending Story, the world of Fantastica is ruled by the Childlike Empress, a mysterious ruler who is given a different name each time a new human comes to her world. When Bastian      seeks to take her place as Emperor after she disappears, he is first thwarted by Atreyu and then discovers that by seizing power he would have doomed himself to oblivion and insanity.   What message does The Neverending Story promote in terms of power? Does it want its readers to come away with the idea that power corrupts and seeking it is a bad thing? Or that power should remain in the hands of those who have always held it? Or something else entirely? "
927,How culturally mixed were the Earth ambassadors in Hard to Be a God?," Anton, aka ""Don Rumata of Estor"", is Russian. Pashka, aka ""Don Hug, first groom of the chamber of his lordship the Duke of Irukan"", is Russian. Alexander Vassilevitch, aka ""Don Kondor, Supreme Judge and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Mercantile Republic of Soan"" (and other titles), is Russian. Even the other Earth observers mentioned only in passing, such as those we hear about near the beginning who violated the Prime Directive failed in their missions by interfering too much, seem to have Russian names.   How culturally mixed are the Earth observers on the planet, really? Is it just a coincidence, or due to the fact that he knew them of old on Earth, that Anton and his closest friends are all Russian?  For that matter, what is the political situation back on Earth - is there some kind of United Earth organising these missions to other planets, or is the entire expedition a Russian-specific thing?  (Sorry if this is made clear later on in the book; I'm only on Chapter 7 at the moment.) "
928,Understanding political subtexts in the Turing test paper,"Alan Turing's article ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" (which you can read online) is commonly interpreted as introducing the Turing test. Briefly, the Turing test is when you have two computer terminals, one controlled by a human in different room, and another controlled by a computer. A second human then has to determine which terminal is the human-controlled terminal and which is the computer-controlled terminal.  However, if you read the actual text of the article, you will notice something strange. The test Turing proposes at the introduction is actually a test to see if someone can identify a terminal controlled by a man from a terminal controlled by a woman:     The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation game."" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either ""X is A and Y is B"" or ""X is B and Y is A."" The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:   It's only at the end of the article that Turing brings computers into play. He asks what would happen if a machine replaced the man, and whether the game would change. Turing reasons that if the third human identified the human man from the human woman at the same rate the third human identifies the machine pretending to be a man from the human woman, then the machine is indistinguishable from being a human.     We now ask the question, ""What will happen when a machine takes the part of [the man] in this game?"" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, ""Can machines think?""   Note that gender continues to play a role in the test. The Turing test, as Turing proposes it, is whether a human can identify a machine from a terminal controlled by a woman. Never in his paper does Turing propose a test where the only thing a human has to identify a terminal controlled by a human whose gender is unspecified from a computer controlled terminal.  My question is, why talk about gender at all? In particular, why talk about gender at the very beginning of the paper, and only later discuss the (presumably) real topic of the paper, computers?  Note that it's extremely unlikely that this is ""random"" (whatever ""random"" means in the context of literature).    This answer has gotten a lot of answers arguing that gender has nothing to do with the test. I suppose this is a good thing: it's good to get a lot of different viewpoints. However, a possible answer that no one has considered yet is that Turing's paper may be related to various tropes about AI and gender. An answer arguing along that lines is something I would really be interested in reading.  If you're interested in writing such an answer but worried that it will get buried under the other answers here, don't worry! I'll accept the first good answer I see, which will move the answer to the top of the answers.  If you're unconvinced that such an answer exists, I would encourage you to take a closer look at Tariq Ali's excellent answer, which cites a paper dedicated to rebutting interpretations of Turing's paper that focus on gender. I'm interested in an answer that explains the arguments that Tariq Ali's answer rebuts. "
929,What's up with the colors of Delirium's speech bubbles?,"In the prologue to Season of Mists (The Sandman #21), the Endless are gathered for a family meeting. Each of them talks with a different typeface, to help differentiate their manners of speech and personality.  I'm wondering why Delirium speaks with colored speech bubbles. I understand that the shifting font size shows her to be slightly tipsy and not quite coherent, but I wonder what quality of speech might be indicated by the changing colors of the bubbles. Is it just more of the same, or do the colors indicate something else about Delirium's speech? (Whimsy, perhaps? My brother noticed that the colors of the speech bubbles in one panel matched the colors of the butterflies that Delirium created.)  Take this example from page 8, with three or four different colors in the bubbles (left), and the panel with the butterflies from page 13 (right):    "
930,Why are Delirium's eyes of two colors?,"In The Sandman #21, some of the various members of the Endless families receive short biographic descriptions. Here's part of Delirium's (p 10):     For Delirium was once Delight. And although that was long ago now,   even today her eyes are badly matched: one eye is a vivid emerald   green, spattered with silver flecks that move; her other eye is vein   blue.      Who knows what Delirium sees, through her mismatched eyes?   Is there a reason her eyes are two different colors? It appears from the above passage that it may have something to do with her development from Delight; is one color normally associated with delight, and the other with delirium?  The Wikia page says ""One of her eyes is blue, and the other is green, though she can adjust them to the same color but says that hurts her,"" but doesn't mention why (in-universe or out) the eyes are different colors. "
931,Why does Morpheus look like Neil Gaiman?,"I'm probably revealing my ignorance about The Sandman and comic books here. Why does Morpheus look like the writer who created him, Neil Gaiman?   On the left - younger Neil Gaiman (src); on the right - Morpheus from Preludes and Nocturnes    Is this just a random choice? Or is there a deeper thematic significance? "
932,What does a dog barking at a crow signify?,"In Much ado about nothing by William Shakespeare, Act 1 Scene 1, Beatrice declares to Benedick     'I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swears he loves me.'   I understand that Beatrice is basically saying 'I would rather X than hearing a man say he loves me.' But I don't understand the dog barking at a crow bit.  What does a dog barking at a crow signify?  I did some research and found that a crow is a bad omen, so perhaps the dog barking is warning the owner of a bad omen? "
933,"Is this a political reference in ""Ozma of Oz""?","Ozma of Oz, one of the several rather lesser-known sequels to L Frank Baum's classic The Wizard of Oz (full text here), contains the following passage in Chapter 6, ""The Heads of Langwidere"":     To their disappointment they found the door tightly closed. A sign was tacked to the panel which read as follows:           OWNER ABSENT.     Please Knock at the Third Door in the Left Wing.         ""Now,"" said Tiktok to the captive Wheeler, ""you must show us the way to the Left Wing.""      ""Very well,"" agreed the prisoner, ""it is around here at the right.""      ""How can the left wing be at the right?"" demanded Dorothy, who feared the Wheeler was fooling them.      ""Because there used to be three wings, and two were torn down, so the one on the right is the only one left. It is a trick of the Princess Langwidere to prevent visitors from annoying her.""   I read this book as a child and thought it was nothing more than an amusing pun - the ""left"" wing being the right wing because it was the only one left. Years later, when I'd become somewhat more ""spoiled"" by life, I realised that it might be a political joke: when the political left wing and centre have disappeared, the right wing ends up being portrayed as the left wing.  Is this actually a political reference, or am I reading too much into it?  While I've read most of Baum's Oz series - albeit when I was probably too young to pick up on many political allegories - I don't know enough about his political leanings or other relevant surrounding context to be able to judge whether this reading is a valid interpretation or not. "
934,Are the guardians of Dream's palace based on mythology? Are they symbolic?,"In chapter 3 of Season of Mists (The Sandman #24), there are three creatures shown guarding the gates of Dream's palace (left). The lion refers to the whole group as ""Gatekeepers"" (p 20-21).         page 21                            page 20   (click either image to embiggen)  The creatures are an eagle-faced lion (I couldn't find a name for a creature like this on Wikipedia's list -- I'd call it a griffin, as Wikia and Wikipedia do, if it had wings), a red wyvern1, and a Pegasus (or a winged horse; both wikis identify this as a ""hippogriff,"" which I think is incorrect because it has four horsey legs).  These creatures are also shown, with very slight variation2, in ""A Dream of a Thousand Cats"" (The Sandman #18, p 13). Notably, the eagle-faced lion has wings (and may have a simian body; it's hard to tell through the trees), and the red dragon is green. The winged horse appears unchanged.  Is this grouping of creatures based on anything in mythology? I might have taken them for mere random elements in the cosmology of The Sandman, but for their recurrence from issue #18 to #24 (and, apparently, in future issues as well). Is this a traditional set of mythical beasts, or are they merely (consistent) random elements in Gaiman's world?   Might they have a symbolic meaning? Each of these creatures is associated with some symbolic and/or heraldic meaning. Do their presence or actions in the Sandman stories represent something deeper about the Sandman, or the Dreaming?    1 I would have called it a dragon, but Morpheus calls it ""Wyvern"" in Brief Lives chapter 2 (#42).  2 At least, in my library's copy of the book. We have found differences in editions of The Sandman in an earlier question on this site. "
935,Will Moon age while he's outside of the sword?,"In ""Sun, Moon, Dust"" by Ursula Vernon, there are three warriors who have lived for many years inside a sword. When the sword is passed down to a young boy as an inheritance, the warriors are surprised to discover that he does not even have the spark of a desire for power and conquest. Dust is very upset, Sun is content to wait in the sword until the next to bear it with intent for war comes along, while Moon rediscovers agriculture, choosing to remain outside of the sword to farm the land together with Allpa.  Sun removed Moon's gem from the sword when he decided to tarry outside of it. Is Moon's decision permanent? Will Moon age while he's outside of the sword? Will he die, eventually? (Is there enough information in this story to tell?)  I wonder about this, because if Moon gives up his (health and) longevity in order to spend time with Allpa, his story becomes that much more touching. "
936,Were there any clues given about Shadow's father?,"The protagonist of American Gods, Shadow Moon, has never met his father. His mother had refused to share information about his father with him as well:     — Tell me about my father.   — He’s dead. Don’t ask about him.   — But who was he?   — Forget him. Dead and gone and you ain’t missed nothing.   — I want to see a picture of him.   — I ain’t got a picture,   Chapter sixteen.   But then comes a revelation:      Wednesday fathered Shadow.   But Shadow is not surprised at this:      Shadow found that he was completely unsurprised when he recognized the man who dances with her. He had not changed that much in thirty-three years. Ibid.   Why wasn't he surprised? There certainly weren't any hints from his mother, and his father didn't hint at it either.  "
937,Why was it necessary to have the page dress up as a woman?,"In the beginning of The Taming of the Shrew, the Lord has his page dress up as a woman:     Sirrah, you go get Bartholomew, my page,   And dress him in all suits like a lady.   That done, escort him to the drunkard's chamber,   And call him ""Madam"", do him obseisance.   I get why it was necessary to have a wife there; it improves the ploy. But why did they need to have Bartholomew dress up? Couldn't they have gotten a real woman to do it? "
938,"Who is the speaker in Leonard Cohen's song, ""Avalanche""?","I understand that some of Cohen's songs have religious context, so when I heard the lyrics of this song that stated, ""You strike my side by accident,"" I thought it could be symbolism of Jesus being stabbed in his side on the cross. Does Cohen have a specific speaker for this song, or is it left to individual interpretation? If there is no specific speaker, what are some speakers that make sense with the symbolism in the song?  A significant piece of the lyrics:     Well I stepped into an avalanche   It covered up my soul;   When I am not this hunchback that you see   I sleep beneath the golden hill   You who wish to conquer pain   You must learn, learn to serve me well      You strike my side by accident   As you go down for your gold   The cripple here that you clothe and feed   Is neither starved nor cold;   He does not ask for your company   Not at the centre, the centre of the world  "
939,"What could be the possible reason behind ""live in fear"" and ""move at liberty"" in the fourth stanza of ""A German Requiem""?","The fourth stanza of the poem ""A German Requiem"" indicates that the widow lived in fear and the young man could not move at liberty between the armchairs. I cannot figure out why. What does the widow fear? And who is the young man? Does that mean the young man could not live at ease?     The better for the widow, that she should not live in fear of surprise,      The better for the young man, that he should move at liberty between the armchairs,        The better that these bent figures who flutter among the graves        Tending the nightlights and replacing the chrysanthemums        Are not ghosts,         That they shall go home.        The bus is waiting, and on the upper terraces        The workmen are dismantling the houses of the dead.    "
940,What is the highest number a comic book issue ever achieved naturally?,"Action Comics #1000 was first published in the US earlier this year.  I got the impression that this seemed to be an unheard of before milestone. Most likely due to the fact that such a daunting number might prevent newcomers from getting involved in a comic book series, publishers use retcons, reboots and restarts to wipe the slate clean and also restart the numbering (and of course you can sell a new issue #1).  So it might actually have been a rarity.  This discussion - rather rude in places, imho -  seems not to be clear on how to go with having an answer to this question:  Problems seem to be:   Are Japanese Manga comic books? Is 2000AD a comic book? (currently on issue #2086 - its wikipedia article calls it a comic magazine, which in turn is a less fancy term for a comics anthology, which both Action Comics and Detective Comics at least started out as.) Are The Beano (currently on issue #3949) and similar publications comic books?   To me, they all seem to be comic books (or at least anthologies, which Action Comics started out as, too), but maybe my intuition is wrong there. My own subjective defintion would be:   Cover (with Artwork) One or more stories Misc stuff: e.g. letters to the editor, advertisement, maybe an editorial or an interview with one of the artists etc   But that could be wrong and an official definition might actually exist (maybe back in the day, due to the US censorship laws one was made?).  After all that preface, here it is:  Which comic book series did indeed go from #1-#X and which X is the highest? "
941,"How do the letters S, U, F, I symbolise the stages of Aziz's life?","In Elif Şafak's novel The Forty Rules of Love, in Aziz's correspondence with Ella, he tells her his life story, completing the final part when he meets her in person. Each part of his life he refers to as his ""encounter with"" a particular letter in the word Sufi.   First he tells her about his wife Margot and how he lost her.     I was a boy once. Love opened up my eyes to a more fulfilled life. After I lost the woman I loved, I metamorphosed drastically. Neither a boy nor an adult, I became a trapped animal. This stage of my life I call my encounter with the letter S in the word “Sufi.”  After his years of drugs and debauchery, he becomes a photographer, and eventually is recommended to the Sufis as a possible way of smuggling him into the holy cities of Islam:     I didn’t know anything about Sufism, and I couldn’t have cared less. As long as they offered to help, I was happy to meet the Sufis. To me they were just a means to an end. But then, at the time, so was everyone and everything else.      Life is odd, Ella. In the end I never made it to Mecca or Medina. Not then, not later. Not even after I converted to Islam. Destiny took me on a different route altogether, one of unexpected twists and turns, each of which changed me so profoundly and irrevocably that after a while the original destination lost its significance. Though motivated by purely materialistic reasons at the outset, when the journey came to an end, I was a transformed man.        As for the Sufis, who could have known that what I had initially seen as a means to an end would very soon become an end in itself? This part of my life I call my encounter with the letter u in the word “Sufi.”  While living with the Sufi brotherhood, he learns about Shams of Tabriz:     I was intrigued. But it was more than simple curiosity. As I listened to Master Sameed tell me more about Shams, I felt a shiver down my spine, an odd feeling of déjà vu.        Now, you are going to think I’m crazy. But I swear to God, at that moment I heard a rustle of silk in the background, first far off, then drawing nearer, and I saw the shadow of someone who wasn’t there. Perhaps it was the evening breeze moving across the branches, or maybe it was a pair of angel wings. Either way, I suddenly knew that I didn’t need to go anywhere. Not anymore. I was sick and tired of always longing to be somewhere else, somewhere beyond, always in a rush despite myself.        I was already where I wanted to be. All I needed was to stay and look within. This new part of my life I call my encounter with the letter f in the word “Sufi.”  Finally, in his hotel room in Boston, he tells her about his cancer and subsequent travels around the world:     “Then I retreated to write the novel I had always wanted to write but, in my laziness or lack of courage, had postponed endlessly,” said Aziz with a wink. “You know, it was one of those things I had wanted to do for a long time. I named the book Sweet Blasphemy and sent it to a literary agency in America, not expecting much and at the same time feeling open to all possibilities. A week later I received an intriguing e-mail from a mystery woman in Boston.”      Ella couldn’t help but smile. A weak smile of respectful compassion, tender and pained. Aziz said ever since that moment nothing had been the same. From a man getting ready to die, he had turned into a man falling in love at a most unexpected time. Suddenly all the pieces that he thought he’d long ago put into place had to be moved. Spirituality, life, family, mortality, faith, and love—he found himself rethinking their meanings again and not wanting to die.      This new and final stage of his life he called his encounter with the letter i in the word “Sufi.” And he said so far this stage had proved to be much more difficult than all the earlier ones, because it had come at a time when he thought he’d worked through most, if not all, of his inner conflicts, a time when he thought he was spiritually mature and fulfilled.    What is the connection between these letters and the stages of his life? It reminded me of the way Shams assigned significance to the individual letters of Rumi's name earlier in the story (the powerful, lucid R; the velvety U; the intrepid and self-confident M; and the mysterious I, yet to be solved), and also of the idea that the entire Koran can be encapsulated in the initial letter B, but how do the different letters symbolise different parts and aspects of life? Is mystical significance of letters part of the Sufi belief, perhaps? "
942,Why did Shams refuse to sleep with Kimya?,"Towards the end of Elif Şafak's The Forty Rules of Love, specifically the book-within-a-book Sweet Blasphemy which is largely a retelling of the real-life story of Shams and Rumi, Shams gets married to Rumi's student and foster-daughter Kimya. She's very much in love with him, as we see from the chapters written from her point of view. The wedding night is described from Shams's point of view, and he feels desire for her too, but he refuses to sleep with her as her husband:     I kissed her again. The warmth of her lips sent waves of desire across my entire body. She smelled of jasmine and wildflowers. Stretching out beside her, I inhaled her smell and touched her breasts, so small and firm. All I wanted was to enter her and get lost inside her. She offered herself to me the way a rosebud opens to the rain.      I pulled away. “I’m sorry, Kimya. I can’t do this.”   He steadfastly refuses to sleep with her throughout their marriage, even when she tries all the tricks in the book to seduce him. Why?  I don't recall anything about Shams taking an oath of celibacy. Nor can it be anything to do with his being a Sufi, because in Islam there's no such thing as clerical celibates or 'monasticism' in the typical Christian sense. He talks so much about love, so why does he refuse to make love with this girl, despite the fact that she wants to, at least part of him wants to, AND they're married? "
943,Why did O’Shaughnessy write Ode?,"Are there any theories on what motivated  O’Shaughnessy to write Ode (also called 'We are the Music Makers') ?   Basically, he was not a ""world-forsaker"" himself. I read that he worked as a herpetologist. So was it that he got inspired by his friends' lives, the way society (probably) looked down upon them, low earning etc. to write the poem? "
944,"How does Dee Raain use the Mirrors to highlight negative human traits in the poem ""Mirror of Truth""?","The poem ""Mirror of Truth"" by Dee Raain is as follows:     What is seen in the mirror is nothing more than a person with lies and hate.   With sadness and traits   Of discrimination and disgrace.      What I see is a broken face of sadness.   With no hope to be filled with gladness.   More than can ever resent.   To have a heart broken and bent.        What I see in the mirror is someone who lost.   At the price of being cost.   With losing someone they love.   And being hurt so bad, it hurts to see them gone.        What I see in the mirror   Is me. The 'I am' and may have already became to be.   This is who I am and how part of my life is.   And unlike most for me this is the mirror of truth.      In the above poem, how does the poet use mirrors to highlight negative emotions of humans? Is the author describing just himself, or humanity as a whole? Also, is it right to think that in the last stanza, he is accepting his weaknesses, providing a positive touch to the poem?  "

Vines as their religious leader?  He's not only a white man, but a rich white man. Why would he be trusted that much? Is this plausible in some way, or is it a hole in the background of the story? "
947,What is this children's short story about an expat English girl who wants to pick primroses on her birthday?,"I remember reading as a child a fictional short story about the difficulties that an English girl had fitting in after moving to America. The children at her school make fun of her using words like ""sums"".  When she tells her teacher about her family's tradition of riding a train to the countryside on her birthday and gathering wild primroses, she is informed that primroses do not grow in America.  She had been hoping that her guardian (adoptive aunt?) would be able to take her to celebrate her birthday like her mother used to.  I think the the character's name was Merry (not Mary) because I remember the other children circling around her and teasing ""Merry Sums!""  I would expect that this short story would have been written between 1930 and 1980.  I read it in about 1988, and any inaccuracies in the description above are due to my fallible memory.  Can anyone identify this story and its author? "
948,Why include the frame story in The Forty Rules of Love?,"The book The Forty Rules of Love contains two stories told in parallel: firstly, the story of Ella and Aziz in the 21st century; secondly, the story of Rumi and Shams in the 13th century as told by Aziz in his novel Sweet Blasphemy which Ella is reading and reviewing. I would say that the main point of Şafak's book, what sets it apart from many other modern romance novels, is the story of Rumi and Shams: it teaches the average modern reader a lot about life in the 13th-century Middle East, and it also adds context to the Ella-Aziz relationship by comparison. Why, then, didn't Şafak simply write the book Aziz did - a story about Rumi and Shams, without giving it any 21st-century context?  Why is the frame story included in The Forty Rules of Love, rather than just making it a gripping and entertaining historical tale about Rumi and Shams? "
949,"The Forty Rules of Love - what kind of ""love""?","In Elif Safak's novel The Forty Rules of Love, Shams has a list of rules which he calls the Forty Rules of Love and encourages everyone to live by. What kind of ""love"" are these rules trying to govern? There are many different types of love (4, 7, or 8, according to who you ask): romantic love, family love, love between friends, love of God, ...  Do Shams's rules cover all of these equally, or are they focused on some more than others? (For example, he seems quite bad at romantic love, but there's a lot more to him than just love of God.) "
950,"Why did George Orwell make ""Oceania"" totalitarian in his novel ""1984""?","During his times the United States and Great Britain were seen as one of the few  the greatest ""true"" democracies that have ever existed. Why did he decide to merge them into one totalitarian superstate?  I think it's safe to assume that Eurasia is an expanded version of the Soviet Union and the story would have worked just as well with Winston working under Stalin's (or BB's) regime fighting against the US/Oceania.  Was there anything Orwell wanted to insinuate?  "
951,"Why is God a ""harshener""? What does this mean?","In Robert Hayden's poem ""The Ballad of Nat Turner"", the word ""harshener"" appears twice in reference to God/Jehovah:     In scary night I wandered, praying,          Lord God my harshener,   speak to me now or let me die;          speak, Lord, to this mourner.      [...]      they were like mine and in joy and terror          wept, praising praising Jehovah.      Oh praised my honer, harshener          till a sleep came over me,   What does it signify to call God a ""harshener""? Why is this word used? "
952,How bad is Winston Smith 's memory in the novel `1984`?,"The book starts with Winston entering his apartment in noon, leaving work at noon by choice since we are given the information that      By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except the bread that must be saved for morning.    Winston takes a sip of VICTORY GIN after entering his apartment and simply watches outside turning his back to the telescreen, which resides in an unusual position due to an alcove and the reader is led to..     It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was about to do.      But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a beautiful book, smooth creamy paper..    where what he is about to do is to start a diary.. So it is almost immediately after he enters his apartment, he gets inspired by his surroundings, not after a while. And we also know that it is a 20 minute walk from Ministry of Truth to his apartment.   However, after writing for a while in his diary he stops and we learn that..     It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.   Are we already warned that Winston has a terrible memory and conscious? Or is the narrator altering the past so quickly?   Who decides to start a diary and sacrifices his lunch in such a world where access to food is limited, forgets what he came home for, decides to start a diary due to a reason completely different than his original intent as he was leaving his work ~20 minutes ago?  Maybe there is a very simple explanation I am missing or I am not understanding the passage, or is there a different message here?   Here are some further hints I was able to find on Winstons memory from Chapter 1:     He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. But it was no use, he could not remember: Nothing remained of his childhood.        .. the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk shop un a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember)..        The thing he was about to do was to open a diary. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up.   Seems like Winston has problems remembering things that are:    very old (from his childhood)  somewhat old (buying a diary from a shop)  very recent(coming home with an intention that he forgot) active information (monologue he constantly has in his mind)..   "
953,Middle Grade book read in 2001,"I read this book in middle school in 2000/2001. I don’t recall that it was a popular or extremely current book, as nobody else had chosen to read it in our class, but I don’t think it could have been written much earlier than the 70s; it seemed current enough, and the actual storyline was also somewhat contemporary.  I don’t remember much of the plot, but I believe the girl protagonist was an expat from the US living on the border of two or three  European countries: I believe Switzerland (possibly Belgium, but I think she was located near the Swiss alps for some reason). She was going to this foreign school and I believe she didn’t quite fit in (not 100% sure on this detail). Pretty sure regardless that she was homesick.   The biggest recollection I have of this story is the feeling and/or theme: she’s quite lonely, and lives in a very in-between sort of place (because she’s literally living on the border of these two/three countries: I think Switzerland and Italy; if not, possiblly her location was between Belgium, Switzerland and France).   The scene I can remember most vividly is a thematic description of the mountainous country surrounding her; she describes the differing terrains/ecosystems of the landscapes on each side of her: there’s a snowy, rough and high terrain (Swiss Alps?) and a (comparatively) more tropical, warm terrain (Italy?)  I hope I’ve given enough information for this to qualify as a full, descriptive question. It’s all I can remember. Thank you for reading!  "
954,What does collachrimation mean?,"The end Thomas Nashe's novel The Unfortunate Traveller takes a very antisemitic turn when both the novel's main character (Jack Wilton) and his concubine fall into the hands of a Jew named Zadoch. Zadoch wants to sell his prisoner to another Jew, Doctor Zacharie; while Jack Wilton is being transported through the streets of Rome, he is seen by the Marques of Mantua's wive, who is one of the Pope's concubines. Chapter IX ends with the following words (emphasis mine):     At the first sight [the Marques of Mantua's wive] was enamoured with my age and beardles face, that had in it no ill signe of phisiognomie fatall to fetters: after me she sent to know what I was, wherein I had offended, and whether I was going? My conducts resolved them all. Shee having received this answer, with a lustfull collachrimation lamenting my Jewish Premunire, that bodie and goods I should light into the hands of such a cursed generation, invented the means of my release.   I couldn't find ""collachrimation"" in Wiktionary but I found an instance of the verb collachrimate in Thomas Nashe's Christs teares ouer Ierusalem (emphasis mine):     A Tormentor (that abiureth commiseration) when he first enters into the infancy of his occupation, would collachrimate my case, and rather chuse to haue beene tortured himselfe, them torment me with ingratitude as thou doost.   Based on these usage examples, collachrimation sounds like a synonym or near-synonym of commiseration, but I would like to find confirmation from a source that actually defines the word.  "
955,Was Hemingway schizophrenic?,"Surrounding the death of Ernest Hemingway, there are declarations that he suffered vigilance from the FBI. It is also said that he believed badly that he was being checked at every turn by goverment security offices. He also received electroconvulsive therapy.   What I cannot find information on is if he suffered from a mental illness (which it appeared the case to be). Does anyone know which one was? Perhaps some kind of schizophrenia? "
956,What is the difference between spatial and temporal paratext?,"According to Gérard Genette, the paratext is what is beyond a text, e.g.: the cover, the title, the interviews about a novel...  Paratext can be devided into two categories: spatial and temporal. The spatial paratexts are peritext and epitext, while the temporal ones are divided into three categories: original, later and prior.  I did not understand the two categories ""spatial"" and ""temporal"". Can someone help me understand them?  In those examples can you help me find out which paratext is temporal and which one is spatial? I still have a hard time making a difference.

957,Who were the tongueless men of Coromandae?,"On the first page of Chapter VII in Thomas Deloney's novel Jack of Newbury, the narrator tells us (italics from the original),     Halfe the day sometime would hee sit by her, as shee was waighing wooll, often sighing and sobbing to himselfe, yet saying nothing, as if he had been tonguelesse, like the men of Coromandae; and the loather to speake, for that hee could speak but bad English.   Which part of the world is Deloney referring to? Which people were supposed to be ""tongueless""? Searching for Coromandae, I find the Coromandel peninsula in New Zealand, which did not receive its current name until 1820, and the Coromandel Coast in southeast India, whose name is probably  more recent than Deloney's novel (the Dutch didn't reach Coromandel governorate until 1606). At this point, I doubt that I'm on the right track with ""Coromandel"", so where did Deloney get the name ""Coromandae""? "
958,Why was Dagny Taggart so reluctant to call Dr. Robert Stadler about John Galt's motor?,"After Dagny Taggart found John Galt's motor, she tried to find a scientist who could reconstruct it. None of the people she interviewed worked out.     She had tried to find a scientist able to attempt the reconstruction of the motor. She had interviewed the men recommended to her as the best in their field... The decision to speak to Dr. Robert Stadler had been her last recourse.      She had forced herself to call him, against the resistance of some immovable point within her that felt like brakes slammed tight. She had argued against herself. She had thought: I deal with men like Jim and Orren Boyle - his guilt is less than theirs - why can't I speak to him? She had found no answer, only a stubborn sense of reluctance, only the feeling that of all the men on earth, Dr. Robert Stadler was the one she must not call.   Hank Rearden later commented that Dr. Stadler wanted Dagney to help him pretend that he was still the great Dr. Robert Stadler, and that she shouldn't have seen him. (John Galt later identifies this as ""the sanction of the victim""). Also, while Jim Taggart is the primary villain in the book, Robert Stadler represents a wholly different kind of evil - the man who knew better.  So, why was she so reluctant to see Stadler? Did she realize that this was giving him the sanction of the victim, or did she realize at some conscious level that his guilt was arguably greater than Jim's? "
959,"Krazy language in Krazy Kat, 25 July 1936","The eponymous hero (or heroine) of George Herriman's Krazy Kat cartoons uses a very peculiar language. Most of the time, it's simply phonetical and is easy to understand, but in the strip that appeared on 25 July 1936, I have difficulty understanding some of what he or she or it is saying. In that cartoon, Offisa Pupp takes a nap; he dreams that he meets Krazy and then catches Ignatz Mouse. Offisa Pupp and Ignatz start wrestling each other, with Krazy looking on and commenting on the action:     Krazy: Regular, the romin - insulting the kottage injins -    Pupp [to Ignatz, who's getting reading to hurl a brick]: Avaunt - wastrel    Krazy: Hoikillitz tossin the big bed bull -    Pupp: Have at you - Quince.   Krazy: Etlitz jugglin' a lot of woils -    Pupp: Kavvy Kannem - [i.e. cave canem]   Krazy: Horachel diffendin' his bridges - [Horachel defending his bridges?]   Pupp: Shis kibab -    Krazy: Cyklops destroyin' the tutty-nine dumb dimmins [i.e. Cyclops destroying the 39 ...]   Pupp: Skol   Krazy: Jupita darin' the tunda bolds - [i.e. Jupiter daring the thunder bolts]   Pupp: Sayonara -   Krazy: Ajex knoggin' the lightnin' around - [i.e. Ajax knocking the lightning around]   Pupp: Weeny weedy weeky [i.e. veni, vidi, vici]   Krazy: Nobil - movillis - killosis -    Pupp: Hark - - I seem to hear the plaudits of my people.   Who or what is Horachel? What are dimmins? Why would Jupiter by ""daring"" thunderbolts? (Or was that supposed to be a genitive, i.e. ""Jupiter's""?) And what does ""Nobil - movillis - killosis"" if it has any meaning at all? Please hurl a brick with explanations at my noodle. "
960,Searching for an Illustrated Children's Book with Animal Characters,"I just spent the last 5 hours browsing through google, pinterest, and eBay in an attempt to find a beautifully illustrated book I loved as a child. I remember what it is generally about, but I have not the slightest recollection of any names (title, author, illustrator, publisher, characters). I do remember that the edition we owned was hardcover and roughly 12 by 9.5 by 0.5 inches.  The story begins with a mouse in a speedster (possibly red) driving through the country one morning by a lake town. The mouse's automobile is rather loud and disturbs the locals who are trying to sleep. One of the mouse's tires is punctured by a nail/nails and he is stranded in that town(?) for the remainder of the book until the end where if I remember correctly he finally gets a new tire and leaves.  I remember that a white cat lets him stay with her (she wears victorian dresses and expensive necklaces of pearls and perhaps jewels). And there is a white goat who owned some sort of grocery store (I remember him on a ladder either putting things away or trying to reach something, and my sister remembers a scene where he is trying not to sneeze—probably the same scene). There is a dog whom my mother remembers being the handyman (possibly for the boat) and thinks was named Billy. I also have distinct scenes in my mind: one of the mouse somehow falling into the lake(?) and having to dry off with a towel, one of the goat laughing, one of the goat and cat having a glass of wine at night (I think they are discussing the mouse leaving and they are sad because they've grown fond of him), one of the white cat being swung around in a waltz at some celebration (possibly by the captain).  The illustrations were very distinct. The style is similar to the images I have attached, however, I remember them being much more anthropomorphic and facially expressive.  My deepest thank to anyone who manages to find out what book this is.     "
961,Why did the N.I.C.E. want Mark Studdock at Belbury?,"Near the middle of That Hideous Strength, Wither says to the Fairy:     If a mere arrest could have secured the — er — good will and   collaboration of Mrs. Studdock, we should hardly have embarrassed   ourselves with the presence of her husband.   This statement seems to imply that the only reason the N.I.C.E. brought Mark Studdock to Belbury was in order to get a hold of his wife, Jane. Now it turns out that Jane is a seer and an invaluable asset to either side, so the Institute wanting to get their paws on her makes perfect sense.  What doesn't make sense is that at the time Wither made that statement, the N.I.C.E. hadn't yet discovered Jane's powers. Frost had seen her in vision and was studying her in the vision—but we have no evidence that he knew it was Mark's wife that he was studying. Furthermore, Frost didn't see Jane in vision until after Mark was dragged to the Institute.  So, why did the N.I.C.E. want Mark Studdock at Belbury before they understood the significance of his wife and her gifts?  We are led to believe at various points before Wither's statement to the Fairy, that the Institute people wanted Mark so he could write good propaganda in the newspapers for them. But if that was the reason they brought him, why would Wither make that statement?   Is this a plot defect? Did the author's timing get tangled? Or am I missing something? "
962,About the role of Lizaveta in Crime and Punishment,"I just finished Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, and I loved it (of course).  I would like to bring into analysis the role of Lizaveta, the pawnbroker's half sister who is accidentally killed by Raskolnikov. More specifically I'd like to understand in a better way how this episode (the killing of an innocent person) really influenced the rest of the book. In fact, it seems to me (but I may be  wrong) that what started as a potentially huge plot twist, later became less central or crucial to the book message. Let's put it like this: what would have happened if Raskolnikov only killed the evil pawnbroker and got away with it? One may say that all his immediate, post-murder, anxieties and second thoughts would have been much less severe and debilitating! He also felt empathetic towards the poor Lizaveta, almost enslaved by her sister. So my (wrong?) guess is that his hypothetical perfect crime would change the story quite a bit. Raskolnikov is indeed convinced (up to his typical overthinking) until the very end of the book (Siberia chapters) that killing the pawnbroker was not a bad thing at all. But here's the thing I don't get. In the book, especially the second part, it's more about the crime in itself, not much about the poor dead innocent. It feels to me that Lizaveta's death could have been used much more than it actually was, to work towards and to explain Raskolnikov's redemption.. for instance. But again it's not perceived to me as a very important fact in the end: Raskolnikov turns himself in because of his murder, it seems that with or without Lizaveta's death he would have done so anyway.   What do you think? Am I misinterpreting something? Or is this really the point of the book, that killing is wrong anyway?  Thank you! "
963,How did Pilate order Judas' death in Master and Margarita?,"After several reads I am still struggling to understand the events around Judas' death in the Pilate story. On the face of it, the following things occur:   Pilate has dinner with Aphranius (head of secret service), and mentions some of Yeshua's friends are plotting to kill Judas, discover how much money he was paid for betraying Yeshua, and return the money to the high priest with a note. Pilate insists all this will happen that same evening. Aphranius expresses surprise and concern at his own failing as he did not have this information. Aphranius leaves the palace, orders some of his men out of town with carts 'loaded with entrenching tools and a barrel of water' (side question, is this to do with Judas or is it just for burying the executed men?). He talks with Niza, Judas' love interest. She then tempts Judas to Gethsemane outside the city. Once Judas arrives there, he is killed by Aphranius and his men, who also obtain the bribe money. Aphranius then attaches the note and returns to the palace. Aphranius tells Pilate that Judas was killed exactly as Pilate had anticipated, and shows as evidence the money bag with note. He admits failure at having been unable to stop the death, and asks to be tried. Pilate questions him about the death, and Aphranius gives an invented story, carefully avoiding Niza and insisting that it could not have been a woman to tempt Judas to his death. Pilate later tells Matthew Levi triumphantly that he killed Judas.   Clearly Pilate did not directly order Aphranius to kill Judas. So was it a veiled order, or a manipulation of Aphranius (in that Aphranius had some reason of his own to kill Judas and this gave Aphranius the chance to blame the murder on Yeshua's followers)?  If it was a veiled order, what hinted to Aphranius that Pilate wanted Judas dead?  If Aphranius had his own motive for killing Judas why? Was he a secret disciple of Yeshua? If so, then why did Pilate have to give the order, couldn't he just rely on the chief spy to get it done at some point?  "
964,What is a neckenger?,"In Chapter IX of Thomas Deloney's novel Jack of Newbury, I found the following sentence (emphasis and links added):     Thus lay the poore Draper a long time in prison, in which space, his Wife which before for daintinesse would not foule her fingers, nor turne her head aside, for feare of hurting the set of her neckenger, was glad to goe about and wash buckes at the Thames side, and to be a chare-woman in rich mens houses, her soft hand was now hardened with scouring, and in steade of gold rings upon her lilly fingers, they were now fild witch chaps, provoked by the sharpe, lee, and other drudgeries.   In Quips upon Questions, a book originally published in 1600 and at one point attributed to the actor John Singer but currently to Robert Armin, I found another example:      A gallant Neckenger her necke to grace,    No matter for her Gowne, or other place :    Good foote, good legge : theſe two are chiefly fine,    And ſhe that giues her wages muſt decline.    So a neckenger appears to be something that can be worn around the neck, as the name suggests. But what exactly is it? A choker, perhaps?  "
965,"How do Pupp's remarks connect with Krazy's in Krazy Kat, 25 July 1936?","This question is about the same Krazy Kat strip (25 July 1936) as in Krazy language in Krazy Kat, 25 July 1936, in which Krazy is making a lot of classical references and Pupp is responding:     Krazy: Regular, the romin - insulting the kottage injins -   Pupp [to Ignatz, who's getting reading to hurl a brick]: Avaunt - wastrel      Krazy: Hoikillitz tossin the big bed bull -   Pupp: Have at you - Quince.      Krazy: Etlitz jugglin' a lot of woils -   Pupp: Kavvy Kannem -      Krazy: Horachel diffendin' his bridges -   Pupp: Shis kibab -      Krazy: Cyklops destroyin' the tutty-nine dumb dimmins   Pupp: Skol      Krazy: Jupita darin' the tunda bolds -   Pupp: Sayonara -      Krazy: Ajex knoggin' the lightnin' around -   Pupp: Weeny weedy weeky      Krazy: Nobil - movillis - killosis -   Pupp: Hark - - I seem to hear the plaudits of my people.   As laid out in Spagirl's excellent answer, Krazy's remarks refer to, respectively: Regulus defeating the Carthaginians; the seventh labour of Heracles; Atlas holding the world; Horatio defending the bridge; a Cyclops fighting demons (?); Jupiter throwing thunderbolts; Ajax defying lightning; ""noble - marvellous - colossus"".  My question is: how do Pupp's remarks connect respectively with these? From Heracles to Quince, Atlas to cave canem, Horatio to shish kebab, etc. - what are the links?  (Spagirl's answer speculates a little about this in the final paragraph, but I'd like to see more detail, and I'd feel bad about asking her to go into full detail about this in her answer when it isn't technically part of that question. Hence, this new follow-up question.) "
966,"In the Iliad, why does Homer list every captain involved in the Trojan war?","In book two of the The Iliad (which you can read online), Homer does something that I find strange: he interrupts the story to list the name of every captain involved in the Trojan war:     And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me- for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things, while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could not name every single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though my voice failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and all the fleet together.      Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.    This is just a tiny portion of the list: Homer continues listing these names for a long time.  What's going on here? Why does Homer interrupt the story to list these names? "
967,"Whose were the ""best minds"" being destroyed in Ginsberg's ""Howl""?","In Allen Ginsberg´s most famous poem ""Howl"", he claims he was witness to the destruction of the best minds of his generation:     I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,   dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,   angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,   Who were the best minds of his generation? Who was he referring to? "
968,"What did ""Moloch"" represent in Allen Ginsberg´s poem ""Howl""?","In Allen Ginsberg´s poem ""Howl"", what did ""Moloch"" represent?     What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?      Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!      Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!      Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!      Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!   Moloch was a particularly nasty god that demanded child sacrifices. What does it mean here? "
969,"What is the meaning of ""To Autumn""?","Many poems are filled with metaphors and underlying ideas about deeper things and more broad issues or feelings. I personally feel that ""To Marguerite"" is an example of this, where the poem is bursting with stylistic devices, each of which contribute to the underlying ideas of the poem.  ""To Autumn"" is the 'other' kind of poem in my opinion. It's been described as ""nearly perfect, but doesn't have a lot to say"". If I'm not wrong, its only aim is to describe/praise Autumn. How would one effectively comment on Keats' writing in such a context? The poem is bursting with imagery, but how do you comment on it?  What I'm looking for is quite simply examples of commentary on devices in the poem ""To Autumn"", which would help me further develop my own interpretations. Thank you for your answers and please take into consideration that I am a high schooler (more specifically, part of the IB program).   My final goal is to be able to write an IB-level commentary of sufficiently high standards on this poem.  "
970,"Meaning of this line in ""On seeing the Elgin Marbles""","   And each imagined pinnacle and steep       Of godlike hardship tells me I must die    The ""pinnacle and steep"" represent the pillars of the Parthenon if I'm not mistaken. But the next line doesn't make sense to me. How can the pillars be of godlike hardship? Also, why are they imagined? I feel like I'm misunderstanding something here...  "
971,"Is the cliffhanger at the end of ""First among sequels"" resolved?","The book ""First among Sequels"" ends on a cliffhanger. The protagonist, Thursday Next, has to run for her life, to escape an impending fire.  The next book in the series, ""One of Our Thursdays is Missing"", has her counterpart Thursday5 investigate a crime. Thursday5 eventually finds Thursday Next, seriously wounded.   However, there don't seem to be burns involved. Thursday Next has been the victim of an attempt at her life, in the form of a taxi accident. Thursday Next's wounds are described as:     She had a fractured skull, a broken femur, and eight breaks to her left arm and hand. There were multiple lacerations, a loss of blood, fever and a concussion.   (I believe it also said somewhere that she had part of the taxi's steering column rammed through her in the accident. I haven't been able to find that back though).  So, it would seem that Thursday Nexts accident in ""One of Our Thursdays is Missing"" is a different one from the fire at the end of ""First among Sequels"" - where she may actually have escaped.  The book after that, ""The Woman who Died a Lot"", starts with a Thursday Next who has recovered enough to walk again.    So it seems that the cliffhanger at the end of ""First among Sequels"" is never quite resolved. Closest thing I can think of, is that the remake of BookWorld at the beginning of ""One of Our Thursdays is Missing"", also changed recent history. This is never stated in the books though.    It's not like Jasper Fforde to give us a cliffhanger and then not resolve it. At the very least he would make a joke about the structure or nature of stories. He hasn't done so in this case.  So - am I missing something here? Are the two issues the same? Or is there an unresolved cliffhanger? "
972,"In Foucault's Pendulum, which names are allusions to the real world, and which are not?","Foucault's Pendulum has a litany of character names that intrigue me. I wonder where many of them come from.  For example, Casaubon, the name of one of the main characters, seems like it comes from Isaac Casaubon, a French philosopher. While I'm having trouble drawing overall thematic connections and links, this has been useful for considering exactly what's going on in the story.  There are a few names, though, that I can't seem to uniquely connect to any specific person or idea. Particularly, the names 'Colonel Ardenti,' 'Diotallevi,' and 'Belbo' remain a little opaque. My guess is that Ardenti just comes from the Italian word ""ardenti"" itself, but I'm not entirely sure. 'Belbo' looks like it has a lot of possibilities, and I'm somewhat lost as to which one is correct. And I don't get any results at all looking for connections to 'Diotallevi.'  Do the above names relate to any ideas or allude to the real world?  What do they refer to? "
973,Why does Stanley Uris react so gruesomely to It returning?,"Stephen King's novel IT concerns a group of children who confronted an evil entity haunting their town -- and their reunion twenty-five years later to face the being again for the final time.  Early in the novel, we see each of ""The Losers' Club"" react to the news and the summons. All are frightened, most are disbelieving, but they all answer the call -- all except for Stanley Uris, who commits suicide. Stanley kills himself, after scrawling a cryptic message on the wall with his own blood.  While this is a horror novel, and there is no question that It is horrifying, Stanley's behavior stands out in stark contrast to that of his friends. When I read the novel, I understood this as a kind of promise -- a promise that, as we learn the story of the children in '57-'58, one of the things we learn is how It left Stanley uniquely scarred among the group. Or, really, any explanation that would justify why Stanley kills himself in such an awful manner.  But as I read, I felt this was never addressed. I don't see Stanley as differentiating himself from the rest of the group in any particular way, or being more affected by It than the others, or being a person inclined to panic or suicide.  Does IT explain why Stanley, and he alone, was driven to suicide? Or does the book not actually mean to imply that Stanley was unique in responding this way? "
974,What concept of love does Tolstoy suggest in Anna Karenina?,"I know one of the characteristics of realistic works is they are mostly formulated as some independent studies of the life of society but, at the same time, I realise that the dominant approach to art in that time was to see it pragmatically, as a way to share your worldview.  Anna Karenina seems to describe lives of two relationships: Once (in the relationship between Anna Karenina and Vronsky) the characters fell into the natural desire for the ""natural love"" (éros, so to speak) and it ended badly and once, in the relationship of Kitty and Levin, the characters seemed to contemplate about their relationship for a while and they seemed to make a happy, overall fulfilled couple.  So we can see the book is pretty far from describing the naturalistic hopelessness and straightforward critique of the opportunistic society. Rather, I feel like Tolstoy thus argues by the natural nature of love for more liberal approach of society (the conservatism of Alexey and Mrs. Scherbatska had been devastating).  But is it really possible that Leo Tolstoy intended to make the story that symbolic? Can we see there some kind of model of love Tolstoy is trying to describe? "
975,Was the clue to who Panama Oxridge really is ever found?,"The Tartan of Thyme series is written by 'Panama Oxridge', a pseudonym. When questioned why they used this pen name the author said:     'Using a pseudonym was partly to distance myself from my previous picture-book persona – partly because (like Justin), I’ve never liked my name – but mostly because I think it helps the reader connect with the story.'   I did some research and found that the author used to write children's picture books - explaining the 'previous picture-book persona'.  However, it says at the back of the first book of the series, Justin Thyme, that there is a clue to the author's real name hidden in the book. I didn't find it of course.  So that got me wondering, was this clue ever found? Has the author's identity been discovered? "
976,Did Captain Pirx make a joke in base 13?,"   When Douglas Adams was asked whether he invented this question because six times nine is actually 54, which is 42 when written in base thirteen, he replied: “I may be a sorry case, but I don't write jokes in base 13.”   This denial by Douglas Adams is well known among his fans, see eg. “How did Douglas Adams choose the Ultimate Question?” on Sci Fi SE.  On the other hand, a friend told me that Stanisław Lem, on the other hand, did write a joke that is based on a positional number system with an unusual radix (not necessarily 13), somewhere in the stories about Captain Pirx.    Is this true?  Or, even if not all the details match, is there something close to this in Lem's writings that spawned this rumour?  Where do I find the relevant part in the writings?  I've read all the stories about Captain Pirx, but I've read most of them only once or twice, and have probably missed this detail.  I admit they're not my most favorite part of Lem's sci fi. "
977,"Has Louise always known the truth in ""Story of Your Life""?","Has the main character of the Story of Your Life (adapted as a movie called Arrival in 2016), Dr. Louise Banks always known the story of her life?   Is there anywhere in the story explained how is it possible to perceive the time as continuous from a certain point in time? The novel seems to be very specific about other details. "
978,Did Cummings' editors try to fix his works' eccentricities?,"E.E. Cummings often wrote with deliberately unconventional spelling and syntax. It was popularly criticised when published; however, did his editors try to ""fix"" his work before it was published?  If not, how did Cummings convey his intentions to the editors? If so, did they know about his intent and disagree? "
979,Meaning of the chapter structure in Calvino's Invisible Cities,"Italo Calvino's book Invisible Cities is essentially a collection of descriptions of cities.   What I find interesting is that the chapters follow a specific structure. There are ten categories of cities, labeled ""Cities &amp; Memory"", ""Cities &amp; Desire"", and so on. The book is also divided into ten chapters. It's hard to describe the structure, but here's wikipedia's description:     The matrix of eleven column themes and fifty-five subchapters (ten rows in chapters 1 and 9, five in all others) shows some interesting properties. Each column has five entries, rows only one, so there are fifty-five cities in all. The matrix of cities has a central element (Baucis). The pattern of cities is symmetric with respect to inversion about that center. Equivalently, it is symmetric against 180 degree rotations about Baucis. Inner chapters (2-8 inclusive) have diagonal cascades of five cities (e.g. Maurila through Euphemia in chapter 2). These five-city cascades are displaced by one theme column to the right as one proceeds to the next chapter. In order that the cascade sequence terminates (the book of cities is not infinite!) Calvino, in chapter 9, truncates the diagonal cascades in steps: Laudomia through Raissa is a cascade of four cities, followed by cascades of three, two, and one, necessitating ten cities in the final chapter. The same pattern is used in reverse in chapter 1 as the diagonal cascade of cities is born   Wikipedia also provides a helpful table that allows you to ""see"" the structure visually.  My question is: how does this structure contribute to the meaning of the book? In other words, why did Calvino spend so much time creating this structure? "
980,What exactly is canon?,"I've seen the word canon used occasionally on this site. I've also seen it used quite extensively on Stack Exchange's science fiction and fantasy site.   I'm pretty sure I know what the word means, but I went looking for a definition on Stack Exchange and couldn't find one. Given that the word is used occasionally on this site as well, I think this question could also be useful here as well.  What exactly is canon? "
981,"What's the meaning of ""well over the fast"" in the following passage?","In Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party (1957), Goldberg (a Jewish character) wishes Stanley a happy birthday and says ""well over the fast."" What does he mean by it? I know that this expression is usually used by the Jewish people as a kind of holiday greetings! But how come Goldberg uses the expression at a birthday party?!!     GOLDBERG. Lift your glasses. Stanley—happy birthday.      MCCANN. Happy birthday.      LULU. Happy birthday.      MEG. Many happy returns of the day, Stan.      GOLDBERG. And well over the fast.  "
982,How does the Nobel committee define literature?,"As you probably know, Bob Dylan, a musician, was awarded the Nobel prize. He was the first musician to receive the Nobel prize.   The Nobel committee, notably, seemed to avoid the word music when explaining why the prize was awarded. The press release simply states that the prize was awarded to Dylan ""for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"", i.e. that the committee is awarding the prize based on Dylan's ability as a poet. Sara Danius, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, described Dylan as a ""great poet in the English tradition""; a poet, not a songwriter. And Danius also said that Dylan ""should be read""; that's an odd statement to say about a musician, whose works are intended to be listened to.  All of this made me wonder: how does the Nobel committee define literature? I suspect that they describe Dylan as a poet because they consider poetry literature. But I then decided to look for a explanation for where exactly they draw the line, but I wasn't able to find one.  How does the Nobel committee define literature? "
983,How did Sheymov manage to convince KGB that he and the family were dead?,"Closer to the end of the book, Sheymov's contact from CIA refused to go with his plan to fake their family death when defecting. In Chapter 11, ""Misha"" refuses to help with the plan:     Victor nodded, then introduced his embellishment. “Good. Now, Misha, I will need your help on something else. We’ll have a tremendously greater advantage if the KGB is not aware that I’m in the United States.” Victor paused. “How about leading them to believe we’re dead?”   Caught completely off guard, Misha stared at Victor, trying to see if he was joking. He wasn’t. Misha chuckled: “Look, let’s just keep this professional, OK? We don’t have time to fantasize.”   “Misha, just listen to me. I think we’ve got a real opportunity here. For example, the three of us could go to the countryside, rent a rowboat, and capsize it. If it’s abandoned near a large water system with a fairly strong current, it would be perfectly natural not to find our bodies. I know for certain that in a number of such drownings every year the bodies simply never turn up.”   “No, Victor. Now you listen to me. Without mentioning the fact that a stunt like that would rob us of at least eighteen hours’ lead time, I can guarantee that nobody in Washington is going to approve it. Our highest priority is to deliver you safely, without taking any avoidable risks. So just forget it, and let’s concentrate on the task at hand.”   Later in Chapter 11, he tells his wife about this and that he's still interested in the idea:     “What did your contact think of our ‘dying’?”   “According to the Americans, ‘playing dead’is not a good idea. From a conventional point of view, I suppose I have to agree. And that idea with the rowboat has to be abandoned. We can’t pull it off without the Americans’ help. Besides, they’ve got a point, it would rob us of eighteen hours. Nevertheless, I’m still determined to try to lead the KGB to believe that we’re dead. I’m going to do my damndest to pull it off. The fact is, there’s zero risk in it. If we succeed, we’ll have a tremendous advantage—not to mention that it would make things much easier for those we leave behind.”   Yet, in the last chapter 12, it indicates that the death faking indeed happen, but I don't think it was described how. All we see is that Victor is worried about being recognized, which would destroy his plan to be assumed to be dead:     “I know, but it’s a tough call. Uzhgorod is in the border zone. On the one hand the Border Guards will every now and then raid trains like this one. They ask everyone for full identification and want to know exactly where you’re going and who you’ll be staying with. That’ll blow up everything I’ve been lining up so carefully. Also, our being here would be registered, and good-bye to any hope that they’d count us dead.   The last ""About the author"" section confirms this:     In 1980, after establishing a contact with the CIA, Victor and his wife, Olga, and their five-year-old daughter were exfiltrated from Moscow. The KGB were even persuaded that they were dead. For his contribution to the national security of the United States, Sheymov was awarded the CIA’s highest medal.   So, what exactly did they do to pretend to be dead if the plan with the rowboat was rejected as it needed help from Americans? "
984,"Why does the narrator of ""Master and Margarita"" say that Caribbean are fiction?","Bulgakov describes the appearance of the Archibald Archibaldovich (chief of the security of the MASSOLIT restaurant) in quite a peculiar way:     At  midnight  there appeared a vision in this hell. On  to the verandah   strode a  handsome, black-eyed man with  a  pointed beard and wearing a tail   coat. With  regal gaze he  surveyed his  domain. According to some romantics   there had once been a time when  this noble figure had worn not  tails but a   broad  leather belt  round  his  waist, stuck with  pistol-butts,  that  his   raven-black hair had been tied up  in a scarlet kerchief and  that  his brig   had sailed the Caribbean under the Jolly Roger.        But that, of  course, is pure fantasy--the Caribbean  doesn't exist, no   desperate  buccaneers sail it,  no  corvette ever chases  them, no  puffs of   cannon-smoke  ever  roll across  the waves.   This is quite peculiar - maybe indeed the romanticised pirates akin to Jack Sparrow did not exist, but definitely there were pirates/privateers/bandits in the geographical region called ""Caribbean"" that anyone can find on the map. Was the existence of the Caribbean Islands somehow censored by the Soviet Union or was it Bulgakov's personal opinion?   To be honest, this whole paragraph of text is quite weird, because it seems that the narrator suddenly changed from the third to the first person:     Look  at that   scraggy tree, look at the iron railings, the boulevard. . . . And the ice is   floating in the  wine-bucket and  at  the  next table  there's  a  man  with   ox-like, bloodshot  eyes and it's pandemonium. . . . Oh gods--poison, I need   poison! . . .   What was the point of this strange outburst from the (until this time) impersonal narrator?  EDIT: TvTropes suggest that characters in the book (mainly Master, Woland and Berlioz) are meant to be the narrator. This would make sense if the author of the paragraph was Behemot or Korovyev goofing around... "
985,Symbolism in The House on the Borderland?,I just read William Hope Hodgson's The House on the Borderland. Is the implication that the man's relationship with his live-in sister inclines to incest? Are the swine intended as symbols of lust (as is the classic interpretation of the pig)?  Is there a psychological interpretation of his vision of the death of the universe? 
986,What did G. K. Chesterton mean by these two paragraphs from the first chapter of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'?,"   'Jenkins,' he repeated. 'Surely you don't mean Jefferson Jenkins, the social reformer? I mean the man who's fighting for the new cottage-estate scheme. It would be as interesting to meet him as any Cabinet Minister in the world, if you'll excuse my saying so.'   'Yes; Hoggs told him it would have to be cottages,' said Fisher. 'He said the breed of cattle had improved too often, and people were beginning to laugh. And, of course, you must hang a peerage on to something; though the poor chap hasn't got it yet. Hullo, here's somebody else.'   What does ""the new cottage-estate scheme"" mean? a scheme to build cottages for the peerage instead of their regular estate? Does ""... people were beginning to laugh"" imply that people are getting better living conditions because ""the breed of cattle had improved too often""? And what does it mean to hang someone on to something?  All I can make out of it is that peasants are getting richer, which makes the governors uncomfortable and willing to do something about it.  For more context, here is the whole story: [website]Any corrections to my writing are appreciated. "
987,Why did Owen Kellogg have a practical need for physics but Dagney didn't?,"When Dagney Taggart spent time in the Valley, she asked to be allowed to attend John Galt's lectures on physics. He refused on the grounds that he didn't want to give her information or ideas that could be used to help people on the outside, and that all of his students had a practical need for it (implication: she didn't). Some of his students included (among others) Dwight Sanders (formerly an aircraft manufacturer), Ted Nielsen (formerly a motor manufacturer), Quentin Daniels (professional physicist), and Owen Kellogg (formerly a manager for Taggert Transcontinental).  Most of those make perfect sense - physics has obvious applications to manufacturing aircraft and motors. I don't understand what Owen Kellogg would do with the information, though; also, it seems like if it was useful for Owen Kellogg, it would be equally useful for Dagney (which John Galt strongly implies that it's not).  Not wanting to give her information that could be helpful to outsiders before she had joined them makes perfect sense, but why the practicality objection? Why was Owen Kellogg on the list of people who had a practical use for the information but she wasn't? "
988,Is alliteration adjacent words and/or close together words starting with the same letter? If words between are permitted then how many?,"OK, I know this question isn't about literary analysis or anything but I posted this on ELU and it was put on hold (as off-topic) and I was advised to post it here.    Is alliteration exclusively adjacent words beginning with the same letter, such as:     Whispering willows waved   Or can it be words close together but not adjacent as well, for example in S T Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner:     “The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,      The furrow followed free;      We were the first that ever burst   Into that silent sea.”   (I would not count articles such as 'the' and 'a' as separating words)  Is the 'f' sound in the words ""fair"" and ""first"" still classed as alliteration in conjunction with the alliteratory phrases ""foam flew"" and ""furrow followed free""? Or are they too separate to be alliteration?  If words between the alliteratory words is permitted, then how many? I have tried to research this but have been unsuccessful in finding a rule that clarifies whether or not several (let's say more than two) non-allitoratory words between alliteratory words 'takes away' the alliteration.

989,Trying to remember a junior fiction story about boys who go back to medieval times,"The two main characters are around age 13. They find? steal? a time machine from someone and end up back in Medieval England. But it's not them exactly - their consciousnesses get put into other bodies. The protagonist finds himself in some knight's body, while the deuteragonist initially gets put into the knight's horse! Later he gets thrown into the knight's squire (and the squire is mid-sentence when it happens, it's a rather bizarre scene).   Aside from the fish-out-of-water aspects, the main conflict is some evil knight, who eventually challenges knight-boy to a duel. I'm pretty sure the kid wins, but I don't remember the rest of the plot, and I don't remember how they get back to their own bodies and time.  I seem to remember that when the two are discussing whether to actually use the time machine, they talk about how the protagonist has hatched a lot of hair-brained schemes, including trying to sell some gross treats that turned out to be ""worse, not better, than they looked."" That might all be from another book entirely though.  I want to say the deuteragonist's name was Max.  This book was adapted into an animated film (not feature length - it might have been an episode in an anthology series) that I remember watching too. In it there's some knight with chicken pox, and he tells people not to touch him because he's cursed with ""little red itchy dots.""  I would have read this book sometime prior to 2000, probably more c. 1996. "
990,Why did Thomas Hardy fictionalise the place names in his Wessex?,"Most or all of Thomas Hardy's novels are set in the region of ""Wessex"", which (as defined by him) covers a vast swathe of England, as you can see from the map provided in this answer:    Notable towns in Wessex include ""Christminster"" - a very thinly veiled version of Oxford, and an important location in Jude the Obscure - and ""Casterbridge"", a fictionalised Dorchester and the main setting for The Mayor of Casterbridge. The list goes on: there are dozens of real towns and villages whose names have been changed for Hardy's novels.  Why did he change these place names? Why not either call them ""Oxford"", ""Dorchester"", etc., or create entirely fictional towns like Anthony Trollope's Barchester? "
991,'Endymion' - Keats,"   And such too is the grandeur of the dooms   We have imagined for the mighty dead;   All lovely tales that we have heard or read:   An endless fountain of immortal drink,   Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.    SOURCE: Keats, Endymion, Book I, lines 20-24   What is Keats saying in the last three lines?    Is Keats referring to ""tales"" of an afterlife / immortality in heaven? If so, why are those ""tales"" an ""endless fountain""? Because there are so many different views on life after death?  Or could he perhaps be saying that ""tales that we have read"" grant their authors immortality?   And what might be the significance of the aquatic imagery (""fountain"", ""drink"")? "
992,Is my controlling idea for my poem analysis accurate?,"This is my current controlling idea of my essay on the poem ""On Pleasure"":     ""The speaker challenges the idea of pleasure in the minds of the   audience, and argues that pleasure is an unavoidable part of life;   only by accepting this, and giving and receiving pleasure, can one   enjoy life to the fullest.""   The poem is pretty difficult to understand for me, so I was wondering if it accurately illustrates the point the author is trying to make, and covers the entire poem. Also, is it more of a summary, or does it actually goes into the deeper meaning behind the poem?  Here is the poem.     From [website]     Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom. It is the   blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit. It is a depth   calling unto a height, But it is not the deep nor the high. It is the   caged taking wing, But it is not space encompassed. Ay, in very truth,   pleasure is a freedomsong. And I fain would have you sing it with   fullness of heart; yet I would not have you lose your hearts in the   singing.      Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are   judged and rebuked. I would not judge nor rebuke them. I would have   them seek. For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone; Seven are   her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.   Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots   and found a treasure?      And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs   committed in drunkenness. But regret is the beclouding of the mind and   not its chastisement. They should remember their pleasures with   gratitude, as they would the harvest of a summer. Yet if it comforts   them to regret, let them be comforted.      And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to   remember; And in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all   pleasures, lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it. But even   in their foregoing is their pleasure. And thus they too find a   treasure though they dig for roots with quivering hands. But tell me,   who is he that can offend the spirit? Shall the nightingale offend the   stillness of the night, or the firefly the stars? And shall your flame   or your smoke burden the wind? Think you the spirit is a still pool   which you can trouble with a staff?      Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in   the recesses of your being. Who knows but that which seems omitted   today, waits for tomorrow? Even your body knows its heritage and its   rightful need and will not be deceived. And your body is the harp of   your soul, And it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or   confused sounds.      And now you ask in your heart, ""How shall we distinguish that which is   good in pleasure from that which is not good?"" Go to your fields and   your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee   to gather honey of the flower, But it is also the pleasure of the   flower to yield its honey to the bee. For to the bee a flower is a   fountain of life, And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love, And   to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a   need and an ecstasy.      People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the   bees.   Thank you in advance! "
993,"Is this idea about incompatibility in marriage because of social status found in James Joyce's ""The Boarding House""?","I want to know what is Joyce's opinion on Mr. Mooney and Mrs. Mooney's marriage and separation in ""The Boarding House."" What has he alluded to through that incident? Does he connote any significant idea here?  When reading the short story, I began to think that, ""When you get married to a person who is inferior to your social status/class, educational level etc. there is a big chance of them becoming incompatible."" This idea seems to be particularly relevant to the marriage of Mrs. Mooney to her father's foreman.  Is this theme present in the story?  I do not need a broad answer, but can you please tell me whether my argument is correct or not.  "
994,Why is the 'a cat may look at a king' quote relevant for when Dr. Rohmer is looking at the man on the podium?,"In The View From Saturday, chapter 2 (page 22 in my copy), there's this quote:     On her left sat Dr. Roy Clayton Rohmer, the District Superintendent for Clarion Academy. Both Dr. Rohmer and Mrs. Olinski paid strict attention to the man at the podium. There could be no mistake: This was the man of the hour, king for the day.   He wore a navy blue, precision fit pin-striped suit and a white-on-dazzling-white shirt. An edge of his French cuffs showed beneath his jacket sleeves. Mrs. Olinski was not sure how much the correct amount was, but if she put a spirit-level to his, they would be exactly right. The French cuffs were held together with onyx cuff links, and his collar was tied with a red-striped power necktie. The television lights beamed down on his crop of hair, which was tinted the color of peach pits. He was dressed, brushed, coiffed, and blow-dried not just to be seen but to be looked at.      Dr. Rohmer could not, would not take his eyes off the man at the podium, and Mrs. Olinski thought of Alice in Wonderland. ""Don't look at me like that!"" said the King to the Cheshire Cat. ""A cat may look at a King,"" said Alice. Mrs. Olinski wanted to tell Dr. Rohmer that a cat may look at a king. But why bother? The audience was not permitted to speak.   I'm having trouble understanding why that would be an appropriate quote to mention. Nobody told him that he couldn't look, and he's obviously doing it, so why would Mrs. Olinski want to tell him that?  "
995,"Where do I find Edmund Wilson's quote ""No two persons ever read the same book?""","The internet seems crazy about this quote, but nobody reports a reliable source. Where was it originally written or spoken? (I.e., which book, interview, or essay?) "
996,"Do ""The Sandman"" and ""Lucifer"" deliberately share the number of published issues?","Neil Gaiman's The Sandman ran for 75 issues; there was one ""special"" issue which told Orpheus' story, but it's not numbered. According to Neil Gaiman in The Sandman Companion, he was intending to end the series at some point, but it's not clear whether he intended the series to run for exactly 75 issues  Mike Carey's Lucifer - which uses the character created in The Sandman and shares the same continuity - also ran for 75 issues; it had a 3-issue comic The Sandman Presents: Lucifer - The Morningstar Option, a one-shot Lucifer: Nirvana, but those are, again, not numbered.  Both comics were published monthly, so I understand that they ran for the same amount of time (~6 years) - but what is the reason for that?  Is it purely a coincidence that the two series ran for exactly 75 issues? Was it a homage from Mike Carey to Neil Gaiman, and the series Lucifer originally was a spin-off from? "
997,"What is the benefit in the Prologue ""spoiling"" the play in Romeo + Juliet?","In the Act 1 Prologue to the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare     Two households, both alike in dignity,   In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,   From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,   Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.   From forth the fatal loins of these two foes   A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;   Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows   Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.   The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,   And the continuance of their parents’ rage,   Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,   Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;   The which if you with patient ears attend,   What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.   Shakespeare spoils the whole play, telling the audience the entire premise of two lovers meeting and that they eventually ""take their life"". Surely revealing this at the start of the play kills of tension as the audience already knows Romeo and Juliet will die at the end? If so, what benefit was their for revealing this information at the start of the play?  "
998,"Why do the translators of ""Social Justice in Islam"" strongly hint at its controversiality, without mentioning what's controversial?","I recently started reading the book, ""Social Justice in Islam."" This is a book by Sayyid Qutb, translated into English by John B. Hardie, commissioned by the Near Eastern Translation Program. There's not really any good references to any of these people online outside this book, nor is there any information about what the Near Eastern Translation Program was or what it did. Questions about who ran this program and why aside (though I'm very curious to know), they went to great lengths in their translation to highlight the controversiality of this book.  But they really didn't talk about what in it was controversial, who found it controversial, and why they classify it that way. The foreword to the book reads like someone defensively trying to justify translating this book, ending, for example, with:     It should, of course, be clearly understood that the views expressed in the works translated are the opinions of the writers and not of the American Council of Learned Societies or the Committee on Near Eastern Studies.    This seems like it goes beyond the standard disclaimer of authorial opinion. Especially in context, it's written in a much more personal tone, as if the writer really wants to emphasize this point. The translator's introduction goes on to highlight exactly the same thing:     ""There will be many points which the specialist and the non-specialist alike will feel like challenging. So much the better, for this, from a Western point of view, is a provocative book. But the aim of the present work has been neither to comment nor to criticize, but simply to translate, as the author himself would have written it, had he written in English.""   This also vaguely hints at some sort of controversy, predicted or past, surrounding this book. It's also the second time this is mentioned, and it occurs no more than one page after the prior quote.   And, to be clear, there's vague historical reason to believe that this book was, indeed, controversial, even in Muslim societies. A more modern book cover has this to say about the author:     ""Social Justice in Islam"" is perhaps the best known work of Sayyib Qutb, a leading figure in the Muslim Brethen of Egypt who was executed by the regime of 'Abd al-Nasr in 1966. Despite the years that have passed since Sayyid Qutb's death, the imprint of his thought on the contemporary Islamic movements of the Arab world remains profound. [emph. mine]   To me, all of these things seem like loose threads suggesting that some part of this book either was controversial, or was expected to be controversial - both to Muslim cultures and to Western ones. But nobody really seems to want to talk about why.  Was there some sort of controversy surrounding this book, either in Muslim countries, ""Western"" countries, or both? If so, who took issue with it, and what, exactly, were the issues taken?  Also, if I'm reading this correctly, why, then, do the translators go to such great lengths to highlight how controversial this book is, without explaining anything about what's controversial in it? "
999,Symbolism of Occam's death in Straight Man?,"In Richard Russo's novel Straight Man, the protagonist Hank claims to be a philosophical disciple of William of Occam, and applies Occam's razor to his approach to deduction many times.  As I recall, the use of Occam's razor was the only way in which Hank considered himself a disciple of this William, which is also Hank's given name.    He names his dog Occam, which escapes from his house near the climax of the book, and is hit by a car and killed by one of his colleagues, Finny.  This provides some natural narrative symmetry by leading to a scene at the end where he buries his dog with his estranged dying father looking on, complementing a scene from the beginning where his father buries a dog with him as a child looking on.  One could also read into Occam's death some symbolism regarding the distance Hank puts between himself and others in his relationships.  Putting those points aside:     Is there any significance that a character named ""Occam"", rather than just Hank's dog, dies at the end?  For instance, is there any evidence that Hank no longer so strongly subscribes to Occam's razor?  "
1000,History of Spoilers,"I live in the USA, where people react poorly if you spoil a move or a book for them. However, the question What is the benefit in the Prologue &quot;spoiling&quot; the play in Romeo + Juliet? raises the interesting point that beliefs about spoilers vary according to location, time period, and culture.  Is it possible to trace our current aversion to spoilers to a specific time period? Have there been any works on the history of thought about spoilers?  I'm not quite sure how to ask this question successfully; please leave comments or edit if this question is too broad. "
1001,What was Max Beerbohm's literary relationship to Dostoevsky?,"I'm currently reading Max Beerbohm's Zuleika Dobson.  When the Duke suddenly pours out his soul to Zuleika, his regrets and love so exaggerated that readers can't help but cringe and laugh, I thought it absolutely had to be a throwback to Dostoevsky and his (socially) ridiculous characters in Notes from Underground, The Double, and although more restrained, The Idiot, The Possessed, and The Brothers Karamazov. It wasn't only those aspects like verbosity, but also a certain style—a grandeur, almost an admirable innocence.     But it is a fact that I, in whom pride   has ever been the topmost quality, have never expressed sorrow to any   one for anything. Thus, I might urge that my present abjectness must   be intolerably painful to me, and should incline you to forgive. But   such an argument were specious merely. I will be quite frank with you.   I will confess to you that, in this humbling of myself before you, I   take a pleasure as passionate as it is strange. A confusion of   feelings? Yet you, with a woman's instinct, will have already caught   the clue to it. It needs no mirror to assure me that the clue is here   for you, in my eyes. It needs no dictionary of quotations to remind me   that the eyes are the windows of the soul. And I know that from two   open windows my soul has been leaning and signalling to you, in a code   far more definitive and swifter than words of mine, that I love you.""   Given Dostoevsky's success already in Beerbohm's early life, I believe Dostoevsky must have influenced Beerbohm significantly, if he creates such a character to me so iconic of Dostoevsky. But Googling the two names only reveal some loose articles that happen to reference both authors, not any interviews or writings of Beerbohm regarding Dostoevsky. Maybe even Beerbohm found Dostoevsky disagreeable, and was satirizing Dostoevsky's caricatures of suddenly-impassioned men—I don't know.  Are there any interviews or writings regarding Beerbohm's opinion of Dostoevsky? Or was Dostoevsky so omnipresent in the late 1800s that documenting his influence on any author would have been superfluous? I'm also open to any analyses that show influence (or non-influence), even if not explicitly said or written by Beerbohm.  "
1002,Why do we see so little mention of Leopold Bloom's social isolation in his internal monologue?,"Leopold Bloom is the primary protagonist of Joyce's novel Ulysses. Throughout the novel, we are treated to an extensive transcription of his thoughts and feelings via the stream of consciousness method that Joyce was pioneering. This has lead to critics labeling Bloom as one of the most fully developed characters in literature.  A key theme of the novel is Bloom's relative social isolation. Although not poor and with apparent society connections, he is treated with mild contempt and rudeness by many of the other characters in the book. He is half-Jewish but even other relative outsiders to Irish society - such as Italian immigrant Nannetti - are shown to have a higher social status (Nannetti has been elected a Councillor) and to act as though they look down on Bloom.  What interests me is why this is rarely mentioned in his internal monologue. Indeed, given the different social mores between now and the novel's setting in 1904, it took me several chapters to realise Bloom was being disrespected by many of the other characters.   What is the purpose of this omission in the otherwise comprehensive study of Bloom's character? Are we to presume that he barely registers the snubs he perceives? Or is the lack of comment setting up some of the later themes and plot threads of the novel?  "

1004,"Which traits of Milton's Lucifer from ""Paradise Lost"" did Neil Gaiman carry to ""The Sandman""?","Lucifer Morningstar, the Vertigo Comics character, was created by Neil Gaiman with influence from John Milton's Paradise Lost - at least that's what is written on his Wikipedia page, and even on the official DC website's ""Lucifer 101"" page, which is supposed to brief new readers for the 2016 Lucifer comic series:     This incarnation of Lucifer is similar to the Lucifer in Milton’s Paradise Lost and looks a bit like David Bowie. The loveliest of the Archangels, he rebelled three seconds after Creation and ruled as Lord of Hell for 10,000,000,000 years, but became bored and tired of humanity’s view of him.   I can find a source for the similarity with David Bowie - in The Sandman Companion and in this panel from Season of Mists:    David Bowie image source  The relevant chapters of The Sandman Companion don't touch the subject of Milton's Paradise Lost, yet the the assumption that it was an influnce is floating everywhere and is taken for a fact.  Is there any evidence, in the form of an acknowledgement by Neil Gaiman, that Paradise Lost was an inflience on Lucifer's character? If so, which traits do Milton's and Gaiman's visions of Lucifer share? "
1005,What is the source of Mr. Norrell's wealth?,"In Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, the magician Norrell has cornered the market on magical books, which must have been a considerable expense. He also seems to have a considerable estate. How did he become so wealthy?  I believe that the character's motivation is driven by the British peerage, in which titles and wealth go to people who have done important things, but inherited without evincing such merit. Norrell isn't a peer of any kind, and is ridiculed when the idea of giving him a title comes up. Wealth and title don't always go together, but there often seems to be a tension between the titled class and those who earned their wealth. So where did Norrell's wealth come from? "
1006,What specifically is being described as stupid and old-fashioned in this passage on arranged marriage?,"I'm trying to rhetorically analyze a passage in Amy Tan's novel titled The Joy Luck Club, where a character, Lindo Jong, describes her experience with the arranged marriage process. I've included the passage below:     The matchmaker had bragged about me: ‘An earth horse for an earth sheep. This is the best marriage combination’… But even if I had known I was getting such a bad husband, I had no choice, now or later. We were always the last to give up stupid old-fashioned customs.   I'm currently trying to analyze the negative diction and ambiguity of this passage. The negative diction can be seen with the words ""stupid"" and ""old-fashioned."" The ambiguity occurs with the word ""customs,"" as the reader doesn't know what exactly the customs Tan is criticizing are: are the customs society's suppression of a woman's voice, or society's reliance on astrological signs?  I'm not really sure what the rhetorical goal of this passage would be, and what the purpose of the ambiguity is. Any ideas? "
1007,"Why does ""Watchmen"" use the 9-panel grid?","Watchmen, the 1986 comic written by Alan Moore and drawn/lettered by Dave Gibbons, is recogniseable (among other features) for the schematic of its comic pages - they all use the 9-panel grid:    Image source   Sometimes the pages don't have exactly 9 panels, but the geometry remains the same:     Watchmen #1, pages 12 and 24.   I haven't seen this layout anywhere in the comics I read; neither was it present in Moore's other works, e.g. V for Vendetta, drawn by David Lloyd:     V for Vendetta #1, pages 6 and 12.   All this raises two questions:   Whose idea was it to use the 9-panel grid?   It's most likely to be the artist, but Alan Moore is known for his excesisvely detailed comic scripts, and he's usually involved with the artistic process as well. What was the reason for it?  E.g. in V for Vendetta David Lloyd, the artist, decided not to have thought baloons or sounds. Just because. Alan Moore had to adapt to that. What is the story behind the 9-panel grid in Watchmen? What purpose does it story, from the point of the story, and the picture?  "

Exactly What qualities in Oblonsky kept this friendship alive?   Levin constantly chided Stiva for his bad husbandry, but if Oblonsky was as shrewd as Levin wished him to be, would Livin have liked him?

1010,Why did Shakespeare write in iambic pentameter?,Shakespeare is incredibly famous for writing a lot in iambic pentameter.   But why did he choose to write in this specific style of having ten beats and 5 stressed syllables per line? Considering it was not at all a requirement for plays at the time and many poets wrote in a completely different meter?  Wasn't this just making his life unnecessarily difficult considering the quantity of stuff he wrote in such a manner? 
1011,"Why did the writer of the 2016 ""Lucifer"" comic series change from Holly Black to Richard Kadrey?","I've been following the 2016 Lucifer series, and enjoying it. While re-arranging my Calibre library, I noticed that, while all the issues up to and including 12th have been written by Holly Black, issue 13 was written by Black and Richard Kadrey, while all issues after that were written by Kadrey alone.         Click for full resolution.   The original Lucifer comic series was written by Mike Carey alone. The Sandman was written by Neil Gaiman alone. While a rotating cast of artists is a known thing in comics, especially in The Sandman and the new Lucifer series (though not so much in Mike Carey's series), I didn't know of a series that would change the writer in the middle of the run, and especially in the middle of an arc.   I know some other comics do it, but I expected Lucifer to be held to a higher standard. What is the reason the writer was changed mid-series? Was it a pre-mediated decision, or was it because of a disagreement over the process (which seems unlikely since Black and Kadrey did an issue together)?  "

Wikipedia describes the document as a ""Nahua pictorial manuscript"", and claims that it was used as evidence in a Spanish court case.  However, the Wikipedia article also contains several images of the codex. And I have to say, looking at the images, I don't see how the codex could be used as testimony or have any sort of meaning. For example, what on earth is this image supposed to represent?     My two related questions are: how can the Huexotzinco Codex be read? How was it used as testimony in the Spanish court system? "

1015,Why do vultures unexpectedly start talking in Their Eyes Were Watching God?,"In Their Eyes Were Watching God (which is a fantastic book that is also [shameless plug] a proposed topic challenge), there's a strange scene on pages 61-62 where several vultures (a type of bird) start talking:     He finally lit on the ground and walked around the body to see if it were really dead. Peered into its nose and mouth Examined it well from end to end and leaped upon it and bowed, and the others danced a response.

So he picked out the eyes in the ceremonial way and the feast went on The yaller mule was gone from the town except for the porch talk, and for the children visiting his bleaching bones now and then in the spirit of adventure.   It's strange because, I think aside from possibly one other scene in the beginning of the book, it's the only time animals speak in the book. And as far as I can tell this isn't a particular theme of the book. So what's the point of including a page long scene where animals speak? "
1016,What was the connection between Hardy and Keats?,"Thomas Hardy's short poem ""At Lulworth Cove a Century Back"" is a sort of ode to Keats, who apparently left England from near Lulworth Cove on his way to Rome:     ""Good. That man goes to Rome — to death, despair;   And no one notes him now but you and I:   A hundred years, and the world will follow him there,   And bend with reverence where his ashes lie.""   Apparently Hardy once corresponded with a biographer of Keats who wanted to know exactly where he left England in 1820, and this correspondence inspired the poem quoted above. But why was Hardy in particular considered an authority on Keats and being consulted by his biographers? And why did he consider it a noteworthy enough thing to write a whole poem about?  What was the connection between Keats and Hardy? "

1018,"In the ""Neverending Story"", what judgement do Falkor and Atreyu make of the Childlike Empress?","When I recently read The Neverending Story to my children, they were puzzled by this passage, and I could offer no help:     “Falkor,” Atreyu asked, “do you suppose the Childlike Empress cares what becomes of Bastian?”      “Maybe not,” said Falkor. “She draws no distinctions.”      “Then,” said Atreyu, “she is really a …”      “Don’t say it,” Falkor broke in. “I know what you mean, but don’t say it.”   What is it that Atreyu is not supposed to say?  Answers with support, please, I can make my own guesses myself. "
1019,"What is the correct term for ""fine words""?","Usually when writing poems or literature, the authors looks for words that can convey their ideas faithfully. The same thing happens to the readers, when suddenly they understand the problem so clear. Mostly they're already available in the language, but sometimes one need to create a new one. In my language that kind of words are called ""fine words"", but how would English call it? It's the same thing with technical terms in academic fields, but what is an equivalent term in poetry? "
1020,Hegel on Antigone,"According to this article:     According to Hegel's account of Greek tragedy, the conflict is not between good and evil but between goods that are each making too exclusive a claim.   What is Hegel's interpretation of the play Antigone written by Sophocles? Does he say that the crisis in the play can be attributed to a clash between good and good instead of good and evil? If yes then what does he mean by being good? "
1021,Why did Maximou behave in this way towards Digenis Akrites?,"In Digenes Akrites, why did Maximou challenge Digenis to a second duel immediately after being defeated once? Also, did Maximou offer herself to Digenis after their duel or did he force himself on her? Here are some lines I found:     She springing back and in a grip of fear   Crouched down, and said, ""Let me not die, young man;   I erred woman-like, Philopappos told me.'   And I respected, her, hearing her words,   Pitied the wondrous beauty that was hers,   And left her there and turned against the rest.   This is immediately after their first duel which Digenis wins. Shortly after this, Maximo says:     Blessed your father, and your mother who bore you,   And the blessed mother's breasts which nourished you;   For such another man I never saw.   I beg you then my master to fulfil   One more request, that by it you may know   More strictly my experience in war:   Bid me to go away and mount my horse,   And in the morning I will come to this place,   That we may singly fight, none present with us,   And you shall see, good friend, my bravery.   Here she praises her opponent and immediately challenges him to a second duel. Did she expect to win the second time? "
1022,What happened to the epic poem?,"It's so strange to me that we all praised and adore things, but would never consider supporting them in a modern setting. There are many examples of this: poetry (very unpopular nowadays; not in the amount of it, but by the respectability of it), obscure, but interesting essays like A Hanging, by Orwell. But not least of these is the most impressive, which is the epic poem.  These epics, like the Illiad, the Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost, et al., are praised and taught almost as if they are a standard for incredible writing and story telling.   But I simply cannot see any modern writer putting forth an epic poem; and further still, I could reasonably suspect that it would not find its way to the best seller list.  It's an interesting question of psychology of why we praised past things, but would never wish to see them in a modern setting, or find them pretentious, but I will stick with a simpler question:  What specifically happened to the epic poem? Where did it leave us and when? And why? "
1023,What was Fred Kinnan gaining from his racket?,"In the discussion of Directive 10-289, Fred Kinnan said the following:     His smile disappeared, and with a sudden, bitter look of weariness he added, ""...I'm not going to say that I'm working for the welfare of my public, because I know I'm not. I know that I'm delivering the poor bastards into slavery, and that's all there is to it. And they know it, too. But they know that I'll have to throw them a crumb once in awhile, if I want to keep my racket, while with the rest of you they wouldn't have a chance in hell. So that's why, if they've got to be under a whip, they'd rather I held it, not you - you drooling, tear-jerking, mealy-mouthed bastards of the public welfare! Do you think that outside your college-bred pansies there's one village idiot you're fooling? I'm a racketeer - but I know it and my boys know it, and they know that I'll pay off. Not out of the kindness of my heart, either, and not a cent more than I can get away with, but at least they can count on that much. Sure, it makes me sick sometimes, it makes me sick right now, but it's not me who's built this kind of world - you did - so I'm playing the same as you've set it up and I'm going to play it for as long as it lasts - which isn't going to be long for any of us!""   What exactly was he gaining from his racket (other than getting power by having a stranglehold on the Unification Board)? "
1024,Where did the names Siegfried and Tristan Farnon come from?,"The British vet and writer Alfred Wight is best known for his series of semi-autobiographical stories written under the pen name James Herriot, recounting details of his experience as a country vet in North Yorkshire. In these books, he himself appears as James/Jim Herriot, rather than his real name of Alfred/Alf Wight, and his friends Donald and Brian Sinclair appear as Siegfried and Tristan Farnon.  The name James Herriot apparently comes from a Scottish goalkeeper whom he saw on television. What about the names Siegfried and Tristan Farnon? Where did these names come from and why? "
1025,"What is the deeper meaning of Blake's ""The Lily""?","The poem ""The Lily"" by William Blake must be one of the shortest of his Songs of Innocence and of Experience collection, only four lines long:     The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,   The humble sheep a threat’ning horn:   While the Lily white shall in love delight,   Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.   Clearly there must be some hidden meaning behind this. Blake's poems tend to have a lot of religious themes, either overt or in subtext, and it's quite implausible for one of the Songs of Experience to be just a description of nature. Also, I can't really see anything ""experience""-related in the surface meaning. Most of the Songs of Experience have something dark or threatening about them, but this seems very benign. Understanding the subtext would probably help me to understand its placement in this collection.  Why is it significant that the Lily has no sharp or threatening parts? What do the Rose, the sheep, and the Lily symbolise? (Is it significant that the sheep is not described as a lamb, which is a recurring motif in Blake's poetry?)  I've got good answers to questions like this here before. Hoping to get lucky again. "
1026,Why were Ellsworth Toohey and Peter Keating so afraid of the identity of Ellsworth Toohey's assailant?,"Shortly after he lost a commission on the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, sculpture Steven Mallory took a shot at Ellsworth Toohey as he was getting out of his car to deliver a radio address (which missed by an inch). Ellsworth Toohey took it very calmly, giving the address exactly as planned.  After finding out about the news, Peter Keating was initially worried about whether the newspaper would still be publishing Ellsworth Toohey's column the next day, which was to speak very flatteringly of him. Once he realized that Toohey wasn't dead, though, his reaction changed (especially upon learning the identity of the assailant):     Keating stared - his throat dry - at the name of the assailant. It was Steven Mallory.      Only the inexplicable frightened Keating, particularly when the inexplicable lay, not in tangible facts, but in that causeless feeling of dread within him. There was nothing to concern him directly in what had happened, except his wish that it had been someone else, anyone but Steven Mallory; and that he didn't know why he should wish this.   When Toohey found out who it was:     When he heard the name, Toohey's glance remained fixed somewhere between the shoulder of one man and the hat brim of another. Then Toohey - who had stood calmly while a bullet struck an inch from his face against the glass of the entrance door below - uttered one word and the word seemed to fall at his feet, heavy with fear: ""Why?""   Mallory himself indicated that him and Toohey had never met in person, he knew none of Toohey's friends, and that he didn't think that Toohey had anything to do with him losing the commission (which was perfectly true). The main connection was that Toohey had criticized him in his column at one point.  That being the case, why were Toohey and Keating so frightened by the Mallory's action? "
1027,What is the significance of Goldstein's book in 1984?,"In 1984 by George Orwell, Goldstein's book The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism is given roughly 30 pages of text, is largely drawn out, and seems unimportant compared to the rest of the novel. What is its significance? Couldn't the book largely be summed up in a page or two of summary from the narrator? "
1028,"Were the three slogans in Orwell's 1984 partly inspired by Kipling's poem ""The White Man's Burden""?","George Orwell did not like Kipling at all. I quote from this essay by Orwell:     Kipling is a jingo imperialist, he is morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting.   But this essay also shows that Orwell had read at least some of Kipling's poetry. I couldn't help noticing some similarities between two of the three party slogans in George Orwell's book 1984 and Kipling's poem The White Man's Burden.     Orwell: &nbsp;War Is Peace   Kipling: Take up the White Man's burden—   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage wars of peace—      Orwell: &nbsp;Freedom Is Slavery   Kipling: The cry of hosts ye humour   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:—   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why brought ye us from bondage,   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our loved Egyptian night?”      Is there any evidence as to whether Orwell's slogans were inspired in part by Kipling's poem?    (And please, let's not get into an argument about whether Kipling was entirely pro-imperialism when he wrote these lines—this question has been hashed out altogether too often.) "
1029,"What was the Red Building, the chess game, and who was the chess genius?","In The Doomed City (""Град обреченный""), when Andrei finally (spoilers, kind of) finds the Red Building and enters it, he sees a surreal host of people expecting him to a game of chess with some grandmaster.   During the game, while they both sacrifice some of their pieces, Andrei somehow realises he isn't actually supposed to play against his opponent, but that they're on the same side, in a sense. And yet he leaves.  My questions are as follows:   What is the Red Building? What does it represent?  What did the game of chess represent? Who was Andrei's opponent? What happened to other people who entered the building? Where did they go? How and why was Katzmann different, how was he able to enter and leave the building?  "
1030,What are all the stories left unfinished in The Neverending Story?,"A recurring phrase in Michael Ende's The Neverending Story, often seen when some character or characters drop out of the story, is "".. but that's another story and shall be told another time"". I believe this is what's being referenced by Bastian, Atreyu, and Falkor near the very end:     ""The Water asks you,"" Falkor translated, ""whether you completed all the stories you began in Fantastica.""      ""No,"" said Bastian. ""None of them really.""      Falkor listed awhile. His face took on a worried look.      ""In that case, it says, the white snake won't let you through. You must go back to Fantastica and finish them all.""      ""All the stories?"" Bastian stammered. ""Then I'll never be able to go back. Then it's all been for nothing.""      Falkor listened eagerly.      ""What does it say?"" Bastian wanted to know.      ""Hush!"" said Falkor.      After a while he sighed and said: ""It says there's no help for it unless someone promises to do it in your place. But no one can do that.""      ""I can! I will!"" said Atreyu.   Given the whole theme of the book - sucking readers into the story in order to continue it themselves - I think these unfinished tales are a very important thing for readers to appreciate and make note of. For anyone who wants to do what Bastian did and continue telling the Neverending Story, these stories are an easy place to start: loose strands left over which any other storyteller can continue working with.  What are all the ""other stories to be told at other times"" in The Neverending Story? "
1031,"What is ""machullah"" in Stanley G. Weinbaum's short story Graph?","Nothing specific can be said from the context and only one thing came up in my google search. I know it's a name, and it's probably Arabic in origin. But it just doesn't add up to the story really. It's in the last sentence of the following paragraph:      ""You doctors,"" continued Levinson, ""spend your efforts treating symptoms instead of causes. Because I am tired, I must go somewhere and rest; because I can't sleep, I must get out somewhere and exercise; because I have no appetite, I must go away from my business! Why don't you find why I am tired, and can't sleep or eat? I should run my business like that and in a year I'd be broke—machullah!""    I only found it on a thread about favorite words (not poker related words) in a poker forum:      ""I've always heard it pronounced gunef or even ganef and in my experience it's meaning is more angle-shooter than out and out crook although I have certainly heard it used in the context of a guy who's business went ""machullah"" or busto and had all of his property in his wife's name.""   So I guess it's something about bankruptcy?   I'm translating this story and really need to know its exact meaning and what language it is from. Thanks!  "
1032,How much of the Looters' philosophy did Fred Kinnan actually accept?,"Related: What was Fred Kinnan gaining from his racket?  In their discussion of Directive 10-289, Fred Kinnan said the following:     ""Well, if you want to talk practice,"" said Fred Kinnan, ""then let me tell you that we can't worry about businessmen at a time like this. What we've got to think about is jobs. More jobs for the people. In my unions, every man who's working is feeding five who aren't, not counting his own pack of starving relatives. If you want my advice - oh, I know you won't go for it, but it's just a thought - - issue a directive making it compulsory to add, say, one-third more men to every payroll in the country.""   ""Good God!"" yelled Taggart. ""Are you crazy? We can barely meet our payrolls as it is! There's not enough work for the men we've got now! One-third more? We wouldn't have any use for them whatever!""   ""Who cares whether you'd have any use for them?"" said Fred Kinnan. ""They need jobs. That's what comes first - need - doesn't it? - not your profits.""   A few things here: first, the formula ""it's just a thought"" is used quite regularly by looters who are afraid to take a firm stance on anything. This seems somewhat out of character for Fred Kinnan.  Secondly, is Fred Kinnan actually accepting part of the Looters' creed here? He doesn't seem to make any pretense of accepting their ideas later in the same meeting - for example, he openly admits that he's going along with Directive 10-289 because he's a racketeer, not because he thinks (or pretends) that he's acting in the public interest. How much of their philosophy does Fred Kinnan accept at this point? "
1033,What does the Malvolio subplot add to Twelfth Night?,"Most of Shakespeare's comedy Twelfth Night is about the group of main characters Viola, Sebastian, Orsino, and Olivia, and the affections requited and unrequited between them. But there's also a subplot surrounding Olivia's steward Malvolio and her other servants, which seems completely unrelated to the rest of the play. It adds more slapstick comedy to the play which might otherwise be rather more serious, but also has a dark element when Malvolio is imprisoned and tormented before vowing revenge on his tormentors.  Why is this subplot part of the play? What does it add to the story? Are we just meant to laugh at the fooling around of the servants, or to be affected by Malvolio's pathos? Does it connect in some metaphorical or symbolic sense to the main plot? "
1034,Jungian archetypes in The Many Coloured Land,"Julian May's science fantasy book, The Many-Colored Land, tells the adventures of a disparate group of time travellers (Group Green) who travel into the early Pleistocene Era. The characters are finely drawn, and seem to be almost archetypal in nature, rather than mere stereotypes. I have always wondered how well they correspond to Jungian (or other) archetypes. For example. Stein (a brawler if ever there was one) would correspond to the hero, Aiken Drum would correspond to the trickster, Sister Amery to the maiden, and Elizabeth Orme to the nurturing mother. Is this reasonable, or am I clutching at straws? Is there a better correspondence in literature?  Other characters in this book and the series (The Saga of the Exiles) are up for grabs.       Group Green      Elizabeth Orme      Elizabeth was a talented metapsychic practitioner on the human-colonised ski-resort planet Denali, but suffered severe injuries which resulted in the loss of her metapsychic abilities. Unable to cope with the trauma of this, she travelled to the Pliocene hoping to travel freely in a hot air balloon. But in an ironic twist, the shock of time travel caused her operant powers to return. The Tanu race regard her with awe as no other naturally operant metapsychics have come through the gate, and treat her as something of a celebrity. Elizabeth is a peace-loving redactor with little interest in politics, but her knowledge of advanced Milieu metapsychic techniques and her high level of metapsychic power make her an important player in the Tanu court, whether she likes it or not.      Aiken Drum      A persistent troublemaker, young Aiken Drum refused to be bent to the will of society. Offered the choice of incarceration, docilization or euthanasia, he instead chose Exile to the Pliocene. Always landing on his feet, his quick wits and schemes earned him respect from his fellow time travelers, and his latent metapsychic abilities earned him a silver torc from the Tanu. But a greater future lies ahead for this maverick Scot.      Felice Landry      Felice starts the book as a tremendously talented athlete, with superhuman strength and coercive power (in short-lived, weak control of others minds), but with barely submerged psychopathy. She chooses to go into Exile when she is banned from her sport after two other players accused her of deliberately hurting them. In Exile she discovers her powers are stronger than she had previously expected but refused to be taken by the Tanu. Later in the book, Felice joins the Lowlives helping them discover that 'Blood-Metal' (aka iron) can kill the 'Exotics'. She is determined to get a Gold Torc throughout the book, confident that it will make her powerful enough to take on the Tanu.      Richard Voorhees      Richard is an ex-spacer who came to Pliocene after being sued by an alien space crew who he refused to help whilst on a mission for a client. Richard tries to act tough throughout the book and often refuses to help other people, especially the Lowlives, but always comes through for them in the end. Richard is most notable in the book for killing the first Tanu to die in the book, in the process discovering iron to be a potent weapon against them. He also flies the aircraft at the end of the book, as the only one with enough experience to work out how.      Bryan Grenfell      Bryan works as an anthropologist in the Galactic Milieu but goes into Exile in pursuit of his love, Mercy. When he arrives in the Many Colored Land, he is regarded as special by the Tanu, who allow him to work bareneck, without a torc, while he is there. In the time where Bryan is the main view-point he often quotes ""There is a lady sweet and kind"" by Thomas Ford:           There is a lady sweet and kind,     Was never face so pleas'd my mind;     I did but see her passing by,     And yet I love her till I die.         Stein Olsen      An ex-driller with psychological scars from the death of his mother. He is of immediate interest to the Tanu, who want him as a competitor in the ritual Great Combat due to his heroic physique. With the help of Elizabeth, he is mentally healed by the human woman Sukey, with whom he falls in love.      Annamaria Roccaro      A nun who develops complex relationships with Claude and Felice.      Claude Majewski      A retired, widowed palaeontologist, planning to see the 'fossil Zoo'.   -- Wikipedia: The Many-Colored Land: Group Green  "
1035,Why are two earls the rankiest of all?,"In Iolanthe, by Gilbert and Sullivan, Phyllis sings (after discovering the ""betrayal""):     So the richest and rankiest of you all   My sorrowful heart shall choose.   then:     I'll be a countess, shall I not?    and the peers say:     Rank, it seems, is vital,   ""Countess"" is the title,   Yes, countess, countess the title, the title,    Yet the only candidates are two earls which seems a bit odd, given that half the House courts her. I see a few options:   No dukes or marquesses are available.   She just picked a title (and nobody wished to contest that).  Marchioness wouldn't fit in the song and duchess would be unrealistic.     But perhaps I'm missing some historical context or a subtle joke? "
1036,"Why is ""Oranges and Lemons"" supposed to describe child sacrifice?","The popular nursery rhyme ""Oranges and Lemons"":     Oranges and lemons,   Say the bells of St. Clement’s.      You owe me five farthings,   Say the bells of St. Martin’s.      When will you pay me?   Say the bells of Old Bailey.      When I grow rich,   Say the bells of Shoreditch.      When will that be?   Say the bells of Stepney.      I do not know,   Says the great bell of Bow.      Here comes a candle to light you to bed,   And here comes a chopper to chop off your head!   Has apparently a darker meaning:     Various theories have been advanced to account for the rhyme, including: that it deals with child sacrifice; that it describes public executions; and that it describes Henry VIII’s marital difficulties. Problematically for these theories the last two lines, with their different metre, do not appear in the earlier recorded versions of the rhyme.     source    While I can understand the public execution theory:     The gaol stood on the current site of the Old Bailey, next to St Sepulchre’s church (the bells of Old Bailey in the rhyme). The sound of that church’s “great” tenor bell striking 9am on a Monday morning would signal the start of any hangings due to take place that week. The prisoners on death row were visited the night before by the bell man of St Sepulchre, who would hold a candle in one hand and ring the execution bell in the other.    ibid   I have problems understanding why this would suggest child sacrifice, something that would be abhorrent in XVII century Europe and probably not heard of since the fall of the pre-Columbian Aztec empire.   Was it just meant to be a simple scary story, beware of the boogeyman?  "
1037,"Does the title of ""The Neverending Story"" have a double meaning?","I only recently started the book, so forgive me if I'm missing something that's made obvious later in the book, but does the title of The Neverending Story have a double meaning? Bastian assumes when he starts reading that it just means that you can keep reading the book as long as you want, but does it mean that you might literally be unable to stop reading it or ""get out of"" the story? That would technically be a ""neverending story."" "
1038,"Why do the names of the first two characters introduced in ""The Neverending Story"" start with B and C?","I only recently started the book, so I'm hoping that I'm not missing something that's made clear in the book later, but the first character introduced in the book is named Bastian Balthazar Bux (whose names start entirely with the letter ""B""). The second character introduced is Carl Conrad Coreander (whose names start entirely with the letter ""C"").  Why ""B"" and ""C""? These are obviously consecutive letters, but if the author is going with consecutive letters then why not ""A"" and ""B"" or something like that? It seems a little weird to just start at ""B"" and ""C"" here. "
1039,Did medieval romances develop into modern romances?,"I'm reading Arthurian texts and I know that it's considered a romance, but there is there such a big difference between modern romance, love stories, and medieval romances, which can be tales of adventure. My question is this: did medieval romances develop into the modern romance genre we know today? If not, why and when did the difference occur? "
1040,"When authors write a single work in multiple languages or translate their own work, how can we determine which version is definitive?","As established in the question, Do authors who translate their own works tend to do accurate translations?, authors who translate their work often emphasize different elements and they do not always give the most 'accurate' translation, from a purely objective perspective. In this question, it is observed that other translations of the works are made, in addition to the authors.  From this it is clear, that there could in some cases be significant variance between the original and the translated languages' editions. When analyzing the work, which version should be taken as the definitive edition, given that they were both produced by the author? What about when neither is published explicitly as a translation of the other? "
1041,Why is the book called Lorna Doone?,"In the book we learn that      Lorna Doone isn't actually a Doone.   So I was wondering, couldn't they have come up with a better name for the book? Or was the whole theme of the title supposed to be a mystery? "
1042,"What is the tone of ""Spring"" by Gerard Manley Hopkins?","Here is the poem ""Spring"" by Gerard Manley Hopkins:     Nothing is so beautiful as Spring–              When weeds, in wheels,   shoot long and lovely and lush;       Thrush’s eggs look little   low heavens, and thrush     Through the echoing timber does so   rinse and wring      The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear   him sing;     The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush   The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush      With   richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.           What is all this juice and all this joy?       A strain of the   earth’s sweet being in the beginning    In Eden's garden. -– Have, get,   before it cloy.        Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour   with sinning,        Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,   Most, O maid’s child, thy choice and worthy the winning.   The book I use for the SAT preparation asks about the tone of the poem. There are two answer choices I have a problem with:     A) meditative and reverent.   B) respectful yet admonishing.     In my opinion, the tone is not admonishing which made me eliminate choice B. A is actually a correct answer choice, but I am a bit confused by the explanation to this question. In regard to the incorrect answer choice B, the explanation says that ""there is nothing respectful about [the poem]."" However, as far as I understand, ""respectful"" and ""reverent"" are actually synonyms with ""reverent"" having a deeper, more intense, feeling of respect towards something. My question is: How can there be then ""nothing respectful about"" the poem if the tone is meditative and reverent? Thank you for any help and suggestions! "
1043,Why did Ellsworth Toohey advise people against doing what they really wanted when he was a career advisor?,"Prior to his job on The Banner, Ellsworth Toohey spent awhile as a career advisor at a college. One of his distinctive traits as a career advisor was that he usually advised people against doing what they really wanted to do, which directly lead to at least one person's eventual suicide:     People noticed that Ellsworth Toohey seldom let a boy pursue the career he had chosen. ""No, I wouldn't go for law if I were you. You're much too tense and passionate about it. A hysterical devotion to one's career does not make for happiness or success. It is wiser to select a profession about which you can be calm, sane and matter-of-fact. Yes, even if you hate it. It makes for down-to-earthness.""...      After leaving college some of his proteges did quite well, others failed. Only one committed suicide. It was said that Ellsworth Toohey had exercised a beneficent influence upon them - for they never forgot him: they came to consult him on many things, years later, they wrote him, they clung to him. They were like machines without a self-starter, that had to be cranked up by an outside hand. He was never too busy to give him his full attention.   We already know from elsewhere in the book that Elsworth Toohey is actually power-hungry, narcissistic, and sociopathic (hence, for example, his attempted takeover of The Banner's editorial policy). But why this? Is it just for the pleasure of having power over them? "
1044,What are the hand signals based on Kipling's books?,"I'm listening to ""Lucifer's Hammer"" and more than once book mentions hand signals based on Kipling's books.  Something along the line of this: one person is manning a barricade, another man in a hide-out with a scoped rifle. And man on barricade meets people and depending on obscure hand signals rifle-man knows what is happening down there. In one case both hands were up - a signal to shoot the incoming party.   So the question is - what are the signals? Anywhere I can read about them? And what is the book by Kipling that explains these?  (I'm new here, not sure about the appropriate tags yet. Please add as you see fit) "

1046,Relevance to literature of 1623 ban on swearing in England,"In 1606, the English Parliament passed the Act to Restrain Abuses of Players, and plays written after that date avoided using the names of God or Jesus ""jestingly or profanely"".   The Wikipedia article about minced oaths claims that     Swearing on stage was officially banned by the Act to Restraine Abuses of Players in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623.   However, the 1623 ban is tagged ""citation needed"", so the exact nature of that ban is unclear. Was it simply a ban on swearing anywhere or did it also mention the theatre or literature generally. The wording ""general ban"" suggest that it does not focus on the theatre or literature, but a citation is needed to verify that claim. I couldn't find any other information about such a ban on The History of Parliament Online or on British History Online.  So I have a twofold question:   Did the English Parliament pass a ban on swearing or profane language in 1623? Did this ban or act specifically mention the theatre or literature?  "

1048,Religious symbolism of the Telmarines?,"The religious symbolism in C.S. Lewis's Narnia books is well known and, in many cases, very clear: Aslan is Jesus, the Calormenes are a very stereotypical portrayal of Muslims, the Dwarfs may represent Jews, and so on.  What about the Telmarines, as seen in Prince Caspian? They rule over Narnia and banish the talking creatures and dwarfs, hags, etc. to the mere legends that they are in our own world. Do they represent anything in the symbolic Lewisian theology? Atheists, perhaps? "
1049,"Does Blake appeal to his readers' faith in the last stanza of ""Holy Thursday""?","Here is the poem ""Holy Thursday"" from Songs of Experience by William Blake:     Is this a holy thing to see,   In a rich and fruitful land?   Babes reduced to misery,   Fed with cold and usurious hand.      Is that trembling cry a song?   Can it be a song of joy?   And so   many children poor?   It is a land of poverty!      And their sun does never shine,   And their fields are bleak and   bare,   And their ways are filled with thorns;   It is eternal   winter there.      For where-e’er the sun does shine,   And where-e’er the rain does   fall,   Babe can never hunger there,   Nor poverty the mind appall.   In a practice test on the SAT Literature Subject exam, I found a question about the last stanza specifically:     In the final stanza, what does Blake appeal to in his readers?   I.   Their emotions   II. Their faith   III. Their reason   (A) I only   (B) II only   (C) III only   (D) I and III   (E) I, II, and III   The only choice I am completely sure about here is III because it seems logical to have enough food in the place where ""the sun does shine"" and ""the rain does fall"" which is not the case in the reality. Also, I can agree with the choice I since the reader can feel pity for those in the poem who lived in poverty and hunger. However, I can't find a reason why the choice II may be correct. It is understandable that the poem itself does touch the subject of faith, but does Blake appeal to it in the last stanza specifically? Here is the test explanation for this question:     First, decide which of the Roman numeral item(s) is or are correct.   Blake appeals to his readers’ emotions, so item I is correct. Although   there is no mention in the stanza of religion, God, or faith, item II,   the title “Holy Thursday” implies a religious context, making item II   also correct. Blake does call on his readers’ reason, so item III   should be included in the answer. Choice (E), which includes items I,   II, and III, is the correct answer.   Here, I couldn't find how Blake appeals to faith in the last stanza. Please explain whether the subject of faith is maybe implied in the final stanza or influences it indirectly. "
1050,"What is ""the sin which ruined our first parents"" in The Count of Monte Cristo?","The opening of Chapter 12 of The Count of Monte Cristo describes a meeting between Villefort and his father Noirtier, on which a servant apparently attempted to eavesdrop. The passage (translation from Chapman &amp; Hall 1846 with my emphasis) reads as follows:     M. Noirtier – for it was, indeed, he who entered – looked after the   servant until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that   he might be overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again,   nor was the precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of   Germain, who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined   our first parents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt   the ante-chamber door, then that of the bed-chamber, and then extended   his hand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise   which he could not conceal.   What is the reference to ""the sin which ruined our first parents""? I thought it might be a reference to the biblical sin of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, but if that's the case I'm wondering what the exact parallel is between eating forbidden fruit and eavesdropping on a private conversation. Or is this a reference to a Christian doctrine in which all sin is some sort of extension of the Original Sin? Or is this a reference to something else entirely? "
1051,Solzhenitsyn's Red Wheel,"I've heard that all of Solzhenitsyn's work is to be in English by the centennial of his birth, which is this year. I'm trying to understand just what new English translations we can expect this year, especially in the Red Wheel series.  Is the bibliography of Solzhenitsyn's The Red Wheel at Wikipedia full and complete? The reason I ask is that the paragraph following the fourth book says that Solzhenitsyn originally intended to carry the cycle through until 1922 when Lenin had his first stroke and went on medical leave. Did any of the books that followed April 1917 ever get written or is April 1917 the absolute end of the cycle?   Has an English translation of April 1917 appeared yet? If not, when can we expect it? Have Russian editions of any further books in the Red Wheel cycle appeared? If so, when can we expect those to appear in English? "
1052,"What qualifies something as ""Lovecraftian""?","I often hear the term ""Lovecraftian"" used in reference to describe certain elements of horror literature or film. I do understand this to be a reference to H.P. Lovecraft and his style of horror, but where I'm a little unclear is on what degree of similarity to style would classify a work as ""Lovecraftian"".   For example, if a horror story had to do with a monster with strange tentacles, this would commonly be referred to as Lovecraftian, but is that just because of the tentacles monster? Are there any examples of tentacled monsters that are not considered ""Lovecraftian""?  Is there a clear definition of what would qualify something as being ""Lovecraftian""? "

1060,What is the literary effect of dropping articles from titles?,"Quite a few novels and films have titles which, if they appeared as phrases in everyday speech or writing, would normally have to be preceded by an article or other determiner. Some examples: Animal Farm, Little House on the Prairie, and Tropic of Cancer among novels, and Easy Rider, Taxi Driver, and Rear Window among films.  My question  My question is this: what artistic or literary effect does the omission of the leading determiner have in my six examples? Or, equivalently: why might an author prefer the above-cited versions of the titles over, say, An/The Animal Farm, A/The Little House on the Prairie, The Tropic of Cancer, The Easy Rider, The Taxi Driver, and The/A Rear Window?  I doubt it's the same reason (or group of reasons) in all cases. For example, in the answer which I posted below, I argue that the reasons for dropping the article from Easy Rider are unlikely to apply to Little House on the Prairie. This is why I think one needs to consider a number of examples before any patterns start to emerge.  A bit of grammar  Let's temporarily treat each of my six titles not as the name of a novel or film but as just a bit of regular text, a ‘word group’, and let's see how it behaves when we try to form complete sentences with it. We will soon notice two things.  First, we are normally forced to add another word in front of our word group, e.g. my little house on the prairie was a good place to grow up and next they saw an animal farm. Words that will work (which we'll called determiners) include (1) the possessives such as my and Alice's, and (2) the determinatives, which include the articles a and the as well as words such as some, this, that, each, and every.   Second, the grammatical behavior of our word group is inherited from one of its nouns (farm, house, tropic, rider, driver, and window), which is therefore called its head. By ‘grammatical behavior’ I mean facts like these: once we add a determiner, the word group can function as the subject of the sentence, the object of a transitive verb, etc.; when it is the subject, we must have subject-verb agreement; and so on. We say that adding the determiner to our word group turns it into a noun phrase (NP).  A word group whose head is a noun but which has no determiner is often called a nominal or sometimes a bare nominal. Some nominals can be acceptable even without adding a determiner, in which case they are called bare NPs and are often described as carrying the zero article or sometimes the null article.   The reason our titles (when viewed as just text) normally require a determiner is that their head nouns are all count nouns in the singular. (Count nouns are also called countable nouns.) Normally, a nominal can escape the requirement of having a determiner only if its head noun is one of the following: (1) a proper name, (2) a count noun in the plural (houses on the hill), or (3) an uncount noun (also called a mass noun, uncountable noun, or non-count noun—e.g. deep blue water).   English wouldn't be English if there weren't any exceptions, and indeed there are some rare exceptions to what I just said, see here. None of them apply to our titles, however.  Ambiguities: those I excluded, and those that could help  The problem, to repeat, is to explain what is the literary effect of having a normally unacceptable nominal be the title—or, equivalently, what reason an author might have for choosing such a title.  I have picked my particular examples in part because they cannot be explained by pointing out that the lack of an article makes for an interesting ambiguity as far as whether the word is really a noun, or rather an adjective (as in Alien) or a verb (as in Network).1   1True, farm and house are also verbs, and tropic is also an adjective. But in my examples, other words make it clear that they are used as nouns there.  I suppose there could be cases where the ambiguity that's being played on is that between the countable and uncountable readings of the head noun. I don't think that's the case in my examples; I don't think any of the head nouns in my examples have any uncount meanings at all (at least not any relevant meanings; house does have one uncount meaning, that of a style of dance music).   Further, I think my six examples also can't be explained by postulating a non-standard usage for the head noun, in which a normally count noun is to be interpreted as an uncount one. That explanation might be viable with some other titles,2 but I don't think it's a believable one with my six examples.  2I am purposefully not going to give possible examples that come to my mind, so as to not encourage straying off topic.  One kind of ambiguity that does seem possible is that between the indefinite and definite readings of the noun group. This could be relevant to some of my examples (though I don't think it could apply to all of them); in my answer below, I explore this kind of ambiguity in the case of Easy Rider.  Finally, there could be an ambiguity in the grammatical number, i.e. in whether the noun group has a singular or a plural meaning. This is a bit of a stretch in my examples, in which all the head nouns have plurals that are not base plurals (i.e. whose form is not identical with the singular). Nevertheless, I will briefly explore this possibility on the example of Easy Rider.  I'm sure that titles of some dramas and even of some operas also fall within the scope of my question. However, for definiteness, unless there is a particularly compelling reason, let us please stick to titles of novels and movies.   What I am not asking  Let me stress from the outset that this is not a grammar question. Coming up with the title of a work of art is itself a creative process, for the title can influence the reading of the rest of the work.   Also, this is not a question about headlines and the writing style used in them, which is sometimes called 'headlinese'. Although the topic of headlinese might be somewhat related to my question, it is still true that newspaper/magazine/blog post/etc. articles are not normally taken to be pieces of artistic literature (unless they explicitly are, as when a magazine publishes a short story; that case, of course, is fair game). In headlines, the main consideration is that of saving space. In contrast, while titles of novels and films are usually relatively short (although see here), it seems to me that this is primarily for aesthetic reasons, not pragmatic ones. Moreover, headlinese has many other features, besides the dropping of articles, which are not shared by titles of novels and films. Some examples of these are (1) the preference for the simple present tense (e.g. Governor signs bill), (2) the extensive use of abbreviations and metonymy (e.g. Wall Street for the financial industry), (3) the absence of honorifics before names of individuals, and (4) the preference for short words which are only much more rarely used in normal speech and writing in that meaning (e.g. bid for 'attempt', see for 'forecast', and tap for 'select an appointee'). In short, it cannot be said that titles of novels and films—even those where articles are dropped— are written in headlinese.  Similar comments apply to any connection to the language of signs and notices.  I am not asking about titles of poems. Poetic language presents a whole other level of complication which I don't want to get into. I admit that some titles of movies and novels could be taken as being poetic, but I also think that this is not a fair thing to say about e.g. Rear Window or Taxi Driver.   I take song lyrics to be a species of poem, and so I don't want to consider titles of songs, either.   Titles of visual works of art, especially the more abstract and conceptual art, are also often too far removed from ordinary speech and writing to be useful for the purposes of my question. However, visual art of earlier epochs is probably fair game, as is art that is more in line with the traditions of earlier epochs, and which is often more figurative. Indeed, I've found a relevant discussion in that context. In the summary of the research I've done so far, I will present what seems to me the most interesting part of that discussion (Japanese Vase vs. A Japanese Vase vs. The Japanese Vase).  I am not asking about band names (i.e. the names of rock/pop/rap/etc. music groups)  And I am also not asking about brand names.  Grammar Girl has an interesting discussion of article use in both band and brand names (here), but in the end, her conclusions are not relevant to my question. I will explain why in the summary of the research I've done.  I am not asking about the names of ships, trains, and the like (see here and here). That context is simply too different from my question. Similarly, I am not asking about the names of lakes, mountains, and the like. And I'm not asking about the names of superheroes.  Summary of the research conducted so far  At the suggestion of Gallifreyan, I've migrated the research I've done so far to an answer (see below). It's quite long, and it includes works by others as well as a little original analysis of mine that I've done for the case of Easy Rider. "
1061,"What is Baldwin referring to by the ""magnificent twenties""?","In his Many Thousands Gone, James Baldwin wrote        We cannot, to begin with, divorce this book from the specific social   climate of that time; it was one of the last of all through the   thirties, dealing with the inequities of the social structure of   America.  It was published one year before our entry into the last   world war–which is to say, very few years after the dissolution of the   WPA and the end of the New Deal and at time when bread lines and soup   kitchens and bloody industrial battles were bright in everyone’s   memory.  The rigors of that unexpected time filled us not only with a   genuinely bewildered and despairing idealism–so that, because there at   least was something to fight for, young men went off to die in   Spain–but also with a genuinely bewildered self-consciousness.  The   Negro, who had been during the magnificent twenties a passionate and   delightful primitive, now became, as one of the things we were most   self-conscious about, our most oppressed minority. In the thirties,   swallowing Marx whole, we discovered the Worker and realized–I should   think with some relief–that the aims of the Worker and the aims of the   Negro were one.  This theorem to which we shall return–seems now to   leave rather too much out of account; it became, nevertheless, one of   the slogans of the “class struggle” and the gospel of the New Negro.   I am especially interested in the part indicated in bold. What is he referring to by the ""magnificent twenties""? Apparently, there was a change of attitude towards the black community.

1064,Children's book(s) with animal stories,"I am trying to find a children's book(s) that I read as a kid. I read it around 1991-2000 so it could only be sooner than that, no later. I am saying books because they might be 2, although I think it was just 1.  All the characters in the books were animals that could talk and there were different stories about each one of them.   I think the cover, when you open both sides would be the whole jungle with a pond(or lake) in the middle where some would fish, other would just climb the trees and other animals would just sit nearby.  I also recall that one of the stories was about an aligator that was a dentist.   And one of the stories, maybe the last, was a christmas(?) story about mice that were living to a snowy village with a bridge and lanterns and at some point one mouse was carrying something with a sledge.  In case there are 2 books, then the story about the mice would be the 2nd one.  Anyone seen/read any of these?  Thanks  Edit to add more info:   To the best of my recollection,  1. They are picture books with 1 page of an image and the other page with a story relevant to the image.  2. I would say they are anthropomorphic since I remember the dentist wearing a uniform and using tools.  3. The age would be 4-8 I guess, I don't remember when kids start to read xd  4.

1068,"What does this paragraph of ""An Equal Music"" by Vikram Seth mean?","I'm (re-)reading ""An Equal Music"" by Vikram Seth and encountered the following paragraph which I do not understand.  For context, the book is written in first person perspective (although that isn't apparent in the quoted portion), the main character (Michael) is a violinist and at this point in the book the love of his life (Julia) has just left Venice to go home to her husband. Michael stays in Venice (since he is on tour with his string quartet).  Here is the passage I'm having trouble with, I marked the specific words and phrases I do not understand in cursive:     A walk at the end of the world, the earthquake plate, alone; the   mudflats of subsidence and flood, and the hermitage of the one who   found the true cross. Then in the city on the day of the earthquake   was born the weak priest whose writings were dispersed, coming through   hands and hands to the library of the curved wall. There they lay till   ecstasy rose unheard to the crowning angels and the dove. If we were   dolphins, what would we play? If we had four hands would Bach's mind   have further branched? Let our thumbs be opposable at the opposite   edge. Let our teeth be pulled, let us have baleen like whales, that   our plankton love might grow, that we might ungnashing plash and play.   There are three points I have trouble with:   Saint Helena (of Constatinople) is the one who (allegedly) found the true cross, and there is a chapel dedicated to her in the outskirts of Venice (a city plagued by earthquakes), which Michael and Julia have visited. However, who goes on this walk alone? Initially I thought it would be Michael revisiting places they went to together alone but since the next sentence starts with ""then"", it seems the walk has to precede the birth of the weak priest (1678) while the story is set in the present. Also, I don't understand what the mudflats of subsidence and flood are supposed to be.   For context to the next phrase I'm having trouble with, an explanation of the weak priest: the composer Antonio Vivaldi (1678 - 1741) was born in Venice, (allegedly) during an earthquake, became a priest and had terrible health. He wrote a piece Michael and Julia played together which is part of  a set (now called the Manchester Sonatas) discovered only relatively recently (very recently when the book was written) in the Manchester city library (where Michael has spent time earlier in the book) which, according to Google Images, is a round building (so there is only one outside wall, in the obviously curved shape of a circle).   Apparently the discovery of the Manchester Sonatas coincided with the rising of ecstasy – I don't have a clue. Neither do I know whether they lay unheard (which is obviously true, since, having been forgotten, they weren't played until their discovery) or whether ecstasy rose unheard (which makes no sense to me but the word order seems to indicate this). Who are the crowning angels? And does the dove symbolise the Holy Spirit? The idea of music being written and played soli deo gloria was common in Vivaldi's time, but in the present music isn't regarded in this way anymore. What comes next might seem bizarre but Michael wouldn't be the first to wonder what composers would have composed if circumstances had been different. Though usually the question is what a composer had written if they had been born in a different time (usually later), what would change if humans had had a different physiology is not so farfetched. But what does this have to do with the rest of the paragraph? My best guess is that this wishing for different music for a different human condition somehow relates to him wishing for different circumstances in which he could be with Julia (an important motif in the book is them playing together) but I'm not exactly convinced of this interpretation.

1070,Why does Pennywise Kill Patrick Hockstetter?,"In Stephen King's IT, we are introduced to some particularly evil characters such as Beverley's husband Tom Rogan, Henry Bowers, and most notably Patrick Hockstetter. King delves into this maniacal, heartless, and excessively cruel character toward the end of the book. Despite torturing animals, molesting people, and otherwise horrifying everyone he is around, Hockstetter is captured and murdered by Pennywise the clown. Being that Patrick is a character who is generally unimpressed with terror, I am curious why Pennywise decides to kill him.   We know Pennywise will ""use"" people to further his agenda, for example, he recruits Henry Bowers to help kill the Losers. Why not use Hockstetter? Hockstetter has killed before, his little brother who he smothered, why not use this individual who clearly enjoys violence and isn't driven by rage like Bowers? There could be a long discussion about the differences between Bowers and Hockstetter, but I believe that can be determined by examining their goals. Bowers hates the Losers, Hockstetter is indifferent to them. I'm curious as to what other people think about these two individuals and why Pennywise might select Bowers over Hockstetter. "

1072,English translation of The Promised Land by Władysław Reymont,Does The Promised Land by Władysław Reymont have an English translation?  I could not find it on Amazon. I am very naive about book shopping beyond Amazon and I could not find anything by Googling. Does anyone know?

1074,"What real word is ""havekar"" alluding to?","During the 2nd chapter of Baptism Of Fire, Geralt and Dandelion come across a group of traders trying to sell Cahir to the Nilfgaardian army, who are introduced as ""havekars"", basically war profiteers selling weapons to the Scoia'tael.  But while the term ""havekar"" is explained to be, within the story, a sloppy transliteration of a (supposedly fictional) elven word, the text seems to suggest that it has, or at least points to, a real meaning in human language, too:     Money ruled the world, and demand created supply. The Scoia'tael roaming the woods piled up huge loot, for which they had no use, though. But they lacked in gear and weapons. This way a flying trade arose in the woods. And a kind of humans who catered to that trade. On the forest paths, glades and aisles quietly and secretly the carts of the speculators appeared, who did business with the squirrels. The elves called them hav'caaren, an untranslatable word, but in which ringed predatory greed. Among the humans the term ""havekar"" vernacularized, and that reminded of an even more detestable word. For it were detestable people. Cruel and ruthless they didn't shy away from anything, not even murder. A havekar caught by the army couldn't count on mercy. The same as he himself didn't use to be merciful. If he encountered someone who could reveal him to the soldiers, he reached for crossbow or knife without hesitation.   But it's unclear to me what ""even more detestable word"" Sapkowski is alluding to here (which might extratextually have in turn inspired the elven word). This is made especially difficult since I didn't read the Polish original but its German translation (and thus the above excerpt has actually been translated into English by me from Erik Simon's official German translation). So it might very well be that the allusion got itself lost in translation and refers to a Polish word that doesn't actually fit to ""havekar"" in German. Alternatively, ""havekar"" might itself have been translated from Polish in order to make sense in the translation, a sense I'm nevertheless still missing.  So what real word is he hinting at here that the ostensible transliteration ""havekar"" is supposed to remind us of? Does this only make sense in Polish? Or does it maybe not even make sense in the original and is itself an empty allusion for the sheer sake of worldbuilding through incomplete knowledge? "
1075,"Meaning of ""a ship saluting like a stuntman"" in Ted Hughes' ""In Laughter""","In Ted Hughes' ""In Laughter"" (A Crow poem. See it fully here), the first paragraph depicts ""colliding"" and ""crashing"" as the kind of events that happen ""In laughter"":     In laughter   Cars collide and erupt luggage and babies   In laughter   The steamer upends and goes under saluting like a stuntman   In laughter   The nosediving aircraft concludes with a boom   In laughter   People's arms and legs fly off and fly on again   In laughter   The haggard mask on the bed rediscovers its pang   In laughter, in laughter   The meteorite crashes   With extraordinary ill-luck on the pram   [Note that the repeating line ""In laughter"" is the beginning, not the ending, of each couplet, as evident by Crow's audio version].  In this paragraph, there's one image that I'm not sure how to interpret:     The steamer upends and goes under saluting like a stuntman   ""saluting"" may simply mean a nautical etiquette flag dipping (and see also this comment), but how do a ""saluting"" and a ""stuntman"" are connected to each other as an image of a sinking steamer ship?

1076,Is A Supplement to the Journey to the West from the 17th century the oldest Chinese work of literature involving time travel?,"A Supplement to the Journey to the West is a Chinese novel from around 1640 that was written as a type of addendum to the great classic novel Journey to the West. Journey to the West is set during the Tang dynasty (618 - 907), since it involves a character, Xuanzang that lived during that period. In A Supplement to the Journey to the West, one of the characters, Sun Wukong aka Monkey     leaps through and travels hundreds of years forward in time to the Song Dynasty,   which officially lasted from 960 until 1279.  In the West (i.e. Europe, not the ""West"" from the novel's title), the concept of time travel was popularised by H. G. Well's story The Time Machine, published in 1895, i.e. three and a half centuries after A Supplement to the Journey to the West. The Wikipedia article on time travel mentions older examples from other literatures, e.g. from the Mahabharata (India) and from 8th-century Japanese literature. Is A Supplement to the Journey to the West the oldest Chinese example? If not, what is the oldest one? "
1077,"Analysis of ""Liberty Tree"" by Thomas Paine","I am having some trouble comprehending a portion of ""Liberty Tree"" by Thomas Paine, and was unable to find a decent analysis of it. It is my understanding that this poem is about the Liberty Tree that was located in Boston where the Sons of Liberty met in order to plan (it died in 1923, and is now memorialized by a statue).  Specifically this stanza:     In a chariot of light, from the regions of the day,   The Goddess of Liberty came,   Ten thousand celestials directed her way,   And hither conducted the dame.   A fair budding branch from the gardens above,   Where millions with millions agree,   She brought in her hand as a pledge of her love,   And the plant she named Liberty Tree.   Update:  Also, is this reference to timber about the pine which was supplied by the colonies to make masts for their ships?      Beneath this fair tree, like the patriarchs of old,   Their bread in contentment they ate,   Unvexed with the troubles of silver or gold,   The cares of the grand and the great.   With timber and tar they Old England supplied,   And supported her power on the sea;   Her battles they fought, without getting a groat,   For the honor of Liberty Tree.   Update 2:   My question was poorly worded, and I did not accurately communicate my points of confusion. I suppose what is really confusing me is specific lines within each stanza. Allow me to provide one example.      And hither conducted the dame.   A fair budding branch from the gardens above,   Where millions with millions agree,   What exactly does this mean? I can understand the overall meaning of the individual stanzas, but certain points confuse me. Even with my researching the definitions. "
1078,"In the short story ""Should Wizard hit Mommy"" by John Updike,what is the author conveying through his narrated story and contradicting actions","The short story ""Should Wizard hit Mommy"" by John Updike (a short five-to-ten-minute read) is on my curriculum; it involves a father who tells a nap-time story to his daughter.  It appears to be a story, that the father is telling her to teach her values, but I couldn't understand what really the author wanted to tell us. What was the real morale of the story?  Because in the middle he says that he has to finish the story quickly to help his 6-month pregnant wife, but in the last paragraph he says that he feels like being in a cage, and doesn't want to speak or touch her!?     “The poor kid,” he answered, and with utter weariness watched his wife labour. The woodwork, a cage of moldings and rails and baseboards all around them, was half old tan and half new ivory and he felt caught in an ugly middle position, and though he as well felt his wife’s presence in the cage with him, he did not want to speak with her, work with her, touch her , anything.   Also why does he call his daughter a ""poor kid""? What exactly is the author conveying here? "
1079,Why does Mr Darcy immediately suspect Mrs Gardiner of telling Elizabeth of his hand in marrying Lydia?,"   Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said, 'Mr Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known  to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.'   'I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,' replied Darcy,  in the tone of surprise and emotion, 'that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs Gardiner was so little to be trusted.'   'You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned with the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.   Volume 3, Chapter 16   As far as I can make out, a few people knew Mr Darcy was involved with Mr Wickham/Lydia affair:   Mr Gardiner Mrs Gardiner The Gardiner children Lydia Mr Wickham   Given that Mr Darcy knew what a thoughtless person Lydia was, why did he not suspect her?  I assume he would have known the embargo Mr Wickham placed on his new wife,     '...But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!'   Volume 3, Chapter 9   But did Darcy think such a promise would stand with Lydia, and it was merely a gentleman's agreement for discretion between himself and the Gardiners that he thinks Mrs Gardiner broke?  Is this an example of sexism/the titular prejudice on Mr Darcy's part, or does he consider the closeness between Elizabeth and Mrs Gardiner as the reason for her suspected divulgence?  "
1080,"""Remembrance Day"" in ""Jude the Obscure""","In Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure (1894-95) some of the characters meet in Christminster (Oxford) on ""Remembrance Day"". For example:     ""The place seems gay,"" said Sue. ""Why—it is Remembrance Day!—Jude—how   sly of you—you came to-day on purpose!""   There is also this passage:     ""Oh, that's the Doctors in the theatre, conferring Honorary degrees on   the Duke of Hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that   sort. It's Remembrance Week, you know. The cheers come from the young   men.""   This appears to be an Oxford University-specific commemoration. However, I can find no reference to this celebration on-line.  Can someone point me to a source that explains what ""Remembrance Day"" in Jude the Obscure is in celebration of?  Or, did Hardy simply make this up? "

1082,How much experience does Mark Haddon have with the autism spectrum?,"While The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is not supposed to be about autism, Asperger's or the autism spectrum, it does feature it prominently in that Christopher, the main character, is on the spectrum.  However, it wasn't clear to me how much Mark Haddon knew about this topic.  Did he have any personal experiences with autism that led to him writing TCIOTDITNT?  If not, how much research did he do on the topic? "
1083,"Is there ""required"" background reading for ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces""?","The influence of ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"" by Joseph Campbell is well documented. I have picked up the version published in the ""Collected Works of Joseph Campbell"" series and have sadly found it to be disjointed and in many cases extremely difficult to understand or find the through-line of thoughts or ideas of 'The Hero's Journey'- in fact, the clearest representation of the journey I can find in this volume is in the table of contents.  I am not critiquing the work itself (due responsibility should first be placed on me, the reader); however, given the 'Collected Works' version I am forced to wonder if there is a volume for background reading from Campbell that makes this volume more clear? In other words - in this book, have I walked into Part II or III when I'm expected to have read Part I and I simply don't have the necessary background the author is expecting?  "
1084,Does time pass for people turned to gold?,"In The Lost Hero, when Piper wakes up from being a gold statue:     Piper woke up cold and shivering.   She’d had the worst dream about an old guy with donkey ears chasing her around and shouting, You’re it!   -The Lost Hero, chapter 33   She obviously wasn't aware of being gold, i.e. she couldn't look out her own eyes and she wasn't a disembodied consciousness.   However, looking at other golden statues like Midas's barber, they (presumably) look the same as they did a long time ago (or else somebody would have noticed that they're a pile of dust).  Piper wasn't aware of time passing, but she dreamt, so she had some brain activity thus time was passing for her. But what about the other people? Does time just move really slow? "
1085,"What is the significance of the black void in ""The Dancer on the Stairs""?","Sarah Tolmie's novelette The Dancer on the Stairs is a kind of portal fantasy, with the protagonist whisked away from our world into a strange fantastical one -- except the place she is whisked to is a guarded stairway, where she depends on charity and desperation to survive, and can get out only by growing to learn the strange culture, and forge a meaningful bond with another.  At the story's conclusion, long after she has escaped, the protagonist is in an unexpected position of responsibility -- orchestrating the enigmatic coronation dance. And here, at the climax of the dance several strange things happen - a break from the culture's fundamental order; a miraculous signal; and also, this:     It is over. But not for me. There is no more rising effervescence, but a terrible black suction into an upward void, pulling pulling pulling. I scream and hold on to Yestril and to the railing, clutching the stone, every cell protesting movement upward, movement away.      The pull ceases, and I fall down.      A murmur passes through the crowd below, an outcry. Four members of the royal family, in their octagonal enclosure, are gone. There are tears, complaints, railing. But there will not be any serious attempt to explain it. Soon enough this will be one of the things that ""do not command attention"" or ""do not happen among us.""   This phenomenon is brief and sudden, and obviously important to the story, but I do not understand it.  What does it mean? Where are they being pulled? And why is it some people, and not others?  This feels like it might tie in the protagonist's arriving in the first place, from another world. And as for explaining that, the hint we have is Yestril's conjecture:     ""But then how,"" I continued, ""did I end up there?""      He looked at me in puzzlement. ""I don't know,"" I remember him saying, ""Perhaps you, also, were too much bound?""   Or perhaps it's to do with the climax of the coronation, which is a (temporary) breakdown of the sigil-groups, and this is somehow an extension of that sudden, shocking intermingling and universality.   But I'm not seeing a clear connection between the sudden void and either of those avenues. So I feel like I'm missing a key piece.  This is a deeply thematic story, so I expect the significance here is more a matter of understanding the theme, than it is of finding a logical, in-world explanation supported by the text -- but I might be wrong about that too. "
1086,Was Shakespeare a religious fanatic?,"In the play The Merchant of Venice, Shylock is pretty much disdained and humiliated only because he was a Jew. His thirst for revenge against Antonio is fuelled by the fact that Antonio constantly humiliates Shylock in front of his fellow merchants.  Even at the end, after Portia skilfully tricks Shylock, Shylock is forced to convert from Judaism to Christianity for going on a revenge mission against a man who insulted and berated him.   Was Shakespeare a religious fanatic for having Shylock go through a forced conversion? Or was it necessary because of the times in which Shakespeare had to write the book?  "
1087,Are there recorded instances of asexuality in the body of ancient Greek writings?,"I've been reading through a fraction of Ancient Greek literature, lately, and an odd thought occurred to me. In nearly every work of Greek literature that is tangentially related to sexuality (which, we've gotta admit, is quite nearly most of the well-known ones), sex is treated as universally desirable, and is a locus of control and power. Most of the discussion around women in Greek culture seems to revolve solely around sexuality.    As another example, Eros is often referred to as being one of those omnipresent entities in male interactions in Greek culture. The Symposium goes into some manner of detail on this point about Eros, describing maleness and sexuality as effectively identical concepts with no real distinguishing factors. Still, beyond this, many of the Greek gods are described as sexually promiscuous. No emphasis seems to be placed in any writings on the absence of sexuality in the Greek gods.   Here, I mean asexuality to be the total absence of sexual attraction, with anyone. This is a concept distinct from both celibacy (not having sex for a particular reason) and abstinence (not having sex by choice). For example:    Dionysius is, based on what I've read, abstinent due to indifference to sexuality. There doesn't seem to be anything to suggest that Dionysius doesn't experience sexual attraction, irrespective of whether he partakes in it. Artemis would count as an example of celibacy, because she's a sworn virgin. (Note: ""virgin"" means ""no sexual relations with men"" in ancient Greek works. There's some discussion about whether Artemis was lesbian, but either way, not asexual.)  While there isn't a whole lot of evidence either way, the speculation I've read about whether Athena had sex with anyone seems to have trouble differentiating between Athena as an asexual figure or an abstinent one. (This might make it hard to demonstrate asexuality through the absence of sexual writings.)   The quintessential example, the way ""asexuality"" is used nowadays, would be if someone in some situation were to turn down a sexual situation - not because they didn't want to have sex with them, but rather because they just didn't feel like having sex, as a whole, with anyone.   Did asexuality as a concept ever appear in Greek writings? If so, is there both asexuality in the Pantheon and asexuality outside of it, or is it just one of the two? I don't expect that the ancient Greeks shared our modern conception of asexuality to a T; however, if it's possible to identify that ancient Greek writings reflect an idea of asexuality comparable to our modern one, that would probably count as an example.  "
1088,Was Artemis Fowl based on any specific prodigy?,"Artemis Fowl, (anti)hero of the eponymous novel series by Eoin Colfer, is a self-described criminal genius and prodigy. He is known to have broken numerous age records, perhaps most notably that of youngest person ever to steal the Fairy Thief painting (in book 4).  Is there any evidence to suggest that Colfer based him on any specific prodigy/ies, either real-life ones or from earlier fictional works? Or was he just a ""juvenile criminal genius"" with no specific pre-existing inspirations? "
1089,Is Professor Moriarty really Sherlock Holmes' arch-enemy in the way some people think?,"Some people view Professor James Moriarty as the ultimate arch-enemy to Sherlock Holmes, and that perhaps he may have been a major character in the stories and novels.  If you've watched a TV series or movie adaptation, chances are the major villain was probably Professor Moriarty, but in the Sherlock Holmes written canon, is any of this actually the case?  Is Moriarty truly the major character some people view him as? Does he appear in a lot of Sherlock Holmes stories and is a mostly central character in them? Or is he not what some people might think he is? "
1090,Do the symbol pages in The Founding and Manifesto of Zardulism mean anything?,"The Founding and Manifesto of Zardulism* has several pages that are... filled with symbols without clear meaning. It's only ten pages long, but three pages (5-7) are dedicated to what looks like encoded text.   Whether it actually encodes text, or if it's designed to look like it encodes text, is a little bit of a mystery. So... does it? If so, what does it say? If not, what are we supposed to make of the fact that it doesn't?  *(this link is the actual link to the document, as posted by Zardulu) "
1091,Is Abrahamic eschatology utopian?,"Abrahamic eschatology promises a golden age for humanity, an unending time of universal peace and prosperity.  The idea of an eternally peaceful and prosperous society united in a common cause seems central to the utopian genre, so can the Abrahamic religious texts describing such a promised paradise (Ezekiel, Ezra, Baruch, Zechariah, Isaiah, Revelation, az-Zalzalah, al-Baqarah, etc) be considered utopian? Is there sufficient distinction between the eschatologies of the Abrahamic tradition that some are utopian while others are not? "
1092,"Should Go Set a Watchman be read as a prequel, or an early draft?","It was established in this question that Go Set a Watchman should be read after To Kill A Mockingbird. However, in the comments, LaurenIpsum pointed out that a better question might be ""Should Go Set a Watchman be considered a prequel or a first draft?"" So, I modified it slightly to ask:  Should Go Set a Watchman be read as a prequel or a first draft?  Note: This question is not about the reading order, it's about the style of Go Set a Watchman and what to consider it as when reading it. "

Obviously, they are referring to neon signs, but in what sense are neon signs ""gods"" and how exactly are people praying to them? Is this an attack on advertising or consumerism?  I have seen on various occasions accusations of people ""bowing and praying to"" television, but not so much to neon signs.    1: if you're more into metal-ish than into hippies, there's a cover by Disturbed, which is disturbingly better than one would expect it to be  "
1094,"What evidence was there in ""The Naked Sun"" to suggest that Baley had feelings for Gladia?","I just finished reading The Robots of Dawn, and was quite surprised firstly when Elijah Baley was excited that he'd visit the world Gladia was on, and secondly when at the end of the novel he calls her ""my love"".     His lips shaped: Good-bye. And then because there was no sound -  he could not have done it with sound - he added, my love.   And her lips moved, too. Good-bye, my dearest love.   I may have flipped the few more sentimental pages of The Naked Sun rather fast, but I don't recall Baley showing that he had any newborn feelings of romantic sort towards Gladia. It appeared to me that Baley merely acknowledged her beauty, but nothing more.  Am I wrong? Were there actually passages that suggested he was falling in love with, or otherwise attracted to Gladia? "
1095,Are photographs in Harry Potter a device for characterizing subjects?,"In an answer that I recently wrote elsewhere on this site, I posited that photographs are used by J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter books as a device to portray the subjects of the photograph in a specific light. I wrote that answer about Regulus Black, who was shown ""smiling and waving"" in a photograph before readers are told that he died hunting Horcruxes.  I recall (but don't have the books at hand) that, before Harry and the readers are told that he was a framed good guy (and are made to believe that he betrayed Harry's parents), Sirius was shown only by his mug shot, as a crazed and evil-looking man.        (img source)  Is there evidence in the Harry Potter books to support this theory? Is there any evidence against? Just because someone is evil (or a supporter of Voldemort) doesn't mean that they can't look friendly and nice in photographs -- has any Death Eater or other ""bad guy"" been shown nicely in a photo? "
1096,"Why is desire ""a commodity [Lucifer is] short on""?","In The Sandman Presents: Lucifer - The Morningstar Option #3 (written by Mike Carey and drawn by Scott Hampton), Lucifer explains he needed Rachel Begai to channel her desire to destroy the Velleity, as he himself is short on desire:    Click for full resolution.   At that point Lucifer has his hidden agenda, namely getting the Letter of Passage from Yahweh - he wouldn't go to all the trouble of fighting the Velleity otherwise.   Getting the Letter serves other means - breaking free of Yahweh's Creation, and of his omniscience and omnipresence. This is what Lucifer wants, or desires (as explained later, from the start of creation) - he doesn't show interest in anything else, and everything he does in the Lucifer comics series is for that one goal.  This was also acknowledged in the last issue of the series:    Click for full resolution.   So why is Lucifer short on desire? How does that fit in the rest of the series? Is my understanding of his character wrong? "
1097,When did men dressed as women stop being the norm in English theatre?,"This excellent answer by Joshua Engel draws a comparison between men dressed as women in Shakespeare-era plays and perspective jumps in modern cinema:     The audience would, of course, have been aware that these characters were portrayed by boys. [...] It worked only because the audience was fully imbued in the trope, and simply accepted it. I think of it as similar to the effect of intercutting in modern cinema: the world doesn't jump perspectives like that, but since you've been trained to accept that as the language of cinema, it doesn't give you even a moment's pause. It's not so much ""suspension of disbelief"" as genuine belief: that's the way this world works.   Which made me wonder: when did this stop being the norm? In Shakespeare's day, there were no women actors, and all the female characters were portrayed by men, but of course this is no longer the case today. When did women in plays start being portrayed by actual women? For that matter, was the change sudden (perhaps due to a change in law) or was there a more gradual shift?  If a fully multicultural and international answer to this would be too broad, then it's OK to restrict answers to English theatre, which has had (as far as I know) a continuous history between Shakespeare's time and the present day. "
1098,"In ""Hard to Be a God"", are ""Sergei Kozhin"", ""George Lenny"", ""Sabine Kruger"" real historical references?","The main character's internal monolog at one point reads:     You just want to kill. Yes, I do. And are you capable of it?     ... the only thing I regret is killing her in vain. So they've almost taught me. But that's bad. That's dangerous. Remember Sergei Kozhin? And George Lenny? And Sabine Kruger? [Italics present in the English translation.]   Hard to Be a God is a Russian science fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky set in the future. Some of the historical references in it are set in our future, but some reference things in our past.  George Lenny might be an oblique reference to Of Mice and Men, whose main characters are George and Lennie1 (and where the reference to learning to kill would be fairly relevant). Are there similar explanations for Sergei Kozhin and Sabine Kruger? And is there a better explanation for George Lenny?  1 Note that Lennie might easily come out Lenny after being transliterated to Cyrillic and back. "
1099,"What exactly was Shadow's crime, and what was Laura's part in it?"," There may or may not be unhidden spoilers from the novel here.   While watching the fourth episode of American Gods, where Laura and Shadow's mutual history has been revealed (to be the first major deviation from the novel), I noticed that the novel didn't explain what exactly it was Shadow did to get in prison, and what part Laura had in it.  Firstly, there is this exchange where it is shown that Laura asked Shadow to do something:     “How was prison?”      “Could have been worse.”      “Yes.” The tip of the cigarette glowed orange. “I’m still grateful. I should never have got you mixed up in it.”      “Well,” he said, “I agreed to do it. I could have said no.”    Author's preferred text, chapter 3.    Then there is this blurb where it is explained that Laura organised a robbery (?) because she was cheated by her associates (?) and Shadow was the driver (?):     He hurried on, pushed through the warden’s gray office, and found himself looking at the VCR repair store on the outskirts of Eagle Point. Three years ago. Yes.      Inside the store, he knew, he was beating the living crap out of Larry Powers and B. J. West, bruising his knuckles in the process: pretty soon he would walk out of there, carrying a brown supermarket bag filled with twenty-dollar bills. The money they could never prove he had taken: his share of the proceeds, and a little more, for they shouldn’t have tried to rip him and Laura off like that. He was only the driver, but he had done his part, done everything that she had asked of him…      [. . . ]      Nobody talked about the money.      Nobody even mentioned Laura, and that was all that Shadow had wanted.   Ibid, chapter 16, emphasis mine.   But Laura was a travel agent, even before she met Shadow - what kind of shady business with ""proceeds"" and ""ripping off"" can a travel agent get involved in? Is there an explanation that I missed in the novel, or something by Neil Gaiman? "
1100,Are the new gods not aware of the appearance of this character?," There will be very heavy spoilers - do not read further if you haven't finished the novel.   Mr. World is the leader of the new gods, though his exact area of influence is left somewhat ambiguous in the novel. This may be an intentional decision, because       Mr. World is in fact Loki, and also Shadow's old cell mate, Low Key Lyesmith.   His appearance is somewhat distinctive:     Low Key, who was a grifter from Minnesota, smiled his scarred smile.      [. . .]      “How the hell should I know?” Lyesmith kept his orange-blond hair pretty much shaved. You could see the lines of his skull. “Tell you what, though. This country started going to hell when they stopped hanging folks. No gallows dirt. No gallows deals.”    Author's preferred text, chapter 1; emphasis mine.    The hair colour may be irrelevant, but combined with the scars on his face, which are faithful to a legend where his mouth was sewn shut after some incident or the other, I claim for this question that his appearance is very distinctive and recognisable.  There is also reason to believe that Loki had the same appearance when in his role as Mr. World:     He smiled then, his scarred smile. Mr. World was easily amused. Mr. Town had noticed this on several occasions. It had amused him to play chauffeur, in Kansas, after all.    Ibid, chapter 17; emphasis mine.    Now for my question - don't the new gods recognise that Mr. World is Loki? I realise this piece of trivia is not very well-known, especially with him being portrayed by such handsome actors lately, but surely the new gods have done their homeworks (with one of them literally being the god of wireless communication and all that) and must know the appearance of all the old gods (""know your enemy and know your ally"" and all that).  Two questions:   Don't the new gods know that Mr. World is Loki, based on his appearance? If they do, why on Earth would they accept him as their leader? Even if one factors in him being a Norse god and maybe having some sort of information about the enemy camp, he is the Trickster God - they should know this sword is of two ends.  "
1101,Are Vin and Elend symbolically linked to Preservation and Ruin in The Hero of Ages?,"In Brandon Sanderson's The Hero of Ages (book three of the Mistborn trilogy), Preservation and Ruin are two anthropomorphized forces of nature, evenly matched in their struggle against one another.  These two forces are represented throughout the books by the colors white, for Preservation, and black, for Ruin. The mists are of Preservation, and are white. The ash is of Ruin, and is black -- really dark black, not the usual ash color (see, for example, the excerpt from Sazed's book at the beginning of chapter 19: ""Yes, the ash was black. No, it should not have been. [...] Perhaps it was the influence of Ruin's power [...]""). More explicitly, in the final chapter:     The twists of mist he saw, they led to a vast white light.      He reached out and touched the mist, and felt an awesome power. A   power of stability. To the side, the other corpse -- the one he didn't   recognize -- was also leaking something. A deep black smoke. Sazed   reached out with his other hand, touching the smoke, and felt a   different power -- more violent. The power of change.   These powers are not good and evil -- Ruin is something of an entropic force, and Preservation is the anti-entropic force. This distinction appears to be very important to Ruin -- he tries to explain this to Vin more than once. For example, in chapter 57:     Vin, Vin. Why can't you see? This isn't about good or evil. Morality   doesn't even enter into it.   Throughout the entire series, Vin wears black, as it's a good color for sneaking at night, as Mistborn are wont to do. At the end of the second book, King Emperor Elend Venture is encouraged to wear white, which improves his image, making him stand out in a world covered by ash. This pairing of colors isn't really emphasized much throughout the book, except for one scene, in which Emperor and Empress crash a ball in a city they have recently placed under siege.     This wasn't an evening for subtlety.      [grand entrance, billowing white cape]      Inside the antechamber, waiting nobility began to whisper and   question. Vin heard them asking if anyone recognized these strange   newcomers, one in black, the other in white.   However, the stress of the contrasting colors in this passage may only serve to reinforce to the readers that this couple doesn't really belong in that room, by flaunting their nonconformity to societal fashion. Later in the same chapter (30), a short while after the dramatic entrance, we're told that the ""men generally wore dark clothing, and the women generally wore colors.""  The royal couple are also shown, standing side by side, in white and black on the book's cover (at least, for the edition that I was reading):        (img src)  Does the use of these two colors for Ruin and Preservation, as well as for Vin and Elend, signify a link between these two pairs? "
1102,"The meaning of the line ""and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah"" in ""Hallelujah""","""Hallelujah"" contains a mix of Biblical themes. The first stanza mentions (King) David by name, and the first three lines of the second seem to refer to one of King David's stories (II Samuel 11). The fourth line, I believe, switches to a story of Samson (Judges 16), and the fifth has elements of both David and Samson in it (Samson was a judge, and never had a throne; ""she cut your hair"" is definitely Samson). The final line of the stanza reads ""and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.""     Your faith was strong but you needed proof   You saw her bathing on the roof   Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you   She tied you to a kitchen chair   She broke your throne, and she cut your hair   And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah   I assume that the final line of the stanza refers to Samson; however, I'm not sure what Samson has to do with ""Hallelujah."" Using a Bible search engine, I could not find an instance where Samson's name (שמשון) appeared with the word ""Hallelujah"" (הללויה). I could not either find the name שמשון in Psalms (although it's possible that one or more Psalms are attributed to Samson; I don't know Psalms or the commentaries on it well enough to say). There's certainly nothing in the story of Delilah with the word ""Hallelujah.""  The word does not appear in II Samuel 11 (nor, actually, in the entire book).  So, my questions are:     Who are the subject and object in the final line of the stanza? Is it Bathsheba and David, or Delilah and Samson?   What is the reference made by that line?  "
1103,Which South or Central American female author wrote a short story about frozen cockroaches?,"In the 90s I read a collection of short stories by a South American female author (most likely translated to English vs having been written in English originally). I remember the stories were good, and I remember fragments of a few:   a person (female?) meditates on a small ornamental table in a hallway, which has flowers on it. There was a death, perhaps? Or a divorce? a woman on a plane is thinking (about...?) an essay about the beauty and perfection of the avian egg a story in which a woman turns on her kitchen light in the middle of the night and finds many cockroaches frozen all over the floor because they have eaten the borax poison she set out and have frozen in place   In general, I think the stories may have tended towards being a bit chilly.  I would like to revisit these stories and know more about this author. "
1104,Does Nausicaä not develop as a character at all?," There will be spoilers regarding characters from the end of the manga here.   In Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (Kaze no Tani no Naushika) manga, the characters are usually depicted as multi-layered, and developing throughout the series... except Nausicaä herself.       E.g. Kushana goes from blood-thirsty and arrogant to humble and peaceful; the Holy One of the Mani tribe helps Yupa and Asbel escape; Charuka first is loyal to the Emperor, but then decides he is actually loyal to the people, and sees Nausiaä as a saviour of the human race.    Even the Guardian of the Garden changes his mind about Nausicaä and lets her go. Same goes for both sons of the Emperor - they're not flat characters.   Nausicaä, on the other hand, remains the same - stil love the Ohmu, the forest, the people, and everyone else. She remains an optimist, and to an extent, a happy-go-lucky person. We are not shown much of her inner world except how she perceives the forest (positively), the insects (positively), needless deaths (negatively), and so forth. These are more or less all her character traits.  Am I wrong about this? Are there some subtle changes in Nausicaä's character that I did not notice? "
1105,Did young Dream and Death really look like this?,"In ""The Parliament of Rooks"" (The Sandman #40), Abel tells a toddler Daniel Hall a ""children's story"" about how he and Cain came to live in the Dreaming (pages 18-20). In the story, Dream and his sister Death appear similarly to Pop Vinyl characters, and it's really quite adorable.         (page 18)    Cain objects to this portrayal of the eldest Endless, but Abel's rebuttal is a little unclear to me:         (page 18)    So I wonder about the veracity of Abel's portrayal of the Endless. Cain thinks this is a gross oversimplification, but Abel says ""this is my story."" I think there are three possibilities:   Abel knows that Cain is right, and changes the story and imagery for baby Daniel's benefit. After all, he does change the end of the story; it's clear by now that in Gaiman's world, Cain and Abel do not live ""happily ever after,"" as Abel finishes the story. He may sanitize other details of the story for the child's benefit. Abel thinks he's right, because he is. We know that the Endless appear differently to different people (see e.g. this Lit.SE answer). Abel thinks he's right, but he isn't. Cain considers Abel simpleminded, constantly calling him any of several derogatory names like ""powderbrain"" or ""numbskull."" There isn't much to analyze, but Abel appears to be of normal intelligence, even if he is much softer (perhaps more naive) than his brother. If he honestly believes that he and his brother lived happily ever after1, then he may be an unreliable narrator.   Which of these three is it? Was Morpheus actually ""Li'l Morpheus"" for a time? (Is there another possibility I haven't considered?)     1: I don't think it's likely that he doesn't understand that his fraternal relationship is severely abusive and dysfunctional, although I admit the possibility. I submit that he doesn't intend the living ""happily ever after"" as part of his story, making it more of a hinted plea to his brother, because the point of view shifts from ""way back when"" back to the present time, when Abel is speaking to Daniel. On the other hand, he doesn't stutter during that part; Matthew notes on the next page that the stutter disappears when Abel tells stories, making it possible that that sentence is part of the story. I'm not really sure how to interpret that part.  "
1106,What is a bootless oath?,"In Book X (10) of The Illiad Hector (edition: Britannica Great Books of the Western World (The Illiad and The Odessey together), rendered into English prose by Samuel Butler) swears the following oath     ""May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witnes that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that you shall have your will with them for ever.""   He swears this to Dolon, son of Eumedes, who agrees to, in return for Peleus's chaiot and steeds when and if they should be captured, spy on the Achaeans and try discover their plans of battle for the next day.   The oath is followed by the following sentence:     The oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going.   Why is the oath bootless? Is it because Jove only has to witness (instead of may jove take my children, juno give me no sons etc).   It can't be because the oath gives him no 'booty' (treasure/loot) because the horses are the boot...  Edit: There seems to be no reason (at this point) to think Hector would go back on his word, and the horses do exist, so presuming the Trojons win (which they are at this point in the story [the Achaeans are in retreat]) there is every reason to presume that Dolon will at some point recieve the horses.   Is the oath 'bootless/useless' because the promised reward is not certain, i.e. it cannot immediately be bestowed on him? If so why is Dolon more eager to go? "
1107,"What's the meaning of ""a knife in your throat held after dark"" in the Silly Walk Song?","The so-called Silly Walk Song by the Monty Python troupe (lyrics and video here, lyrics in text form here) is mostly a lament of the tedium and futility of a life of money-induced drudgery. But there are a few lines which are much darker and don't quite seem to fit with the tone of the rest of the song:     Life is a silly walk in the park,   A knife in your throat held after dark.   Life is a terrible joke a lark,   A spoken word then it all goes dark.   Where does the idea of a ""knife in your throat held after dark"" come from? What does it mean and how does it fit with the overall theme? What does bloody murder have to do with working uselessly in an office for money, or is there some indirect or symbolic meaning in this phrase? "
1108,How were notes sent from classroom to classroom in Up the Down Staircase?,"In Bel Kaufman's Up the Down Staircase, part of the story is told through notes that Sylvia Barrett sends to other teachers. For example, the first one goes     FROM: Mrs. Beatrice Schachter, Room 508   TO: Miss Sylvia Barrett, Room 304   Dear Syl—   Welcome to the fold! I hope it goes well with you on this, your first day. If you need help, just holler; I'm in 508.   What's your program? Can we synchronize our lunch periods?   Fondly,   Bea   In chapter 2, Sylvia and Beatrice seem to exchange seven notes within a single day of work.   How were they sent? Did they ask students to deliver them during classes? During breaks? My imagination runs rampant and thinks of pneumatic tube transport, but surely this wasn't the case in 1960s US schools? "
1109,"What does ""chafed"" mean here?","I would like to know what ""chafed"" means in the following sentences:     ""I like her,"" said Daisy, ""I think she's lovely.""      But the rest offended her—and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented ""place"" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.   This is an excerpt from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Daisy, Tom and Nick went to Gatsby's party, where Daisy was astonished at its unmasked hedonism. Throughout the party, she was more and more aware of the difference between her ""old money"" society and the ""new money"" society at Gatsby's party. Therefore, she came to dislike everyone present except one very famous actress.  In this part, I could not grasp what ""chafed"" means. How could the raw vigor be chafed under the old euphemisms? Does it mean that the euphemisms curbed their raw vigor?  I would very much appreciate your help. :)  "
1110,"Did Stefan Zweig tell this anecdote in The World of Yesterday""?","Many years ago I read The World of Yesterday by Stefan Zweig. I believe that in this book there was the following, real-life story: Shortly before the outbreak of World War II several intellectuals, including the author, discussed whether or not a big war (like World War I) was possible. They agreed it wasn't because they believed that peoples of Europe were too tired from the first war to want a second one.  I tried to find the exact quote in the Kindle edition, but couldn't.  Did Stefan Zweig write this? If yes, where (book, chapter)? "
1111,"What does ""made notes for a little thesis"" mean here?","I would like to know what ""made notes for a little thesis"" means in the following sentences:     Collins made notes for a little thesis pointing out the   inferiority of the original mosaics to their photographs. Here was   planted the seed of what became his life's harvest. When, many years   later, there appreared the first massive volume of his still   unfinished work on Byzantine Art, I was touched to find among two   pages of polite, preliminary acknowledgements of debt, my own name:   ""...to Charles Ryder, with the aid of whose all-seeing eyes I first   saw the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia and San Vitale...""   This is an excerpt from Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh. The narrator Charles went on a trip to Ravenna in Italy with his scholarly friend named Collins. Although Charles found the place boring, Collins took this opportunity to prepare for his little thesis.  But I could not grasp what ""make notes for"" meant in this context, and thus found it difficult to understand what exactly Collins did in the underlined part.  Did he just scribbled here and there for his little thesis? Or did he actually make a formal first draft for the thesis?  I would very much appreciate your help.  "
1112,"What does ""an affront to the common store of life"" mean here?","I am reading The Great Gatsby, and would very much like to know what ""an affront to the common store of life"" means in the following sentences:     He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to   take our stiff straw hats.  ""Madame expects you in the salon!"" he   cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra   gesture was an affront to the common store of life.         F. Scott Fitzgerlald, The Great Gatsby, Chapter 7      In this part, Nick and Gatsby visited Daisy and Tom Buchanan's house to lunch together. But because it was a very hot day, the butler's gesture indicating the direction seemed unnecessary.  Here, I could not grasp what was the common store of life.  Does ""life"" indicate all human beings? Or all creatures? Does the author have an idea that all creatures share the same store of life...?  I could not understand exactly.  I would very much appreciate your help. :)  "
1113,"What was ""standard shift"" in the 1920's?","I am reading The Great Gatsby, and encountered these sentences:     ""Shall we all go in my car?"" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green   leather of the seat. ""I ought to have left it in the shade.""  ""Is it   standard shift?"" demanded Tom.  ""Yes.""  ""Well, you take my coupe and let   me drive your car to town.""         F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby, Chapter 7      In this part, Daisy and her husband Tom invited her relative Nick and her friend Jordan and her lover Gatsby to their house for a luncheon. But it was such a stifling day, and Daisy was confused to see the visible tension between her husband and her lover. So she ended up insisting that they all should go to town in this heat, and that was why Gatsby suggested that they start in his car.  But I could not understand what was a standard shift car in the 1920's.  Was there the automatic transmission in the 1920's, and the standard shift was a concept opposed to it?  I would very much appreciate your help. "
1114,Is it possible that Bastian's journey to Fantastica was purely metaphysical?,"The first half of The Neverending Story is about Bastian reading a fantasy story about Atreyu's adventures in Fantastica. The second half is about Bastian's own adventures in Fantastica, a world which he basically recreates from nothing, becoming a completely different person himself in the process, before returning to his own world to find that he's still the same person as originally and only a single night has passed.  My question is: is it possible that Bastian never actually went to Fantastica? Is this a valid and consistent reading of the story, or does it  not make sense with everything that happened?   Bastian's adventures leave a permanent effect on him, making him more brave and confident. But the same effect could have come from a vivid hallucination in which he had all the experiences detailed in the second half of the book. The conversation at the very end between Bastian and Mr Coreander hints at a more metaphorical interpretation of Fantastica and the whole story, but I can't quite solidify this idea.   Years after reading The Neverending Story as a child, I came to the conclusion that there are many different ways to interpret the story, and I think this may be one of them: that Bastian's whole experience was a dream or hallucination after reading a story he loved, which changed his personality literally overnight. But I'm not certain if it's a totally consistent model of the narrative. "
1115,Why was Sunan permitted to take the exam to be a Presented Scholar?,"In Golden Daughter, Sunan took an exam to become as Presented Scholar in the Center of Learning. He passed the test, but wasn't permitted to join due to his parentage:     ""You will be pleased to know,"" Overseer Rangsun said, his voice mild as a spring breeze, ""that you far exceeded all expectations and achieved the top score of this year's Gruung... Unfortunately, due to the circumstances of your birth and less-than-desirable parentage, the Center of Learning does not feel that it can accept you into the Middle Court.""   However, he offered him a position as a Crouching Shadow. Was that the main reason he was permitted to take the exam in the first place? The Overseer didn't seem aware of his uncle's (supposed) death until shortly before telling Sunan about their decision, and Sunan had been studying for the exam under his uncle for years. Given those facts, how could they possibly have known that Sunan would be expected to replace his uncle? And if that wasn't their plan, why was Sunan permitted to take the exam in the first place if they never intended to accept him as a scholar even if he passed the exam? "
1116,"Why ""Moon Child""?","In The Neverending Story, the main turning point is when Bastian gives the Childlike Empress her much-needed name, saves Fantastica, and enters into the story himself.  This name is ""Moon Child"", or ""Mondenkind"" in the original German.  What, if anything is the significance of this name? Since the whole story revolves around names and particularly Bastian's skill at naming things, and this particular name is of such vital importance to the plot, surely the author put a lot of thought into choosing it. Why ""Moon Child""? Does this name have some deeper meaning, or even wordplay in the original German? Does it tie in somehow to the main themes of the story? "
1117,Is John Milton's Lucifer a tragic hero?,"Loosely related: Was Paradise Lost the first major work of literature to give &quot;sympathy for the devil&quot;?  In Paradise Lost, Lucifer/Satan appears to have at least some heroic characteristics, such as courage and (apparent) dedication to his comrades. His tragic flaw, of course, is his arrogance, with him declaring at one point ""Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.""  He also set the events of the story in motion, including fomenting an all-out rebellion in Heaven as well as the fall of man, through his arrogance.  With that said, is he actually a tragic hero of sorts? "
1118,How does Jude's work with masonry relate to his ambition of becoming a scholar?,"In Jude the Obscure, work that Jude does is masonry - stones and menial labor. His ambition is to become a scholar - books and mental labor.  I'm struggling to see how these relate to each other - how is Jude doing masonry related to his ambitions? Is this to provide a contrast, or is there something else? "

""Well, he said he knew   you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around   at the last minute and asked if we had room for him."" Jordan   smiled. ""He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was   president of your class at Yale.""         F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby, Chapter 7      In this part, Daisy, her husband Tom, her lover Gatsby, her relative Nick, and her friend Jordan engaged a suite parlor in the Plaza Hotel to have some mint julep on this stifling day. As Mendelssohn's Wedding March was heard from the ballroom below, Daisy and Tom recalled that their wedding day was also very hot and that someone named Biloxi even fainted. Biloxi was carried into Jordan's house because it was very close to church, and stayed there for three weeks.  Here, I could not grasp what ""if we had room for him"" means here. Did Asa Bird—presumably their friend—bring Biloxi, who wasn't their friend and thus was uninvited, at the last minute of their wedding and asked if they had some vacant seat for him? Or did Asa Bird bring the fainted Biloxi to them and asked some space to lay him down? Or was Asa Bird finding a room for him to stay for a while?  I am completely clueless. I would very much appreciate your help. "
1120,Is there a standard way to measure how influential a particular book is?,"I got to thinking awhile back: many high-level politicians (such as Paul Ryan, current Speaker of the House in the U.S.), media figures, etc. cite Atlas Shrugged as a major influence. Then I got to thinking: has anyone actually tried to measure exactly how influential it is?  Has anyone come up with a quantitative measure of how influential particular books are? I assume that studies would study how be influential they are relative to something - for example, how influential something is in politics. Are there high-quality studies on this topic? "
1121,Why didn't Jim Taggart realize his real motive for saying this?,"In the discussion of Directive 10-289, Jim Taggart said the following:     Jim Taggart spoke first.

If we are to perish, let's make sure that we all perish together. Let's make sure that we leave them no chance to survive!""   Why didn't that ""tip him off"" as to his real motives? "

1123,"How does ""How Nnedi Got Her Curved Spine"" meet the definition of creative nonfiction?","The short story ""How Nnedi Got Her Curved Spine"" by Nnedi Okorafor details a story about a woman named Nnedi, who, while in the woods, was taken in by intelligent baboons and taught their first written language, which she then took back to her people, thus introducing writing to them.  Nnedi Okorafor writes at the end of the story:     Many years later, while considering all this and just before I wrote what would become my first published novel Zarah the Windseeker, I wrote this short piece of “creative nonfiction”. I call it nonfiction because it is a true story. I call it creative because it is told through the lens of fantasy.   But while looking up the term ""creative nonfiction"", I found this definition, on CreativeNonfiction.org:     The words “creative” and “nonﬁction” describe the form. The word “creative” refers to the use of literary craft, the techniques ﬁction writers, playwrights, and poets employ to present nonﬁction—factually accurate prose about real people and events—in a compelling, vivid, dramatic manner. The goal is to make nonﬁction stories read like ﬁction so that your readers are as enthralled by fact as they are by fantasy.   I took this to mean stories such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie series - a true story told in a way that reads like a novel. ""How Nnedi Got Her Curved Spine"" doesn't seem to fit that.  Am I missing something here? Misunderstanding the definition of creative nonfiction? Or what?  "
1124,Did Shakespeare err in using Ephesus as a port setting?,"Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors is set in the town of Ephesus, which is apparently a seaport with ships within walking distance of where the action takes place:     DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:   Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum       That stays but till her owner comes aboard,       And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,       I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought       The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.       The ship is in her trim; the merry wind       Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all       But for their owner, master, and yourself.        ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:   How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,       What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?      DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:   A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.   But the real town of Ephesus, whose spectacular ruins still exist to this day, actually lies several kilometres from the sea.  Is this one of Shakespeare's geographical errors, akin to the coast of Bohemia in The Winter's Tale? Or was Ephesus really once a seaport which now lies further from the sea, like Sandwich in Kent? "

Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby, Chapter 7      In this part, Daisy, her husband Tom, her lover Gatsby, her relative Nick, her friend Jordan came to the suite parlor in the Plaza Hotel to have some cold drink on the stifling day. The room became the battlefield between her husband and her lover, when each began to claim that it was him that Daisy loved. Tom had made some small ""investigation"" regarding Gatsby's past, and revealed the information during the argument that he earned his money through not very honorable routes.

I find the last sentence especially difficult to understand. How could they have been ""snapped out""?

1126,Who or what is Cassiopeia?,"In Michael Ende's Momo, the tortoise Cassiopeia seems to be something of a mystery.  Even Professor Hora is easier to grasp: he appears to be a sort of personification of time itself, sending everyone's own allotment of time to them, with the flow of time all across the world stopping when he sleeps. What he gives, the men in grey poison and steal; they're essentially time parasites.  But Cassiopeia? She doesn't seem to serve any vital role in Professor Hora's work or the normal operation of time, mostly acting as an advisor, confidante, and helper to Momo. Her power of seeing half an hour into the future is one unmatched (as far as I remember) by any other person or creature in the story. She's the only thing able to move during the time-stop, apart from those with external sources of time like Momo's flower or the men in grey's cigars.  What manner of being is she, really? Why are so many unique abilities found in a single tortoise? Is she something else taking the form of a tortoise - and why a tortoise specifically? Are there more like her anywhere in the universe? "

What are the statues?  Why the speech? What did it represent? Who was the other speaker?  "
1128,What's the significance of Faust's meeting being on Easter Day?,"In Goethe's Faust, the eponymous (anti?)hero meets the demon Mephistopheles on what seems to be Easter Sunday, during local celebrations of Easter. Given the religious themes in the story, this surely can't be a coincidence.  Why is their meeting on Easter Day in particular? What symbolic significance does this have in terms of Faust's life and actions? "
1129,How did Theseus woo Hippolyta by doing her injuries?,"In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Theseus tells Hippolyta:     THESEUS:      Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword   And won thy love doing thee injuries,   But I will wed thee in another key,   With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.   Why does he say this? How is it possible to woo someone with a sword? Why did Hippolyta give him her love in return for injuries?   I have unfortunately run into obstacles right at the outset. "
1130,Why wouldn't Guy Francon testify against Howard Roark?,"In her testimony at the lawsuit over the Stoddard Temple, Dominique Francon mentioned that her father had refused to testify against Roark and that he thought that they ""weren't behaving like gentlemen."" Why is this? Is this Guy Francon's better attributes on display? "
1131,Examples of mother-son writing partnerships,"I've recently been reading the 'Flaxman Low' series of short stories by Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard, written in partnership with his mother Kate O'Brien Ryall Prichard.  The fact that it was a mother-son writing partnership struck me as unusual, can anyone suggest any other notable examples of mother-son writing partnerships?  "
1132,"What is the ""Eastern wolf"" in this poem?","I'm reading through J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fall of Arthur and in I.29 - I.33 it says     [...] But what foe dareth    war here to wake or the walls assail    of this island-realm while Arthur liveth,    if the Eastern wolf in his own forest    at last embayed must for life battle?   (This is from the speech of Mordred at the beginning; he is encouraging Arthur to go off to war against the east so he can begin his treachery to gain the throne, as far as I can tell.) Is it a correct interpretation to say that the ""Eastern wolf"" are the ""heathen kings"" to the east? I'm not sure if there's more to this reference than that...was Fenris wolf, for example, chained to the east? Does this allude to anything else? "
1133,"In what book does Paul Dirac say, ""Some new ideas are here needed""?","In an interview for the Yorkshire Television program Take the World from Another Point of View (1972), Richard Feynman said:     You see, I have had in my life a number of pleasant experiences. One of the earliest ones was when I was a kid I invented a problem for myself, the sum of the powers of the integers, and in trying to get the formula for it I developed a certain set of numbers, the formula for which I couldn’t get, and I discovered later that those were known as the Bernoulli numbers and discovered in 1739. So I was up to 1739 when I was about 14 you see. And then a little later I discovered something that I’d find out I just may have invented a thing which we now call operator calculus. That was invented in 1890-something. Gradually I was inventing things that came later and later.      But the moment when I began to realize that I was now working on something new was when I read about quantum electrodynamics at the time and I read a book, and I learned about it. For example, I read Dirac’s book, and he had these problems that nobody knew how to solve that were described there. I couldn’t understand the book very well because I really wasn’t up to it. But there in the last paragraph at the end of the book it said, “Some new ideas are here needed.” And so there I was. Some new ideas were needed? OK! So I started to think of new ideas.   What book does Richard Feynman refer to exactly? "
1134,Why does Great Literary Classics change details in its abridged versions?,"From the Wikipedia article on Great Illustrated Classics:     The Great Illustrated Classics series of books offers easy-to-read   adaptations of well known classics, featuring large print and   illustrations on every other page. The series is targeted at children,   but the writing style is suitable for adult readers as well. Currently   there are 66 titles.   Now I understand that they have to omit parts of the stories in order to fit them into this type of book. However, I don't see any reason why there would be a need to change things that are kept in the abridged versions. Yet in fact there are changes made in the abridged versions.  Here are three examples from The Count of Monte Cristo:   In the regular version it was Abbé Faria who directly showed Edmond that it was Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort that had caused his imprisonment. Yet in the Great Illustrated Classics version it is described as follows:     One day as Edmond and Faria rested from the hard work of tunneling,   Edmond said, ""Father, I have been thinking about my enemies. Your   lessons on history have taught me how the minds of some men work in   evil ways. I believe I was accused by two men — Danglars and Fernand.   In the next paragraph we have the following:     ""Very good thinking,"" said Faria with a smile. ""When you told me   everything about yourself, I, too, suspected Danglars and Fernand. But   I wanted you to puzzle it out.""   This seems to be a complete invention. In the original version the value of Spada's treasure is specified as 13 or 14 million Francs. In the Great Illustrated Classics version the value is given as 70 million Francs. In the original version the cannon signifying an escaped prisoner goes off well after Edmond boards the smugglers' boat. In the Great Illustrated Classics version, however, the cannon is shot before he even sees their boat.   Here are two examples from A Journey to the Center of the Earth:   At the end of the book when they get shot out of a volcano and wonder where they are, Hans says that they are not in Iceland. In the original version, the narrator says that Hans is wrong:     ""Hans must be mistaken,"" I said, raising myself up.   In the Great Illustrated Classics version it is the narrator's uncle who asserts that Hans is wrong:     ""You must be wrong,"" my uncle cried.  The date that they leave Stromboli is off by a month. In the original version we have:     After waiting forty-eight hours, on the 31st of August, a small craft   took us to Messina, where a few days' rest completely removed the   effect of our fatigues.   In the Great Literary Classics version we have:     And forty-eight hours later, on the 30th of September, a boat took us   to the city of Messina on Sicily.    There are many more examples, but I don't think it is necessary to list them.  Is there a purpose to these changes? Do they somehow simplify the story for children? Or did the adapters just read the originals and then entirely rewrite the books as simply stories based on the original?  I am primarily interested in a general principle (or set of principles) that addresses the series as a whole. However, if the answer is that each individual change has its own reason, I am okay with that but would ideally like to see one or two example explanations of some of the individual cases (not necessarily limited to the ones I mentioned). "
1135,What does the raven say to Ged when he first enters the school at Roke?,"In the Wizard of Earthsea when Ged first enters the school at Roke, he meets with the Archmage Nemmerle, and a ""raven of Osskil"" wanders towards the Archmage (his familiar, maybe?) and when the Archmage vanishes     Only the raven stood eyeing him, its beak outstretched as if to peck the vanishing staff. It spoke, in what Ged guessed might be the speech of Osskil. ""Terrenon ussbuk!"" it said croaking. ""Terrenon ussbuk orrek!"" And it strutted off as it had come.   What is the raven saying to Ged? The one thing I do note is that when Ged is in Osskil, he encounters the evil stone in the Court of the Terrenon; I assume this is somehow connected.  "
1136,"Is Caliban of Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" based on a real life character?","In the book ‘Over the Edge of the World’ the author Laurence Bergreen has described Ferdinand Magellan's daring circumnavigation of the globe in the sixteenth century was a three-year odyssey filled with sex, violence, and amazing adventure. The book was first published in 2003 and the Harper Collins edition which I read was published in 2008.  The best and most affecting eyewitness account of Magellan’s circumnavigation was written by Antonio Pigafetta, the young Venetian scholar and diplomat who was among the handful of survivors. His chronicle remains one of the most significant documents of the Age of Discovery.  Pigafetta’s account of the Patagonian giant describes him as:     “He was so tall that the tallest of us only came up to his waist,” the   official chronicler observed. “He had a very large face, painted round   with red, and his eyes also were painted round with yellow, and in the   middle of his cheeks he had two hearts painted. He had hardly any   hairs on his head, and was painted white.”       The giant was a member of the tribe known as the Tehuelche Indians,   who were numerous throughout the region.   Laurence Bergreen continues:     About ninety years later, Pigafetta’s affecting account of the   curtailed education and conversion of the Patagonian giant drew the   attention of William Shakespeare, who read an English translation by   Richard Eden of Pigafetta’s diary. Distinctive fingerprints  in    Shakespeare’s  resulting  play, ‘The Tempest’, first performed in   1611, could only have come from Pigafetta’s account.       In Shakespeare’s imagination, the humble details of Pigafetta’s   encounter with the Patagonian giant are woven into an immense   cosmological tapestry. The playwright sets the scene on an enchanted   magical island ruled by Prospero, the duke of Milan, who, with his   daughter Miranda, had been set adrift by his brother Antonio, a   usurper. Shipwrecked, Prospero learns magic and manages to remain on   good terms with spirits inhabiting the island, especially Ariel, a   sprite whom Prospero had freed from an evil sorceress known as   Sycorax. But Sycorax also has a son, Caliban, one of the most   compelling yet enigmatic characters in the Shakespearean canon, and a   character inspired in part by the Patagonian giant.       The clash between Prospero and Caliban offers a vivid image of the   impact of European discovery and conquest on indigenous peoples   throughout the world, and Shakespeare dramatizes the encounter with   wit and a frisson of horror.        You taught me language; and my profit on’t   Is, I know how to curse:   the red plague rid you,       For learning me your language!        Later, Caliban quotes Pigafetta’s account of the Patagonian giant:        I must obey: his art is of such power,       It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,      And make a vassal of him.        Although Shakespeare keeps the setting vague, this mystical play   demonstrates, if nothing else, that the New World, with its splendour   and barbarism, had taken up residence in the European consciousness.   Is Caliban's description based on the Patagonian Giant described by Antonio Pigafetta? Apart from this reference in the referred adventure book, are there any other sources to support such a conclusion? "
1137,Fight Club book editions and different text passages,"I found out that there are different editions of the Fight Club book that contain different text passages. I cannot find any page that would describe these differences and I don't know which version is the original one.  Example of book differences (one of many):  After the following text in chapter 6:     Except for their humping, Marla and Tyler are never in the same room. If Tyler’s around, Marla ignores him. This is familiar ground.   In version 1 is the following text:      “The big sleep, `Valley of the Dogs’ style. “Where even if someone loves you enough to save your life, they still castrate you.” Marla looks at me as if I’m the one humping her and says, “I can’t win with you, can I?”   In version 2 is the following different text:     My father always said, “Get married before the sex gets boring or you’ll never get married.” My mother said, “Never buy anything with a nylon zipper.”  My parents never said anything you’d want to embroider on a cushion.""   I am not sure if these differences are between paperback and e-book editions. I have a Czech version of the paperback that contains text from version 2. I have been able to find the online English e-books only with the version 1 text.  I cannot find any information about different editions of the Fight Club books. Can you help me? The new rerelease of the book should contain only the new introduction by the author. "
1138,"What is the effect of using “silver” to describe the “horn” in ""Madman's Song"" by Elinor Wylie?","Here is the poem ""Madman's Song"" by Elinor Wylie (from The Prose and Poetry of Elinor Wylie , by William Rose Benét):     Better to see your cheek grown hollow,   Better to see your temple   worn,   Than to forget to follow, follow,   After the sound of a silver   horn.      Better to bind your brow with willow   And follow, follow until you   die,   Than to sleep with your head on a golden pillow,   Nor lift it up   when the hunt goes by.      Better to see your cheek grow sallow   And your hair grown gray, so   soon, so soon,   Than to forget to hallo, hallo,   After the milk-white   hounds of the moon.   I have a question about this poem in a book Cracking the SAT Literature Subject Test (by the way, if you've seen some of my previous SAT questions, these are from another book which is better in quality and which I use until I'm going to use until I finish with it):     What is the effect of using “silver” to describe the “horn” (line 4)?      (A) To imply that the horn is not as valuable as a golden horn    (B) To foreshadow any item that may be used in the “hunt” (line 8)    (C) To be alliterative with the word “sound”    (D) To indicate that the image would be bright    (E) To symbolize the beauty of wealth   I think A, D, and E can be eliminated but am not sure about the remaining answers. In C, the words ""sound"" and ""silver,"" actually, are alliterated although I wouldn't think that could be a reason for using the word ""silver"" in general. As for B, I don't completely understand this answer. I couldn't find an analysis of the poem online although I know it is dedicated to someone who lost their touch with what's important in life. However, I am not 100% sure if the words ""horn"" and ""hunt"" are related in the context of the poem. And here is the explanation:     C   “Silver” and “sound” are alliterative (C). There is no comparison   between silver and gold (A). “Silver” does not foreshadow the hunt   (B). Silver is not necessarily bright (D). The horn is not about   wealth, nor are we told it’s beautiful (E).     Should it be obvious in the context of the poem that the horn and the hunt aren't related here? Is it just my lack of understanding? And do the ""silver horn"" and ""hunt"" symbolize something else? Also, can alliteration here be the main reason for using a particular word? "
1139,80s-90s Female Cat Burglar accepts only Sapphires as payment,"Read at least 30-40 years ago. Was in English read in USA.  Basics of the story is following the career of a Female Cat Burglar in Europe(?) (I think she was French) She travels from country to country pulling solo high value jobs for hire. She ONLY takes payment in the form of Blue Gems. (Believe it was Sapphires, but might have been Blue Diamonds)  Meanwhile in interludes, or maybe flashbacks, they are relating the events of her life, and how she became a cat burglar.  I don't remember anything about any of the jobs. Other than sometimes people trying to get her to take other forms of payment, despite her insistence of Gems as payment.  I do remember the the last job, the the people who hired her paid her in fake gems. And after she leaves with them, they are laughing it off saying more or less when she finds out, who is she going to complain too? The Police?  At this point I think when she discovers they are fakes, she has a quite explicit graphic flashback, which shows why she only wants Blue Gems as payment.      When she was a teenager the police grabbed her in a church (I don't  recall if SHE had committed a crime, was the girl friend of someone  who had committed a crime, or the police just decided to ""have fun""  with a runaway they caught) They decided to ""teach her a lesson"" and  violated her with their night-sticks. The night-sticks were described  as either very heavily scuffed/scrapped/scratched or engraved with  patterns so when they hit someone with them it would it would cut them  up. And while she is being violated, and torn up inside, all she can  see is a blue stain glass window, which through her tears looks like   lots of little blue gems.   I believe the book ends with her in the process of hunting down the men who paid her in fakes. "
1140,"In The Mezzotint by M. R. James, what is a ""Door Bible""?","A passage in this famous ghost story, from his published collection Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, makes reference to a ""Door Bible"".     ‘Well, sir, of course I don’t set up my opinion against yours, but it ain’t the pictur I should ‘ang where my little girl could see it, sir.’      ‘Wouldn’t you, Robert? Why not?’      ‘No, sir. Why, the pore child, I recollect once she see a Door Bible, with pictures not ‘alf what that is, and we ‘ad to set up with her three or four nights afterwards, if you’ll believe me   Note that it's capitalised meaning, one would presume, that it's a particular edition of the Bible.  Googling the phrase turns up endless biblical references to, or sermons on, doors, which isn't much help.  What is this edition of the Bible, and why does James believe it contain disturbing images? "
1141,"What is a ""proem"", and why was this word used in the translation of the Kalevala?","The contents of Crawford's translation of the Kalevala begin, after the frontmatter that's not part of the original text, with something called a ""Proem"". Here it is.  Obvious question: what is a proem? It almost looks like a typo for ""poem"", but surely a typo wouldn't have been preserved for so long. Unfortunately, none of the sources I tried really explains what a proem is, just that there is one at the start of the Kalevala. Presumably it means an introductory chapter of some kind, but why was this word chosen by Crawford in his English translation instead of, say, ""prologue""? "
1142,Does the Kalevala rely on the concepts of good and evil?,"In the preface to his translation of the Kalevala (1888), John Martin Crawford wrote (my emphasis):     A deeper and more esoteric meaning of the Kalevala, however, points to a contest between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil; the Finns representing the Light and the Good, and the Lapps, the Darkness and the Evil. Like the Niebelungs, the heroes of the Finns woo for brides the beauteous maidens of the North; and the similarity is rendered still more striking by their frequent inroads into the country of the Lapps, in order to possess themselves of the envied treasure of Lapland, the mysterious Sampo, evidently the Golden Fleece of the Argonautic expedition.    One of the hosts on the Northern Myth Podcast on YouTube appear to disagree with the above view (my emphasis):      A thing about Kalevala: I don't think there is any concept of good or evil. There is order and chaos - very specifically, which I think is probably more the original type of morality, (...) without any sort of christianised influence. And I do think that that is, except for the very final poem, which, I think, some details had to be put in there to appease the Church, (...) but throughout, I think Lönnrot maintained the feel and the morality (...).   Based on what little information about Crawford is available on Wikipedia, he doesn't strike me as a ""scholar"" of Nordic literature. (He based his translation on an existing German translation.) I don't know what the YouTubers studied; maybe they just read a lot of Northern mythology.  My question is: is Crawford right about the contest between Good and Evil, or is the Northern Myth Podcast right, which may imply that Crawford might have been taking a christianised view on the story? Does scholarly literature shed more light on this issue? "
1143,"Where does Tolkein talk about hybridization of humans and other beings, in ""On Fairy Stories""?","Where does Tolkien talk about hybridization of humans and other beings, in ""On Fairy Stories""?  I just re-read it, and can't find the spot.  Is it just a small mention, related to the Frog Prince or something?  I got the info from TVTropes's info on the essay, which says, or used to say:     Heinz Hybrid: He mentions this, and notes that it can lead to unimpressive results if overdone.   Where Heinz Hybrid is:     A hybrid of an implausible number of different species.  "
1144,"""Literary theory"": Genre or field?","I vaguely remember learning that ""literary theory,"" according to some, is theory through which society and other artificial constructs are analyzed as though works of literature or art.  I recall finding more useful for my own understanding an original interpretation that ""literary theory"" is theory (of culture, of society, of language, of whatever one likes) that is written as literature, with the same creative and imaginative affordances, the same sensitivities, and a flexible style.  I feel that defining the field of theory this way (ironically?) gives it some legitimacy--for example against the Sokal attacks, which arguably misunderstood its goals--and distinguishes it neatly from philosophy.  Is this interpretation of literary theory mine alone, or have any scholars expressed similar views?   Otherwise, whence did the label ""literary theory"" arise, and how is one correctly to understand its vocabular meaning? "
1145,What do these lines mean in 'The Importance of Being Earnest'?,"   Miss Prism: (Recoiling in indignant astonishment) Mr Worthing! I am unmarried!      Jack: Unmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be one law for men, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you. (Tries to embrace her again.)  "
1146,Meaning of lines explaining Hrothgar's ruling in Heorot,"I'm reading Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf and when the poet talks about Heorot Hall (lines 71 through 73) he says     it would be his throne-room and there he would dispense    his God-given goods to young and old -   but not the common land or people's lives.   What exactly does it mean by saying ""not the common land or people's lives""? Does it mean to imply that Hrothgar had control over everything but the land and people's lives - God hadn't given him that control? The line just strikes me as rather confusing. "
1147,How are we supposed to know that Wainamoinen is the son?,"I've just read the first rune of the Kalevala (Crawford's translation). Most of it is about the ""maiden"", ""daughter of the Ether"", and how her travels in the sea lead to the creation of the world. It is mentioned that she has a baby, but nothing more about that baby:     Seven hundred years she labored   Ere her first-born was delivered.   Thus she swam as water-mother,   Toward the east, and also southward,   Toward the west, and also northward;   Swam the sea in all directions,   Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,   Swam in travail, swam unceasing,   Ere her first-born was delivered.   Later in the poem, after the world has been created, the story shifts abruptly to Wainamoinen:     Thus created were the islands,   Rocks were fastened in the ocean,   Pillars of the sky were planted,   Fields and forests were created,   Checkered stones of many colors,   Gleaming in the silver sunlight,   All the rocks stood well established;   But the singer, Wainamoinen,   Had not yet beheld the sunshine,   Had not seen the golden moonlight,   Still remaining undelivered.   Wainamoinen, old and trusty,   Lingering within his dungeon   I've read enough about the Kalevala to know that he is the baby mentioned earlier. The title of this rune is also ""The Birth of Wainamoinen"". But how is this clear from the writing itself, without any external context? The baby is mentioned briefly early in this rune, and at the later stage it seems as though we're shifting locations from the maiden in the sea to a man in prison.  Is it meant to be clear, without context, that Wainamoinen is the son? How? "
1148,What does Lorca mean by ‘the oppressed reds’ and ‘garnet violence’ in his poem ‘The King of Harlem’?,"I've already asked one question on this poem and I did think to include this question along with it but decided against it as the poem is quite long, though of course not as long as some ancient epics like the Mahabharata.  In the sixth and seventh stanzas of ‘The King of Harlem’, Federico García Lorca writes (in the English translation from The Selected Poems of Federico García Lorca):     Necessary to murder the blonde seller of brandy,   and all the friends of the apple and sand,   necessary to bang with closed fists   the small Jewesses that tremble full of bubbles,   so that the King of Harlem sings with his multitude,   so that the crocodiles sleep in long rows   under the asbestos of the moon,   so that nobody doubts the infinite beauty of funnels,   graters, feather-dusters, and saucepans in kitchens.      Ah Harlem! Ah Harlem! Ah Harlem!   There is no anxiety compared to your oppressed scarlets,   to your blood shaken within your dark eclipse,   to your garnet violence deaf and dumb in the penumbra,   to your great King, prisoner with a commissionaire’s uniform.   What does Lorca mean by that thread of red that threads itself through the seventh stanza? ‘Oppressed scarlets’, ‘blood shaken’ and ‘garnet violence’?   The sixth stanza is there as an introduction to the seventh.  "
1149,The House Was Quiet And The World Was Calm by Wallace Stevens quote interpretation,"I'll give the whole poem for context, but I'm having trouble making complete sense of a line in the poem.   What exactly does Stevens mean by the phrase ""wanted much most to be / The scholar to whom his book is true,""? Does Stevens mean to draw attention to the rationalism/empiricism of math, science, or philosophy, that the reader wanted to be like the scholar of the ""truth""?  "
1150,"Why did Eddie refer to himself as a ""feudal serf""?","In the beginning of the book, when Eddie Willars confronted Jim Taggart about the poor condition of the Rio Norte Line, they had the following exchange:     ""Jim, what are you saying? Does it matter that no one blames us - when the road is falling apart?""   James Taggart smiled; it was a thin smile, amused and cold. ""It's touching, Eddie,"" he said. ""It's touching - your devotion to Taggart Transcontinental. If you don't look out, you'll turn into one of those real feudal serfs.""   ""That's what I am, Jim.""   Why did Eddie say that? "
1151,What kind of engineer was Owen Kellogg?,"Towards the beginning of Atlas Shrugged, Owen Kellogg was described as follows:     [Dagney Taggart] knew that the superintendent of the Ohio Division was no good and that he was a friend of James Taggart. She had not insisted on throwing him out long ago only because she had no better man to put in his place. Good men were so strangely hard to find. But she would have to get rid of him, she thought, and she would give his post to Owen Kellogg, the young engineer who was doing a brilliant job as one of the assistants to the manager of the Taggart Terminal in New York; it was Owen Kellog who ran the Terminal...   This is somewhat ambiguous. What kind of engineer was he - engineer as in a train driver, or engineer as in ""the subject taught in college""? It's used in both senses in the book - Dagney studied engineering in college, William Hastings and John Galt were described as engineers, and Pat Logan was described an an ""engineer of the Taggart Comet on the Nebraska Division"".  Later, John Galt implies that Owen Kellogg has a practical use for physics (with the possible implication that Dagney didn't). The exact reasons for Galt's statement are discussed more in that question, but does this suggest that he was an engineer in the same sense as William Hastings? Having a practical use for physics would be consistent with an engineering background (although you'd then have to ask why Dagney didn't have a need for it, given that she had an engineering background too).  On the other hand, the fact that he was helping to manage the Taggart Terminal rather than working in the research department would seem to suggest that he was an engineer in the same sense as Pat Logan.  Finally, when Owen and Dagney were stuck on a ""frozen train"" that had been abandoned by its crew, there was no discussion of having Owen Kellogg take over as engineer (even temporarily). This is a bit of an argument from silence, though, and it seems unlikely that he and Dagney would be able to run the train alone without other crew members in any case (so they still would've needed to send for a crew anyway, especially given that Owen Kellogg didn't intend to go all the way to the train's destination). "
1152,Tudor or Jacobean plays that are sequels to a Shakespeare play?,"William Shakespeare wrote around 40 plays (depending on how the Shakespeare canon is defined). Except for some of his history plays (Henry IV, Henry VI) and possibly The Merry Wives of Windsor (not a real sequel of Henry IV Part 2 but another play involving Falstaff) Shakespeare did not write any continuations or sequels to any of his own plays. Marlowe, by contrast, wrote Tamburlaine the Great as a two-part play. But what about plays by other dramatists that continue the plot of a Shakespeare play? Do any such plays exist?   (I am excluding history plays from this question; there are history plays by several contemporaries of Shakespeare that tackle the same material—often based on Holinshed's Chronicles—in a different way.)  Note that the Jacobean period ended in 1625 with the death of King James, i.e. nine years after Shakespeare's death. Although the works I am looking for may have been written during Shakespeare's lifetime, I expect that the number of such works is very low. "
1153,Why didn't Eddie Willers ever connect some of the disappearances to his conversations with the Mystery Worker?,"Eddie Willers periodically ate dinner in the Taggart cafeteria with the Mystery Worker (who is, of course, later identified as John Galt). They discuss a lot of different things, including the state of the world and Taggart Transcontinental.  With that said, given the fact that much of the concrete information Eddie supplies to the Mystery Worker is promptly used by the Strikers to the detriment of Taggart Transcontinental, why didn't Eddie ever put two and two together (especially given how obviously pointed a few of the Mystery Worker's questions were)?  For example, Eddie Willers mentioned that Dick McNamara was going to be the contractor on the John Galt Line to the Mystery Worker, and he disappeared shortly after that.  He mentions their great need of diesel engines and who they'll be ordering them from. The Mystery Worker pointedly asked about how critical the diesels were, and the would-be manufacturer promptly disappears.  Same thing for Quentin Daniels (although admittedly the disappearance of Daniels was kind of overshadowed by the simultaneous disappearance of Dagny herself, along with the fact that Quentin Daniels was working for Dagny directly rather than through Taggart Transcontinental).  There were a number of other strange occurrences with information that Eddie shared with the Mystery Worker. So why didn't Eddie ever figure out who he was? "
1154,"In Great Expectations, who is the man at the pub in Chapter Ten?","In Chapter 10 of Dickens's Great Expectations, Pip goes to the pub to find Joe, as told by his sister. When he enters the pub, Joe and Mr. Wopsle are sitting at a table next to a mysterious man:     He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time, nodded.   Pip would have immediately recognised him if it was Magwitch, considering the trauma he caused him, so it probably isn't. Is it Compeyson? If it is we don't get the tell-tale detail of the large scar across his face that defines his appearance in the rest of the novel.   The man then indicates for Pip to sit next to him and Pip declines. Then he proceeds to 'grill' Joe about who Pip is after he hears his name:     The stranger looked at me again - still cocking his eye, as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun - and said, ""He's a likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?""      ""Pip,"" said Joe.      ""Christened Pip?""      ""No, not christened Pip.""      ""Surname Pip?""      ""No,"" said Joe, ""it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant, and is called by.""      ""Son of yours?""      ""Well,"" said Joe, meditatively - not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes; ""well - no. No, he ain't.""      ""Nevvy?"" said the strange man.      ""Well,"" said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, ""he is not - no, not to deceive you, he is not - my nevvy.""      ""What the Blue Blazes is he?"" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.   If it is Magwitch, he would not need to ask all of these questions since he had met Pip and knew his name as well as meeting Joe when he was captured in the marshes as a runaway convict, so I don't think it is him.   The man also mentions this at the pub, when he is told Mr. Wopsle is the church clerk:     ""Aha!"" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. ""The lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!""   This detail supports that perhaps it was Magwitch, since he first appears and meets Pip there, but Compeyson was also loose on the marsh near the church as he was recaptured whilst fighting Magwitch.  Finally, the man begins to stir his rum and water with the file that Pip had given Magwitch to break his shackles at the very beginning of the novel:     He stirred his rum-and-water pointedly at me, and he tasted his rum-and-water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and he tasted it: not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.      He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound.   It's strange that he was asking Pip's name just a few minutes ago but is now showing him the file, a very pointed symbol of Pip's frightening encounter with Magwitch in the first chapter. Maybe he was making sure it was Pip and not another boy? (this possible unsureness and need for clarification suggests is is not Magwitch)   Since he only let Pip see on purpose, he must either be one of the convicts or a messenger from the convicts. Either way this is a dramatic device used by Dickens to foreshadow the reappearance of Magwitch in Chapter 39 (when he reveals himself as Pip's mysterious benefactor, because he just before he leaves the pub he gives Pip some coins wrapped in two one-pound notes, which symbolises Pip's imminent unexpected inheritance) but is it actually one of the convicts? We know that Magwitch was eventually deported to Australia somewhere between Chapter 5 (when he is arrested in the marsh just after Christmas dinner) and Chapter 39. It is not stated when he does leave the country, but surely after his arrest to the prison ship he would not have been able to be at the pub, which is another consideration that seems to suggest that it cannot be him.  Is there any evidence in the book (or comments by Dickens) that points to who this man is?  "
1155,How to read S.?,"I've had S. by Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams on my shelf for ages and finally want to dig into it. From what I've read about it, there is a ton of layers to the book: the printed book itself, pencilled notes, notes in coloured pens from two characters added at 4(?) different times, physical inserts between the pages.  So now I'm wondering, how do you go about reading it to get the most from the experience? Do you try to take in everything at once? Read through the book multiple times, layer by layer? How do you know which timeline of the notes the inserts belong to? Can notes from later times spoil the plot from earlier times?  I've tried googling around a bit, but the recommendations seem to be all over the place, and I'm also a bit wary of spoilers. Since the book has been out for a few years, I figured some people have come up with some decent strategies to enjoy the book as much as possible.  Is there a consensus among fans on the best way to read it (or an ""officially"" recommended way), or at least could anyone give a comprehensive overview of the different approaches to the book and their pros and cons? "
1156,Do Guildenstern and Rosencrantz deserve to die?,"In Shakespeare's play Hamlet (which you can read online), Hamlet is on a voyage with his two friends, Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, to give a letter to a foreign ruler. However, Hamlet discovers that the letter they are carrying orders the foreign ruler to put him (Hamlet) to death. So Hamlet changes the letter so that it asks for Guildenstern and Rosencrantz to be put to death, and then leaves the boat to return home.  However, this seems a little bit unfair to Guildenstern and Rosencrantz. For one thing, they didn't write the letter--Claudius did (the letter had the king's seal). For another, as far as I can tell there isn't any evidence that Guildenstern and Rosencrantz knew about the contents of the letter.  When asked about this, Hamlet tells Horatio that:     Why, man, they did make love to this employment;       They are not near my conscience; their defeat       Does by their own insinuation grow:       'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes       Between the pass and fell incensed points       Of mighty opposites.   Which, again, I don't really think is fair. There's no evidence that ""they did make love to this employment,"" and saying that its ""dangerous when the baser nature [Guildenstern and Rosencrantz] comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites [Hamlet and Claudius]"" seems pretentious rather than a valid moral explanation.  Am I missing something here? Do Guildenstern and Rosencrantz deserve their deaths? "
1157,"Meaning of ""trente-six à soixante-huit chandelles"" in Jean Ferrat's Ma France","The French singer-songwriter Jean Ferrat (1930 – 2010) wrote a number of controversial songs. One of his most beautiful songs, Ma France (1969), was banned from the radio for two years. It's last lines are as follows (emphasis added):     Elle tient l’avenir, serré dans ses mains fines   Celle de trente-six à soixante-huit chandelles   Ma France   English (my own translation):     She [France] holds the future in her fine hands   That of thirty-six to sixty-eight candles   My France   What is meant by the words ""trente-six à soixante-huit chandelles""? According to this article by Manuel Talens,      This verse of consonant rhyme (belle / chandelles) refers to two important dates of French left history during the 20th Century, 1936 and 1968. The first one was the year of Léon Blum's Front Populaire victory in parliamentary elections, whereas the second one was the year of the French May insurrection. Ferrat introduces a play of words with chandelles, which is part of a French language boxing idiomatic expression voir les trente-six chandelles — literally ""to see the thirty-six candles"" — equivalent to the English language ""to see stars"" after a blow on the head. This ingenious rhetoric metabole permutation of both numbers allows the singer to metaphorically represent the failure of the 1968 students uprising at the hands of the French Republic's repressive apparatus.   When I showed this to a teacher of French (a native speaker) whose favourite singer is Jean Ferrat, she was sceptical. So my question is: did Manuel Talens get the meaning of ""trente-six à soixante-huit chandelles"" right or is there a better explanation? "
1158,Why are Sidorio chapters narrated in the present tense in Tide of Terror?,"Sidorio, the main antagonist of the Vampirates series, has several stand-alone scenes dotted through the second novel, Tide of Terror. Although the series as a whole is almost entirely narrated in the past tense, these scenes with Sidorio on his own (and some of his scenes with Stukeley too, IIRC) are for some reason narrated in the present tense.  Why is the tense changed for the Sidorio scenes? What does this inconsistency add to the tale? "
1159,"In 'Roman Fever' by Edith Wharton, why would Grace be raided?","I am reading Edith Wharton’s 'Roman Fever'. I have a couple of question which are beyond my understanding, being not a native English speaker.     ""I'd rather live opposite a speakeasy for a change; at least one might see it raided."" The idea of seeing Grace raided was so amusing that (before the move) she launched it at a woman's lunch. It made a hit, and went the rounds—she sometimes wondered if it had crossed the street, and reached Mrs. Ansley.   Mrs. Grace Anslay is an ordinary housewife, without a chance to get involved in a speakeasy business, so there is no reason for her to be raided by the police. What is the logic in this sentence? Something is missing? "
1160,"Is ""Africa"" by Toto focused on the woman referred to in the beginning of the song, or on Africa itself?","The song ""Africa"" by Toto is at least nominally about the narrator's relationship with a woman:     I hear the drums echoing tonight   But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation   She's coming in 12:30 flight   However, much of the rest of the song is talking about Africa itself (e.g. the title, the references to wild dogs, etc.). Even its music video is full of references to Africa (clothing style, globe centered on Africa, etc.), and doesn't feature a woman anywhere in it.  The song includes the following chorus, sung multiple times:     It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you   There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever   do   I bless the rains down in Africa   Who, exactly, is ""you"" here? Is the narrator referring to the woman introduced in the beginning of the song, or to Africa itself? "
1161,Meaning of ché in several French or Martiniquan Creole phrases in Wide Sargasso Sea,"The first part of Jean Rhys' novel Wide Sargasso Sea is set in Jamaica, but the main character's mother is from Martinique, where French and the French-based Martiniquan Creole are spoken. The family's parrot can speak a few words that are based either on French or Martiniquan Creole.   For example, on page 25 of the Norton Critical Edition of the novel:     Our parrot was called Coco, a green parrot. He didn't talk very well, he could say Qui est là? Qui est là? and answer himself Ché Coco, Ché Coco.   Judith L. Raiskin, who edited the Norton Critical Edition, explains Coco's words as ""Who's there?"" and ""Dear Coco."" The first translation is fine, but the second does not appear to make sense. It assumes that ""ché"" is a mispronunciation of ""cher/chère"", turning the French è into é and dropping the guttural R. However, the normal answer to, ""Who's there?"" would be, ""It's Coco"" (since the parrot answers himself) or, in French, ""C'est Coco"". ""Ché Coco"" can be interpreted as a mispronunciation (or perhaps an eggcorn) of ""C'est Coco"", which sounds more plausible than Judith Raiskin's explanation.   In part two, Prof. Raiskin annotates another phrase in (presumably) Martiniquan Creole:     ""Doudou, ché cocotte,"" the elderly woman said to Antoinette.   (The elderly woman is Christophine, who used to be Antoinette's nurse. The word ""doudou"" is also used in Nalo Hopkinson's novel Midnight Robber, which uses many elements from Caribbean culture.) According to Prof. Raiskin, the phrase is     An endearment, ""darling little ducky"".    Wiktionary tells us that doudou comes from a duplication of the French word ""doux"" (literally ""soft""), so the first part of the translation is fine. However, since the phrase is a greeting, it would make more sense to translate the second part as ""it's cocotte"" instead of ""little ducky"" (assuming that ""cocotte"" refers to the elderly woman and isn't used in its current meaning).  However, much later (page 90 in the Norton Critical Edition), Christophine uses the phrase ""doudou ché"", which Judith Raiskin translates as ""darling dear"". Based on word order, the translation ""it's doudou"" does not appear to make sense.   My question therefore is what ""ché"" in the above examples means. Does it always mean the same thing? If it comes from ""c'est"", how it is possible to make sense of the last example? (Does Martiniquan Creole use a different word order than French?) If it comes from ""cher/chère"", how does that make sense in the first two examples?  "
1162,What is the logic in this quote about raids in 'Roman Fever' by Edith Wharton?,"I am reading Edith Wharton’s Roman Fever. I have a  question which is beyond my understanding, being not a native English speaker.  The phrase is as below from the original text.     ""I'd rather live opposite a speakeasy for a change; at least one might see it raided.""    The idea of seeing Grace raided was so amusing that (before the move) she launched it at a woman's lunch. It made a hit, and went the rounds—she sometimes wondered if it had crossed the street, and reached Mrs. Ansley.

1163,"What do ""current words"" mean in 'Roman Fever' by Edith Wharton?","The below paragraph is from ""Roman Fever'.     ""Alida Slade's awfully brilliant; but not as brilliant as she thinks,"" would have summed it up; though she would have added, for the enlightenment of strangers, that Mrs. Slade had been an extremely dashing girl; much more so than her daughter, who was pretty, of course, and clever in a way, but had none of her mother's—well, ""vividness,"" someone had once called it.    Mrs. Ansley would take up current words like this, and cite them in quotation marks, as unheard-of audacities. No; Jenny was not like her mother.   What does the ‘current words’ mean? Why ‘in quotation marks, as unheard of audacities’?  "
1164,"How much did Lombard know about the murders in ""And Then There Where None""?","When only Lombard and Vera are left alive, they have this dialogue that makes it seem like Lombard was the murderer. And while you could claim that it was a mutual misunderstanding (both of them thinking the other one was the murderer), there is this line that perplexes me.     Vera said:      ""There's no one on the island - no one at all - except us two..."" Her voice was a whisper - nothing more.      Lombard said: ""Precisely. So we know where we are, don't we?""      Vera said: ""How was it worked - that trick with the marble bear?""      He shrugged his shoulders. ""A conjuring trick, my dear - a very good one...""   Here, it's as if Lombard admits he did all the murders, along with the last one. Which is obviously then proved to be a lie.  Before reading the epilogue, I was thinking that Morris had hired him as a murderer, so the line made sense. Which is again proven to not be the case. So, which one is it? How much did Lombard know about the plan, and why did he answer like that about the marble bear? "
1165,Why are the names Rumi and Mevlana respectively used for the famous poet?,"This famous Persian poet and mystic was named Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Balkhī (جلال‌الدین محمد بلخى‎) or Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī (جلال‌الدین محمد رومی), where Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad was his actual personal name while Balkhī and Rūmī were nisbas referring respectively to his birthplace and the place where he spent much of his later life.  In the English-speaking world, he is usually referred to as Rumi after one of these nisbas. In various Middle Eastern countries (e.g. Turkey), he is commonly referred to as Mevlana or some other variant of Mawlānā (مولانا‎) meaning ""our master"".  Why have these sobriquets in particular become popular for him? Nobody refers to him by his personal name; instead we have, in the west, the name ""Rumi"" meaning ""from the western part [of the Persian Empire] which was formerly in the Roman Empire"", and, in the Middle East, some variant of the name ""Mawlana"" meaning ""my/our master"". How did these names become the standard way of referring to him? And why different names in different countries? "
1166,Aesop's ambiguous fables,"I've been reading through some fables of Aesop's. I notice that some of them draw an explicit moral, but I don't know whether these were edited in later. For example, this version of ""boy and snails"" stops short of the moral while this one delivers it. The collection I've been reading mostly omits them, although characters do often get a line such as ""This is what I deserve for leaving my life in the pasture, hard as it was!"" or ""But the sheep was no fool and retorted...""  However, some are without editorialization and seem open to interpretation. Examples:     Ape and travellers. Is this an indictment of those who tell the truth heedless of the danger; of those who tell the truth only opportunistically; or of those who can't bear the hear the truth?      Three tradesmen. Do we laugh at the tanner for having no better argument than his partiality, or does he lampoon the others for appearing to have good reasons when really they're partial?      Swan. Are we supposed to agree with the expedient solution or is it as crude as it sounds?      Wolf, mother, child. Do we laugh at the wolf's naïveté about figurative language or do we share his disgust at people never meaning what they say?   Sometimes I find it easier to piece together an intended reading when there are thematic links:     Pomegranate, apple tree, bramble. Two fruit trees argue over whose fruit is better and a bramble invites them to quit quarrelling. Dolphins, whales, sprat. Same story but this time the dolphins and whales rebuke the would-be mediator: ""We would rather go on killing each other than be reconciled by a sprat."" Lion &amp; boar. Two enemies realize that killing each other for others' gain benefits neither of them.   The heart of my question: Do some of the fables have intentionally ambiguous meanings? I consider this important because that's quite a different species of literature than black-and-white moralizing. (Of course, I see that at least some fables are of the latter kind.)  Some subquestions of possible relevance:   Is this the fault of my edition? That is, do we have some manuscripts with more of the morals spelled out and others with less? I know that the Victorians liked to gloss the fables... Does something about the form tell me how to read it? For example, in the bramble story, does its having the last word mean anything? Are there clues from the customs or mores of the time that make some readings more or less likely for the time? For example, if one used to wring swans' necks as a matter of course...  "
1167,"Origin of ""give a watermelon a pure fit"" in ""Blood Meridian""","On page 334 of Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian, Elrod responds to the man’s assertion that the ears on his scapular were taken from Apaches by saying that the “Apaches would give a watermelon a pure fit”:     The man sat holding the necklace in his hands. They wasnt cannibals, he said. They was Apaches. I knowed the man that docked em. Knowed him and rode with him and seen him hung.       Elrod looked at the others and grinned. Apaches, he said.

1168,When was the Party founded?,"   The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.      Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all   caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the   presence of the telescreen.      'They've got you too!' he cried.      'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful   irony.   In the discussion on this question about why O'Brien seemed regretful, we discussed whether there was any chance that O'Brien was referring to a time before the Party was in power.  My question, then: does the book offer any clue as to when and/or how the Party took power originally? Is it possible that O'Brien remembered it, and was perhaps even part of putting them in power in the first place? Did Orwell ever comment on either point outside the text? "

1170,Which book(s): Fictional account of pre-columbian indians,"I'm trying to identify a book, or series of books I read as a child. The setting was pre-columbian Central America, the protagonists belonged to a river based tribe (lots of big canoes etc).  If memory serves, the premise of one of the books was that the beautiful wife-to-be of one of the protagonists was kidnapped by members of a rival tribe. A rescue party is formed by the protagonists and some of the kidnapped girls kin (from the rival tribe?). They track the kidnappers, and soon discover that the kidnappers have sold her to slavers or have been themselves taken by slavers (my recollection of this bit is a bit hazy). The rescue party learn the destination of the slavers by talking to salt traders.  The slavers are heading for the far away mountains to sell their catch to a (relatively) advanced city-dwelling nation ruled by a god-king. To look at the god-kings face means certain death (unclear if this death is instant, or if it means that the offender is shunned as lawless/banished to a wasteland). The girl is sold to the temple of the god-king and are to be wed and/or sacrificed to the king. The rescue party find a local ally to help them, and end up saving the god-king from a plot by the evil vizier/main priest or whatever during a jaguar hunt. As a reward the girl is freed and reunited with her betrothed, the protagonists get fancy gifts and travel back home.  Some details (that might be from other books in the series):   There is a tapir hunt, involving using a big bow which have to be drawn using the feet while lying on the back. At one point the protagonists have to climb trees to escape/hide from aggressive peccaries Some people worship a giant (evil?) snapping turtle living in the bottom of a cave and feed it human sacrifices. There is a sacred gathering of the tribes where conflicts are resolved, trade agreements are made, weddings are decided. All feuds and violence are banned during this gathering, but traveling to the gathering can be dangerous as the restriction on violence only applies to the gathering proper. Salt, well crafted items and hides are the main trade goods, the protagonists doesn't understand the mountain nation's fascination for precious metals. There is a character called something like Stonefist because his tolerance of pain (he receives the nickname after holding a burning coal in his hand for a dare?)   I don't know how old these books might be, I read them in the early 90s, but I'm guessing they were from the 60-70s.  edit  The original might not be English! The version I read was in Norwegian, and I've always assumed they were originally in English, but that might not be the case. "
1171,"What effect did the knocking at the gate in ""Macbeth"" have on Thomas De Quincey?","In Thomas De Quincey's 1823 essay ""On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth"", he describes the effect of the knocking on him when he was a boy: ""it [the knocking] reflected back upon the murderer a peculiar awfulness..."". What did he mean by this? Does he admits feeling sympathy for Macbeth?  Here is the paragraph in question:     From my boyish days I had always felt a great perplexity on one point   in Macbeth. It was this: the knocking at the gate, which succeeds to   the murder of Duncan, produced to my feelings an effect for which I   never could account. The effect was, that it reflected back upon the   murderer a peculiar awfulness and a depth of solemnity; yet, however   obstinately I endeavoured with my understanding to comprehend this,   for many years I never could see why it should produce such an effect.

1172,"Is there much critical analysis of ""The Hunger Angel""?","Herta Müller, the Romanian-born-German-novelist, won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature. In the same year, her novel The Hunger Angel (Atemschaukel) was published and received much laudation. Despite this, it seems to me that there has been a dearth of critical analysis of this novel (at least in English, I concede that I do not possess the ability to find it in any other language, although I would easily believe it exists in German).   So far I have only been able to find three or so essays/articles on the book (as well as some reviews by newspapers) but nothing that seemed to me to be serious, academic criticism. This was a huge surprise to me given the fact that the book came out in the same year that she won the Nobel Prize. My question is: has much academic criticism been written concerning this novel? Is there any substantial analysis of her work as a writer that pays special attention to this novel?  "
1173,Does translation take away from the meaning of verse and poetry?,"I am currently reading The Heart of Haiku by Jane Hirshfield. In it, many examples of haikus translated from Japanese are given. However, in their English form, they lack the rhythm and meter of Haiku. Does this take away from their meaning? If so, in what way? In music, songs' lyrics are often translated loosely to maintain the melody and rhythm. Does an equivalent process occur for music? "
1174,"In the song ""Ja is Playing Jazz"" (Джа играет джаз), who is Ja?","While listening to Splean's last album Ключ к шифру (The Key to the Cipher) again, I've wondered about a particular line from the song ""Джа играет джаз"" (""Ja is Playing Jazz""):     Сегодня Джа играет джаз,   А завтра – Родину продаст.        Today Ja is playing jazz,   and tomorrow he'll sell his motherland.    Translation mine.    It very much seemed like there's some background I was missing, since people don't usually go accusing people of betraying their country in song lyrics for no good reason.  Turned out I was right - this website, where I also took the lyrics from, claims that ""Сегодня он играет джаз, а завтра Родину продаст"" (""Today he is playing jazz, and tomorrow he'll sell his motherland."") is a line from a Soviet magazine Крокодил (Crocodile), which became popular and widely known for some time.  Okay, but who is Ja? This website lists ""джа"" is a slang word for jazz - how is this related to ""him"" from the magazine? And how does that relate to the rest of the lyrics:     Сегодня Джа играет джаз,   А завтра – Родину продаст.   Хотя, кому она нужна?   Об этом знает только Джа.      Сегодня Джа играет джаз   И это наш последний шанс,   Чтобы увидеть старика.   Пока не скажет Джа – пока,   My brief summary: Ja is playing jazz; he's an old man; he's going to sell (betray) his country (but who needs it anyway?); and it's their last chance to see ""the old man"" before he says ""goodbye"" (presumably dies or runs away).  Is this a reference to some political event I'm surely oblivious to, or just a random reference added in for no reason at all? "
1175,Why and how did the orphan kill his adoptive mother?,"While seeking the answer to a story-identification question the other day, I got sucked into a collection of Guy de Maupassant's short stories. (Have fun!) One of them, ""The Orphan"", is about a woman, Mademoiselle Source, who adopts a young boy and is later - so the text strongly implies - murdered by him. (Full text here.) My question is twofold:   how did he kill her? He does fall under suspicion, but seems to have a solid alibi and is acquitted. How, then (and when) did he actually manage to perform the deed?     He proved that he had spent the evening up to eleven o'clock in a cafe. Ten persons had seen him, having remained there till his departure.      The driver of the diligence stated that he had set down the murdered woman on the road between half-past nine and ten o'clock.  More importantly, why did he kill her? What was his motivation? She'd brought him up since he was a child, and never been anything but loving to him. Even if he hated her for some reason, she was actually in the process of leaving her home when she died, so he wouldn't have had to put up with her any longer anyway. What possible reason could he have to want her dead?  "
1176,"Understanding the use of the word ""Negress"" in the Kilmartin and Cox translation of Solaris","I just finished reading Kilmartin and Cox's translation of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, and one particular passage stood out to me. I'm hesitant to ask a question about the Kilmartin and Cox translation, because I found out after reading it that (1) it's a very poor translation, most likely due to the fact that (2) it's not a direct translation, it's a translation of a French translation of the Polish text. The passage occurs on page 30 of my translation, where one character is referred to as a ""Negress"" and described using racially coded language:     Suddenly, looming up in the opening which led to the communal bathroom, a tall silhouette appeared, barely distinguishable in the surrounding gloom. I stood stock still, frozen to the spot. A giant Negress was coming silently towards me with a smooth, rolling gait. I caught a gleam from the whites of her eyes and heard the soft slapping of her bare feet. She was wearing nothing but a yellow skirt of plaited straw; her enormous breasts swung freely and her black arms were as thick as thighs. Less than a yard separated us as she passed me, but she did not give me so much as a glance. She went on her way, her grass skirt swinging rhythmically, resembling one of the steatopygous statues in anthropological museums. She opened Gibarian's door and on the threshold her silhouette stood out distinctly against the bright light from inside the room.    On one hand, I feel like I'm missing some things in translation here: the word ""Negress"" seems weird to me, and I'm not sure if this is due to Kilmartin and Cox's translation. On the other hand, the passage appeals to several racial stereotypes, such as the reference to the ""grass skirt,"" and the ""statues in anthropological museums.""  I have three interrelated questions. How much was this passage altered in translation? How would the language have been understood by Polish readers? And why did Lem code this particular character as black? "
1177,"Who put forward this completion to Sappho 94, and what is it actually supposed to read?","In Sappho 94 (τεθνάκην δ' ἀδόλως θέλω), there is this tercet at ll. 25-27, which is very incomplete, which Edmonds doesn't even have, and which Bibliotheca Augustana and Campbell p. 69 both read:     κωὔτε τις [^ ^ οὔ]τε τι   ἶρων οὐδ᾽ ὐ[^ – ^ ^         ἔπλετ᾽, ὄππ[οθεν ἄμ]μες ἀπέσκομεν·   Wharton seems to not even have the fragment, and then safopoemas. This weird doc full of horrid typos, which is no longer available at the link it was at, which is now broken, but can be found as a pdf here, with the same garbage typos as the doc version, and is based on a Spanish edition of Sappho, has this semi-garbage:     χωΰτε τις[λόγος οδ]τε τι Τρον ούδ' ύ[δατος ρ6χ]   ϊπλετ' όπ π [όθεν Εμ]   μες άπέσχομεν   This is very messy, but it allows us to almost complete the above as:     κωὔτε τις [λόγος οὔ]τε τι   ἶρον οὐδ᾽ ὔ[δατος †ρ6χ†         ἔπλετ᾽, ὄππ[οθεν ἄμ]μες ἀπέσκομεν·   The safopoemas translation reads:     Y no hubo colina profana | And there was no sacred hill   o sagrada, ni fuentes de aguas | Or profane, nor springs of water   a donde no hayamos ido | Where we haven't gone to   This tells us that λόγος is probably a typo/mojibake for λόφος, given by LSJ as quoted by Perseus's Greek Word Study Tool as various things including crest of a hill, and that the incomprehensible ρ6χ must somehow mean spring. I looked for all possible combinations of vowels substituted for the 6 and endings, and found nothing on Perseus, but found ραχία, flood-tide, on the Rocci dictionary. Not too fitting, but maybe. Back in the days when I translated Sappho, I had temporarily settled for ῥέον, but now I guess a better way to do this would be ῥόος, both meaning stream and keeping the initial consonant and possibly a vowel. Analysing other fragments in that safopoemas, 6 is almost certainly an omicron, and the chi could be a kappa, so we could have ροχ or ροκ, neither of which yields anything interesting on Perseus.  I looked around for another source for this completion (possibly Reinach, which this document claims to be following in the quote below), but was unable to find any. So my question is: what was this reconstruction supposed to look like, and who proposed it, and of course, how supported is this amongst critics?  Quote from safopoemas.doc's introduction     El texto griego que hemos utilizado fue el que preparó Theodore Reinach, en atención a su magnífico aparato crítico y como homenaje mínimo a su severo y conservador trabajo, que prefiere, sin audacia, leer lo mínimo con la seguridad de que esas escasas palabras fueron de Safo, en lugar de las largas, interesantes y arriesgadas reconstrucciones de otros autores. Como la edición de Reinach, que finalmente revisó Aimé Puech, fue anterior a la publicación de varios papiros importantes y de otras ediciones útilísimas, hemos consultado permanentemente las de Edmonds, Diehl y Page, y en varias ocasiones las hemos seguido.      The Greek text we have used was that which Theodor Reinach prepared, with attention to his magnificent critical apparatus and as a minimal hommage to his strict and conservative work, who prefers, without boldness, to read the least with the sureness that these scarce words were of Sappho, in the place of the large, interesting and risked reconstructions of other authors. Since Reinach's edition, which Aimé Puech finally revised, was prior to the publication of various important papyri and of other very useful editions, we have permanently consulted those of Edmonds, Diehl and Page, and in various occasions we have followed them.   Update  Diehl p. 49 also has an incomplete (in fact, even more incomplete than the others) version. Can't get ahold of Bergk, but seen as this doesn't give the Bergk number for this poem, Bergk probably didn't have the poem at all. Voigt is also either to be paid for, a Google Book, or on researchgate which I'd have to join for something which is not my field of study, which feels like lying. "
1178,Who is Thoreau quoting (or paraphrasing) here in Walden?,"The passage in question is in Walden's conclusion:     The philosopher said ""From an army of three divisions one can take   away its general, and put it in disorder; from the man the most abject   and vulgar one cannot take away his thought.""   Who is Thoreau referencing here? Is it anyone in particular, or is he making more of a general reference to ""The Philosopher"" as a cultural construct? "
1179,Symbolism of Marx and Lenina's names in Huxley's Brave New World?,"Reading Brave New World it seemed obvious to me that Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowne are in some way referring to Marx and Lenin, but I couldn't figure out any clue to support this claim. Is it truly so and what are they representing? Is there any (related) symbolism in their other names (first and last, respectively), i.e. Bernard and Crowne? "
1180,"About Sappho's epigram for the little girl Aithopia: first line (manuscript tradition and experts' take), and authorship","Background and research  As I am planning to post this poem on my blog relatively soon, I was doing some research on the first line. From what I had written previously, I seem to have found two different versions:     Παῖδες, ἄφωνος ἔοισα τόδ' ἐννέπω, αἴ τις ἔραται   or:     Καίπερ ἄφωνος ἔοισα ποτεννέπω, αἴ τις ἔραται   I opted for the first one for my translations, because καίπερ only stresses the concessive (is that the word?) nature of the participle, and I preferred to have a vocative there like παῖδες, and also because instead of a seemingly useless prefix I preferred an object for the verb ἐννέπω. Tonight I was trying to get more info on the sources. I looked into bibliotheca Augustana, and the ἐπιγράμματα link does not exist. I looked at Edmonds (who proposes another version, παῖς ἔτ', which I prefer to the one I opted for back in the days, and has τόρ' instead of the object, an adjective referred to the speaker meaning ""clear, distinct"", perhaps I will adopt this reading), and he says Anth. Pal. 6 269. Sadly, I found no scans of that. I looked at Campbell hoping for a more detailed critical note, and the poem isn't there! Wharton agrees with me, The Complete Poems of Sappho follows Cox (or so he says), and ends up agreeing with my choice -- almost, he has τότ' instead of τόδ', perhaps a typo, as ""then"" doesn't seem to fit in there. I'm starting to wonder where I got the other choices. Well, the καίπερ might have been off the weird safopoemas.doc (pdf version here), for which cfr. my post on the completion of Sappho 94. But the other thing? Even the Greek Wikisource completely agrees with me on this! Googling Σαϋναϊάδα yields this with ποτεννέπω. I don't remember this source, but perhaps that was it.  Question     Anyways, I was wondering what the experts think about this line and its most likely ""correct"" reading, what the sources for this poem have to say, and why Campbell doesn't include it. Is it perhaps of disputed authorship, along with the other two epigrams in elegiac couplets?   Reference to Greek Wikisource with texts of epigrams  Two of these (the present one is Απόσπασμα 118, the other one 119) can be found here. The third one, to the fisher Pelagon (τῷ γρίπει Πελάγωνι πάτηρ ἐπέθηκε Μένισκος / Κύρτον καὶ κώπαν, μνᾶμα κακοζοΐας), has strangely been removed even from there. Somebody here probably doesn't have a clear idea what an epigram is :). Anyway here is someone following Edmonds on the poem of the question and including all 3 epigrams.  Bergk  Bergk p. 636 ha all epigrams, his line 1 reads:     Παῖδες, ἄφωνος ἐοῖσα τότ' ἐννέπω, αἴ τις ἔρηται   and he has this critical note:        Acknowledging a mistake  Whoopsies! I missed them in Campbell because they were in smaller font. p. 113. Et voilà: good morning ποτεννέπω, though Campbell agrees on the vocative. Here is a screenshot of all the epigrams in Campbell:       "
1181,What was this novel about an English man growing up in a mansion isolated from society?,"I remember from school that a certain book was treated during English literature classes about an English man who grew up in a mansion isolated from society? He was taken care of and everything without having to interact with other human beings. When he finally came out into society, there was a disconnect between his view of things and reality. Could anyone tell me the title and author of that book? It was set somewhere in the 20th century.   EDIT: It must have been about 25 years ago I read it. It was a British novel. I think we had a cheap paperback version and on the cover there was a picture of a man wearing fancy clothes, a grey bowlerhat and a walking stick, sitting on a chair. The idea of the novel was that the person was mentally stilted, because of his lack of social contact, very much set in his ways and routines and unable to understand other people or even acknowledge their autonomy. "
1182,"What is the significance of the name ""Strange"" in Strange and Norrell?","Inspired by What is the significance of &quot;Jonathan&quot; in Strange and Norrell?   In the book Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, ""Strange"" immediately strikes the reader as a rather ... well, strange name. Even in Britain, the country which produces such wackily wonderful names as Pogglethorpe, Higginbottom, and so on, I've never seen Strange as a surname except in this book. It stands out from the other names in the novel, which all seem rather more believable.  One might say that Strange is clearly an out-of-the-ordinary person, someone who never fit in. But he's less ""strange"" than e.g. Childermass or Vinculus, so why was he the one singled out for the strange name? What does it signify in terms of his character and his place in the plot?  Where did the name ""Strange"" come from, and what is its significance? "
1183,"Who came to Rumata's house at the end, and why?","At the very end of Hard to Be a God, a group of men arrive at Rumata's house and      murder Kyra,   sending Don Rumata into a blind and murderous rage. But who were they, who sent them, and why did they come in the first place? They weren't expecting Rumata to be home, and Kyra said:     ""They've come for me,"" she whispered. ""I knew they would!""   Why is she an important target, and for whom? What was their purpose in coming ""for her"" (?), or in      killing her?  "
1184,Are man and woman like ash and elm? How?,"In Neil Gaiman's adaptation of the Norse myths, Norse Mythology, it is sometimes clear that certain elements are used in the stories as a way for the Norse people to transmit useful information and skills to their children. For example, in ""The Last Days of Loki,"" Loki invents a net, and Kvasir deduces what it was (both its use and its manner of construction) from the pattern of the ashes. This small exchange can ensure that children understand the skill of net-making (and also, possibly, to teach them deductive reasoning).  One of the earlier stories, ""Before the Beginning, and After,"" describes the creation of human beings. Odin and his brothers, realizing that the world of Midgard must be inhabited, set out to create humanity. They collect two logs that had floated to shore:     The first log was a log of ash wood. The ash tree is resilient and   handsome and its roots go deep. Its wood carves well and will not   split or crack. Ash wood makes a good tool handle, or the shaft of a   spear.      The second log they found, beside the first on the beach, so close to   the first log they were almost touching, was a log of elm wood. The   elm tree is graceful, but its wood is hard enough to be made into the   toughest planks and beams; you can build a fine home or a hall from   elm wood.   The godly brothers then give the logs first life, then will, intelligence, and drive, and finally shape (one male, one female). Then they give them clothes, for they were cold, and finally they gave them names.     Last of all they gave the two people they had made names: the man they   called Ask, or Ash Tree; the woman they called Embla, or Elm.    Does this description of man as Ash, and woman as Elm, tell us anything about how the ancient Norse people understood gender and the differences between men and women? If the story does tell us something about the ancient Norse views on gender, is there something in the first passage I quoted, about the suitable uses for ash and elm wood, that is relevant to this? The explanation of the differences between the two woods (both are useful, but in different ways) might reveal a similar attitude toward men and women (neither is superior, but they have different roles), or it might only be a practical description of the materials available to the Norse, and nothing else. Is this description of man and woman as Ash and Elm changed in any way from the original Norse myths? (I know there's been some discussion about the accuracy of Gaiman's transmission of the myths, but I haven't yet seen any discussion of particular discrepancies in Norse Mythology.) What, if anything, does it mean that Yggdrasil is an ash tree (""Yggdrasil and the Nine Worlds"")? Is Yggdrasil meant to have masculine characteristics?  "
1185,What does it mean that different parts of humans are created by different gods?,"While looking at Norse Mythology to write this question, I read a passage of the book more closely than I had before, and noticed something interesting. When humans are created, the brothers Odin, Vili, and Ve each take a different role in the creation of the first two fully functioning humans beings. First, Odin gives them life: ""Odin [...] breathed life into them [...] now they were alive."" Then ""Vili gave them will; he gave them intelligence and drive. Now they could move, and they could want."" Finally, ""Ve carved the logs,"" giving them a shape, making one male and one female. And then all three brothers give them clothes, and names. (p. 33-34)  Is there a significance to the creation of each different part of the complete human being coming from different brothers? After reading Gaiman's book, I don't feel that I know Vili and Ve very well, but Odin is certainly very different from his brothers. Neither Vili nor Ve, for example, sacrificed an eye or hanged themselves to seek knowledge. The gallows-god is also a strong-willed leader; Odin, not his brothers, leads the Aesir and the Einherjar. He is in charge of battle, and is the most important god in the Norse pantheon; these are qualities that his brothers lack.  What, if anything, does it mean that essential qualities of humanity are endowed by different gods?  Do these gods have different skill sets? Is it possible that Odin wouldn't be able to, let's say, carve the logs into a shape? Or could it be that, assuming all three brothers are equally capable, there is a reason that Odin, as the god of war (or any of the other things he is god of) is associated with the breath of life, and ditto for Vili and Ve? How should we explain the multistep and multi-player creation of humanity in the Norse mythos? "
1186,Confusing list in Crime and Punishment,"I have started to read some classic books and I am having some trouble understanding some parts of chapter 6 part 3 in Crime and Punishment, this is after Raskolnikov is called a ""Murderer"" by a man that was in Raskolnikov's lodgings. Briefly after Raskolnikov chases the man and comes back to his room, he starts thinking about his theory. However, I get confused in this part:     ""In the first place, because I can reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I am utterly a louse,""   So I believe he is trying to prove that is indeed a ""louse,"" which I think means something insignificant and trivial. However, I don't get what he is trying to say with this list:     In the first place, because I can reason that I am one   Ok so he is one because he can figure out by himself he is a louse. Got it.     secondly, because for a month past I have been troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble object--ha-ha!   This is where I get lost. He says for ""a month past,"" which I think means a month after, he has ""been troubling benevolent Providence."" What is ""benevolent Providence?""  Then he says that it wasn't because of his human lust, but because of a nobler purpose. How does that prove he is a ""louse""?  I have a slight feeling that he is being sarcastic, but I am not sure. Could someone clarify what he means? "
1187,Is Doctor Adams a self-insertion in Watership Down?,"In chapter 48, ""Dea ex Machina"", of Watership Down, we meet Doctor Adams.  Watership Down is of course written by Richard Adams.  Is there any indication besides the surname that this character is a self-insertion by Richard Adams?  Or is the surname just a ""coincidence""? "
1188,What makes Alex Rider and Matthew Freeman so different?,"At the end of my copy of Raven's Gate, there's a Q&amp;A with Anthony Horowitz, the author. One of the questions is:     Q: Is it difficult to write both Alex Rider and The Gatekeepers at the same time? What do you think the series have in common, and what's different?      A: I can't write Alex Rider at the same time as The Gatekeepers - the two are just too different. Fortunately, I've now finished the sixth Alex adventure, Ark Angel, and don't plan to return to him until I've finished the second and third volumes of The Gatekeepers series.   What do the two series have in common? Pace, adventure, action, violence, and, I hope, readability. They're both fairly adult - not classic ""children's books"". But Matt Freeman is no Alex Rider. He's much less sure of himself, even more of a victim than Alex. And there won't be quite so many happy endings in The Gatekeepers.   But what are some examples of Matt being less sure of himself? In what other ways are they different? "
1189,"Is the heart in ""The Hunt"" associated with Desire?","One symbol that is repeatedly associated with Desire is a crystal heart. This appears in several Sandman stories, including in each Endless member's gallery. (Each Endless has a gallery, containing the sigils of the other Endless.)     The Sandman vol. 2: The Doll's House, part seven: ""Lost Hearts""; click for full page.   I do have a picture of one of these hearts from a question that I had asked earlier on another SE site:        The Sandman #16 ""Lost Hearts""  The hearts are also something of a signature for Desire; when Nada's village was destroyed by Desire in The Sandman #9 (""Tales in the Sand""), crystalline hearts are left in the sand (and prompt the old man to begin his tale).   I wonder, then, if the ""emerald heart of Koschei the Deathless,"" (seen in The Sandman #38 ""The Hunt"") is also associated with Desire of the Endless. The heart, given to Baba Yaga, appears strikingly similar to those hearts associated with Desire:        As a side note, this emerald heart may or may not actually have once belonged to Koschei the Deathless:         Desire's hearts appear in different colors, at least white and red, so I don't think Koschei's hearts green means that this is a different type of heart.  Is the emerald heart of Koschei the Deathless connected to Desire? If so, what is that connection? "
1190,What were the original two results for 'died in a blogging accident'?,"XKCD 369, ""Dangers"", mentions two results for 'died in a blogging accident':    But XKCD has messed up the Internet. Now there are a lot more results for 'died in a blogging accident' - 250k of them.  I tried a search using Googles fancy tools, to exclude results that contained 'xkcd' and searching before the comic came out, searching for the exact term ""died in a blogging accident"".  It... didn't work so well; no results were found. Without searching for the exact term, though, results in a bunch of irrelevant results.  So... what was Randall referring to here? What were his two results? Or did he just make the number up on the spot? "
1191,Who are all the Priestesses and Gods?,"In Seanan McGuire's Incryptid series, there are the Aeslin mice, who believe the Price/Healy men are their gods, and the women are their Priestesses. They give them all names (like the Arboreal Priestess (which I think is Verity), the Precise Priestess (Antimony), and the God of Chosen Isolation (Artie, maybe?)  The problem is, it's hard to keep track of all of these. What are all the known names of the Priestesses and Gods, and which character do they match up with? "
1192,In which story does a child survive Hiroshima by diving in a pond?,"I am trying to identify a story about a boy who survived the attack on Hiroshima. My clearest memory is the moment of impact: the boy happens to be outside the city and dives into a pond just before the bomb hits, and so survives the immediate effects of the blast. (1)  After that my memory is hazy:   I'm pretty sure he eventually gets sick and dies I thought he folded a hundred cranes in order to make a wish, but that was a real hibakusha child, Sadako Sasaki, who attempted to fold one thousand before she died.   Perhaps he befriends the historical figure, and she is the one who dies? Perhaps I have misremembered the main character, and she is the one who dives into the pool? (No, she was too young.)    (1)  Apparently plausible. Thanks Mithrandir for the link. "
1193,"Did ""Number Five"" really act differently from his father?","In the story The Fifth Head of Cerberus, the protagonist - whose real name is never mentioned, so I'll just call him ""Number Five"" as his father and aunt do - is essentially an experiment of his father's. Towards the end of the story he learns that he is      a cloned duplicate of his father, in fact part of a long sequence of such duplicates.   The visiting Dr Marsch describes the experiment as like ""relaxation"", in which approximations are made increasingly accurate by iteration. He says that ""Number Five"" and his father are now essentially one individual - an observation which seems supported by the close physical resemblance between them, noted throughout the story and especially strong towards the end.  But the implication of the final part of the story, or at least the implication I picked up, is that ""Number Five"" turns out not to be so much like his father after all. In fact, he      kills his father, and serves long years in a labour camp for this crime.   Was his father expecting this, and did he do the same thing to his own father? By doing what he did, is ""Number Five"" essentially conforming to his father's intent and carrying on the same family tradition? Or did he dramatically diverge from the expected behaviour of his family (and if so, why - what influences on his life made him so different from his father and grandfather?)?  I've only read the story once, and the answer to this important issue has evaded me. But I suspect that a close reading of the text, and especially the parts which refer to the protagonist's father/ancestors and his relationship with them, will provide enough evidence to piece together the answer. "
1194,Was CS Lewis referencing the uncanny valley?,"I recently learned about the concept of the uncanny valley, and it immediately reminded me of the following passage from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, Chapter 8 (emphasis mine):     ""No, no, there isn't a drop of real human blood in the Witch.""   ""That's why she's bad all through, Mr Beaver,"" said Mrs Beaver.   ""True enough, Mrs Beaver,"" replied he, ""there may be two views about humans (meaning no offence to the present company). But there's no two views about things that look like humans and aren't.""   ""I've known good Dwarfs,"" said Mrs Beaver.   ""So've I, now you come to speak of it,"" said her husband, ""but precious few, and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that's going to be human and isn't yet, or used to be human once and isn't now, or ought to be human and isn't, you keep your eyes    on it and feel for your hatchet.""   Was CS Lewis making a deliberate reference to the philosophical concept of the ""uncanny valley?"" For that matter, did the latter idea even exist back then - and if not, did it have a precursor, a related philosophical idea known about in Lewis's day, which did inspire him to write this? "
1195,Why is there only one of this person in Dark Matter by Blake Crouch?,"In the book 'Dark Matter' by Blake Crouch, the central plot theme is a 'box' that creates quantum superposition (see Schródinger's cat) such that, every time you make a decision, an alternative universe branches off from the one you are in. As we constantly make decisions, the alternative universes (multiverse) that are created are infinite.  In the book, many versions of 'Jason' are created by the 'original' Jason in his trips through the box. However, there is only one version of Jason2 who originally kidnapped Jason1 and started the whole ball in motion.  Shouldn't the 'final' universe they end up in be completely awash with an infinite amount of Jasons and Jason2s? After all, Jason2 made choices all the way through, yet we only ever meet one of him.  I realise that infinite numbers of protagonists in a story will be a) confusing &amp; b) difficult to write but I was wondering if there was a scientific reason for this? "
1196,"Why are ""last choices"" necessary in David Mitchell's Slade House?","In Slade House, by David Mitchell, the twins work complex illusions to tempt their prey into the attic of their house before consuming their souls. The intended victims, however, are always given opportunities to back out and escape and are given a ""last choice"" just before the soul sucking commences.  Why are they given these choices? The twins are obviously outsiders and pretty much independent. So, why don't they simply kidnap people and get on with it?  I'm looking for an 'in-universe' answer. "
1197,Is there any merit to reading the Poirot novels in order?,"Curtain is Poirot's last case and for fear of spoilers I have not looked up whether it is his last case because he dies.  I intend to read it only after I have read all the other novels featuring him.  However I recently realised that Curtain was published posthumously and am now wondering if that is the reason that it is Poirot's last case.  So, is there any merit to reading the Poirot books in order? Or does it not matter which you read when as long as Curtain is last? Or does it not matter at all? "
1198,Is religion still an important factor in the world of Fahrenheit 451?,"There are several cases in Fahrenheit 451 where it is clear that Christianity, while evidently extremely rare, is still heard of. For instance, Faber notes that Jesus is still known, though in a much different form than before:     ""It's as good as I remember. Lord, how they've changed it - in our 'parlours' these days. Christ is one of the 'family' now. I often wonder it God recognizes His own son the way we've dressed him up, or is it dressed him down? He's a regular peppermint stick now, all sugar-crystal and saccharine when he isn't making veiled references to certain commercial products that every worshipper absolutely needs.""   At the same time, the Bible (a copy of which Montag saved from a house before it was burned) is evidently no longer read, and certainly not held in any high importance.  This is highlighted when Mildred asks Montag, ""Who's more important, me or that Bible?""  Is religion at all a factor in the society, and if so, has it played a role in keeping old literary fables and stories alive, if only in the oral tradition? Has Christianity - or other religions - been a source of conflict and rebellion against the overwhelmingly anti-literary world? "
1199,Were all of Shakespeare's plays fully in iambic pentameter?,"Were the plays within The Complete Works of Shakespeare entirely in iambic pentameter?  I seem to recall singing bits (when there were lyrics) from Twelfth Night and definitely from Much Ado About Nothing, which were not in that metric form.  However, it could be the way that I had strung the lyrics together so that I could stress the rhyming words - unlike the lines I spoke.    Are Shakespeare's plays completely in iambic pentameter? "
1200,How does Shakespeare's iambic pentameter work with Original Pronunciation?,"In school, students are often taught about iambic pentameter via Shakespearian examples.  These, however, were based on the Received Pronunciation (RP) reading of Shakespeare's works. In reality, Shakespeare used an entirely different pronunciation, replete with differences which removed syllables relative to Received Pronunciation.  Take the first stanza of Romeo and Juliet:     Two households, both alike in dignity,   In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,   From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,   Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

1201,"In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, what is the purpose of this character's resurrection?","(Massive spoilers on the book follow).  Toward the end of Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell, a nameless character appears before Childermass and performs various feats of magic, including bringing Vinculus back to life. He then vanishes and is not mentioned again.  I had always presumed this nameless character was John Uskglass, the Raven King. But the episode has always bothered me because I can't understand its significance. It adds nothing to the plot - Vinculus being raised by ""unknown forces"" would have served just as well - and feels like a nagging loose end introduced to no great purpose.  Given the literary skill exhibited in other aspects of the novel's construction, I doubt that this is true. So: is the nameless magician John Uskglass? And what is the significance of his reappearance in terms of the novel's themes and story?  "
1202,How did having a full pot of tea betray the doctor's lowly origins?,"Memoires of gedenkschriften van minister Pieter Bas (The memoirs of Minister Pieter Bas) is a satirical biography of a fictional Minister of Education. The book is mostly about the man's youth in the second half of the 19th century. The book was first published in 1937.  Early in the book, the author describes the social status of various members of the future Minister's hometown of Dordrecht, and how some of them fell down the social ladder.  Translating from Dutch:     Well-known is the case of doctor Jolles. His whole life had been one masterful tactic to hide the fact that his father had been a butcher. He married the daughter of Bille, he bought a house at the Wijnandt Bridge; and slowly ascending via the tax receiver, past the apothecary, past Boddens, yes past Venemeyer, he found himself in the space between Sanders and Simons, and would soon have been allowed to tap Simons' shoulder, saying: ""Would you come to me, Jan, tonight?"" when that fatal event happened on the card-playing evening of Mrs Beekman.   ""Do you want more tea, doctor?"" Mrs Beekman had said (she spoke those words at the window, according to others however she stood on the doorstep). ""No"", Jolles had answered laughing, ""I still have a full pot at home"".   The moment he said this, he went pale. But it was too late. His life's work was destroyed. He fell deep beneath the tax receiver, still made a few attempts to get out of this swamp until death surprised him.    The author goes on to suggest that death was a release, after this fall from grace.  The work is highly satirical, and the paragraph can be seen as poking fun at the value people ascribe to social status.    It seems that both Jolles and Simons are medical doctors. Since it is set in the late 1800s, and written in 1937, it makes sense that a lowly origin affects Dr. Jolles' status, putting him below Dr. Simons in the eyes of the other people of status in town.  There doesn't seem to be much analysis of the book; most of what's on the internet is written by school children reading it as homework. (Here, in Dutch and here, also in Dutch).  The question is, how does having a pot full of tea at home betray his lowly origins and cause his fall from grace? Since the work is satirical, there may be a joke here that is lost on 21st century readers? The best we could think of is that it somehow showed him being too frugal to be a part of high society; but we were unable to establish if that was the case. "
1203,Has Robert Frost ever written a poem that doesn't rhyme?,"I know a few of Robert Frost's poems, though I'm not an expert, and I've noticed that they all have long and elaborate rhyme schemes.  Is this true for all of his poems?  Has he ever written a poem that didn't rhyme consistently (have a rhyme scheme)? "
1204,Do Daniel Handler's novels for adults share themes or tone with his Lemony Snicket work?,"Daniel Handler's A Series of Unfortunate Events, written under his Lemony Snicket pseudonym, delves into a great many intriguing themes -- the blindness and dysfunctionality of modern society; living with uncertainty and incomplete information; the ambiguity of moral judgments; society's tendency to clash and schism. These themes are constant and developed throughout the series.  In addition, there is a very distinct tone that Handler maintains in all his Snicket work -- quirkiness, idiosyncrasy, and dark, deadpan humor.  Do Handler's work aimed for adults, have similar themes and/or tone? Or are they extremely different, in nature? "
1205,"Where was the phrase ""behind the wind"" first used?","In Millennium: A History of the Last Thousand Years, chapter 4 (""The World Behind the Wind""), the second-to-last sentence:     On the evidence of the events of the fifteenth century, in the world east of the Bay of Bengal—the world ""behind the wind"", as Arab navigators called it—China could have [...]   There's more to the sentence, but it's not relevant to this question (it's about why China didn't end up conquering Europe).  The part I'm interested in is the ""the world 'behind the wind', as Arab navigators called it"".  Where was this term first used in a literary work? The author quotes Arab navigators, but which one and when? "
1206,"Interpreting the line ""'O keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men"" in The Waste Land","I'm hoping to get some insight into line 74 of The Waste Land (you can read The Waste Land online). Here's the passage in question (line 74 is in bold):     That corpse you planted last year in your garden,   Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?   Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?   Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,   Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!   There are a number of things going on in this passage. One interpretation is that this section is describing a fertility rite of sacrificing a victim and burying in them in the fields to guarantee a good crop. The dog comes in because you don't want the corpse you burried to be dug up: that ruins the power of the ritual.  At the same, line 74 seems to be an allusion to John Webster's play The White Devil, which contains a very similar line: ""But keep the wolf far thence, that’s foe to men, / For with his nails he’ll dig them up again."" I'm not quite sure how to interpret the contradiction between the wolf in Webster's poem, which is a ""foe to man"", and the dog in The Waste Land which is a ""friend to man"". However, the section of The Waste Land that line 74 is in is full of contradictions, such as ""winter kept us warm"" (line 5). All of these contradictions illustrate the irony of modern life.  I'm hoping to get a sense of all the different ways of looking at this line in The Waste Land. Any and all interpretations of this line (so long as they are based on evidence) will be accepted. "
1207,How do we know Humpty Dumpty was an egg?,"As depicted in 1870 by James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs, the nursery rhyme ""Humpty Dumpty"" goes as follows:     Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,   Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.   All the king's horses and all the king's men   Couldn't put Humpty together again   Now, in most if not all illustrations Humpty is portrayed as an egg...     Why is this? Because nothing in the four lines of the rhyme depict him as such...  How do we know Humpty Dumpty was an egg? "
1208,"Why is the Agatha Christie play called ""The Mousetrap""?","The Agatha Christie play The Mousetrap has not only the longest initial run of any play in history (it's been running continuously for nearly 65 years, mostly in the very same building in London), but also an ending which is traditionally kept secret, the audience asked after every performance not to reveal it except to others already in the know.  My question is: why is the play called The Mousetrap? A couple of possibilities come to mind:   The nursery rhyme Three Blind Mice is mentioned several times in the play, so there's already a mice-related theme. (But why Mousetrap rather than say Three Blind Mice as the title?) The play-within-a-play in Shakespeare's Hamlet is also entitled The Mousetrap. This surely can't be a coincidence, but I'm struggling to see any other connection between the two.   Is there any authorial word or other compelling evidence on the reasoning for the play's title? "
1209,Why did Avicenna write his medical textbook in verse?,"Avicenna (980-1037) was a Persian writer and scientist who is regarded as one of the founders of modern medicine. I found it interesting to discover that his textbook on medicine was written in the form of poetry, in a verse form as well as a prose form. Why was this?  Was it a common practice in Persian literature of the time to write scientific textbooks as poems? Either way, what was the reason - to make the writing more entertaining / likely to hold the reader's attention, or for a sense of aesthetic beauty, or what? "
1210,"Are these quotes from Orwell's 1984 similes, metaphors, or something else?","   Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice.   I thought metaphor, but it's the ""seemed"" that's throwing me off.  It's not quite 'something IS something else' (i.e. his 'entrails turned into ice'), but then it's not as comparative as 'like/as' (i.e. his 'entrails were like ice'/'entrails went as cold as ice').  There's a quote straight after where Julia's red cheeks are described as:     as though unconnected with the skin beneath   I'm posed with a similar problem with the 'though'. I don't think it's a simile because there's no comparison - simply an extension of the idea that her 'cheekbone stood out sharply'. But it is metaphorically(?) saying she jumped out of her skin - is it?  Any ideas?  "
1211,What's going on in Charlotte Riddell's Old House in Vauxhall Walk?,"Maybe I'm looking too hard for meanings that aren't there, but can someone explain to me what's going on in Charlotte Riddell's Old House in Vauxhall Walk? How was the second burglar caught? What was up with the rattle? How did the mirror get broken? What story did William tell Graham that he never knew before? I feel these questions mean I just didn't get the whole thing, so I'd appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction. "
1212,Meaning of “I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I couldn't do”,"From Christina Aguilera - ""Hurt"":      I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I couldn't do.   What does it mean?

1213,"Source of the quote ""The only bad question is an unasked one""?","There are many variations on this phrase, but is there an original source which inspired the others, or is it just a piece of popular wisdom that's emerged naturally from humanity?  Wikipedia has a page ""No such thing as a stupid question"", Goodreads attributes ""The only stupid question is the question that is never asked"" to Ramon Bautista, and a Quora user attributes there is no such thing as a stupid question"" to Albert Einstein, but none of them has any good citation for an original source. Is there one? "
1214,Why do the Watches bother with anything if the whole system is designed to be balanced?,"The basis of the interactions between the Watches seems to be to keep the balance in their powers: whatever one side does, it must allow the other to counteract. Thus the Night Watch/Inquisition/Day Watch system - to prevent any side from getting too strong and taking over the world. I.e. this is a sort of a zero sum game, where an advantage gained by one faction is compensated by providing the other side with an equal advantage (e.g. every Other has a certain allowance of applications of magic they can use every year).   This brings the question: why even bother trying to get the upper hand over the other faction? A striking example is Nadya, whom the Light ones designed to be the messiah of light, the most powerful sorceress in the history of ever. As Gesar later tells Anton, she came at a price - a ""credit"" or a ""loan"" taken from the Dark ones, meaning the latter had to be allowed to do something equally powerful.  Why do the Others keep playing this game? It always plays out in such a way that the two major factions remain at the same level, even if they gain a temporary advantage, except the stakes keep getting bigger (think Nadya, she saw said to be able to destroy the Twilight and the Earth).

1215,"What caused English intellectuals to be ""ashamed of their own nationality"", according to George Orwell?","Gary Gibbon, First-class BA History (Balliol College, Oxford). Breaking Point: The UK Referendum on the EU and its Aftermath (Haus Curiosities). p. 63.     &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  And then there is English nationalism. Defining yourself as    English rather than British was one of the most accurate indicators of    a Brexit vote.But what is English identity? It is not like other    nationalisms. A Scottish Nationalist might resent Edinburgh a bit but    nothing like an English nationalist will loath London and, to his or    her mind, what it stands for. The common identifiers of someone    describing themselves as    p. 64     English more than British will be a sense    that they are not doing very well, struggling perhaps. They will    usually look at the pace of change and migration and feel it is ""time    to put people like me first"".    It is often linked to a sense that life    would be better if the clock could be turned back. Five years ago,    Peter Kellner delved into the issues and found that ""English"" voters    overwhelmingly wanted their country to withdraw from the world    and that international agreements were more trouble than they were    worth compared with ""British"" voters who were much more evenly    divided between internationalists and isolationists.14   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Labour MP Tristram Hunt has been at the forefront of    Labour attempts to get in touch with English sentiment. He's    recalled George Orwell's admonishment back in 1941 that [1.] England    was ""the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their    own nationality. [2.] In Left wing circles it is always felt there is    something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman."" [mine] But those    Labour souls that struggled to find an English nationalism they could    identify with are struggling even more after June's referendum.    Fintan O'Toole in The Irish Times wrote straight after the    referendum: ""England has not had the time, nor made the effort, to    develop an inclusive, civic, progressive nationalism. It is left with a    nationalism that is scarcely articulated in positive terms at all and    that thus plugs into the darker energies of resentment and    xenophobia. 15     Please expound 1? What are the reasons of the shame? Please expound 2?   I couldn't glean any reasons for this English anti-intellectualism from /r/quotesporn, Quora, or The King's Review.  "
1216,"Who or what is the subject of Andrea Bocelli's ""Gloria the Gift of Life""?","""Gloria the Gift of Life"" is a song by Andrea Bocelli. It's beautiful, but I can't quite figure out what it's about.    It seems like it could be God. ""Gloria"" is a traditional Catholic exaltation to God (""I raise my voice to sing"") and the first few lyrics express gratitude for a variety of phenomena:     For the air we breathe   For the tears we cry   For every melody   For the times we break   Even when we bleed   For the morning sun   Some of the other lyrics seem very inapt in this context, though: ""You were just a child/ only yesterday/ and now here you are/ here on your wedding day."" That's not something a believer would say about God.  It could be about a child (named Gloria, even). But why would you thank your child for ""the air we breathe,"" and things like that?  It could be a romantic love song, certainly, since that is Andrea Bocelli's best-known genre. But somehow that doesn't seem quite right for a song about a child grown up, and, similar to the previous point thanking one's partner for things like the ""the air we breathe"" or ""the morning sun"" seems a little off.    Who is the subject of the song? Is there a clue in the lyrics? Has Andrea Bocelli mentioned anything about this?  "
1217,"Is ""Hyperdimension Warp Record"" parodying/referring to a particular anime?","The short story ""Fandom For Robots"", written by Vina Jie-Min Prasad for Uncanny magazine,1 concerns a robot entering into the fandom of a particular anime TV series. As a member of an online sci-fi/fantasy community myself, I can tell that this is a broadly accurate depiction of such fandoms in general. But as someone with absolutely no knowledge of anime, I have no idea if the fictional series  Hyperdimension Warp Record, or HyperWarp, is a thinly-veiled reference to some particular real anime series, or if it's just meant to be a generic portrayal based on anime fandom as a whole.  From the text of the story (which you can read in full online):     Hyperdimension Warp Record (超次元 ワープ レコード Chōjigen Wāpu Rekōdo, literal translation: Super Dimensional Warp Record) is a Japanese anime series set in space in the far future. The protagonist, Ellison, is an escapee from a supposedly inescapable galactic prison. Joined by a fellow escapee, Cyro (short for Cybernetic Robot), the two make their way across the galaxy to seek revenge. The targets of their revenge are the Seven Sabers of Paradise, who have stolen the hyperdimensional warp unit from Cyro’s creator and caused the death of Ellison’s entire family.      Episode seven of HyperWarp comes with the revelation that the Second Saber, Ellison’s identical twin, had murdered their parents before faking her own death. After Cyro and Ellison return to the Kosmogram, the last segment of the episode unfolds without dialogue. There is a slow pan across the spaceship’s control area, revealing that Ellison has indulged in the human pastime known as “crying” before falling asleep in the captain’s chair. His chest binder is stained with blood from the wound on his collarbone. Cyro reaches over, gently using his grabbing claw to loosen Ellison’s binder, and drapes a blanket over him. An instrumental version of the end theme plays as Cyro gets up from his seat, making his way to the recharging bay at the back of the ship. From the way his footfalls are animated, it is clear that Cyro is trying his best to avoid making any noise as he walks.      The credits play over a zoomed-out shot of the Kosmogram making its way to the next exoplanet, a tiny pinpoint of bright blue in the vast blackness of space.      The preview for the next episode seems to indicate that the episode will focus on the Sabers’ initial attempt to activate the hyperdimensional warp unit. There is no mention of Cyro or Ellison at all.   Does this seem to be a reference to a particular real-life anime series?    1 Hat-tip to @BESW for making me aware of this story in the first place. "
1218,Why could Cú Chulainn not recognise his own son?,"I was reading WB Yeats play On Baile's Strand in which the protagonist Cú Chulainn kills a young man whom he later recognizes as his son. How did he not recognize him earlier? Fintain, a character in the play says of the victim's mother:     I overheard her telling that she never had but one lover, and that he   was the only man who overcame her in battle.   I couldn't find any such event in the play. Can anyone throw some light on this? "
1219,Are there female Alphas?,"All of the Alpha characters I can think of--Bernard, Helmholtz, Mustapha Mond, the DHC, Henry Foster--are men. And none of the female characters seem to be Alphas. Lenina is probably a Beta. Linda is stated to be a Beta-Minus. Fanny Crowne is probably also a Beta or Beta-Minus since she works in the Fertilizing Room and it seems like all the technicians at the Hatchery are Betas (Linda worked in the Bottling Room).  There's some minor circumstantial evidence against the existence of female Alphas; at the beginning of Chapter 4 it says ""The lift was crowded with men from the Alpha Changing Rooms"", as if the Alpha Changing Rooms are all-male. But the door Lenina opens towards the start of Chapter 3 just says ""Girls' Dressing-Room"", not ""Beta Girls' Dressing-Room"". I'm not entirely convinced by this, though.  Do we know if female Alphas exist? Can we infer their existence or non-existence from evidence in the book? "
1220,"Why does Shelby Foote use the phrase ""airline miles"" in The Civil War: a Narrative?","In The Civil War: a Narrative, Shelby Foote periodically uses the phrase ""airline miles"" to mean ""distance on a straight line."" I can't recall offhand hearing this phrase anywhere else; why this phrase?  Commercial air travel was still fairly new then. The first volume was published in 1958, the same year as the introduction of the Boeing 707, which was the first commercially successful passenger jet. Was that an influence at all? "
1221,"Why did Volume 3 of ""The Civil War: A Narrative"" take so long to write?","The Wikipedia page on The Civil War: a Narrative says the following about the publication history:     In 1964 [Shelby Foote] began Volume 3, Red River to Appomattox, but found himself repeatedly distracted by the ongoing events in the nation and was not able to finish and publish it until 1974. Writing the third volume took as many years as had the first two combined.   Were these ""ongoing events"" primarily the Vietnam War, or did it include other events as well? Why were these events distracting to him? "
1222,"Is the impenetrability of Chapter 14 of Ulysses deliberate, or a consequence of its stylistic pastiches?","Chapter 14 of Joyce's Ulysses, The Oxen of the Sun, frequently changes writing styles as it unfolds. Joyce was attempting to mimic the development of the English language, from its Latin roots through to modern-day street slang.  Many of these passages are extremely difficult to understand. Here's an example modelled on the work of early Roman historians:     Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitable by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature's incorrupted benefaction.    Here's another, which mimics the work of Aelfric, a 10th century Anglo-Saxon writer:     Before born babe bliss had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.   My question is this: not being familiar with the overwhelming majority of historical styles employed, it is not clear to me whether or not the incomprehensibility of the text is a consequence of the style it's mimicking? Or to put it another way, could Joyce have attempted this literary history lesson while leaving the text easier for the reader to follow? "

1224,Short Story about Lady (Teacher?) caught skinny dipping by kids,"I recall long ago hearing or reading a story, (30-40 years ago?) (maybe a short story, or a tale or joke told in a story)  Country setting: Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn or Little House on the Prairie type environment.  Young Lady (School Teacher?) is Skinny Dipping (swimming nude) in the local watering hole or stream or pond.  A group of young teens (Some of her students?) come along a see her and start spying on her, but she quickly sees them. She tries telling/asking them to leave but they wont, and they start messing with her clothes she left on the shore.  She starts getting mad and yelling at them to go away, but they come even closer, so she is moving around trying to keep them from seeing her body in the water. While she is moving she bumps into something on the bottom. Feels it and realizes its an old washtub.  Now she has something to cover herself with, she pulls it up and holds it in front of her and charges up on shore. Chasing the kids around the clearing who have her clothes, and telling them to leave.  About this time, she says something like ""You kids know what I think...?"" And the kids reply something like ""Yeah, you think there is a bottom in that washtub"" "
1225,Is The Owl Service sexist in its negative portrayals of women?,"Alan Garner's novel The Owl Service has a small cast of characters, three of whom are female. On reflection, all three appear to be portrayed in a rather negative light.   Alison is something of a passive, empty vessel, who rarely states any desires of her own and, in the course of the novel, is to some extent ""possessed"" by the vengeful Blodeuwedd. Nancy is an angry and bitter woman who, although there is some justification for her ill-temper, takes it out by ill-treating her son. ""Mother"" is not an active character in the novel, and is never given a name, but is a constant background presence. Other characters are motivated to satisfy her sometimes irrational desires, implying she is neurotic and petulant.   Furthermore there is Blodeuwedd herself, whose fury powers the entire plot of the book and cannot ever seem to be satisfied, in spite of the implied deaths of many men down the centuries.  Does the lack of any positive female role models make the book sexist? If not, why not? "
1226,"What does ""that most limited of all specialists"" mean here?","I am reading The Great Gatsby, and encountered these sentences:     There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to   be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen   volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they   stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,   promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and   Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other   books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a   series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and   now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become   again that most limited of all specialists, the ""well-rounded man.""   This isn't just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at   from a single window, after all.         F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby, Chapter 1      The narrator Nick moved into West Egg, and determined to read many books on banking and securities, as well as literary works, in order to become the ""well-rounded man.""   In this part, I could not understand especially what ""limited"" means. Does it indicate that the well-rounded men have limited knowledge compared to other specialists? Or does it indicate that the well-rounded men are so rare compared to other specialists?   And I also could not grasp how the concept that the well-rounded man was limited leads to the epigram that life is more successfully viewed from a single window. I think the well-rounded man has many windows, for he knows about everything albeit shallowly, so I couldn't see the connection here. Or, is the author being ironic here, saying that the well-rounded man is a failure because he has so many windows from which he looks out at life?  In short, I would like to know how the well-rounded men are ""limited"" and how the concept of being a well-rounded man is connected to looking at life from a single window.  I would very much appreciate your help.  "
1227,"Indeed, why doesn't the City have any great artists?","The city is an interesting place - an ensemble of people from all around the world, and even from different times (though the 20th century seems to be prevalent).  Their occupations, genders, beliefs, and everything else seems to be as diverse as possible, except one thing: there just aren't any great, or probably even decent, artists. Writers, actors, painters, film directors - all mediocre at best, while there are certainly great engineers and scientists (""No Mendeleevs, but on a solid international level"").   Why is that? Given the whole novel is a reflection on the life of the authors in the Soviet Union (it is, isn't it?), why are there no great artists in that world? Are they not chosen to be invited there, or what? "
1228,"What does ""the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty"" mean here?","I am reading The Great Gatsby, and came to be curious as to what ""the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty"" means in the following sentences:     His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his   imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The   truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his   Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if   it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father's   business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So   he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy   would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to   the end.         F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby, Chapter 6      The young Gatsby found his humble family background unsatisfactory; that was why he began to imagine himself as somebody different, divine. Thus he started to reach for a higher goal in his life, such as earning a huge amount of money or winning Daisy's love.  But I could not understand especially what ""the service of"" meant. Does it mean that he provided such beauty? Or that he believed in such beauty?  And since ""His Father's business"" has some Biblical undertone in it, I would like to know whether the boldfaced phrase also has such a tone in it. I am not much knowledgeable when it comes to the Bible, so I would like to know whether there is some description that Jesus serviced some beauty, just like Gatsby, because I think that could give me some hint as to what was indeed ""a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.""  I would very much appreciate your help.  "
1229,"What does ""The none too savory ramifications by which"" mean here?","I am reading The Great Gatsby, and came to be curious as to the meaning of ""ramifications"" and ""by which"" in these sentences:     Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,   of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The   transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire   found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,   suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him   from his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye,   the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and   sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid   sub-journalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable   shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny in   Little Girl Bay.         F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby, Chapter 6      The narrator Nick is telling how Gatsby first came into being. Before he became Gatsby, he was named James Gatz; but when he met Dan Cody, who would start him in business and leave him inheritance, he decided to change his name to Jay Gatsby. When he met Gatsby, Dan Cody was soft-minded and was liable to be swayed by women.  In this part, I could not understand what ""ramifications"" and ""by which"" meant. Are the ramifications some flaws in his character derived from his soft-mindedness? Or the negative results, or rumors, caused by the fact that Ella Kaye pushed him out to the sea?  And I would also like to know what ""by which"" means. Does that mean Ella Kaye played Madame de Maintenon by the none too savory ramifications? If it is the case, what does ""by"" mean here? Did she use, or took the advantage of, the ramifications?  I would very much appreciate your help. "
1230,80s? Infected Man trapped in an Office tower with people trying to kill him,"Paperback Probably from the 80s. Cover may have had the exterior short of an office tower (~20 floors) with a man suspended on a rope swinging outside.  Man goes to his companies office in the tower, (The building is pretty deserted, its either a holiday, or after hours/early morning) He is in a side room (Snack room? Xerox room? Coffee break area?) when he sees armed men walk past toward his office talking on the radio clearly looking for him.  So now he is dodging around up and down to various floors trying to avoid the armed men. He can't call out, (Phone lines are cut) or use the elevator (they have either shut it down or put it in emergency mode where it will only go to the ground floor where they have more men waiting)  Somewhere along the chase he gets rappelling gear (I think from breaking into an Adventure Outfitters Shop office, or taking if from one of the men whom he is able to ambush) and using it to transfer to another floor, by rappelling down the elevator shaft, or the outside of the building. (i.e. they know he is above 16th floor, have men stationed on 15th, so he repels down to 12th to leapfrog past them.  It turns into a Die Hard type situation, with him scrambling around trying to avoid them and/or take them out. (If I recall correctly, except for the team leader, they are not highly trained special forces types, just well trained and armed Security guards.  Why they are after him. From overhearing them, or hearing them talk on a radio he got from one of them he ambushed, or by talking with them over the radio he got from one of them. They tell him why they want him.      Apparently a day or two before the story stats, while visiting a research lab in the course of his job. (or visiting a facility that had a secret research lab) He became infected with a deadly virus. I think an animal got lose and either scratched or bit him or more likely got lose and contaminated some object that he later touched. Because no one at that time he is there realizes he was infected until they review the tapes after he has already left.   .      The virus he has contracted is Lethal, has a short incubation period, a highly contagious period, then after the contagious period stops rapidly breaks down your body and you die a few days later. (ie, 3 days after exposure, you can pass the virus to anyone through contact or fluid exchange (Kissing, splatter with blood, spitting, coughing on them) but that phase only last 2-3 days, after that you can not spread the virus, but your going to be dead in a couple days.   .      I believe the men after him are the security team from the research lab, who are trying to kill him BEFORE he becomes contagious. But do NOT want the authorities know know about the situation. (Lab was doing illegal research?)  "
1231,How does anacrusis simulate a ship's pushing back from dock?,"   [ Source : ] Interestingly, anakrouein or anacrusis is also found in Greek poetry,  where the first syllable is not accented. Being the sea-faring people as they were, starting a poem with anacrusis felt like pushing a ship back from the dock, signalling a start of a voyage.   I don't understand the last sentence overhead. I don't know about Ancient Greek marine navigation, but I'd divine that ships don't always reverse when leaving port? They can leave by dock by going forward and turning away?  "
1232,"What ticked off Soviet bosses about ""Inhabited Island""?","   Нет, конечно. Насколько я помню, мы ничего об этом Супермене и не знали тогда. Я уже писал, что Максим был нашим ответом начальству: не хотите серьезной литературы? Пожалуйста! Вот вам залипуха о приключениях комсомольца 22-го века. Почему-то нам, дуракам молодым, казалось, что мы таким образом способны специально раздражить начальство. Впрочем, начальство, действительно, впало в раздражение, но совсем по другому поводу.        Of course not. As far as I remember, we did not know anything about this Superman. I already wrote that Maxim was our response to the authorities: You do not want serious literature? Here you go! Here you have a pulp about the adventures of a 22-century Komsomol member. For some reason, it seemed to us,  young fools, that in this way we were able to especially annoy our superiors. However, the superiors, indeed, were irritated, but quite for quite a different reason.      Source: Boris Strugatsky Off-Line Interview, 7/2000, Q#26, discussing  why Maksim Kammerer from ""Inhabited Island"" was such a ""superman"".   What exactly was that reason that Strugatsky's ""superiors"" (presumably, publishing/censorship/literature board bosses) were irritated with seemingly wholly pro-Soviet ""Inhabited Island""? "
1233,"Who is Thomas o' Becket"" in Tristram Shandy?","Who is Thomas o'Becket in chapter 2, vol.7 of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman?  In this chapter Tristram says he has never visited St. Thomas at Canterbury before. This Thomas is St. Thomas à Becket. But in the following passage he also says as follows:     So without arguing the matter further with Thomas o’Becket, or any one else—   St. Becket is of course dead at the time when Tristram wrote this. So I wondered if this second Becket is the author's publisher, whose name was also Thomas Becket. Do you think my guess is right, or do you think Thomas à Becket and Thomas o’Becket are the same person?   Below is the whole passage for reference.     ——and I never gave a peep into Rochester church, or took notice of the dock of Chatham, or visited St. Thomas at Canterbury, though they all three laid in my way—— —But mine, indeed, is a particular case——      So without arguing the matter further with Thomas o’Becket, or any one else—I skip’d into the boat, and in five minutes we got under sail and scudded away like the wind.   Thanks! "
1234,Why did the gods decide that Enkidu must die?,"In the Epic of Gilgamesh, a major turning point is the death of Enkidu as a punishment from the gods after he and Gilgamesh slew both Humbaba and Gugalanna. From the modernised Muss-Arnolt translation, Tablet VII:     The great gods Anu, Enlil, Ea, and Shamash held an assembly, and Anu spoke unto Ea thus: ‘Because these two slew the Heaven-Bull, and slew Humbaba, the guardian of the mountains and the Forest of Cedar, one of the two must die.’ Enlil said unto Anu, ‘Let Enkidu die, for Gilgamesh must die not!’ Shamash, however, spoke unto Enlil thus: ‘Was it not by thy order that these men slew the Heaven-Bull and the guardian Humbaba? Why should the innocent Enkidu die for this?’ But Enlil, burning with anger at Shamash, said unto him: ‘Each day thou traveled with them like unto a companion.’   I'm missing the cause of the political undercurrents between these gods. Why is it that killing Humbaba and Gugalanna (at the behest of the gods?) is considered cause for killing one of the two men? Why only one? Why Enkidu and not Gilgamesh? (Could it be that Humbaba and Gugalanna are only an excuse, the real reason being Enkidu's failure to defeat Gilgamesh?)  Is there any more information about this decision, perhaps in a different version of the text, or some context from other passages? "
1235,Fantasy children’s novel about a boy who can’t lie,"I read this book around 2010 and I need help identifying it.  The first scene was of a woman who had just given birth (?, she had her newborn) and it was raining. A wizard (who have been called something else) knocked on her door and she let him in. He was there to give a gift to the child. He was already in a bad mood because of the rain and the mud. The mother was trying to get her son something good and she annoyed the wizard who ‘gifted’ the kid with truthfulness before leaving.  In the next scene (?) the boy is older and having difficulty with his inability to lie. There might be some sort of fair at his town. He talks with his mother and somehow it’s decided he’s going to magic school.  At the magic school (which I think was underground) he is working with another boy, who he is on vaguely antagonistic terms with. They either have to extinguish a flame or make it cold. The kid who can’t lie casts a spell (?) and when he picks up the candle it is cold. The other boy sits on the table and starts screaming because the heat was left behind. He accuses the first boy of doing it on purpose, getting him in trouble (?) from their teacher.  At some point both boys and the original wizard end up in tunnels on a flying carpet being chased by giant worms. (The worms might be purple, but I’m not sure.) I think the original wizard wasn’t very powerful.  I think the cover was yellow and it may have been part of a series. "
1236,"Context of ""swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow""?","   I go, I go; look how I go,   Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.      -- Puck, Act III Scene II, A Midsummer Night's Dream   This is a well-known line from a Shakespeare play, but did Shakespeare invent this simile? Was it already a known phrase in Elizabethan England - or at least, was there a saying about Tartar bows shooting fast? Did Tartar bows shoot faster than others? How much were the English even aware of the Tartars at that point in history - had they had much contact with them, or seen them in war?  Is there any historical context behind Shakespeare's use of this phrase? "
1237,What is the origin of the trope of an evil character whose name is not permitted to be spoken?,"Many works of fantasy involve an evil leader or ""dark lord"" whose real name is known but usually not permitted to be spoken, either by his own followers (out of respect?) or by others (out of fear?) or both.   In the Wheel of Time series, the Dark One's true name is Shai'tan, but nobody uses the name, either Darkfriends or good people, for fear of attracting unwanted attention from him. In the Harry Potter series, Voldemort is referred to by such names as You-Know-Who, He Who Must Not Be Named, or (by his followers) the Dark Lord. In the Lord of the Rings, Sauron does not permit his name to be used by his followers. (I'm not exactly sure why and have asked a related question about that.)   What is the origin of this trope? Many fantasy tropes spring originally from Tolkien, but this one feels older. It feels similar to the Jewish belief that one must not speak the name of God, although different because this is specifically about evil characters. I couldn't find any analogous belief about Satan in any major religion, but my gut feeling says this idea might well come from real-world religion or mythology rather than being a thing purely of fantasy literature.

1238,"John Betjeman’s ""Suicide on Junction Road Station after Abstention from Evening Communion in North London""","John Betjeman’s poem ‘Suicide on Junction Road Station after Abstention from Evening Communion in North London’ was first published in the collection Continual Dew (1937). It’s short enough to quote in its entirety:     With the roar of the gas my heart gives a shout—       To Jehovah Tsidkenu the praise!   Bracket and bracket go blazon it out       In this Evangelical haze!      Jehovah Jireh! the arches ring,       The Mintons glisten, and grand   Are the surpliced boys as they sweetly sing       On the threshold of glory land.      Jehovah Nisi! from Tufnell Park,       Five minutes to Junction Road,   Through grey brick Gothic and London dark,       And my sins, a fearful load.      Six on the upside! six on the down side!       One gaslight in the Booking Hall   And a thousand sins on this lonely station—       What shall I do with them all?   What is this poem about? What is the significance of the three Hebrew phrases starting “Jehovah”? What are “Mintons”? Why does the speaker abstain from communion and commit suicide? Why Junction Road? Is the poem sincere or satirical? If satirical, what is its target? "
1239,Is there any special significance in Dr. Rutenspitz's last words to Mr. Golyadkin?,"Throughout The Double by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, there had been hints that maybe Mr. Golyadkin Jr., the double, was a product of Mr. Golyadkin Sr.'s imagination — and that it was either a way to signify him struggling to reconcile two facets of himself, or that he was simply suffering from some sort of mental disorder. Right at the end, it's made clear that it's most likely the latter, given that the last chapter pretty much describes Mr. Golyadkin having a psychotic/mental breakdown. Furthermore, a few chapters before that Mr. Golyadkin pulls a vial of medicine out of his pocket (even though he seems confused by it, and maybe thinks it's poison...?), which means he'd been presumably diagnosed with something beforehand too.  Right at the end of The Double, Mr. Golyadkin is taken by his friend, Dr. Krestyan Ivanovitch Rutenspitz, in a carriage, presumably to an asylum. As I mentioned before, the last chapter describes what seems like a psychotic or mental breakdown. However, the very last words spoken by Krestyan Ivanovitch seem to confirm something for Mr. Golyadkin (my highlight):     “You get free quarters, wood, with light, and service, the which you deserve not,” Krestyan Ivanovitch’s answer rang out, stern and terrible as a judge’s sentence.      Our hero shrieked and clutched his head in his hands. Alas! For a long while he had been haunted by a presentiment of this.      Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1846). The Double, chapter 13. Translated by Constance Garnett (1945). 1   Is there any special significance to this sentence?  Does it make Mr. Golyadkin aware of his mental condition?  Or does it just confirm his paranoia that people are out to get him, given that he sees the doctor as ""a terrible Krestyan Ivanovitch"" once inside the carriage?    1 I read The Double in another language, so I quoted it in Garnett's English translation. If there's a better/more accurate translation, please edit the question to replace this one. "
1240,What are T. S. Eliot’s “Jellicle Cats” and “Pollicle Dogs”?,"T. S. Eliot’s poem ‘The Song of the Jellicles’ was first published in Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats (1939) and was popularized by Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Cats. It begins:     Jellicle Cats come out to-night   Jellicle Cats come one come all:   The Jellicle Moon is shining bright—   Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball.      T. S. Eliot (1939). ‘The Song of the Jellicles’. Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. London: Faber and Faber.   Another group of curiously named animals in the book are the “Pollicle Dogs”:     But a terrible din is what Pollicles like,   For your Pollicle Dog is a dour Yorkshire tyke      T. S. Eliot (1939). ‘The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles’. Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. London: Faber and Faber.   What are “Jellicle Cats” and “Pollicle Dogs”? Where do these names come from? "
1241,"Is there any significance to the name ""friends of Lilith"" in Simone Kern's ""The Propagator""?","Simone Kern's ""The Propagator"" is set in a future where abortion is illegal, and anyone who tries it is persecuted for ""reproductive crimes"". During the story, we learn about the ""friends of Lilith"", who are a group of underground folks who help people with abortion, and the phrase ""visiting Lilith"", which refers to attempting to get an abortion.     Suddenly it clicks. Friend of Lilith. “She’s gone to see a friend of Lilith.” That’s what kids would say when someone met a doctor at a sunken home, late at night, maybe never to emerge. “She tried to visit Lilith.” That meant one of our classmates was in the hospital for eating a box of laxatives. Or digging inside themselves with an unbent coat hanger.   Is there any significance in invoking the name ""Lilith""? Was it simply an arbitrary choice, or is there something deeper here? "
1242,"What are the thousand churches in ""In your eyes""?","In your eyes by Peter Gabriel contains the following verse:     in your eyes   the light the heat   in your eyes   I am complete   in your eyes   I see the doorway (in your eyes) to a thousand churches   in your eyes   the resolution (in your eyes) of all the fruitless searches   What is the ""doorway to a thousand churches"" referring to?

1243,"What does it mean to say ""the future of the English language is grand but as far as its literature is concerned it seems bleak""?","An English professor commented that ""the future of the English language is grand but as far as its literature is concerned it seems bleak"".  How can this sentence be interpreted? What exactly is the difference between language and literature? I know that language is primarily spoken and literature is primarily written. There is no literature without language and language is being enriched by literature. For example, Shakespeare has enriched the English language immensely. I think Shakespeare's works belong to both literature and language. "
1244,Did Howard Roark contradict Henry Rearden on the purpose of work?,"And Rearden said the following at his trial for the illegal sale of metal:     “You pose as a champion of freedom, but it’s only the freedom to make money that you’re after.”   “Yes, of course. All I want is the freedom to make money. Do you know what that freedom implies?”   “Surely, Mr. Rearden, you wouldn’t want your attitude to be misunderstood. You wouldn’t want to give support to the widespread impression that you are a man devoid of social conscience, who feels no concern for the welfare of his fellows and works for nothing but his own profit.”   “I work for nothing but my own profit. I earn it.”   He also said the following to Paul Larken:     “What do they write about me?”   “Well, you know the stuff. That you’re intractable. That you’re ruthless. That you won’t allow anyone any voice in the running of your mills. That your only goal is to make steel and to make money.”   “But that is my only goal.”   “But you shouldn’t say it.”   “Why not? What is it I’m supposed to say?”   On the other hand, compare that to when Howard Roark and Peter Keating were discussing the Cortlandt project:     “Well? Go on. I want you to give me a reason why I should wish to design Cortlandt. I want you to make me an offer.”   “You can have all the money they pay me. I don’t need it. You can have twice the money. I’ll double their fee.”   “You know better than that, Peter. Is that what you wish to tempt me with?”   “You would save my life.”   “Can you think of any reason why I should want to save your life?”   “No.”   “Well?”   “It’s a great public project, Howard. A humanitarian undertaking. Think of the poor people who live in slums. If you can give them decent comfort within their means, you’ll have the satisfaction of performing a noble deed.”   “Peter, you were more honest than that yesterday.” His eyes dropped, his voice low, Keating said: “You will love designing it.”   “Yes, Peter. Now you’re speaking my language.”   Reardon seems to imply that his main motive is money, whereas Roark seems to imply that his love for the work (not the money) is his main motive. What is the reason for the difference here? "
1245,Did the Brotherhood really exist?,"In George Orwell's 1984, there is a mention of a secretive organization named Brotherhood whose main aim is to rebel against the Big Brother, and the Party in general.  In the later part of the prose, we find out that O' Brien was actually working for the Party the whole time in order to find and capture rebels like the protagonist. Does that mean Goldstein's Book, and the Brotherhood itself, were just made up by the Party to achieve the task of separating out the rebels? Or did the Brotherhood really exist at some point? "
1246,"Emily Jane Pfeiffer's ""Evolution""","Emily Jane Pfeiffer’s poem ‘Evolution’ was first published in Poems (1876):     Hunger that strivest in the restless arms       Of the sea-flower, that drivest rooted things       To break their moorings, that unfoldest wings   In creatures to be rapt above thy harms;   Hunger, of whom the hungry-seeming waves       Were the first ministers, till, free to range,       Thou madest the Universe thy park and grange,   What is it thine insatiate heart still craves?   Sacred disquietude, divine unrest!       Maker of all that breathes the breath of life.   No unthrift greed spurs thine unflagging zest,       No lust self-slaying, hounds thee to the strife;   Thou art the Unknown God on whom we wait:   Thy path the course of our unfolded fate.   What is this poem about? What is the significance of “hunger”? How can creatures “be rapt above thy harms”? In what way are waves “hungry-seeming” and “first ministers”? What is “sacred disquietude”? How can greed be “unthrift” and lust “self-slaying”? What is the speaker’s attitude to evolution? "
1247,"Why does the guard call the inmates ""girls"" in ""The Propagator""?","In Simone Kern's short story ""The Propagator"", there's a line where a prison guard for those convicted of ""reproductive crimes"" refers to the inmates as ""girls"":     The guard leaned towards me, and for a moment I thought he was going to arrest me. Like he also knew what was in my rotten heart. But slowly, I processed what he was shouting over the din. “They thought their little ‘protest’ would get them something better than that,” he pointed back at my drones and their rolls of sod.   We stepped through another set of doors into a blessedly quiet corridor, and his voice dropped to a normal volume. “We meet all the legal requirements. Every inmate gets an hour a day of green time, and we have 1 square foot of lawn for every girl. But that wasn’t good enough for them.”   (emphasis added)   Why does this line refer to ""girls""? As we can see directly above, it's not only women who are jailed here:     The inmates were cursing and wailing, kicking the bars and their beds. Many of them were pregnant—women and trans men. I saw one guy, scraggly beard and swollen belly, must’ve been nine months along. He was chained to his bed, sobbing into his hands.   And in any case, these are on the whole grown women, not under 18 girls. So why does this guard refer to them as girls? Is he being anti-trans, or misogynistic, or what? "
1248,"Why do Rachael and Eldon attempt to blackmail Rick in ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""?","In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, at the beginning of the book, Rachael and Eldon Rosen attempt to make a deal with Rick Deckard when Rick thinks the empathy test he was going to use (the Voigt-Kampff scale) to hunt the 8 escaped androids does not work. They will give him a “live” (but actually robot) owl in exchange for his secrecy as to the fallibility of the Voigt-Kampff scale.   Why do they do this? I thought they didn’t want him to kill the androids? Why do they want to send him on his mission using this scale? Do they want him to accidentally kill a human so that bounty hunters lose credibility? Or do they want him to doubt himself so that he ultimately gives up on his hunt, or goes mad? That seems roundabout, I don’t understand why they don’t just blackmail him into not completing his mission or force him to tell his boss that their scale is erroneous.   Obviously it turns out the scale worked fine, but I’m still confused by their actions here. "

1250,"What is the supposed cover story in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy""?","Spoilers for John Le Carré’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.  In this novel, Percy Alleline has become the director of “the Circus”, a fictional British intelligence service. Alleline and the department heads of the Circus (Bill Haydon, Toby Esterhase, and Roy Bland) are running a group of Russian agents, codenamed “Source Merlin”, who communicate by passing their secrets to Aleksey Polyakov, supposedly a cultural attaché at the Soviet Union’s embassy in London. Polyakov passes the secrets to Esterhase at meetings in a house in Camden owned by Alleline:     The Treasury had sanctioned sixty thousand pounds for the freehold and another ten for furniture and fittings. To cut costs, it wanted its own lawyers to handle the conveyance. Alleline refused to reveal the address. For the same reason there was an argument about who should keep the deeds. This time the Treasury put its foot down and its lawyers drew up instruments to get the house back from Alleline should he die or go bankrupt.   Polyakov is actually a spy, and his cover story for the meetings is that Esterhase is his agent in the Circus, and accordingly the Circus carefully selects harmless low-level information (“chickenfeed”) for Esterhase to pass to Polyakov for the latter to put in his reports to “Moscow Centre”:     ‘What I’m asking you is very simple,’ Smiley insisted. ‘Notionally, who is Polyakov’s agent inside the Circus? Good heavens, Toby, don’t be obtuse. If Polyakov’s cover for meeting you people is that he is spying on the Circus, then he must have a Circus spy, mustn’t he? So who is he? He can’t come back to the Embassy after a meeting with you people, loaded with reels of Circus chickenfeed, and say, “I got this from the boys.” There has to be a story, and a good one at that: a whole history of courtship, recruitment, clandestine meetings, money and motive. Doesn’t there? Heavens, this isn’t just Polyakov’s cover story: it’s his lifeline. It’s got to be thorough. It’s got to be convincing; I’d say it was a very big issue in the game. So who is he?’ Smiley enquired pleasantly. ‘You? Toby Esterhase masquerades as a Circus traitor in order to keep Polyakov in business? My hat, Toby, that’s worth a whole handful of medals.’   My question is this. In the Circus’ view, what is Polyakov’s cover story, in his reports to Moscow Centre, for the meetings with Esterhase taking place at a house owned by the director of the Circus? I can see five possibilities, none completely satisfactory:   The Circus has not considered this problem. The Circus believes that Polyakov says in his reports that he meets Esterhase somewhere else. (The problem with this is that Moscow Centre might tail him one day and discover that he has been lying.) The Circus believes that Polyakov tells the truth about the location of the meetings but lies about the nature of the house. (The problem with this is that Moscow Centre might discover that Alleline owned the freehold. The novel is set in the 1970s, well before the Land Registration Act 2002 made it compulsory to register ownership upon purchase, but the seller and both sets of conveyancing solicitors would have known, and it seems risky to depend on their silence for such a delicate operation.) The Circus believes that Polyakov tells the truth about the house but says that Esterhase, as a senior member of the Circus, is able to suppress evidence that the meetings took place there. (The problem with this is that the safe house has a housekeeper, Millie McCraig, and there would need to be a convincing story explaining why her silence could be relied on.) The Circus believes that Polyakov tells the truth about the house but says that Esterhase has a cover story for the meetings, namely that Polyakov is his agent. (There are several problems with this. One, Polyakov would need to be passing “chickenfeed” to Esterhase, in addition to the “Source Merlin” material, to explain how Esterhase is able to make his cover story stick, and there is no hint of this in the novel. Two, Esterhase’s cover story wouldn’t be convincing to the Circus as it wouldn’t explain how Polyakov was able to secretly visit the house, as he points out himself: “But [Polyakov]’s got to pretend to his own people that he’s spying on us. How else does he get away with it? How does he walk in and out of that house all day, no gorillas, no babysitters, everything so easy?” Three, this scenario is too close to the truth.)  "
1251,Are the illustrations part of Shel Silverstein's poems?,"Shel Silverstein's poems are illustrated by himself. The illustrations often provide the 'punchline' of the poem, as in the following examples (all taken from Falling Up. Pictures are mine - feel free to replace them with better ones):  Safe     I look to the left,   I look to the right,   Before I ever   Move my feet.   No cars to the left,   No cars to the right,   I guess it's safe   To cross the street...    This poem is accompanied by this illustration:   This is a safe falling out of the sky onto the girl's head.  Unfair     They don't allow pets in this apartment.   That's not decent, that's not fair.   They don't allow pets in this apartment.   They don't listen, they don't care.   I told them he's quiet and never does bark,   I told them he'd do all his stuff in the park,   I told them he's cuddly and friendly, and yet -   They won't allow pets.   This is accompanied by this charming animal:     Web-Foot Woe     Us swans and geese   Have rotten luck.   You folks don't know   Whose name is whose.   I waddle in -   You all yell ""Duck.""   Can't you see   That I'm a goose?   With this pointed picture:     Imagining     You're only imagining   A mouse is in your hair.   You've got to stop imagining   That mice are everywhere.   I think you're just imagining   To give yourself a scare,   But trust me dear, I wouldn't lie:   There is no mouse up there.   With this slightly surprising picture:       I've made the point; there are more examples.

1252,Why does Zhan Xixi call Jian Yi an idiot?,"I've been re-reading 19 Days - One Day1, a webcomic2 by the Chinese author Old Xian. One of the first chapters has me wondering, though:    Click for full resolution    What does Zhan Xixi mean when he says ""What if...""?  I'm guessing he's afraid Jian Yi slipped and fell, but it's not clear from the further exchange. Why is Jian Yi an idiot?  I'm confused about this one. Firstly, Jian Yi appears to genuinely be taking a shower. Secondly, the bathtub is behind him. Thirdly, there are showers that are supposed to be taken directly on the floor, and the shower thingy appears to be fixed in place. Fourthly, Zhan Xixi tells him he's an idiot. Question - what am I not getting?     1 The manhua can be read here on the translators' Tumblr (posted there with the permission of the author).  2 Chinese comics are called manhua. Read left to right (though I've heard about manhua that are read right to left, I've not seen any). "
1253,"Is it Zhan Zheng Xi, Zhan Zhengxi, or Zhan Xixi?","One of the protagonist of 19 Days - One Day is called Zhan Zheng Xi. Or Zhan Xixi. I'm not sure, because he's been called all three:   Zhan Zhengxi   Zhan Zheng Xi   Zhan Xixi     The first two I can attribute to translation from Chinese to English. What about the third one, Zhan Xixi? Does he have four names, as in ""Zhan Zheng Xi Xixi"", or is it something else?    All images taken from here. "
1254,Why are my answers wrong for this Bacon passage about reading and writing?,"Here is the passage being analysed, from Francis Bacon's essay ""Of Studies"":     Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention. Some books may also be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner sort of books; else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full man, conference a reading man, and writing an exact man. And therefore if a man writes little, he had need have a good memory; if he confers little, he had need have a present wit; and if he reads little, he had need have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not.      Histories make men wise, poets witty, the mathematics subtle, natural philosophy deep, moral, grave, logic and rhetoric able to contend.   And here are the questions I'm expected to answer about this passage:        What is meant by conference?         (A) A meeting where conversation is important   (B) A gathering of people   (C) A get together   (D) A group of people assembled to hear a speaker      What does some books are to be tasted mean?         (A) To be read with diligence and attention   (B) To be read but not curiously   (C) To be read just for fun   (D) To be read only in parts      How must we approach the 'meaner' sort of books?         (A) They are to be read by deputy and extracts made of them by others   (B) They are to be read but not to contradict and confute   (C) They are to be read but only in parts   (D) They are to be read but not curiously      What should be the real object of reading?         (A) Not to contradict and confute   (B) To weigh and consider   (C) To distil the contents   (D) To understand the author's point of view      If a man reads very little, what must he pretend?         (A) He must pretend to have a good memory   (B) He must pretend to have a lot of intelligence   (C) He must pretend to know a lot   (D) He must pretend to be witty             source   The answers I marked are: 2D, 3A, 4B, 5A. However, the correct answers are: 1D, 2A, 3D, 4D, 5C.  Now, my understanding is that the answers I marked are directly from the passage as it is. However, the correct answers seems to be different. Perhaps a great understanding of the passage is required? "
1255,What does the author imply by using the phrase “open to attack” for the element of worship in patriotism?,"Source:  [website]  Patriotism is a very complex feeling, built up out of primitive instincts and highly intellectual convictions. There is love of home and family and friends, making us peculiarly anxious to preserve our own country from invasion. There is the mild instinctive liking for compatriots against foreigners. There is pride, which is bound up with the success of the community to which we feel that we belong. There is a belief, suggested by pride, but reinforced by history, that one’s own nation represents a great tradition and stands for ideals that are important to the human race. But besides all these, there is another element, at once nobler and more open to attack, an element of worship, of willing sacrifice, of joyful merging of the individual life in the life of the nation. This religious element in patriotism is essential to the strength of the State, since it enlists the best that is in most men on the side of national sacrifice.   (Note: This passage appears in Bertrand Russell's Why Men Fight; however, this should not be necessary to understand the passage, which was quoted by itself in the example question linked above.)  The example question asks     What does the author imply by using the phrase “open to attack” for the element of worship in patriotism?   Options are:        This element is unnecessary in some instances of patriotic behaviour    This element will call for various acts of national sacrifice   This element has no historical basis yet it is important    This element can cannot (sic) be justified on rational grounds      The answer key indicates that the last option (the element cannot be justified on rational grounds) is correct.  The analysis is not quite clear to me. I want to know what this sentence actually implies:     here is another element, at once nobler and more open to attack, an element of worship,   "
1256,"How is the connection between the picture on page 59 and the last line of ""Allison Beals and Her 25 Eels"" shown in other publications of the poem?","""Allison Beals and Her 25 Eels"" is a poem in Falling Up by Shel Silverstein. It describes how Allison uses 24 eels -- as shoelaces, earrings, ladle, etc. The 25th, however, is different. The poem ends like this:     The 'lectric one was a lamp that could shine,   And one got a new job on page fifty-nine.   You can see an eel half off the page (bottom left corner):        And then, if you flip back (the poem is on page 98) to page 59, you can see an eel being used as a wire:        So is the page-59 eel shown in other publications of the poem1? If so, how?    1Which, IMO, it should be, as I think it's actually a part of the poem. "
1257,"Were the contributors to ""The SEA is Ours"" all already established authors?","The SEA is Ours is an anthology collection of steampunk stories by various South-East Asian authors, including names such as Olivia Ho, Marilag Angway, and Timothy Dimacali. I know very little about either steampunk or South-East Asian literature, so none of these names were familiar to me; however, a little online searching told me that at least some of them, such as Dimacali, were already well-known authors in the genre, and presumably were asked to contribute for that reason.  Were all of the contributors already established authors? In other words, is The SEA is Ours a collection of short stories by famous authors, the sort of anthology that might advertise itself by ""includes stories from So-and-so!"" - or is it a collaborative effort to create a new thing, a South-East Asian steampunk collection, by a mixed team qualified more by enthusiasm than experience? "
1258,"Do the stories in ""The SEA is Ours"" accurately portray the essential aspects of South-East Asian culture?","The SEA is Ours is this month's topic challenge. The purpose of these challenges is to increase the diversity of the literature that we discuss on this site. This is important for a number of reasons, among them to increase our understanding of cultures other than our own.  Therefore, I'd like to ask if the stories from The SEA is Ours accurately portray South-East Asian culture. I have little to no prior experience with SEA culture, and want to ensure that I'm getting a correct picture from the stories of this anthology (whenever my copy arrives). I understand that culture isn't static, and that part of writing SEA characters and culture into a steampunk world necessitates the creation of something new; however, I imagine that an effort was made to preserve the essence of SEA culture and society in the brave new steampunk world(s) of this collection. If that effort falls short in some manner, I'd like to be alerted about it in advance so that I don't come to misunderstand the culture under discussion.  While an argument could be made that if ""SEA authors are writing SEA steampunk, then it would be difficult for it to not in some way be an authentic representation of SEA culture,"" I know that other efforts by members of a given culture to explain parts of that culture have fallen short in different ways. (See, for example, this part of a conversation in chat regarding Chamorro culture.)  I suppose that the best answers to this question will come from those who have both read the book, and are familiar enough with SEA culture to point to things that were done correctly (or not). Answers that quote reviews from South-East Asians describing the accuracy of the stories are also acceptable.  (I had a conversation about this in chat which may be of use to potential answerers.) "
1259,Why did Morris and Clay preemptively dissolve the Red-Headed League?,"Spoilers ahead for The Red-Headed League.  In this Sherlock Holmes story, Holmes and Watson are recruited by a flustered pawnbroker, Jabez Wilson, who has been tricked into joining a fake society, the Red-Headed League. In reality, the society was just a ruse to get Wilson out of his house between the hours of 10 and 2. Whilst he was out, the criminal John Clay, who had taken a job in Wilson's shop, was digging a tunnel to the nearby bank. Wilson was supervised by Clay's accomplice, William Morris, who acted as the League's enforcer and who served to make sure Wilson never left the offices they had hired for him to use.  When Clay had finished the tunnel, Morris disbanded the League. Wilson came to the office as usual to see a sign that read:     The Red-Headed League is Dissolved   9 October 1890   Holmes is then able to guess the date when the duo plan to carry out their raid on the basis of this announcement.     ""And how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight?"" I asked.   ""Well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr Jabez Wilson's presence - in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come tonight.""   However, wasn't this a daft and reckless move on the part of the criminals? Relieving Wilson of his cushy fake job at the office was sure to arouse his suspicions. Because of Wilson's despair at losing the job he ended up recruiting Holmes, which lead to the foiling of their raid. Wouldn't it have made much more sense simply to leave Wilson to keep his membership of the League until they'd made their escape? He would eventually put two and two together once his assistant disappeared and he stopped getting £4 a week for doing essentially nothing. It seems that they put an awful lot of work into creating this whole charade in the first place. Why didn't they maintain it for just a couple more days?  This misstep certainly doesn't fit with Holmes's judgement that Clay was one of the brightest criminals in London.     ""Smart fellow, that,"" observed Holmes as we walked away. ""He is, in my judgement, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he had not a claim to be the third.""   What can explain the behaviour of Clay and Morris here? "
1260,Why is The Dreaming a simple place compared to Hell?,"In chapter 2 of Season of Mists, Lucifer says the following to Morpheus, when trying to explain his burden of ruling Hell:    I cannot say I see Lucifer's point here. In some of the further stories it is shown that Morpheus has lots of work in The Dreaming, and that it doesn't seem to be easy to rule at all. What does Lucifer mean by ""A simple place - compared to Hell""? "
1261,Who was Long John Silver based on?,"In his little-known preface to Treasure Island (which I discovered while answering this question), Robert Louis Stevenson wrote rather persuasively on the possibilities for how a fictional character might be inspired, whether by a stranger encountered once or by a good old friend:     And then I had an idea for John Silver from which I promised myself funds of entertainment: to take an admired friend of mine (whom the reader very likely knows and admires as much as I do), to deprive him of all his finer qualities and higher graces of temperament, to leave him with nothing but his strength, his courage, his quickness, and his magnificent geniality, and to try to express these in terms of the culture of a raw tarpaulin. Such psychical surgery is, I think, a common way of ""making character""; perhaps it is, indeed, the only way. We can put in the quaint figure that spoke a hundred words with us yesterday by the wayside; but do we know him? Our friend, with his infinite variety and flexibility, we know ― but can we put him in? Upon the first we must engraft secondary and imaginary qualities, possibly all wrong; from the second, knife in hand, we must cut away and deduct the needless arborescence of his nature; but the trunk and the few branches that remain we may at least be fairly sure of.   As soon as I read the first sentence of this quote, I wondered: who was the friend of Stevenson on whom Long John Silver was based? Silver is easily the most interesting character in Treasure Island - a most ""ambiguous rogue"", as I once saw him very accurately described - and it would be very interesting to know who inspired him, especially if it was a famous figure ""whom the reader very likely knows and admires"". "
1262,"Who narrates ""Ars Arcanum"" in The Alloy of Law?","I just finished The Alloy of Law by Brandon Sanderson. As is the norm in many of Sanderson's Cosmere books, the story is followed by a short section titled ""Ars Arcanum,"" with a description of some of the various kinds of magic present on that particular world of the Cosmere. (There's a bit about the naming of this section on Sanderson's blog, here.)  While lazily skimming that section, I noticed that the final sentences read:     It is primarily concerned with things of the Spiritual realm, and is   of the greatest interest to me. If one of these three arts is of great   interest to the Cosmere, it is this one. I think there are great   possibilities for its use.1   Most of the rest of that section was written neutrally, without a specific voice; however, those lines reveal that someone must be speaking. Those last few lines force the weary reader to wake up and pay closer attention to that which he has just read. (At least, that was the effect it had on me.)  Who wrote those lines? Is is Mr. Sanderson himself? Is it Hoid, the world-hopping character who finds himself in many of the Cosmere stories? Is it someone from Scadrial (the world of Mistborn, and The Alloy of Law), or elsewhere in the Cosmere?  (Note: there may be clues in Arcanum Unbounded, but I have yet to read that collection.)    1 I am uncertain of the author's intention, but I feel uneasy about whoever it was that wrote this. I understand that the art described, Hemalurgy, was just described in that appendix as ""not evil,"" but is known only (to me, at this time, at any rate) as an art that requires very bloody (described as ""messy"" in one of the books) murder and implanted metal spikes to function. I would feel uneasy about any character that found Hemalurgy interesting. (At least, more interesting than Feruchemy or Allomancy. Those are clean magics, and feel a lot more fun and wholesome.) "
1263,"Why would one call a Japanese Jew ""Sosumi""?","While doing some background research for another question about Daniel Clowes' Ghost World, I stumbled upon this article, which mentions the following exchange:    . . . I don't get this.  The first thing a search yields for ""sosumi"" is the Apple notification sound, and some further search shows that ""sosumi"" == ""so sue me"", and I don't understand how that is relevant either. There is also the Japanese restaurant in Jerusalem, and a records label.   Neither of those substituted in the joke make it funny, which makes me conclude that I'm missing some context, especially with Enid (probably) being Jewish, and Daniel Clowes comes from a Jewish family as well (and Enid Coleslaw being an anagram of Daniel Clowes, and all that).  So what is the joke? "
1264,What is Number Five's real name?,"In the story The Fifth Head of Cerberus, the protagonist has a name which is never stated explicitly, different from the ""Number Five"" by which his father and aunt refer to him.     I told [my father] my name, but he shook his head. ""Not that. You must have another name for me - a private name. You may choose it yourself if you like.""      I said nothing. It seemed to me quite impossible that I should have any name other than the two words which were, in some mystic sense I only respected without understanding, my name.   We know that it's the same name as his father's:     ""Is that [Number Five] what you call him?""      ""It's more convenient since his name is the same as my own.""   What is his actual name? There are various references dropped through the story which might give us clues about it, but is there enough for us to deduce or at least guess at either of those ""two words"" which form his name? "
1265,"What is happening in issue #1 of ""Black Magick""?","The first issue of Black Magick opens with a pagan ritual being done during full moon. A circle member's phone rings, and the ritual is interrupted, and the following panels take place (behind a spoiler because there is some nudity there, but not too much):         I should also note that those two women really are witches.  Two questions:   What does the gesture with the knife mean? Was it meant to be intimidation, or is it some ritualistic thing? The woman with the knife says     Make sure you ground yourself before you leave.   What is that supposed to mean?  "
1266,Why is Pechorin a hero of our time?,"In Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (Герой нашего времени), the main hero is Grigory Pechorin, a cynical noble army man, an example of superfluous Byronic hero.   The title of the novel has to refer to Pechorin himself - but why? What traits make Pechorin a ""hero""? Or is it a negative description, implying that Pechorin is not a hero?   To me, Pechorin is hardly a hero - he has broken at least two hearts, murdered his friend, after toying with former's love interest, and apparently abducted a Caucasian woman and (inadvertently) caused her death. "
1267,Reading order for Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere,"Brandon Sanderson has plans in place to write many books set in different worlds, but in the same Cosmere. These books include series that have already begun (eg Stormlight Archives, Elantris, Mistborn, and others), and some that have not yet started (eg Aether of Night, Dark One, and Dragonsteel).  What order (if any) should the books be read in? Obviously, books should be read in the proper order within a world, but is there reason to read the books of one world before another?  I do realize that the answer to this question will change an evolve over time as more books are released, but answerers today and in the future should respond according to the best knowledge available to them at the time answered. "
1268,How did the Inklings originate?,"The (original) Inklings were a group of Oxford academics and writers, their most famous members including J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and Hugo Dyson. They used to meet regularly, often at the Eagle &amp; Child pub in Oxford, and read portions of their work to each other. Out of this group came such well-known and influential works as The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia.  My question is: how and why was this group first established? When was it set up? Who were its founding members? Was there any special motivation for it,  and how did it grow to its later glory?    While this question doesn't directly relate to any particular work of fiction, I feel it's very interesting from the point of view of understanding not only the lives of several authors but also the possible effects on their works. After all, feedback received during Inklings meetings may have led to substantial changes to some of the works being read. "
1269,Why was 1984 set in 1984?,Was there any special meaning to the year he chose? I originally thought that he just selected a date in the future but now I am not so sure. Has George Orwell or his editor ever commented on the title? 
1270,Is the nursery rhyme Jack and Jill based on real life events?,"   Jack and Jill went up the hill   To fetch a pail of water.   Jack fell down and broke his crown,   And Jill came tumbling after.        Up Jack got, and home did trot,   As fast as he could caper,   He went to bed to mend his head (or and bound his head)   With vinegar and brown paper.     Alternative second verse:     Up Jack got, and home did trot,   As fast as he could caper,   To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob   With vinegar and brown paper.   Are these lyrics based on true events? Or is it a simple nonsense poem for children? "
1271,Looking for a poem about the (fictionalized) writing of The Canterbury Tales Prologue,"A friend of mine used to quote a poem that told the fictionalized story of Chaucer writing the first lines of the Prologue of The Canterbury Tales:     ""Whan that Aprill with his ... "".       When he gets to the word for ""showers"" he paused and had to choose between the French version of the word and ""shoures"", which is Anglo-Saxon. He chooses ""shoures"", and the English language is launched.  I've been searching all over for where this delightful poem comes from and I can't find it anywhere. Does it ring any bells with you? Can you end my search? "

In particular, what other authoritative commentators, besides Richard Ellmann, provide illuminating insights into said influence and related themes? "
1273,"Should I read the English translation of ""Khasākkinte Ithihāsam"" first, or the original?","O. V. Vijayan translated his Malayalam novel ഖസാക്കിന്റെ ഇതിഹാസം (Khasākkinte Ithihāsam) to English about three decades after it was originally published, with the title The Legends of Khasak. The Wikipedia article, citing P. P. Ravindran as a source, says:     Khasakkinte Itihasam has been translated into ... English ... differing substantially from the original in its sensibility - most   readers prefer to read it as an independent novel by Vijayan in   English rather than seeing it as a translation. [...]      The early Vijayan was marked by deep philosophical doubt and   skepticism, but the later Vijayan upheld certitudes. The Legends of   Khasak was written by the Vijayan of certitudes, which makes it a   very different novel in its sensibility, in spite of being a   translation.   This reminds me of the situation in Should Go Set A Watchman be read before To Kill A Mockingbird?  I can read both languages fairly well, so discounting difficulty in understanding the language itself, which work should I read earlier? The original Malayalam novel, or the English ""translation""?    To underscore the difference in the works, the titles themselves are different. The Malayalam word ഇതിഹാസം is singular, and its plural is ഇതിഹാസങ്ങൾ (Ithihāsangal). Thus, the Malayalam title would be literally The Legend of Khasak, which can be interpreted differently from The Legends of Khasak. The former could mean that Khasak itself is of legend (like in the legend of El Dorado), whereas the latter implies the legends belong to Khasak (like in the legends of England). "
1274,Does Dr. Manhattan have free will?,"In Alan Moore's Watchmen, Doctor Manhattan is a superhero with godlike powers, including the ability to view his past, present, and future simultaneously. Manhattan believes that everything that happens and everything that will happen has been predetermined, and cannot be changed.  My memories of the comic show him to be almost passively compliant with what he's seen and what he's ""supposed to"" do. Earlier in the series, when he's building his city on Mars, he does question ""A world grows up around me. Am I shaping it, or do its predetermined contours guide my hand?"" (Watchmen, chapter IV), implying that he's uncertain about the predetermination of his own actions. However, I think that he later changes his mind, and completely believes that his actions are predetermined. This is supported by several later quotes throughout the story, like the ones below (also on Mars):     Why does my perception of time distress you? [...] Everything is   preordained. Even my responses.      [...]      We're all puppets, Laurie. I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.   Watchmen, chapter IX  He does seem to change his mind several times about his willingness to get involved in the affairs of humanity during that conversation, implying that he has (or believes himself to have) the freedom to choose, but that could simply be because he doesn't know everything all the time (either usually, or now because of the tachyon interference).  Most people read Doctor Manhattan as a god, partly because of his powers and partly because of his detachment and separation from humanity. (There's also that whole creation of life thing going on there at the end.) However, I think it's possible that Manhattan is simply a confused human being with more knowledge and power than he really knows what to do with. I think he's really Jon Osterman underneath his blue skin, but I'm not sure if he thinks that anymore.  Has Doctor Manhattan ever attempted to do anything differently from how he foresaw it? Has he tested his puppet strings? What makes him certain that he lacks free will?  Doctor Manhattan seems to believe that all of his actions have been preordained. Is there any support for this, or its negation, in the story? "
1275,"When did Robert Frost write ""Two Tramps in Mud Time""?","Googling the poem, and utilizing Wikipedia, I could not find the answer to my question. The book I own (""101 Great American Poems"") which contains the poem also does not give the year of its creation - it gives the birth and death years of the featured poets, but not the publication year of the specific poems.  Does anyone know? Or better yet (because I have this question about many poems), how can I find out when a particular poem was written? "
1276,What's the symbolism of the flowers in The Winter's Tale?,"In Act IV, Scene IV of The Winter's Tale, Perdita is ""mistress o' the feast"", playing hostess at the sheep-shearing feast, when King Polixenes and Camillo arrive in disguise. Perdita gives them both flowers, accompanied by the following short speech:     Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,   For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep   Seeming and savour all the winter long:   Grace and remembrance be to you both,   And welcome to our shearing!   But it doesn't end there. She and Polixenes, along with Florizel and Camillo, talk at length about flowers for the next 60-odd lines. (I won't quote all those lines here, since the full text of the play is freely available and easy to find online, for example here.)  When I saw The Winter's Tale performed in the theatre, this conversation was actually cut out, as were some later sections of the sheep-shearing feast in this very long scene. But I remember hearing that the conversation about flowers had some special significance and symbolism relating to the plot.  Is there more to this conversation than just idle chat about flowers? If so, what is the hidden meaning and/or symbolism? "
1277,Is Jack (in Lord of the Flies) actually 'bad'?,"For me, the real 'evil' in The Lord of the Flies was Roger. From the beginning the story shows how he has 'revelations' about how there is no one to stop him bullying and hurting.  Jack, for me, simply goes mad, and the apparent lack of punishment suggests this. Fear, hunger and pride drive Jack to savagery, a way to forget all the bad things (the beast) and to have the power his pride needs. Jack's new way of life allows Roger to unleash the 'badness' in him.  Is my interpretation correct? Or did Golding mean for Roger and Jack to be equally 'bad' and Roger simply the more physical one of the two? "
1278,"Is Irene actually delusional in ""The Famine King""?","At the end of ""The Famine King"", we are given the impression that Irene is delusional and that everything that relates to the windigo is actually just imagined:     “Where did that bruise come from?” Az pointed to my throat. A purplish streak marked the curve below my chin. I understood why she was concerned. It resembled a self-inflicted injury, the impression of a makeshift noose. But much like the face print Mr. Botello left on my childhood window, the bruise was evidence of monsters. Real monsters. During my psychotic thrall, while I imagined wendigo conspiracies, ancient ghosts wrapped a sheet around my neck. I must have faith in my little specks of proof, because the alternative is too terrible. Above all, I fear that my life is one endless hypnopompic nightmare.   However, she seems to believe that it's all real. And there's one thing that makes me suspect that she's not delusional - the opening.  The story opens with Irene having a sleep paralysis vision of her neighbor at her window:     Face pressed against the glass, it said, “Hey, Irene. I have a secret for you. People rarely starve like they used to.” It sounded like a shrill parody of the neighbor, Mr. Botello.      “Go away,” I thought. “Stop.” Though young, I was accustomed to hypnopompic nightmares projected on reality, hallucinated monsters and voices without mouths.      The silhouette withdrew, leaving marks where its skin had touched, where its hot breath had fogged, and where its nails had pawed the cold glass. As it dissolved into the 2 a.m. shadows outside, it called, “The hunger is still here.”      [...]      Sometimes, I heard my tattooed window repeating “the hunger, the hunger, the hunger” behind its curtain shroud.   However, that same neighbor did at that time did commit murder suicide, killing his wife and children.  Also, these ""hunger"" delusions seem eerily similar to what she would later encounter after seeing the trailer for The Famine King.  Does this mean that she wasn't delusional after all, or is she too much of an unreliable narrator for us to tell?  "
1279,Is there any other definition or sub-meaning of the term 'marines'?,"I've come across the term 'marines' in the book 'The Arrangement by Elia Kazan' twice; however I couldn't get what it may refer. I know it is like 'nautical' or something but it seemed different to me in the context. Need your help. Here are the two paragraphs:     ""You're the son of 612, aren't you?"" he asked. ""I'm Dr. Levine. I've been looking after your father.""   ""How is he really?"" I said.   ""He's finished. Otherwise he's fine.""   ""What the hell does that mean?""   ""I t means some doctors will BS you, put him on a drug calendar,   and slip you a hefty bill. But there's no way back with this thing.""   ""So what do I do?""   ""Make him as happy as you can, for as long as you can. But don't   look for the marines. They ain't coming.""   I need to mention here that the old man here suffers from arteriosclerosis. The other paragraph is:     My father winked at me, and laughed and coughed and laughed.   Miss Smythe came back. With her were Butch and the marines,   Dr. Levine and Father Draddy, the young priest who had tried to   talk to my father earlier and hadn't been able to.   I thought that the term 'marines' may be something used in daily language like white-collars or something like that. I know it isn't but what is it then? "

1281,What do the first two lines of this rap by Public Enemy mean?,"The rap group ""Public Enemy"", in their first album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (released in 1988), had a track titled Don't Believe the Hype. Its first stanza is:     Back   Caught you lookin' for the same thing   It's a new thing - check out this I bring   Uh oh, the roll below the level   'Cause I'm livin' low next to the bass   C'mon   Turn up the radio   They claim that I'm a criminal   By now I wonder how   Some people never know   The enemy could be their friend, guardian   I'm not a hooligan   I rock the party and   Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist   Preach to teach to all   'Cause some they never had this   Number one, not born to run   About the gun...

Don't believe the hype    What is meant by the first line ""caught you lookin' for the same thing""? More specifically, what 'thing' was being looked for and why?  Also, what is this 'new thing' that he's going to 'bring'?  What does he mean by 'don't believe the hype'? "

1283,Does this quote belong to Goethe?,"This quote is often attributed to Goethe. Did he actually write this? If yes, then where can we find it? It would be wonderful if there is a reliable source or a book so that I can quote it in my future writings. I'm always suspicious of quotes that circulate on social media, but when I look them up, I can't find an actual source.     “I will say nothing against the course of my existence. But at bottom   it has been nothing but pain and burden, and I can affirm that during   the whole of my 75 years, I have not had four weeks of genuine   well-being. It is but the perpetual rolling of a rock that must be   raised up again forever.”  "
1284,Why does Uri get a special answer when his balloon pops?,"In Miriam Roth's classic Hebrew children's book A Tale of Five Balloons (Hebrew: מעשה בחמישה בלונים), five children each get a balloon:    In sequence, each child sees their balloon pop. And each is told not to cry, with the refrain, ""That's the end of every balloon"" -- ""זה סופו של כל בלון"".    While this is a very simple children's story, it deals very directly and explicitly with loss and impermanence; possibly even grief.  Which is why I'm always a little unsettled by the first iteration, which is a little different -- a small difference, but I feel a significant one. When Uri's green balloon pops, he isn't told to cheer up because ""that's the end of every balloon."" Instead, he's exhorted:     אל תבכה, אורי   אל תצטער   נקנה לך בלון אחר      Don't cry, Uri,   Don't be sad   We'll buy you a new balloon   This is a perfectly reasonable thing to say to a crying young child -- but it feels to me at odds with all the following repetitions. None of the other children are promised another balloon; all of them are told to accept the popping of balloons as inevitable.  Why is Uri different from all the others? Isn't it odd to break the story structure in this one, initial instance? Is there thematic significance here; does this somehow tie into the theme?  I welcome both analysis, and any commentary from the author that addresses the question. "
1285,Son of Adam but not Eve? Daughter of Eve but not Adam?,"Throughout The Chronicles of Narnia the humans are referred to as ""Son of Adam"" for a male, and ""Daughter of Eve"" for a female. I'm assuming that the characters in Narnia don't think that females only descend from a female but not a male, and males only descend from a male but not a female. I.e. technically, a male would be a son of Adam and a son of Eve; likewise, a female would be a daughter of Eve and a daughter of Adam.  If this is indeed correct, is there a reason why they always refer to males as ""Son of Adam"" and not ""Son of Eve"" or ""Son of Adam and Eve""? And, similarly, is there a reason why they always refer to females as ""Daughter of Eve"" and not ""Daughter of Adam"" or ""Daughter of Adam and Eve""? "
1286,"Why is ""...Then fall, Caesar"" always left out when talking about Caesar's last words?","From this link,     DECIUS BRUTUS: Great Caesar,      CAESAR: Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?      CASCAL: Speak, hands for me!      CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR      CAESAR: Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.      Dies   For some reason, the last part of the phrase is always left out when discussing Caesar's death. It is very widely believed that Et tu, Brute? were the last words of Caesar*, and is often used as a joke in common speech. Even Wikipedia ignores the last part, and has an entire page on Et tu, Brute? with no mention of the subsequent phrase.  The reason I bring it up is that I think it brings up a different interpretation of the sentiment Shakespeare was trying to convey. ""Et tu, Brute?"" sounds like an accusatory statement of betrayal, similar to ""how dare you!"" Even Wikipedia mentions this interpretation:     It has been argued that the phrase can be interpreted as a curse or   warning   On the other hand, the addition of ""Then fall Caesar"", at least in my opinion, makes it sound more like a disappointment - similar to ""how could you?"" In a sense, Caesar believes that the fact that Brutus has taken the side against him is reason enough for Caesar to not fight back against his impending death. This is, of course, my interpretation.   Nonetheless, I don't understand why the second part of the phrase is never mentioned, even in literary discussions. Is it just because Latin sounds cooler?    (To be clear, I'm talking about the Shakespeare version of the story, and not the actual series of events. There's some evidence to suggest that Caesar's actual last words may have been ""And you, son?"" (translated), but that doesn't change the point of the question.)  *From my personal experience. Depending on where you live and who your friends are, this might not be the case.  "
1287,"What is meant by ""strength"" in Anathema's ""One Last Goodbye""?","The second stanza of Anathema's ""One Last Goodbye"" goes as follows:     I know you didn't want to leave   Your heart yearned to stay   But the strength I always loved in you   Finally gave way         See full lyrics e.g. here    What does ""strength"" mean here? Does it mean some sort of inner strength, e.g. will or resolve? The way this line sounds to me is a bit accusing, or let down and disappointed.   The song is also apparently dedicated to the writers' late mother (or so some websites claim), but it doesn't feel it like it's talking about motherly love. "
1288,Did Peddana create Pravarakhya and Varudhini?,"When I was studying in my high school, there was a lesson in my Telugu textbook about the travels of Pravarakhya and the places he saw in the Himalayas. It was a part of Manu Charitra, written by Allasani Peddana, a great writer who lived around the 15-16th centuries. The  name of the book means ""The story of Manu"".   Manu Charitra is classified as a Prabandha, which is a semi-historical anecdote about a person. The poet takes a small story and enlarges it into a large work using poetic expressions, metaphors, and by adding fictional characters and dialogues, all to describe natural beauty.  Manu Charitra is the story of Swarochisha Manu, second of the fourteen manus. In Hinduism, we have many texts describing the lives of different Manus, especially Swarochisha Manu.   What was the inspiration for Pravarakhya and Varudhini? Are they from a pre-existing book or were they created by Peddana? "
1289,Was the Tralfamadorian view of time based on a real metaphysical position?,"I was reading Metaphysics: a Very Short Introduction and encountered the following paragraph in the discussion on time:     One may have some attraction towards coupling this Aristotelian view with what is called eternalism about events and things. We considered privileging the present, or the present and past, but the eternalist takes all events as equally real even if from one perspective they are future. I don’t know whether the 2020 Olympic Games will pass off successfully or not, but, if they do, an eternalist takes them just to be as much a part of reality as anything. This may sound confusing. Trading on the image of the block again, the eternalist takes reality to be one huge block of everything that ever was and will be. We are located some place in the middle, able to look back at what occurred earlier than us but unable to see what is later than our perspective. But it’s all just as real.   I couldn't help thinking about the Tralfamadorians in Slaughterhouse-Five. Was Kurt Vonnegut aware of the metaphysics of time? Was he thinking of this view when he wrote the book? "
1290,How can the inscription on AURYN be interpreted?,"In The Neverending Story, AURYN, the medallion of the Childlike Empress, bears the following inscription (at least while Bastian is carrying it - it's never 100% confirmed that it had the same writing in the first half of the book when Atreyu had it):     DO WHAT YOU WISH.   The obvious interpretation of this is that it means ""do whatever you want, man"". But it could also be interpreted along the lines of ""wishes become actions/reality"": what you wish, you then do, thanks to the Golden-Eyed Commander of Wishes. I think I've also read somewhere about a third interpretation, which now I can't remember.  Unfortunately, I've only read a translated version of the story. Double meanings and other such nuances of language can very easily differ between one language and another, and are almost impossible to grasp in a given language without a close familiarity with that language. So, without being able to speak German myself, I pose the question here:  How can the inscription on AURYN be interpreted, in the original story?  Are both of the above interpretations valid for the German version of the inscription? Are there other possible interpretations which look less valid in English? "
1291,“Optimists and pessimists differ only on the date of the end of the world.”,"Source: The Human Predicament: A Candid Guide to Life's Biggest Questions (2017). p. 215 Middle. Note for Ch. 1, para. 1.        Or when it [referent beneath] will occur. Stanislaw Lec famously said: “Optimists and pessimists differ only on the date of the end of the world.” Stanislaw Lec, it should be noted, was remarkably successful in delaying his own demise. Sentenced to death for a second attempt to escape a German work camp during the Holocaust, he was taken to dig his own grave. He used the shovel to kill his guard and successfully escaped.      The 'it' refers to p. 4:       To gain some clarity, one helpful distinction is between different domains within which optimists and pessimists might disagree. One such domain is the realm of the facts. An optimist might believe that some terrible fate will not befall him, whereas a pessimist might believe that he will fall victim to that fate. They both agree that the fate is terrible, but they have differing views about whether it will occur.1   Am I correct that the emboldened quote's an allegory? What's its hidden meaning?  The literal meaning is false, as optimists and pessimists can differ on love, justice, value of life.   "
1292,Antecedents for Hawthorne's Dr. Rappaccini,"In the short story Rappaccini's Daughter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Dr. Rappaccini uses his own daughter as a subject in his great experiment, resulting in her living a life of isolation and eventually causing her death. Oblivious to his daughter's pain throughout, Rappaccini was a fairly early example of what was to become a common literary and cinematic archetype: the cold-hearted scientific genius whose human empathy is decapacitated by an all-consuming lust for knowledge.   I am interested in tracing the evolution of this Rappaccini literary archetype, especially in relation to the Scientific Revolution in Europe that began 250 or so years before Hawthorne penned his short tale. Specifically:   Are there instances of the archetype in literature prior to the Scientific Revolution? (Non-European literatures included.) What are the earliest examples of the archetype appearing in literature after the start of the Scientific Revolution? Did the frequency of the archetype's appearances in literature increase as the Scientific Revolution progressed between the 17th and 19th centuries?   I am not well-read enough to begin answering these questions, and they've been itching me since reading  Hawthorne's story a few weeks ago. I'll be grateful for any light cast on them.  "

1294,What happens to Crow after communion?,"In ""Crow Communes"", The lines following the communion - after Crow tore off a mouthful of God - describes the results of this act, in two phases.  At first, Crow seems unsure of what his act might achieve:     “Will this cipher divulge itself to digestion       Under hearing beyond understanding?”   But then, he feels it does something to him:     Yet, it’s true, he suddenly felt much stronger.       Crow, the hierophant, humped, impenetrable.       Half-illumined. Speechless.   I'm trying to understand what Hughes is trying to convey with each phase:   As for the first phase: What does it mean to decipher something ""Under hearing beyond understanding?” (FWIW, Hughes' read-aloud of this sentence separates it into two clauses) As for the second phase: What is actually happening to Crow? Why is he ""humped""?   "
1295,What is steampunk?,"I've long been confused about what exactly comprises the steampunk genre. Of course I realise that genres aren't usually things for which one can pin down exact definitions, but I don't even have a proper 'feel' for the steampunk genre or where its boundaries are.  The Wikipedia article is full of citation-needed notes, and I'm somewhat suspicious of its attempts at defining the genre. For example, it cites steam power as being a required part of steampunk stories (which also makes sense given the name steampunk, of course), but I'm pretty sure that many 'steampunk' things are actually based on other technologies such as clockwork: gears are a common device used to make objects steampunky. But I'm not really sure where else to look to get a proper idea (if not a rigorous definition) of what it means to be steampunk.  What is steampunk, really? What makes a work of literature steampunk or not? "
1296,Why did Douglas Adams call Paul Neil Milne Johnstone the worst poet?,"Douglas Adams evidently named Paul Neil Milne Johnstone the worst poet in the universe in the original Hitchiker's Guide radio broadcast.

1297,Is it a common theme in (western) storytelling that the antagonists are located to the east?,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place for this question. I was reading some Lord of the Rings-lore the other day and it got me thinking about the location of ""evil"" in storytelling. In LOTR, Mordor is located to the east of where the protagonists of the story live and I got this feeling that this isn't unique to LOTR and is a common theme in many (Western) stories but I wasn't able to think of any of the top of my head.  Is this a common theme or am I just imagining this? If this is not imagined, is this reversed in stories told by Eastern authors, ie. evil coming from the west?  "

1300,"Why were ""Daisy-Head Mayzie"" and ""My Many Colored Days"" not published until after Dr. Seuss's death?","The Dr. Seuss bibliography lists a number of books that were published posthumously. While I do realize that it's not uncommon to have posthumous works, several of these books are apparently quite old. For example, What Pet Should I Get? is believed to have been written in the 1950s or 1960s, and Daisy-Head Mayzie was written in 1973. Given that Dr. Seuss was publishing books until 1990, why did it take so long to publish these? "
1301,"In Finnegans Wake, surely the dreamer is this character?","As I see it, Finnegans Wake has two main sections, namely Section A (“dreamland” [1-617.29]) and Section B (“anna’s interior monologue” [617.30-628]). Section A and Section B are my terms and there is no structural division between A and B. Structurally, the novel has Parts I - IV, with my Section A being the last 10 pages of Part IV (Part IV has only a single chapter beginning on page 593).   As with Ulysses, Finnegans Wake ends with a woman’s interior monologue as she just awakes (Section B). A reader of Ulysses will find Section B “easy” familiar reading. There are a few strangenesses encountered, especially near the beginning of the monologue, i.e., when Anna is closer to sleep.      Soft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing. Lpf! Folty and folty all the nights have falled on to long my hair. Not a sound, falling. Lispn! No wind no word. Only a leaf, just a leaf and then leaves.   Joyce has noticed that such ""leafy speafing"" is more consistent with our own interior “monologues” than the language that he used for Molly (just listen to yourself). Joyce renders a better interior monologue in Finnegans Wake than in Ulysses. But a good old-fashion modernist interior monologue nonetheless. Ten pages of devastating beautiful fluid sensible reading.      But I’m loothing them that’s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O   bitter ending! I’ll slip away before they’re up. They’ll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it’s old and old it’s sad and old it’s sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me   seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms.   Section A, on the other hand, consists of 617 pages with not one “readable” paragraph. With familiarity, Part I is fairly ""clear"", but as the night progresses, so the text becomes murkier and murkier.    The universe of Section A is that place you find yourself when dreaming. It is also that place you find yourself when you are having a two way argument with your “partner”, entirely in your head, while washing the dishes alone after the divorce. The characters are “you”, and your “partners” (who have many forms and voices all “spoken” by you), and all the characters from all your dreams, and waking life (""heliopolis""), days stacked upon nights stacked upon days, etc. The “narrators” too are of that world.   It is argued as to who is the dreamer. From my reading of texts about Finnegans Wake, many feel there is one dreamer, although some prefer “us all as the dreamer” (tenable) or even a few multiple dreamers (less tenable).   If there is a unique dreamer, then who is it?   Before I got to the end I was betting on Issy (I). [I didn’t think a man could dream the wake. The dreamer knows girls and women from the inside. The dreamer knows so much sexual abuse from the inside.]  On the other hand, all texts that I have read posit a male dreamer (Kevin or HCE).    But then Section A ends with dawn breaking and “the smog lofting”. “The grand fooneral will now shortly occur” [617]. And then, Anna’s monologue, with numerous consistent referents to the previous 617 page dream world.       Surely the dreamer is      -  Anna?     Surely the structure is such that this character is obviously the dreamer, and before arguing any other position (Kevin, us all, etc) one would first have defeat the simplest position (Occam's razor: this character dreams the wake)? One would also have to explain who dreams Section B, or how Section B is located ontologically.  The kind of answer I am looking for is something like ""This character cannot be the dreamer since..."" or ""It is much more likely that... since..."". I would also be interested in any references to arguments that this character is or is not the dreamer.   [... The pure uninterrupted interior monologue begins 619.20. 617.30-619.19 is a transition, but more Ulysses than Finnegans Wake ...] "
1302,"Repetition in Faulkner's ""As I Lay Dying""","While reading As I Lay Dying, I noticed that the characters repeat certain phrases a great deal.   Here's an example from one of Tull's chapters which shows the same two phrases recurring three times in a short space of the text.     That boy comes up the hill. He is carrying a fish nigh long as he is. He slings it to the ground and grunts ""Hah"" and spits over his shoulder like a man.       Durn nigh long as he is.       ""What's that?"" I say. ""A hog? Where'd you get it?""       ...      ""You clean that fish,"" Anse says. Vardaman stops. ""Why cant Dewey Dell clean it?"" he says.       ""You clean that fish,"" Anse says.       ""Aw, pa,"" Vardaman says.       ""You clean it,"" Anse says. He dont look around. Vardaman comes back and picks up the fish. .... He goes on around the house, toting it in both arms like a armful of wood, it overlapping him on both ends, head and tail. Durn nigh big as he is.    These repetitions are not unique to Tull but occur in other chapters narrated by other characters (see the previous chapter where Dewey Dell repeats ""without the words"" for example).   Because they are phrases in thought and speech, they seem to be fundamentally different to, although mirroring, the descriptive repetition that occurs elsewhere in the book.     It will give her confidence and comfort. I go on to the house, followed by the Chuck. Chuck. Chuck. of the adze.    Why does Faulkner have his characters repeat themselves so often? Is it a common speech pattern in the Southern US dialect he's seeking to mimic, or are there deeper meanings here, perhaps related to the descriptive repetition? "
1303,Explain the bidding in ‘The Unprincipled Affair of the Practical Joker’,"The short story ‘The Unprincipled Affair of the Practical Joker’ by Dorothy L. Sayers was collected in Lord Peter Views the Body (Gollancz, 1928). In this extract the characters are playing a game of bridge:     ‘Whatever has induced you, my dear boy,’ said Colonel Marchbanks, ‘to take up with that very objectionable fellow Melville?’      ‘Diamonds,’ said Lord Peter. ‘Do you find him so, really?’      ‘Perfectly dreadful man,’ said the Hon. Frederick Arbuthnot. ‘Hearts. What did you want to go and get him a room here for? This used to be a quite decent club.’      ‘Two clubs?’ said Sir Impey Biggs, who had been ordering a whisky, and had only caught the last word.      ‘No, no, one heart.’      ‘I beg your pardon. Well, partner, how about spades? Perfectly good suit.’       ‘Pass,’ said the Colonel. ‘I don’t know what the Army’s coming to nowadays.’      ‘No trumps,’ said Wimsey. ‘It’s all right, children. Trust your Uncle Pete. Come on, Freddy, how many of those hearts are you going to shout for?’      ‘None, the Colonel havin’ let me down so ’orrid,’ said the Hon. Freddy.      ‘Cautious blighter. All content? Righty-ho! Bring out your dead, partner. Oh, very pretty indeed. We’ll make it a slam this time.’   The puzzle here is to explain the bidding, which I’ve highlighted.   If Lord Peter and Sir Impey have the cards for a slam, how come they stopped bidding at one no trump? According to the modern laws of rubber bridge, a bid “names both a level, from one to seven, and a denomination”. So Lord Peter’s opening bid of “diamonds” would today be given as “one diamond” and Freddy’s “hearts” as “one heart”. Was it the norm in the 1920s to omit the “one”, as in the dialogue above?  By comparison, in Agatha Christie’s Cards on the Table (1936), the bidding is in the modern form, in this respect at least:     There they were well down to it, their faces serious, the bids coming quickly. ‘One heart.’ ‘Pass.’ ‘Three clubs.’ ‘Three spades.’ ‘Four diamonds.’ ‘Double.’ ‘Four hearts.’        ‘One no trump’—clear and decisive—Mrs. Lorrimer.

1304,"Repetition of ""smile"" in Kamala Surayya's 'My Mother at Sixty-six'","In the poem 'My Mother at Sixty-six' by Kamala Surayya, the poet ends the ""prose"" saying      all I did was smile and smile and smile....   There are various critical interpretations as to what does the over-usage of the word ""smile"" mean, some say it is because she wanted to hide her feelings of sadness, while some say she was out of words. Reading the poem, I think she is trying to exaggerate in a sense, by over-using the word smile. Can you interpret for me in that way? Also, are all critical interpretations valid? Here's the complete poem:     Driving from my parent’s   home to Cochin last Friday   morning, I saw my mother,   beside me,   doze, open mouthed, her face   ashen like that   of a corpse and realised with pain   that she thought away,   looked but soon   put that thought away, and   looked out at young   trees sprinting, the merry children    spilling   out of their homes, but after the    airport’s   security check, standing a few yards   away, I looked again at her, wan, pale   as a late winter’s moon and felt that old   familiar ache, my childhood’s fear,   but all I said was, see you soon, Amma,   all I did was smile and smile and smile......

1307,"Are Lorca's ""Gypsy Ballads"" adapted from, or inspired by, traditional Romani songs?","Federico Garcia Lorca's Romancero Gitano, usually translated as Gypsy Ballads, is a collection of poems, about which Wikipedia says:     All of the poems deal with the Romani people (gypsies) and their culture, but only as a theme used to carry the larger message that the poet was trying to convey. [...]      It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside.   Are the poems just about the Romani people, or are they imitations (or even translations?) of actual Romani ballads?  I've read one of them, ""Sleepwalking Ballad"" as translated by Kirkland and Maurer, and it mentions a ""gypsy girl"" but I can't tell if the poem could have come from Romani culture itself or if it just happens to feature one of the Romani people as a character.  What is the backstory behind these poems? Were they inspired by Romani literature in any form? "
1308,Thomas Hardy’s “The Man He Killed”,"This question is asking for open-ended interpretation of a poem. See here on meta for an explanation.    Thomas Hardy’s ‘The Man He Killed’ (1902) was published in Time’s Laughingstocks (1909):         “Had he and I but met       By some old ancient inn,   We should have sat us down to wet       Right many a nipperkin!          “But ranged as infantry,       And staring face to face,   I shot at him as he at me.       And killed him in his place.          “I shot him dead because—       Because he was my foe.   Just so: my foe of course he was;       That’s clear enough; although          “He thought he’d ’list, perhaps,       Off-hand like—just as I—   Was out of work—had sold his traps—       No other reason why.          “Yes; quaint and curious war is!       You shoot a fellow down   You’d treat if met where any bar is.       Or help to half-a-crown.”   What is this poem about? What poetic and rhetorical techniques does Hardy use? What do we learn about the character and origins of the speaker? Is “old ancient” a pleonasm? What is the significance of “nipperkin”? Does “war is” rhyme with “bar is”? "
1309,What was the Great Silence Epidemic of 1712?,"One of the many memorable pieces of wordplay in The Phantom Tollbooth is when the heroes meet Dr Dischord and his assistant, the awful DYNNE.     ""You mean you've never met the awful DYNNE before?"" said Dr. Dischord in a surprised tone. ""Why, I thought everyone had. When you're playing in your room and making a great amount of noise, what do they tell you to stop?""   ""That awful din,"" admitted Milo.   ""When the neighbors are playing their radio too loud, late at night, what do you wish they'd turn down?""   ""The awful din,"" answered Tock.   ""When the street on your block is being repaired and the pneumatic drills are working all day, what does everyone complain of?""   ""The dreadful row,"" volunteered the Humbug brightly.   ""The dreadful RAUW,"" cried the anguished DYNNE, ""was my grandfather. He perished in the great silence epidemic of 1712.""   What, if anything, does ""the great silence epidemic of 1712"" refer to? Did something significant happen in that year which led to a reduction of noise in the world? (Trying to recall this line from memory, I misremembered it as 1918, which would have made sense as the end of a world war would surely have reduced noise levels.) "
1310,Trying to find: Short story: Boy meets a man who is about to hang himself,"For decades this short story has been stuck in my head. We read it in highschool English class once.  As I remember it, it was about a boy leaving his home to encounter a man who was about to hang himself. I think the man is standing on a chair and preparing the ordeal, when the boy meets him. The boy doesn't understand the situation, so he starts a conversation. Not sure how the story ends...  I remember it as a very beautiful short story, but haven't managed to find it.  Can anybody help me?  I think the word 'penny' was involved.  Does anybody know the story? "
1311,"In Master and Commander, why is the cook told to put his pans upside down?","In Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander, during the encounter with the Cacafuego, Aubrey says the following to Ellis:     ""Cut along to the galley. Tell the cook to put all his dirty pans and coppers upside down.""   Is this a literal command, or some kind of nautical jargon? In either case, what is the purpose of it? "
1312,"Who is the mysterious stranger at the end of Faulkner's ""As I Lay Dying""?","Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is, on the whole, a realistic novel which seeks to portray the misery of poverty in the deep south.   However, the ending very much took me by surprise. Anse, the father of the Bundren family, borrows some shovels from a mysterious house. Later:      He announces to his family that the woman from whom he borrowed the shovels is his new wife.   Note: further spoilers follow which I have not hidden in tags.  There are several unanswered questions with this ending. Most pressing: who is this woman? Have she and Anse been corresponding and if so, for how long? If not, why has she suddenly agreed to marry Anse? For that matter, since Anse is relatively old and portrayed as lazy and selfish, why would anyone agree to marry him at all?  It seems a rather unsatisfactory close to proceedings: why did Faulkner choose to end this way? "
1313,"What does H. G. Wells mean by ""He had added to exceptional business 'push', bankruptcy under the old dispensation, and judicious matrimony.""?","I encountered this following sentence while reading the second chapter of H. G. Wells' novel Kipps.      He was an irascible, energetic little man, with hairy hands, for the most part under his coat tails, a long, shiny, bald head, a pointed, aquiline nose a little askew, and a neatly trimmed beard. He walked lightly and with a confident jerk, and he was given to humming. He had added to exceptional business ""push,"" bankruptcy under the old dispensation, and judicious matrimony.   I'm not so clear what this sentence means. What exactly does ""the old dispensation"" refer to, and what role does the notion of ""judicious matrimony"" play in the context of this sentence? I'm not a native speaker of English so it's possible I'm not understanding some subtle language play, or perhaps some allusion to certain social context is lost on me. Could anyone help? "
1314,"Meaning/translation of title ""The Light Fantastic"" by Terry Pratchett","I have read The Light Fantastic by Terry Pratchett in English and always interpreted the title as ""The Fantastic (adjective) light (noun)"". Mostly because I do not see ""Fantastic"" as noun. To my surprise the Slovak translation is titled ""Ľahká fantastika"", translatable as ""The Light (adjective) Fantastic (noun)"", ""Easy fiction"" or ""The Lightweight Fiction"".   Is ""The Light(adjective) Fantastic(noun)"" a correct meaning/translation of the title? If so, does ""Fantastic(noun)"" here mean fiction?  Investigating this only made me more confused:  Reading the wikipedia page, the title of the book is a quote from ""L'Allegro"" by John Milton, but there it is used like this:     Come, and trip it, as you go,    On the light fantastic toe; And in thy   right hand lead with thee   So is it used there as ""The Light(adjective) Fantastic(adjective)""?.  A definition for ""Fantastic(noun)"" yields ""A fanciful or whimsical person."" so this could refer to one of MCs of the book (Rincewind?). I hope this fits here better than English SE. "
1315,"What does H. G. Wells mean by ""ha'penny longcloth to sell, he put it thus to startled customers: 'Can DO you one, six half if y' like.""?","I'm having trouble deciphering what appears to be a string of colloquialisms in H. G. Wells' novel Kipps. The passage in question describes a business owner Mr. Shalford, and it goes as follows:     He was the sort of man who is not only ignorant, but absolutely incapable of English. When he wanted to say he had a sixpenny- ha'penny longcloth to sell, he put it thus to startled customers: ""Can DO you one, six half if y' like.""He always omitted pronouns and articles and so forth; it seemed to him the very essence of the efficiently businesslike.    I recognize that these expressions are idiosyncratic to Shalford, and are supposed to give him character. But being a non-native speaker of English I'm having a hard time understanding their meanings. What does Shalford mean by ""Can DO you one, six half if y'like"", and is the ""ha' penny"" supposed to be an abbreviation of ""had a sixpenny""? There have been quite a few such colloquial shortenings of sounds in this book up until this point but this is the first one that's giving me any real trouble. Can anyone help? Thanks! "
1316,Children’s story: boy accidentally hits bird with stone and nurses back to health. man hurts it on purpose nurses it back to get gift,"A long time I read a story where a young boy accidentally hits a bird (with a stone I think). He runs over to find it and nurses it back to health. It flies away and eventually brings him back some sort of gift (a bag of gold maybe?). A man sees this happen and decides to try the same thing. He hits the bird on purpose and nurses it back to health. However, the bird knew his intentions and did not bring him a gift but instead punished him in some way. I’m not sure where I read this story but I want to know how it ends and I would very much like to find it. Is anybody familiar with it or may have some resource that could help me find it? "
1317,How can Gilgamesh be one-third man and two-thirds god?,"In The Epic of Gilgamesh, it says that the gods made Gilgamesh to be two-thirds god and one-third man:      Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.      -- modernised Muss-Arnolt translation     Two-thirds of him are divine, and [one-third of him human,]      -- Thompson translation    How is this possible? Considering the ancestors of a person, one's genetic proportion of ""god"" or ""human"" can only be a dyadic rational, not 1/3 or 2/3. Does it mean he had two-thirds of the attributes of gods and one-third of the attributes of humanity? Does it simply reflect a poor understanding of genetics? Am I overthinking this? "
1318,"In Kipps, what does H. G. Wells mean by ""colonial meat by contract at threepence a pound""","I came across this following sentence in H. G. Wells' Kipps  and I don't understand what it means.      What he put into Kipps was chiefly bread and margarine, infusions of chicory and tea-dust, colonial meat by contract at threepence a pound, potatoes by the sack, and watered beer.    I get the other parts of the sentence, but what is ""colonial meat""? Is it a particular type of meat? Or is it in reference to a method of farming/processing in the British Empire? Or, is it ""colonial"" as in an animal colony (This one may be too far off the mark as it doesn't seem to make much sense but just in case)？Also, ""by contract"" is alluding to the existence of some business arrangement between retailers and farms, right?   I'd really appreciate it if someone cares to clarify this bit for me. Thanks! "
1319,Understanding the 2018 and 2019 Nobel prizes,"When someone is awarded the Nobel prize, the Nobel committee always gives a short description of their achievement.  This year, two prizes were awarded (for 2019 and 2018):     Peter Handke      “for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.”   and     Olga Tokarczuk      “for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.”   I can make some sense of the description of Handke's achievement, but not of Tokarczuk's. Can someone explain it in layman's terms?  I can't make sense of terms like ""encyclopedic passion"". ""Encyclopedic knowlegde"" is a common phrase that I understand. Encyclopedias are the books where one finds the most knowledge. So this term makes sense to describe someone who has vast knowledge. But I do not understand the relationship between encylopedias and passion.  I also don't understand ""crossing of boundaries as a form of life"".  Does she write about other forms of life than humans? Or is this a metaphor that only makes sense with some background knowledge? ""Crossing of boundaries"" makes some sense as a metaphor to me, but it is awfully nonspecific. Perhaps I'd understand it if I had read her books.  Please explain for a layman who is not well versed in abstract literature, but is excited about the Nobel prize and is interested in the getting to know the work of the prize recipients.    P.S. You can see all awards here. The vast majority have a clear and understandable description. I feel that this years' descriptions suddenly become much harder to understand. "
1320,What is it with British occultism and Brussels sprouts?,"Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's Good Omens is set in England, and one of the characters is Madame Tracy, who makes her living by doing ""occult"" seances, either by using a crystal ball or a Tarot deck (which doesn't contain any Major Arcana because their sight was upsetting the clients). The following detail caught my attention:     And she made sure that she had always put sprouts on to boil just before a seance. Nothing is more reassuring, nothing is more true to the comfortable spirit of English occultism, than the smell of Brussels sprouts cooking in the next room.   Is this some sort of British humour? From an Internet search I can see that Brussels sprouts seem to be an (in)famous popular Christmas dish in Britain - is that it? The novel isn't set during Christmas, though; the Annotated Pratchett File and this reference file by Tor.com don't mention this scene. "
1321,"On the use of the word ""thief"" in Imagine Dragons' ""Thief""","The chorus of Imagine Dragons' ""Thief"" (from the deluxe version of the album Smoke + Mirrors), written by Clare Reynolds and Natalie Maree Dunn, goes like this:     So take me back   When I believed   Back when I was unafraid   Just like a thief   And all the heights   That I could reach   Back when I was unafraid   Just like a thief     (Spotify, lyrics)  These lyrics confuse me slightly. Invoking the ""thief,"" I'm pretty sure, cannot be only for the purpose of creating an example of someone who's unafraid -- why not ""hero,"" or any other person who is unafraid? (The word is also the title of the song, perhaps hinting at something...more?)  Additionally, the word ""thief"" can carry a negative connotation, and so (at least for me) distracts from the request to ""take me back"" to an earlier, simpler, and more naive time ""when I believed."" Also, ""all the heights/that I could reach"" make more sense when connected to almost any other profession that requires bravery from its practitioners.    My understanding of the song is that the singer is speaking to someone who doesn't understand the darkness that can exist in the world, for people who experienced things than the listener had not, as in the first stanza:     If only you   You could see   The darkest place that you could be   Oh maybe then you'd understand   From desert heat to cobbled streets   From broken home to the city beat   There's so much more than you could know     This is followed immediately by the chorus: ""So take me back..."" I interpret this as a hope or prayer that the singer can go back to a simpler time, so that he and the listener will be on the same level again. (He does not ask that the listener gain negative life experiences.) I don't think that ""thief"" is a good example of someone who has that earlier and lighter frame of mind that the speaker wishes to return to. The thief may be unafraid, but that mindset is probably not the solution that the speaker seeks from the ""darkest place that you could be.""  So, why use the word ""thief"" in ""Thief""? "
1322,"Who is the speaker in ""The Unreturning""?","Wilfred Owen's poem ""The Unreturning"" (full text here) seems remarkably free of context - it never says explicitly what it's about, what's happening, which ""dead"" are being talked about, who or what are ""unreturning"", or what the point of the poem is. Therefore I'm hoping that this is a poem which will lend itself well to close reading, and that our understanding of it will be greatly increased by doing so.  One of the first questions this poem made me ask is: who is the narrator? The poem is written in the first person in at least a couple of places:     There watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.   Each one whom Life exiled I named and called.   This makes it sound like the narrator might be God, calling the dead as they leave life ...     I dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.   ... but this suggests that the narrator fears heaven, which surely God would not.  So I can't really work it out. Who is the first-person speaker? "
1323,Why should a teacher's cat care less about human robbery?,"I started reading Natsume Sōseki's I Am a Cat a week or two ago in preparation for this month's topic challenge, and I came across the following paragraph towards the end of the first chapter (whose full text is freely available in English at WikiSource):     But human beings do not seem to understand the rights of property. Every time we come on something good to eat, invariably they descend and take it from us. Relying on their naked strength, they coolly rob us of things which are rightly ours to eat. Miss Blanche lives in the house of a military man, and the tomcat’s master is a lawyer. But since I live in a teacher’s house, I take matters of this sort rather more lightly than they. I feel that life is not unreasonable so long as one can scrape along from day to day. For surely even human beings will not flourish forever. I think it best to wait in patience for the Day of the Cats.   (emphasis mine)  Why should being a teacher's cat mean that our unnamed hero is more blasé about human 'robbery' than cats belonging to lawyers or military men? I don't understand the connection here. Perhaps there's some Japanese cultural reference that I'm not getting? "
1324,"Is it significant that the eyes being reflective are proof that a Soul is inside in ""The Host""?","The eyes being reflective are proof that a Soul is inside of the body in The Host, and is used as verification by both Souls and humans:     ""Look, look, look!"" he says. He pulls a small cylinder from his hip pocket and twists the top. A beam of light shoots out the end.   He turns the flashlight on his face.   The light makes his skin yellow. It shows the prominent cheekbones beside a long thin nose and a sharply squared-off jaw. His lips are stretched in a grin, but I can see that they are full, for a man. His eyebrows and lashes are bleached out from the sun.   But that's not what he's showing me.   His eyes, clear liquid sienna in the illumination, shine with no more than human reflection. He bounces the light between left and right.   The Host, chapter 4 (page 35)   This seems like it should have some sort of significance - the phrase 'the eyes are windows to the soul' comes to mind - but I don't know what the significance could be. So:  Is there a significance to this? If so, what? "
1325,What is the essence of Undershaft's moral argument in Major Barbara?,"I can discern certain Nietzschean undertones such as Undershaft's idealization of the will to power. I also understand Undershaft's discussion on the problem with describing poverty and starvation as virtues, and how the Salvation Army essentially bribes the poor with bread as opposed to actually saving their souls. Sure, that may dismantle the moral position of Cusins and Barbara, but how does it contribute to his own position? He manufactures weapons and self-admittedly sells to all indiscriminately. It seems to be a non-sequitur when he says      ""[killing] is the final test of conviction, the only lever strong enough to overturn a social system""   because he - by his own admission - shouldn't have any qualms in providing that ""social system"" with firepower. I don't really understand the main argument he is using by the end of the book to persuade Cusins and Barbara. Why were they persuaded?  "
1326,"Was ""It was a dark and stormy night"" deliberately purple prose?","Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Paul Clifford is most famous for its opening phrase, ""It was a dark and stormy night"". Today, this phrase is seen as a textbook example of purple prose - writing which is overly extravagant and flowery, drawing the reader's attention more to the words than the story.  In the context of the original novel, was this really purple prose? Was the novel full of purplitude elsewhere, or was it (for its time) a reasonably ordinary piece of writing?  The book is available on Project Gutenberg, so you can read it yourself if necessary to judge its purpleness or otherwise. "
1327,Is the hook of Marethyu meant to evoke a scythe?,"Marethyu is a central character in The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel. You can read more about him here, but that Wikia page contains major spoilers for the series, so follow that link at your own peril.  Marethyu is, among other things, Death:     Marethyu was said to have gone by many different names prior to his   appearances in the books - however, all of these names meant Death.   He is also directly involved in many occurrences throughout the books that involve his dealing death, so the appellation is appropriate.  His ""signature piece"" is his hook, which replaces one of his hands. Spoilers:      That hook is constructed from the Four Swords of Power: Joyeuse, Excalibur, Durendal, and Clarent. The swords are each connected to one elemental power (earth, air etc). It is also called the sword, or hook of ""Aether,"" and confers to its wielder power over time.   Was this hook intended to parallel the Grim Reaper's scythe?  The personification of Death in many cultures often wields a farm tool with a curved blade. Even Death of the Endless is occasionally shown with a scythe. I've seen many ""fan arts"" of Marethyu's hook online (as far as I could tell, none official), and most look something like Captain Hook's hook, and not much like a scythe. I don't remember any of the book's descriptions of this hook's appearance, but it has to appear as something that can fit on the end of one's arm, which obviously means that though it is a curved blade, it does not appear exactly as a scythe does.  Physical appearance aside, is there any indication from the books that Marethyu/Death's hook is supposed to be a scythe? A trivial Google search didn't turn up anything relevant. "
1328,Are there earlier incidences than Merchant of Venice of an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other?,"In act 2, scene 2 of The Merchant of Venice, Launcelot Gobbo is conflicted regarding whether to run from Shylock, or continue working for him. Shakespeare expresses this internal conflict by describing the conscience on one side and a fiend on the other (at his elbow). This is an image which has found its place in popular culture over the years (an angel on one shoulder and a devil on another).  But did Shakespeare get it from somewhere? Are there earlier (literary, biblical, cultural etc) sources for this device? "
1329,When was Marlowe's Doctor Faustus written?,"I read in a recent answer that ""Marlowe's plays are generally hard to date and Doctor Faustus was probably written between 1589 and 1592"", and this intriguing situation struck me as something that would make an excellent question.  Wikipedia agrees that the play was written ""sometime between 1589 and 1592"", but I'd like to know what the information is here. How do we know it was after 1589 and before 1592, and why don't we know any more than that?  In short, what is the information regarding the publication time of Doctor Faustus? "

1331,A quote from the introduction of Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Women,"Here is a sentence from her introduction.     I earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consists - I wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength, both of mind and body, and to convince them that the soft phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness, and that those beings who are only the objects of pity and that kind of love, which has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.   What are the ""siblings"" in this really long sentence? Here is the part of the sentence which I suppose should give the context. I replace ""those beings"" with women.     Delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness, and that [women] who are only the objects of pity and that kind of love, which has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.   My guess is that the pair is ""weakness"" and ""pity."" Grammatically, how is ""pity"" associated with ""weakness""? "
1332,"Is there really a single ""Old Babylonian version"" of the Epic of Gilgamesh?","From the Wikipedia article about the Epic of Gilgamesh:     From the diverse sources found, two main versions of the epic have been partially reconstructed: the standard Akkadian version, or He who saw the deep, and the Old Babylonian version, or Surpassing all other kings. Five earlier Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh have been partially recovered, some with primitive versions of specific episodes in the Akkadian version, others with unrelated stories.   It seems that the standard Akkadian version was discovered all in one place, at the ancient Library of Ashurbanipal, and it was clear that all of these tablets were part of a single unified story. About the Old Babylonian version, by contrast, Wikipedia says:     This version of the epic, called in some fragments Surpassing all other kings, is composed of tablets and fragments from diverse origins and states of conservation. It remains incomplete in its majority, with several tablets missing and big lacunae in those found. They are named after their current location or the place where they were found.   ... and then goes on to list various tablets found in ones and twos at diverse locations (the Pennsylvania tablet, the Nippur school tablet, the Tell Harmal tablets, the Ishchali tablet, the Sippar tablet, etc.), many of which roughly overlap with parts of the story told in the standard Akkadian version.  What is the evidence that all of these scattered tablets are parts of a unified whole? In other words, why do they talk about an ""Old Babylonian version"" rather than fragments of what might be various different versions in contrast with the single long Akkadian version? "
1333,Where does the name Childermass come from?,"Returning to the tale of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, it occurred to me to wonder where Childermass (probably my favourite character) got his name from. Wikipedia informed me that ""Childermass"" is the name of the feast day of the Holy Innocents - today! - but the connection, if any, with the character is unclear to me. There are also other characters and titles in literature named Childermass, who could equally have inspired the name of John Childermass.  Is there any connection between John Childermass and today's feast day of Childermass? Or, is there any evidence for what inspired the name of the character Childermass? "
1334,"What does Camus mean by ""the disastrous fact that love and desire must be expressed in the same way""?","Here is a set of lines from the book A Happy Death by Albert Camus:     In the past, whenever Mersault had spent any time with one woman, he made the first gestures of commitment, he was conscious of the disastrous fact that love and desire must be expressed in the same way, and he would think about the end of the affair before even taking her in his arms.   I want to know what Camus meant by the disastrous fact that love and desire must be expressed in the same way?And what did mean by desire here? "
1335,Why did iambic pentameter become so 'standard' in classical English poetry?,"Iambic pentameter is probably the most prevailing and widely used meter in classical English poetry, and it's the 'standard' form of verse in many forms of poetry such as sonnets. From Wikipedia (admittedly not the best of sources):     The most frequently encountered metre of English verse is the iambic pentameter, in which the metrical norm is five iambic feet per line, though metrical substitution is common and rhythmic variations practically inexhaustible. John Milton's Paradise Lost, most sonnets, and much else besides in English are written in iambic pentameter. Lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter are commonly known as blank verse. Blank verse in the English language is most famously represented in the plays of William Shakespeare and the great works of Milton, though Tennyson (Ulysses, The Princess) and Wordsworth (The Prelude) also make notable use of it.   How and why did iambic pentameter become so prevalent? Why this particular choice of meter, and how did it happen - e.g. was there one particularly prominent writer who favoured it and influenced others?  Related, but not duplicates:   Why did Shakespeare write in iambic pentameter? Why did the alexandrine become the &quot;natural&quot; metre for French verse drama, whereas English renaissance drama adopted the iambic pentameter?  "

1337,What does Athena’s statement to Zeus at the beginning of The Odyssey reveal?,"I was told to analyze this passage in book 1 of The Odyssey, having read only books 1-4:     And sparkling-eyed Athena drove the matter home: “Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king, surely he goes down to a death he earned in full!   Let them all die so, all who do such things.   But my heart breaks for Odysseus,   that seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long—   far from his loved ones still, he suffers torments   off on a wave-washed island rising at the center of the seas. A dark wooded island, and there a goddess makes her home, daughter of Atlas, wicked Titan who sounds the deep   in all its depths, whose shoulders lift on high   the colossal pillars thrusting earth and sky apart.   Atlas’ daughter it is who holds Odysseus captive,   luckless man—despite his tears, forever trying   to spellbind his heart with suave, seductive words   and wipe all thought of Ithaca from his mind.   But he, straining for no more than a glimpse   of hearth-smoke drifting up from his own land,   Odysseus longs to die ...   Olympian Zeus, have you no care for him in your lofty heart?   Did he never win your favor with sacrifices   burned beside the ships on the broad plain of Troy? Why, Zeus, why so dead set against Odysseus?”   Here are my takeaways:   Athena is obviously very affectionate for Odysseus. Regardless of whether they have any history, I’m suspecting that Athena cares for him as he is essentially her male/mortal counterpart-he is known as a very wise/cunning man, and known for his valor in war, while Athena is the goddess of wisdom and battle. I suspect that she is affectionate for him in the same way that a master is affectionate for their skilled apprentice, although I don’t know how to explicitly support this claim with this passage The Gods seem to favor punishment/use violence as a means for resolving issues. Zeus looks at most humans as corrupt, using Aegisthus as an example. Athena, on the other hand, seems to believe that not all humans are bad, and seeks a way to help them, in this passage she advocates for helping Odysseus, and later on she assists Telemachus in finding his father, as well as helping comfort Penelope, reassuring her that her son was in good hands. The gods seem to have traits typically assigned to their respective gender, the male gods being violent, and the goddesses being kind and compassionate. This, along with other evidence like Zeus deciding to help free Odysseus behind Poseidon’s back, justifying it with essentially “we can overpower him” shows that the gods aren’t necessarily these enlighten beings, they seem to have many of the traits/flaws characteristic to humans I also noticed how Athena, despite having traits commonly possessed by women, acts as a fatherly figure to Telemachus. She guides him on this journey, trying to help him achieve manhood by telling him he has to kill the suitors, be confident, and brave. This isn’t entirely related to the passage but ties into my first observation, although I’m not really certain what the significance of this is. I noticed how Zeus seems to be a fairly poor leader. Almost immediately after Athena makes her point Zeus says that the gods have not freed Odysseus because of Poseidon, but then decides that they should go against him with his only reasoning being that if Poseidon acts out against it, the other gods could overpower him. It seems as if not much has to be said to convince him, however this is the only example I have so far.   Are my takeaways accurate? I feel like there’s not many more observations I can make, though I feel like there’s so much more this passage says about Athena and the gods as a whole. I feel as if some parts of my takeaways are already reaches and don’t know what else is so significant about it. Did I hit on any good points? "
1338,"Regarding a conversation between Miss. Price, Miss. Crawford and Edmund in Mansfield Park by Jane Austen","I am reading chapter 11 of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen. There is a conversation going on between Fanny, Edmund, and Mrs. Crawford. In the book the conversation is going on without explicitly mentioning who is the speaker. Since there are three speakers, I am unable to follow who is speaking the following sentences. If anyone could help me regarding who is speaking which sentence, it would be of great help.     Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.      ""Your father's return will be a very interesting event.""      ""It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but   including so many dangers.""      ""It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your   sister's marriage, and your taking orders.""      ""Yes.""      ""Don't be affronted,"" said she, laughing, ""but it does put me in mind   of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great   exploits in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their   safe return.""      ""There is no sacrifice in the case,"" replied Edmund, with a serious   smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; ""it is entirely her own   doing.""      ""Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than   what every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being   extremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not   understand.""      ""My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria's   marrying."" ""It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's   convenience should accord so well. There is a very good living kept   for you, I understand, hereabouts.""      ""Which you suppose has biassed me?""      ""But that I am sure it has not,"" cried Fanny.      ""Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would   affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a   provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that   it should. There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I   see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that   he will have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I   should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure   my father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt   that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly.""      ""It is the same sort of thing,"" said Fanny, after a short pause, ""as   for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general   to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody   wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve   them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they   appear.""      ""No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either   navy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its   favour: heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are   always acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers   and sailors.""      ""But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of   preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?"" said Edmund. ""To be   justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty   of any provision.""      ""What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed;   absolute madness.""      ""Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither   to take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would   not know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman   from your own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings   which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and   sailor in their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and   fashion, are all against him, he ought to be less liable to the   suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of   his.""      ""Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made,   to the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of   doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat.   It is indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a   want of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of   inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men   clergymen. A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and   selfish—read the newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his   wife. His curate does all the work, and the business of his own life   is to dine.""      ""There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so   common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general   character. I suspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say)   commonplace censure, you are not judging from yourself, but from   prejudiced persons, whose opinions you have been in the habit of   hearing. It is impossible that your own observation can have given you   much knowledge of the clergy. You can have been personally acquainted   with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively. You are   speaking what you have been told at your uncle's table.""      ""I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion   is general, it is usually correct. Though I have not seen much of the   domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any   deficiency of information.""      ""Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are   condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,   or (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals,   perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or   bad, they were always wishing away.""      ""Poor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the   Antwerp,"" was a tender apostrophe of Fanny's, very much to the purpose   of her own feelings if not of the conversation.      ""I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,""   said Miss Crawford, ""that I can hardly suppose—and since you push me   so hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of   seeing what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my   own brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging   to me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good   scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very   respectable, I see him to be an indolent, selfish bon vivant, who must   have his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger   for the convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a   blunder, is out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth,   Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a   disappointment about a green goose, which he could not get the better   of. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it.""      ""I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great   defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of   self-indulgence; and to see your sister suffering from it must be   exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against   us. We cannot attempt to defend Dr. Grant.""      ""No,"" replied Fanny, ""but we need not give up his profession for all   that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have   taken a—not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy   or army, have had a great many more people under his command than he   has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor   or soldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that   whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been   in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly   profession, where he would have had less time and obligation—where he   might have escaped that knowledge of himself, the frequency, at least,   of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is   now. A man—a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of   teaching others their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every   Sunday, and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he   does, without being the better for it himself. It must make him think;   and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself   than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman.""      ""We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better   fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness   depends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a   good-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him   quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday   night.""      ""I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,"" said Edmund   affectionately, ""must be beyond the reach of any sermons."" Fanny   turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time to   say, in a pleasant manner, ""I fancy Miss Price has been more used to   deserve praise than to hear it""; when, being earnestly invited by the   Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,   leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all   her many virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and   graceful tread.

1339,What does it mean when Ralph is thinking about Piggy's death in Lord of the Flies by Golding,"I have a question about this quote:     ""He yearned for a bed and sheets- but the only whiteness here was the slow spilt milk, luminous round the rock forty feet below, where Piggy had fallen. Piggy was everywhere, was on this neck, was become terrible in darkness and death.""   I think the ""spilt milk"" is referring to a problem, but what does it mean by whiteness? I guess it is related to the bed and sheet, does it refer to the cleanliness that civilization has?  That last sentence is what is mainly confusing me. ""Piggy was everywhere"" probably means that Ralph's mind is filled with Piggy, ""was on this neck"" probably refers to Piggy being on that neck of land, but what does Golding mean by ""was become terrible in darkness and death""? "
1340,Difference between Indian and English lyricism besides language?,"Suppose we sing or rap about dark themes (depression, alcohol, drugs, violence, sex) similar to modern American music from 1970-present day in Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, or Malayalam over Indian classical-Rock, Pop or Hip Hop fusion. Would the lyrics sound as modern; sounding similar in sound/delivery, flow/melody, and meaning as English lyrics? Could it be as common (used in everyday conversation), complex (lyrical), explicit (swearing, slang), or controversial?   I say this because I'm an American from Indian Origin. Dark themes hardly exist in Indian music and if it does it's extremely poetic with references to nature (sun, flower, moon), dresses (veils, saris, fabric), organs (heart, liver) and gods. Their music remains very ancient and hardly modernized to this day.  Some songs with dark themes (I read English translations) exist in India but few are well-known :  keh ke lunga (Hindi) (Uses slang, Refers to Intimidation and Violence)  Ganda hai (Hindi) (Intimidation)  Beware (Punjabi) (Intimidation)  Emotional Attyachar (Hindi) (Depression)  Hikknaal (Punjabi) (Comical reference to violence)  In Independent music there is a rise in rock (apocalyptic themes, depression) and rap (struggle, representing neighborhood, alcohol, sexual references to women):  Bandeh (Hindi) (Apocalyptic)  Jimikki Kamal (Malayalam) (College Slang, Alchoholism)  Iraiva (Tamil) (Suicide, Violence)  Char Bottle Vodka (Alcoholism, Sexual References to Women)  Represent (Indus Vally Remix) (Representing Neighborhood, Violence, Swearing, Intimidation)  Mere Gully mein (Initimidation, Representing Neighborhood, Violence)  But some of these songs hardly contain elements of Indian classical music so it’s hard to say it’s musically “familiar” to Indian ears.  Most of these songs use poetic lyricism but we see some songs (Represent, Mere Gully Mein) use more common everyday language. However, the most well-known rap songs (char bottle vodka) refer to alcohol and women but are not as lyrically sophisticated (dull compared to English).  So can Hindi lyricism sound as modern (using dark themes) as English over a beat. "
1341,"What does ""ceremony of innocence"" mean In ""The Second Coming""?"," The Second Coming by W.B. Yeats:     Turning and turning in the widening gyre   The falcon cannot hear the falconer;   Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;   Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,   The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   The ceremony of innocence is drowned;   The best lack all conviction, while the worst   Are full of passionate intensity.        Surely some revelation is at hand;   Surely the Second Coming is at hand.   The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi   Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   The darkness drops again; but now I know   That twenty centuries of stony sleep   Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?     What does the phrase ""The ceremony of innocence"" mean here? From a quick look online, one interpretation I found is that the ceremony of innocence refers to christian baptism, but that doesn't sound quite right to me (how do you drown an actual ceremony?).   One idea I had is that maybe ""ceremony of innocence"" refers to people pretending to be innocent, so the lines ""The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\ The ceremony of innocence is drowned;"" mean that humanities evil deeds (the blood-dimmed tide) are so numerous that there is no point for anyone to pretend to be innocent.  Can anyone suggest other interpretations? "
1342,"What does ""get to"" mean in ""Hillbilly Elegy""?","I have been reading a book titled ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" and I have its Korean translation too. But at some part, especially which I am curious about in meaning, the translation seems so uncertain, so I want someone who is a native English speaker to let me know what this ""get to"" means here.  If you already read the book, it might be much better. But no problem. Here is part of the book, which will help you understand the meaning.     ... Most of this tradition was far from child appropriate. Almost all of it involved the kind of violence that should land someone in jail. Much of it centered on how the county in which Jackson was situated--Breathitt--earned its alliterative nickname, ""Bloody Breathitt."" There were many expectations, but they all had one theme: The people of Breathitt hated certain things, and they didn't need the law to snuff them out.      One of the most common tales of Breathitt's gore revolved around an older man in town who was accused of raping a young girl. Mamaw told me that, days before his trial, the man was found facedown in a local lake with sixteen bullet wounds in his back. The authorities never investigated the murder, and the only mention of the incident appeared in the local newspaper on the morning his body was discovered. In an admirable display of journalistic pith, the paper reported: ""Man found dead. Foul play expected."" ""Foul play expected?"" my grandmother would roar. ""You're goddamned right. Bloody Breathitt got to that son of a bitch."" ]   What is the exact meaning of this ""got to""? Please let me know really specifically. Plus could you also explain the meaning of ""my grandmother would roar"" here? The tense of ""would"" is always confusing. "
1343,"What does ""pick up shop"" mean in ""Hillbilly Elegy""?","Let me share some part of the book, and I would appreciate if you give me the answer to my question.     There were undoubtedly many of these children and grandchildren, as hillbillies tended to have much higher birthrates than the native population.      In short, my grandparents' experience was extremely common. Significant parts of an entire region picked up shop and moved north. Need more proof? Hop on an northbound highway in Kentucky or Tenessee the day after Thanksgiving or Christmas, and virtually every license plate you see comes from Ohio, Indiana, or Michigan--cars full of hillbilly transplants returning home for the holidays.   In Korean version, it is translated into like ""Significant parts of an entire region moved north along plants(or factories)"" or ""Significant parts of an entire region moved north, looking for plants(or factories).""  I don't understand what ""pick up"" means here, what's more I don't get the hang of ""shop"" here. Does it any mean factories or plants? It is even used without an article, really confusing. "
1344,Meaning of the prose of Monsieur Jourdain,"I just stumbled across the expression in Molière's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme of Monsieur Jourdain having been speaking prose for all of his life.  As far as I understand this is used today as a metaphor (correct rhetoric figure?) for if someone is doing something of high achievement without noticing himself. The point which I do not understand is the bit that it's ""prose"" what he is speaking. According to my knowledge prose is anything except the bound language of lyrics. So it includes the normal everyday spoken language, doesn't it? In this understanding I would think that the figure of Monsieur Jourdain discovering that he spoke prose is a mere joke without noticing is that he actually just discovered an euphemism for a plain common thing, but his fascination for the sound of the euphemic expression is larger than his understanding of the meaning.  Apparently my understanding is in mismatch with the common usage, so I wonder what am I missing? "

""Please nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny where 'twas a bad one, sir--ma'am I mane.""   ""Quite correct. Now here are ten shillings in addition as a small present, as I am a new comer.""

1346,Who ran the small errands in 19th century London?,"Philip Pullman's The Ruby in the Smoke is set in 19th century London. Four of the main characters, Sally, Fred, Rosa, and Trembler, are running a small photographic studio. They are not particularly well-off, and they do a lot of household chores on their own. However, at some point they host a small celebration, and Pullman uses the following phrasing (end of chapter eight):     Once that was settled, Sally felt a glow of happiness; and to celebrate their agreement, Frederick sent out for a hot meat-pie from the chop-house around the corner.    Apparently, since Pullman says ""sent out"", none of the main characters went to the chop-house on their own, as I would expect. Who did they send to get a meat-pie for them? Were there street urchins running small errands for the homeowners?  "
1347,Can we assume the 'Savages' go unpunished?,"In the end of The Lord of the Flies, the boys' rescuer, the Naval Officer, does not comprehend what is really happening, terming it ""all fun and games"".  Can we assume that the savages, especially Jack and Roger, go totally unpunished?  Ralph is there to speak against them, but he is practically the only one (littleuns don't really count) and he participated in the killing of Simon. This means that telling the Adults is incriminating himself as well.  So will the 'savages' grow up secretly knowing that savagery goes unpunished? "

1350,"Meaning of some phrases and lines in ""Quality"" by John Galsworthy","I am reading ""Quality"" by John Galsworthy and there are some phrases and lines which I could not grasp. I thought that this site would be the perfect place to ask this question. Below are some lines from the story from the beginning.     I knew him from the days of my extreme youth, because he made my father's boots; inhabiting with his elder brother two little shops let into one, in a small by-street--now no more, but then most fashionably placed in the West End.      That tenement had a certain quiet distinction; there was no sign upon its face that he made for any of the Royal Family--merely his own German name of Gessler Brothers; and in the window a few pairs of boots.      I remember that it always troubled me to account for those unvarying boots in the window, for he made only what was ordered, reaching nothing down, and it seemed so inconceivable that what he made could ever have failed to fit. Had he bought them to put there? That, too, seemed inconceivable. He would never have tolerated in his house leather on which he had not worked himself.      Besides, they were too beautiful--the pair of pumps, so inexpressibly slim, the patent leathers with cloth tops, making water come into one's mouth, the tall brown riding boots with marvelous sooty glow, as if, though new, they had been worn a hundred years. Those pairs could only have been made by one who saw before him the Soul of Boot--so truly were they prototypes incarnating the very spirit of all foot-gear.       These thoughts, of course, came to me later, though even when I was promoted to him, at the age of perhaps fourteen, some inkling haunted me of the dignity of himself and brother. For to make boots--such boots as he made--seemed to me then, and still seems to me, mysterious and wonderful.   My Questions:    What does the phrase ""two little shops let into one"" mean? Does it mean that Does it mean that the shop consisted of two ""shops"" and there was one entrance into the shop? What does the phrase ""reaching nothing down"" mean? I think it means that he did not make more shoes than required, that is, he only made what was required. What does ""the tall brown riding boots with marvelous sooty glow, as if, though new, they had been worn a hundred years"" mean? I think it means that by looking at those shoes one could understand that the shoes were the epitome of endurance. What does ""These thoughts, of course, came to me later, though even when I was promoted to him, at the age of perhaps fourteen, some inkling haunted me of the dignity of himself and brother."" mean? I am unsure of its meaning. What does ""When one grew old and wild and ran up bills, one somehow never ran them up with Gessler Brothers. It would not have seemed becoming to go in there and stretch out one’s foot to that blue iron-spectacled glance, owing him for more than — say — two pairs, just the comfortable reassurance that one was still his client."" mean? I think that the first sentence means that the shoes made by him were affordable so one never fell into debts with them. I am unsure of the second part of the paragraph.   Thanks for your help. "
1351,"What is the significance of the name ""Kopy-Keck"" in The Light Princess?","In ""The Light Princess"" by George MacDonald, the king consults ""two very wise Chinese philosophers"" about the princess's condition.1 The philosophers are named ""Hum-Drum"" and ""Kopy-Keck."" The story is full of puns, and these faux-Chinese names would seem to be no exception.  Hum-Drum is described as ""a Materialist... slow and sententious""; his name is clearly a play on the word humdrum: ""lacking variety or excitement; dull; boring."" So far, so good.  However, I'm not coming up with a similar play on words for Kopy-Keck, who is ""a Spiritualist... quick and flighty."" Kopy sounds like ""copy,"" perhaps, but ""Keck"" has me stumped. (I don't think the sense of ""to vomit"" has any bearing!)  This Quora post suggests ""copycat,"" but I am unconvinced:   The post's author tries to explain the connection between ""copycat"" and ""quick and flighty"" by saying that cats are quick; but cats don't really have anything to do with the usual meaning of ""copycat."" Etymonline informs that ""copycat"" is first attested in American English in 1884, although the word is ""probably at least a generation older""; still, it seems unlikely that MacDonald, a Scottish writer, would be making a pun on the term in a story published in 1864, twenty years earlier.   And in any case, it's unclear that Kopy-Keck has a tendency to ""copy"" anything. He propounds a theory that the princess has no gravity because her soul is from another planet and therefore is not attracted to the Earth, and he suggests that she can be cured by being taught extensively about the Earth so that she takes an interest in it. I can see the connection here to being a ""Spiritualist,"" but that's it.  So, the question: What is the significance of the name Kopy-Keck? Is it a pun or play on words? If so, on what?    1 Chapter 7, ""Try Metaphysics""--available at Project Gutenberg "

1354,"What did Pope intend to say by ""Whatever is, is right""?","Source: The Well-Educated Mind (2 edn 2016), p. 86 Middle.        Related to this is one final question: What is fiction meant to do? Why are you    reading a novel at all? Are you expecting to find out some truth about human nature?    Should a novel reveal some difficult, hard-to-face truth about ourselves? Do novels    show the inevitable end of certain paths? Or are they, instead, agents of moral    change? Do they show us models so that we can amend our ways? This idea—that    fiction provides us with a model—itself has a certain assumption behind it: There is    some standard of human behavior which applies to all of us, in all cultures, and our    quest in life is to uncover it.     The opposing idea was once expressed by Alexander Pope in the phrase,    ""Whatever is, is right."" The novel doesn't set out an ideal, because to assume that    there is such a thing as an unchanging standard of behavior governing all people at all    times is narrow minded and myopic. The novel has no business in providing models.    It simply explores realities: It opens numerous doors for you to peer through, but    makes no suggestions as to which threshold you should cross.

1355,"Equestrian statues and wooden logs, what's the connection?","Here's a quote from Tomas de Quincey's ""Confessions of an English Opium-Eater"":     Turkish opium-eaters, it seems, are absurd enough to sit, like so many equestrian statues, on logs of wood as stupid as themselves.

My question, though, is about the connection between equestrian statues and wooden logs. As I can see from Wiki (sorry for Wiki, but this article clearly has good references), those statues are made of stone, marble etc. What statues is Quincey talking about? Is it a specific kind of equestrian statues? Was it typical for some period in the history to build such statues? Are those some toys for children he's referring to? "

1358,"Why was the ending of ""And Then There Were None"" changed for the stage version?","Agatha Christie's famous crime story And Then There Were None was written both as a book and later as a play by Christie herself. However, when adapting her own story for the stage, she made a significant change to the ending, namely ...     Warning: major spoilers follow!   ... in the book, every single one of the ten people on the island ends up being killed, even the true mastermind behind it all; while the play has a happier ending, in which Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard are innocent and manage to escape the island together.  The Wikipedia page for the play (cited to Christie's autobiography, which I didn't find online) says:     She knew the ending would have to be changed as all of the characters die in the book and therefore ""I must make two of the characters innocent, to be reunited at the end and come safe out of the ordeal.""   In contrast, other stage versions of the story (including one from 1944, only a year after Christie's own play) have preserved the book's dismal ending.  Why did Christie change her play's ending from the novel's? Was she afraid that nobody would like a story in which all the main characters die - and if so, why did such qualms apply to the play more than to the original novel? "
1359,What happens at the end of Book 1 of Evelyn Waugh's Scoop?,"I'm reading Scoop by Evelyn Waugh. I thought I was fully comprehending the story, until the return of John Boot at the end of Book 1.     When they had gone, Mrs. Stitch said: ""I must go too. Just tell me in three words what happened. The last thing I heard was from Lord Copper. He telephoned to say you had left.""      ""Not a word from him. It's been very awkward.""      ""The American girl?""      ""Yes, exactly. We said good bye a fortnight ago. She gave me a lucky pig to wear round my neck — it was made of bog-oak from Tipperary. We were both very genuinely affected. Since then I haven't dared go out or answer the telephone. I only came here because I knew she wouldn't be coming.""      ""Poor John. I wonder what went wrong... I like the bit about the pig very much.""   What American girl? What does this have to do with the wrong Boot being sent?  If I am not supposed to know at this point in the story, i.e. I'm supposed to be confused, then please only state that much visibly, and use spoiler syntax for any further explanation.  (My reading club is stopping at Book 1 this week and no one's supposed to read ahead, which is why I can't just keep reading. If the rest of my co-readers are confused as well, I'd like to have an explanation for them, so I ask here. I have tried to look for plot summaries online but see nothing focused on Book 1 except on bookrags.com, behind a paywall.) "
1360,A story in which a young girl saves a poor boy from a factory owner and meets that boy decades later,"Yesterday, I was reading a 5th grader's comprehension book. It had multiple excerpts from good (if not well-known) novels.  One of them particularly stood out to me. It was about a woman who lived in the Victorian era. When she was a young girl, Victoria was crowned. On her coronation day, the protagonist and her sister couldn't handle the huge crowd and so started walking down a less busy road. There they see a sickly boy of their age lying on the ground. He tells them that he'd escaped from the factory he worked in. The master used to beat underage workers and kept them in alarmingly unsuitable conditions.  Her older sister is considerably disgusted by him and tells her to leave him as is. Not listening to her, she helps him stand up and is kind to him. He begs them to let him escape so that he can live a better life. And he implores her not to say which way he went if the master came searching for him.  Soon the dreaded master comes and gets hold of the boy. He is rough and tells the girls that this is the way of life for the poor — harsh. He himself worked in factories as a boy and believes the poor have no way but to work hard. In the meantime, the boy slips off his grip and manages to flee. The master gives up then and heads back to the factory.  Many years later, she reminisces about that day as she attends Queen Victoria's funeral. She has become old and can't push her way through the crowd. A gentleman helps her pass the crowd and when she turns to thank him, she smiles and sees that exact same scar the boy had on the man's face.  Is this simply a short story or part of a novel? Which book is it taken from then? "
1361,Did Conan Doyle's belief in the supernatural influence his fiction writings in any way?,"Arthur Conan Doyle was a believer in the supernatural. My source here is from the Muse magazine, published by Cricket Media, in the October 2011 issue, page 6, by Doug Stewart.      One of the English celebrities who came to see the mystifying American perform that year [1920] was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the mystery writer. Conan Doyle was as famous around the world as Houdini was, thanks to his wildly popular detective stories starring crime solver Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur's admirers may have assumed that he, like the brainy sleuth he had created, was committed to keen observation, hard evidence, and logical reasoning.   If so, they were wrong. Conan Doyle believed in fairies, ghosts, haunted houses, and messages from beyond the grave. He rushed backstage after one of Houdini's performances, and the pair talked well into the night. Sir Arthur believed that certain people, called mediums, had supernatural abilities. He was convinced that Houdini was one of them.   But did this belief in the supernatural influence his writings at all? Do we see any evidence of this in the Sherlock Holmes stories, or any of his other fiction works?  "

Or come in the evening, at any rate.   I understand (from here; first paragraph) that the Liberal Unionists were allied with the Tories (hence ""they dine with us""), but what does she mean by ""or come in the evening""? "
1363,"Is ""Listen Nations"" referring to any incident in particular?","""Listen Nations"" is one of the songs on the album Miami Meets Toronto, in which the Miami Boys Choir and the Toronto Boys Choir (both started by Yerachmiel Begun) sing together. The song is about the suffering of people, and the nations of the world not caring. The chorus is:     And when I saw it   The thought I could not bear   My fellow people dying   Their cries no one did hear   So listen nations   To the voices of those so dear    I added the lyrics to musixmatch.com, so you can view the lyrics.   But is this song referring to anything in particular? I.e., the Holocaust (it's Jewish music, BTW). If so, is there anything in the text that shows this?  "
1364,What is the difference between a philosophical novel and a novel of ideas?,"Wikipedia calls the novel of ideas a subgenre of philosophical fiction, without defining the first term. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory (2010) uses the terms ""novel of ideas"" and ""philosophical novel"" interchangeably.  In articles published together in the New York Times in 2016 under the headline ""Whatever Happened to the Novel of Ideas?"", Benjamin Moser also uses the terms to mean the same thing, and Pankaj Mishra, while eschewing the word ""philosophy"", draws no distinction between them. Writing in the Financial Times in 2012, Jenny Erdal describes the two forms as ""close cousin(s)"", but she does not explain the difference.  There does, however, seem to be general agreement that the novel of ideas is quite rare nowadays.  Since not all ideas are philosophical, I do not favour a definition of the novel of ideas as a type of philosophical novel, it seeming that if one is a subtype of the other then the relationship should be the converse. But in that case, what definitions might we use? And if neither wholly includes the other, and therefore each has instances that are not instances of the other, how might we define the two genres as ""close cousins""?  Google's Ngram viewer returns the following for the use of the two terms over time:    I have looked briefly at a number of other sources, including encyclopedias. While several define the two terms as equivalent, several others do not. But I have so far found only one source that offers clearly contrasting definitions, namely Leszek Kolek's 1975 PhD thesis. The author defines one of his aims as being to provide ""a definition and description of the genre called 'novel of ideas' on the basis of (Aldous) Huxley’s fiction"". Achieving his aim, he describes its distinctive features as being found in   its “material”: that is, explicit ideas appearing in the fictional reality; a reduced semantic significance of character and plot; a semantic and structural balance between explicit and implicit modes of presentation,   where an explicit idea is ""an abstract, syncretic and explicit statement analysed in essayistic utterances of the characters, the narrator’s comments, and in various forms of quotations"" (p.106).  He goes on to say that the novel of ideas differs from the philosophical novel ""owing to the syncretic character of explicit ideas"" and its ""lack of a 'thesis'"", the implication being that a philosophical novel shares the above three features except that its explicit ideas are non-syncretic and it contains a thesis. (It could also be that he means to suggest that the expression of ideas in a philosophical novel is achieved using means that have a greater proportion of the implicit rather than the explicit, but he does not say so explicitly.) Kolek qualifies the distinction, however, by acknowledging that ""we"" lack a precise definition of the philosophical novel (p.107).   How far this gets us, I am not sure. "
1365,"What was the original ""The Sound of Silence"" about?","I've had this version, by the Maccabeats, of the classic song ""The Sound of Silence"" stuck in my head for a while. (because @Shokhet linked me to it.... -_-)  This version, by Jew in the City and the Maccabeats, makes a point about cellphones (via the music video). Such as at 1:39:    and 0:52:    However, the original version by Simon and Garfunkel, was not about cellphones - the cell phone was invented in 1973, and ""The Sound of Silence"" was recorded in 1963/1964.  So - what was the original message of the song? What caused the sound of silence? "
1366,"Does this passage in ""I Am a Cat"" reference a real Western novel?","In Chapter 2 of I Am a Cat (full text of this and preceding chapters available here), the cat makes reference to a particular ""western novel"" in order to draw an analogy with his master:     “Ah, and who were the women?” enviously my master asks. At first glance my master usually looks cold and hard; but, to tell the truth, he is by no means indifferent to women. He once read in a Western novel of a man who invariably fell partially in love with practically every woman that he met. Another character in the book somewhat sarcastically observed that, as a rough calculation, that fellow fell in love with just under seven-tenths of the women he passed in the street. On reading this, my master was struck by its essential truth and remained deeply impressed. Why should a man so impressionable lead such an oysterish existence? A mere cat such as I cannot possibly understand it. Some say it is the result of a love affair that went wrong; some say it is due to his weak stomach; while others simply state that it’s because he lacks both money and audacity. Whatever the truth, it doesn’t much matter since he’s a person of insufficient importance to affect the history of his period. What is certain is that he did enquire enviously about Coldmoon’s female fiddlers.   (emphasis mine)  Is there a real ""Western novel"" being referred to here, and if so, what is it? I'm always curious about little intertextual references like this, and it'd be a shame if it turned out to be an idea the author had made up out of whole cloth. "
1367,"Is the song ""Mabel Grey"" by Brown Bird an allusion to a real ship?","The song Mabel Grey, by Brown Bird contains peculiar lyrics.   The lyrics are awfully specific about what happened to this ship, which is a common pattern I see when a song is referent to a real-life event. It's reminiscent of Barrett's Privateers, in that it appears like it could be referring to a specific event, and is written in the form of a historical allusion.  But, while Barrett's Privateers is fictional, it contains the details needed to tell a full story. Mabel Grey here seems to be a snapshot of some existing story - its descriptions are both cursory and rather specific, leaving a great number of holes for the listener to either fill in, or, alternately, understand within a pre-existing context.  That leads me to wonder if the Mabel Grey was a real ship and person. There certainly have been both ships and people named ""Mabel Grey"" (or, Gray). Notably, two schooners that wrecked have borne the name: one sunk on March 11, 1904, off the coast of California, and the other has an entry on ShipIndex, but doesn't seem to have any other public information.   These are my best guesses as to where I would start. But I really have no clue.  Is this song referring to a real event? If not, is it new fabrication, or does it refer to something else? "
1368,Are the inconsistencies in Harry Potter symbolic or allegorical?,"(I asked a more verbose version of this question on Sci Fi &amp; Fantasy where it didn't go down well. It seemed to get bogged down in whether or not the Potterverse really is ""inconsistent"". But I feel it's an interesting topic which might go down better here.)  The Harry Potter books are a ripping yarn, but the logical consistency of their setting tends to play second fiddle to the demands of character and story. It is hard to see how many aspects of Wizard society and economy might function and is the cause of many fan questions.  Of course, there are no rules to say fantasy worlds have to make logical sense. The fashion, since Tolkien, is that they should. But prior to him (and a few later examples), wild flights of fancy were the norm. Kazuro Ishiguro is on record has saying he's not interested in whether his fantasy worlds make any sense, merely in whether they work to help examine his chosen themes.  This makes me wonder whether these omissions may have been partially deliberate on the part of the author. What if Rowling intentionally made aspects of the wizarding world nonsensical in order to make points about modern society?  Take Quidditch. It leaves much to be desired as a sport, yet many Wizards seem oblivious and remain fanatically devoted to it. Could this not be read as a wry commentary on the fanatical devotion shown by many sports fans to what are, after all, relatively inconsequential pursuits? And the ""poor"" nature of some Wizarding families in spite of the magic available to them. Again, perhaps a comment on how a rich western society still relegates some people to live in poverty, in spite of the wealth of the nation?  Has Rowling ever intimated, or is there any additional evidence, that some or all of the logical inconsistency in her invented world should be read as allegory or metaphor? "
1369,"What is the explanation for the two versions of Lucifer's fall from Heaven in ""The Sandman"" and ""Lucifer""?","In Season of Mists, the fifth book of The Sandman series, in chapter 2, Lucifer explains that rebelled against god, and was cast out of Heaven to Hell, along with his lieutenants.     This version of Lucifer and his fall was inspired by John Milton's Paradise Lost (could use a comparison, though).  In the last, 75th issue of Lucifer, a different story is told. Lucifer rebelled, yes, but the wasn't cast down - he was offered to rule the (then barely-existing) realm of Hell, as a compromise, by his Father. This would put Lucifer as far away from Heaven and God as possibly, which is all he wanted.      Click for full pages   The pages from Lucifer are Lucifer's memories, meaning they can't be wrong. The Sandman pages, on the other hand, can - maybe Lucifer was lying to Morpheus, who knows?  When Lucifer fell, his wings (which used to be white and feathery) burned and became bat-like. However, we can see that in Lucifer, he didn't fall and his wings were left unscathed. And yet, in Lucifer #8 (""The House of Windowless Rooms pt. 4), Susano-o-no-Mikoto says that separated from Lucifer (as Morpheus cut them off), his wings ""healed"", meaning they returned from their bat-like shape to the normal angelic shape.    Click for full page   And even in Lucifer #75 (""All We Need of Hell""), he is seen with his bat-like wings, in a faithful reproduction of the same scene from Season of Mists:    Click for full page   Therefore, in The Sandman Lucifer fell (literally), and his wings burned, as seen in Season of Mists. In Lucifer, it is implied that he fell, because his wings are burnt as well, but his own recollection is that he didn't fall, but simply left Heaven.   At first, I wanted to chalk this up to the simple reason - The Sandman was written by Neil Gaiman, while Lucifer was written by Mike Carey (albeit with help and advice from Neil Gaiman), so the latter could have simply retconned the former. But that doesn't explain why Lucifer's wings were burnt if he didn't fall in the first place.  How can those two stories, as told by Lucifer in The Sandman and his own series be made to work with each other? "
1370,"What's the point of the sandy beach in ""A Dream Within a Dream""?","The main thrust of Edgar Allan Poe's poem ""A Dream Within a Dream"" concerns the existential angst of the narrator, and his fear that ""all that we see or seem"" is nothing but ""a dream within a dream"". But much of the second stanza dwells instead on a sandy beach:     I stand amid the roar   Of a surf-tormented shore,   And I hold within my hand   Grains of the golden sand —   How few! yet how they creep   Through my fingers to the deep,   While I weep — while I weep!   O God! Can I not grasp   Them with a tighter clasp?   O God! can I not save   One from the pitiless wave?   What is the purpose of these lines, and how do they fit into the poem as a whole? Do the sand and the surf have some deep symbolic meaning? "
1371,What is the significance of the words of the prophets being written on the subway wall?,"The fifth verse of ""The Sound of Silence"" runs thusly:     And the people bowed and prayed   To the neon god they made   And the sign flashed out its warning   In the words that it was forming   And the sign said:   ""The words of the prophets are   Written on the subway walls   And tenement halls   And whispered in the sound of silence.""   There's already a question about what the neon god is. But why does it say that 'the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls'? What does this signify?  "
1372,Are there significant differences across the Nordic countries in the traditional portrayal of trolls?,"Trolls are a common feature of Scandinavian folklore - and possibly also of those of the wider Nordic region, Finland and Iceland as well as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, although I'm not sure about this). But the Scandinavian countries have a very mixed history and culture, and have often been united in one or two nations instead of three during their history. I'm curious about how, if at all, national differences are expressed in traditional literature and folklore, specifically concerning trolls.  How much does the portrayal of trolls differ between the literature of the different countries?  Are there traditional troll stories which are distinctively ""Norwegian"", ""Swedish"", etc., and can these be told apart just from the nature of the stories themselves? "
1373,Mathematics or gibberish? Understanding a description of an alien message in His Master's Voice,"I'm reading the 1983 Michael Kandel translation of Stanislaw Lem's His Master's Voice. The plot revolves around a secret military project to decode an alien message. The main character is a mathematician, and in one scene in the book he describes a mathematical proof of certain properties of the alien message. The scene takes place on page 86 of my copy of the book, and I have reproduced the scene below:     It was from this position that I proceeded to the translation of the problem into the language of mathematics. What I did I cannot present plainly, since our everyday language lacks the required concepts and words. I can only say, in general, that I studied the purely formal properties of the ""letter""--treating it as an object mathematically interpreted--for features that are of central interest in topological algebra and the algebra of groups. In doing this, I employed the transformation of transformational sets, which gives the so-called infragroups or Hogarth groups (named after me, since I was the one who discovered them). If I obtained, as a result, an ""open"" structure, that would still prove nothing, because it could be that I had simply introduced an error into my work, going on some false assumption (such an assumption might be, e.g. the assertion of the number of code signs in a sing e""unit"" of the message). But it happened otherwise. The ""letter"" closed beautifully for me, like an object separated from the rest of the world, or like a circular process (to be more precise, like the DESCRIPTION, the MODEL of such a thing).      I spent three days setting up a program for the computer, and the computer carried out the task on the fourth. The result said that ""something, in some way, closes."" The ""something"" was the letter--in the totality of the interrelations of its signs; but as for the ""how"" of that closing, I could only make certain guesses, because my proof was indirect. The proof showed that the ""described object"" was NOT ""topologically open."" But to reveal the ""means of closure"" with the aid of current mathematical methods was impossible for me; such a task was several orders of difficulty greater than the one I had managed to surmount. The proof, then, was very general--one could even say vague. One the other hand, not every text would have displayed this property. The score of a symphony, for example, or a linear coding of a television image, or an ordinary linguistic text (a story, a philosophical treatise) does not close in that fashion. But the description of a geometric solid closes, as does that of something as complex as a genotype or a living organism. The genotype, true, closes differently from the solid. But by going into such distinctions and details I fear that I will be confusing the reader rather than explaining to him what I did with the ""letter.""   I have two related questions about this passage. First, I'm hoping that someone can break down the mathematics or lack thereof in this passage. Some of this is clearly made up; Hogarth is the fictional main character, so ""Hogarth groups"" probably aren't a real thing. But given Stanislaw Lem's reputation, I doubt that all of this is made up; I feel like some of this passage must have a relationship to real mathematics. It would be great if I could get an explanation of that.  Second, this passage is simplified, and the (fictional) narrator tells us that it's intentionally simplified. So my question is, what does this passage tell us about the message? What does the fact that the message is ""closed"", which makes it more like a ""geometric solid... [or] a genotype"" than a ""a story [or] a philosophical treatise"" convey to a lay reader? The narrator tells us that this is meant to be understood without a background in mathematics, but I feel like I'm missing something. "
1374,"Identify mystery novel: Past crime uncovered in English village, gossip leading to death(s)","I'm trying to remember a book I read sometime within the last ten years, but although I'm able to recall a fair bit of the story I have no idea of the title or author. I believe it's a ""modern"" mystery (rather than something by Agatha Christie or someone like that), but it's definitely set in England sometime between the late 19th and mid-20th century.  As I recall, some decades before the time of the story, there was a death where a woman was poisoned (or thought by people to have been poisoned) and a man was suspected. I think the suspect was the vicar (unpopular in town because of his ""modern"" ways), or perhaps a doctor, and the woman may have been his wife or fiancée. In any case, he was also suspected of having an affair with some girl, perhaps a maid, and this was supposed to have been his motive for murder.  A malicious gossip (I think some kind of religious fanatic) has kept the story alive all these years, and the vicar (?) was ostracized or driven from the town, perhaps to his grave. (I seem to remember a gravestone being vandalized or shunned. Perhaps the girl was also suspected of involvement in the murder and died somehow?)  All of this is only revealed gradually, because something in the present of the story brings it back up, but I don't remember what it is (are there more deaths? someone's will?). Anyway, it turns out the vicar was innocent, both of the affair and the murder. The girl was maybe infatuated with him and made up some story, or she was having an affair with someone else and the rumor was distorted. Did the victim actually commit suicide because she was in love with the man, over the gossip of his affair with the girl? Or was it assisted suicide because she was suffering from some malady? I don't recall precisely. At the bottom there was definitely a story of two lovers who were torn apart by malicious gossip, leading to the death of one or both, and still being maligned by the town decades later.  I also seem to remember that there's only one or two people in town who don't believe in the gossip, one of them a doctor or dentist (or lawyer?), and the other I think an old lady living in the house where it took place (the sister of one of the people involved?). I have a vague recollection that the doctor turns out to have been guilty of something (possibly of facilitating the woman's suicide, or keeping some dying admission secret).  I also seem to remember that the main character (a man, I'm pretty sure; he might be a journalist or attorney of some kind) travels back and forth to this town, presumably from London, several times, and that the whole business has more or less poisoned the atmosphere of the town with guilt/resentment, making it suspicious of outsiders digging into the past. The destructive consequences of village gossip is a major theme.  The main character first gets wind of the story in the inn/boardinghouse/B&amp;B where he's staying or a pub where he's having dinner. I also seem to recall that there's something in the story about music (was the vicar a music lover who introduced new tunes to the services?), but I can't swear to it.  It's NOT:   The Murder at the Vicarage (Agatha Christie) The Moving Finger (Agatha Christie) Night at the Mocking Widow (Carter Dickson)  "

It might seem to us like just a story told to comfort a sick child, but it turns out to be true, and the boys go on to have adventures together in Nangiyala.  My question is: how did Jonathan know about what happens to people when they die? Obviously he hadn't died himself before.

Guiweng means aristocratic old man. Zhao is meant to serve as a not-so-subtle metaphor for the corrupt aristocracy of China at that time.   Gu Jiu's name is a play on words. Gu Jiu means old. Gu Jiu is meant to serve as a not-so-subtle metaphor for China's feudal past.      Why are these names called ""a play on words""? If Guiweng means aristocratic old man, what does Zhao mean? I understand that the names correspond to what the characters symbolically represent, but to my mind that's not enough to qualify as ""wordplay"". Is there more to it than that? "
1384,"Is there any significance in Shakespeare's use of the name ""Laertes"" (name of the father of Odysseus) in Hamlet?","Is there any significance in Shakespeare's use of ""Laertes"" (name of the father of Odysseus) in Hamlet?  Do we associate the name with The Odyssey more strongly than Shakespeare, to whom it was just an available name with a nice ring to it?  If there is a connection, what is it? "
1385,How do we know that Bloom was never circumcised?,"Everyone knows that Bloom was not circumcised (just ask Google).     But how do we know this?   Hugh Kenner claims it is (371/373). I have read these pages over and over, but don't see it?  Despite the ready repetition of the claim, I have not been able to find the actual quote from Ulysses that proves that Bloom was not circumcised. "
1386,What is the meaning of this sentence: ...for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man,"It is a line of one of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, and it says:     We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the   entertaining as of the contemptible about the man...   I don't understand the boldfaced part of the sentence. Does it mean the man was entertaining and despicable at the same time? If that is the case, what makes it confusing for me is that supposing that he was despicable, why did they give him a hearty welcome? "
1387,"Why did Aristotle write that downfalls are not 'terrible or pitiful', and triumph unsympathetic?","Source: The Well-Educated Mind (2 edn 2016), p. 286 Top.       For Aristotle, tragedy is always a moral enterprise: Capable men, he    writes ""should not be shown changing from prosperity to disaster because    [1.] that is not terrible or pitiful, but simply repulsive; and dissolute men should    not be shown changing from bad fortune to good, because [2.] it doesn't engage    even sympathy, let alone pity or terror."" Pity and terror are best aroused    a good man is shown going from good fortune to bad; and the most    pitiable things of all are acts done by blood relations to each other.     Isn't Aristotle misanthropic in belitting downfalls? Why doesn't it?  What's the source of this quote?  "
1388,Why did 18th-century readers judge Gothic literature countercultural or 'Gothic'?,"Dr. Lilia Melani admits that     [1.] To most modern readers, however, The Castle of Otranto is dull reading; except for the villain Manfred, the characters are insipid; the action moves at a fast clip with no emphasis or suspense, despite the supernatural manifestations and a young maiden's flight through dark vaults. [2.] But contemporary readers found the novel electrifying original and thrillingly suspenseful, with its remote setting, its use of the supernatural, and its medieval trappings, all of which have been so frequently imitated and so poorly imitated that they have become stereotypes.    Why's 2 true? How weren't the masterworks beneath just as electrifying, original, suspenseful, which  educated Georgians would've read?  All page numbers refer to The Well-Educated Mind (2 edn 2016).   (p. 89) John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1607)  features ""the monster Apollyon"", ""goblins who haunt the Valley of the Shadow of Death"", and ""another pilgrim taken to a mysterious door at the city's foot and thrust through: ""Then I saw,"" he ends, soberly, ""that there was a way to Hell, even from the Gates of Heaven.""   (p. 280) Aeschylus's Agamenon (c. 458 BC) features ""the goddess Artemis, who loved Troy, blew great winds on the fleet to keep the Greeks from sailing.""  Then Agamenon sacrified ""daughter Iphigenia"" ""Against the wild objections of his wife."" Agamenon's ""father, Atreus, punished Agamenon's brother Thyestes for sleeping with Atresus' wife by roasting Thyestes' children and serving them to his brother.""   Other supernatural thrillers  are Marlowe's Doctor Faustus (p. 287) and Beowulf (p. 359).    p. 64:     In the nineteenth century, the soap opera of choice was the “Gothic novel,” a story of mystery and vague supernatural threat, set in fantastic and menacing places (or in central Europe, which, for most readers, amounted to the same thing). Gothic heroines languished in ruined castles, threatened by ancient spells, insane wives, and mysterious noblemen who avoid sunlight and mirrors. Here is Emily of the wildly popular The Mysteries of Udolpho: plucky but not too bright, wandering through the strange echoing castle of Count Morano.   Prof. Ellen Malenas Ledoux outlines here that Gothic literature:     “explore the darker impulses of human nature, such as paranoia, barbarism and the taboo,” explains Ledoux. “Some of the markers of Gothic literature aren’t often what one would think; it doesn’t have to be supernatural, but deals with confusion about boundaries, such as those between what is alive and dead, or animal and human.”      ""us[s]e dark elements to uncover social atrocities, or to offer alternative solutions to these issues. “In a fantasy world, you can offer an alternative vision of something that you can’t through realistic writing,” explains Ledoux.      Informed by genre and reader-response theories, the [Ledoux's] book illustrates how Gothic scenes depicting violence and heightened emotion challenged conventional thinking and normative behaviors, revealing the Gothic’s transgressive spirit as a dynamic force within the sociopolitical landscape of the 18th- and 19th-century Atlantic world.   This Ted-ed video at 4:48 and Quora post instance the polysemy of 'Gothic', but they and Etymonline don't  headline the underlying semantic notions.     The history of the word gothic is embedded   in thousands of years worth of countercultural movements,   from invading outsiders becoming kings   to towering spires replacing solid columns   to artists finding beauty in darkness.   "
1389,How many of the Swallows & Amazons stories are metafictional?,"When reading the classical children's book series Swallows and Amazons by Arthur Ransome, I started with the eponymous first book Swallows and Amazons, but read Peter Duck before Swallowdale. Thus, I first read Peter Duck in the same spirit as the other stories - the children going on boats and having adventures, albeit rather more thrilling adventures than their usual summer-holiday fare. It was only after reading Swallowdale that I realised Peter Duck was actually metafictional: considered to be a work of fiction even within the world of the Swallows and Amazons.  It was much later that I read Missee Lee, which I assumed to be in the same metafictional category. Although not featuring the character of Peter Duck, it does seem to follow on from the novel Peter Duck, and it similarly stretches the reader's suspension of disbelief much more than most of the books in the series.  Other candidates for possibly being metafictional include Great Northern (which also features the boat Wild Cat) and Pigeon Post (wherein, if I recall correctly, the children successfully dowse and mine copper). But these I'm less sure of.  Which of the books in the Swallows and Amazons series are considered to be metafictional?  This question would probably be best answered using intertextual references (Peter Duck, for instance, is clearly metafictional because of the way it's described in Swallowdale - are there other inter-book references like this?), but I'm open to being convinced by other evidence too. "
1390,How much French does Madame Eglentyne know?,"In the General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales, we're introduced to Madame Eglentyne, a prioress (a nun). On lines 124-126, there's a confusing passage where we're told that she speaks elegant French, but that she doesn't know the French of Paris:     And Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly,   After the scole of Stratford-atte-Bowe,   For Frenssh of Parys was to hir unknowe.   Why would someone know French but not the French of Paris? Is this a joke about her (and the people around her) thinking she knows French, when the fact is that her French is essentially gibberish? "
1391,What exactly happened at the end of The Dumb Waiter?,"I've read a few critical explanations and exegeses on Harold Pinter's one-act play, The Dumb Waiter. I'm still confused by a few things that happen at the very end, before the curtain. I understand that Ben got the order to kill Gus, but what confuses me is how Gus went into the lavatory, through a door on the left, and then for some reason came back in through the other door, the one on the right. Did he loop around? Is that even possible in old hotels in England?  The other--and more confusing--element is this: Upon returning from the lavatory, why was Gus stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, holster and revolver? "
1392,Who or what is the narrator of “Our Talons Can Crush Galaxies”?,"I just read Brooke Bolander's short story ""Our Talons Can Crush Galaxies"", which has been nominated for both Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Short Story after its publication less than a year ago (November 2016) in Uncanny Magazine. It's very short and you can read it in full here (warning: contains strong language and potentially disturbing content, about assault and gruesome revenge).  My question is, exactly what manner of being is the narrator?  We can tell from the story that she's one of a group of sisters from a millennia-old civilisation, who speak an ancient language, possess great power, and can pass in and out of the ""mortal plane"". Does the text or subtext suggest a particular civilisation and language, a particular kind of mythical creature? Or is it meant to be vague about her exact nature and leave it to our imaginations? "
1393,Did Dirk Gently do anything to help Odin the end of Tea Time?,"At the end of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, the following things resolve Odin's troubles:   Thor changes an eagle back into a fighter plane, which (unintentionally?) kills the Draycotts, whom Odin entered a contract with. Odin re-entered the hospital he wanted to stay in, on more favorable terms. A new Guilt God emerged, apparently from Dirk's old fridge, and dealt with Toe Rag and the green-eyed giant, as they were escaping from Valhalla.   Apart from getting rid of his old fridge, and possibly giving an old god (who was perhaps a guilt god, as Dirk felt a ""nameless roaring guilt that came howling at him out of nowhere"" at their encounter) a coin, which apparently helped precipitate the 3rd item above, I don't see that Dirk did anything for the resolution of this story.  But as Toe Rag and the giant were escaping anyway, this doesn't seem crucial to the resolution.  Dirk made his way to Valhalla, and tried to help Odin against the Draycotts, but quickly gave up.  Kate apparently is responsible for 2, and Thor for 1.  As far as I can tell, it seems like he figured out, more or less, what was going on, and tried to help fix things, but without success in any major way.  Did Dirk actually do anything useful for the end of this story?  (Am I missing the significance of 3?) "
1394,Novel about teenagers committing suicide,"I read this novel about 3 years ago on the train, having borrowed it from a co-passenger. I couldn't read the whole book and I'd like to complete it now.  When did you read the story, and how old was it?  I read it 3 years ago and I don't remember how old it was.  Medium and appearance  If I remember correctly, the cover has a brownish picture with the title of the book. It was, I think, a picture of long brown hair.  It was a novel with hard cover and must have had around 200-300 pages.  What language did you read it in, and was it translated?  It was in English and I can't say if it was translated. It was set in the UK or USA, but it might not be translated I suppose.  Anything else  It was particularly about teenagers attempting and succeeding in suicide.  Story:  This novel was about a family with five teenage daughters. It starts with an ambulance to bring the body of one of those girls who committed suicide. Then a back story starts.  One of those girls tries to commit suicide, but fails. However, she does it again and dies. Thereafter, another one tries and succeeds. This thing goes on and on.  The motive isn't explained in the story till the last I read. This is the suspense I want to know.  When I had to give the novel back, three of them had committed suicide. "
1395,"Why is the narrator speechless at the end of this short story ""Something new""?","I've been reading through some of the short stories written for the (now largely defunct) weekly writing exercise in the Writers SE chatroom. On 28 February this year, the writing prompt was ""Something new"", and the user Kit Z. Fox wrote a piece with this title which can be found here on her blog.  This short story is about a woman who's soon to be married and her interactions with her mother. I wasn't quite sure how to interpret the very last paragraph:     I looked out the window to the yard where guests were gathering. I held my breath until I thought I could speak. “I’m already wearing Gramma’s necklace,” I said quietly, touching the locket at my throat.   What emotion is making her so speechless? Is she choked up at the thought of a gift from her father, angry at her mother for her presumption, or something else? This passage seems ambiguous, and I wonder if there's enough elsewhere in the text to make the answer completely clear. "
1396,"On what occasion did Shelley say ""Keats was a Greek""?","Once Shelley said, ""Keats was a Greek."" What was the context? Whom did he say this to? "
1397,"Why does Ishtar insist on being called ""Ishtar""?","There are many characters in Gaiman's Sandman stories that have multiple names; Morpheus is one of them. For the most part, they usually don't mind if someone calls them by one name or another. The first that I've seen this happen was with Ishtar.  After meeting Ishtar, Morpheus calls her by two other names for goddesses of love (Belili and Astarte). She corrects him both times, asking him to call her only ""Ishtar.""        both images from The Sandman #45      Dream: Hello, Belili.   Ishtar: Ishtar.      [...]      Ishtar: What brings you here?   Dream: You do, Astarte.   Ishtar: Ishtar.   This exchange is interesting, and makes me wonder if there is a reason that Ishtar insists on that name, as opposed to the others? Perhaps there is a historical element of worship that Ishtar had that Belili and Astarte didn't, that allowed her to draw the power she needed to live from the nightclub where she danced? "
1398,What does this sentence mean (from 'Dracula')?,"   To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.   I did not quite understand the last sentence. Why  did Jonathan say one vampire meant many? What did he mean by ""the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks? Does he mean that he has made up his mind to become a vampire too if Mina became one, or that he wants to use his love to help Mina ascend to heaven if Mina became a vampire?  "
1399,Is this quote by Mr Eastwood a pointed remark by Agatha Christie?,"In Agatha Christie's book The Listerdale Mystery, in the story Mr Eastwood's adventure, there is the following paragraph:     He knew only too well that the kind of story that the editor in question did not want that kind of story - beautiful though it might be. The kind of story he wanted, and insisted on having (and incidentally paid handsomely for getting), was all about mysterious dark women, stabbed to the heart, a young hero unjustly suspected, and the sudden unraveling of the mystery  and fixing of the guilt on the least likely person, by the means of wholly inadequate clues; in fact,   'THE MYSTERY OF THE SECOND CUCUMBER'.      'Although', reflected Anthony, ""ten to one, he'll alter the title and call it something rotten, like ""Murder Most Foul"" without so much as asking me!'   Emphasis mine.  Anthony is an author and is trying to write a story called THE MYSTERY OF THE SECOND CUCUMBER.  I wondered if this excerpt is possibly a dig by Agatha Christie at her editor? I know that there was a movie based loosely on one of her books called Murder Most Foul...  My question is if there is any evidence that this excerpt is 'pointed' at anyone, i.e. more than just a bit of atmosphere for the story? "
1400,"Why does Melville call Washington ""General"" rather than ""President""","In Moby Dick, beginning of chapter 10, I read about the resemblance of Queequeg's head to George Washington's:     It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts of him.   Now to this European, George Washington is better known as first President of the United States of America than as general. So why is he called General here?   I searched for Washington's bust on Google Images and I found he is not always represented in a uniform.   So these are the options I could think of:   It's just me: Washington is more famous as general than as president It's Europe vs USA: for Americans, Washington is more famous as general than as president It's now vs then: in 1850s, Washington used to be more famous as general than as president  "
1401,"What does ""the orchestra broke out"" mean?","The short story The Man, the Maid and the Miasma by P.G. Wodehouse ends with the following paragraphs:     He bent across the table.       'Isn't this like the old times?' he said. 'Do you remember the first time I ever ki–'      Just then the orchestra broke out.   The sentence I am wondering about is the last, ""Just then the orchestra broke out"". My first thought was that it was all a play in the theatre, because there were a few references to the theater in the story. Am I right, or is there a better explanation? "
1402,Why does O'Brien claim that the party didn't believe in solipsism?,"In 1984, O'Brien claims that the party's philosophy is not solipsism. Why does he claim that? Was he telling the truth, and how does the party's philosophy actually differ from solipsism?  From chapter 3, section 3:     The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind - surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false. Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he had forgotten...      ""I told you, Winston,"" [O'Brien] said, ""that metaphysics is not your strong point. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing; in fact, the opposite thing...""   Why does O'Brien claim that the party's philosophy is not only different than solipsism, but its exact opposite? "
1403,Why wasn't O'Brien considered a thought criminal?,"Given that O'Brien shows a high level of awareness of the Party's deceptiveness and malice (e.g. the fact that he admitted to being involved in creating and promoting the Goldstein myth), to what extent does he actually believe in the system himself? Why wasn't he considered a thought criminal? Or were Inner Party members not actually expected to conform to the party's beliefs to the same extent that Outer Party members were as long as everyone else was convinced that they did? Or is he practicing some form of doublethink?  By way of example, he said in chapter 3:     The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness; only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing.   I suppose that a closely related question is whether the telescreen in his house actually worked and whether he could actually turn it off. If it worked, who was monitoring him, and what were they actually monitoring? "
1404,"What motivated the choice of those folk songs for the soundtrack of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt""?","While writing the answer for What existing songs, if any, was the soundtrack of “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt” based on? on SFF, I learned that the songs that had any lyrics were mostly (if not all of them) inspired by existing songs, many of them folk songs. Some of those include   ""Bonny at Morn"", an English folk song, which according to one account,     [i]s a lullaby addressed to a baby, and in part it's reproach to a lazy son who is 'ower lang' in his bed and won't get up.  A Belarusian folk carol ""Бегла старожа"" (""Running guard"", I think). Having no better source, I'm quoting its description from Quora:     It is a Belarusian folk carol called Бегла старожа. The phrase repeating after each line literally means Good evening, but rather than a normal greeting, it looks like a reference to Christmas. My interpretation is that on Christmas Eve Khazars (violent Medieval Turkic people who were enemies of Eastern Europeans) attacked some village/city and abducted Sergey’s daughter. The guard wakes everyone and wants to go to war and marry the girl when once he rescues her.  ""Fear a' Bhàta"" (""The Boatman""), a Scottish Gaelic song, which even has its own Wikipedia entry. ""Naranča"" (""Orange"", the fruit), a Croatian folk song about the sea, the winter, and wine. ""Lazare"", a Bulgarian folk song, which is typically sung on Lazar's day, 8 days before Easter, to call for good harvest, prosperity, etc.   . . . And probably some others.   The songs were no doubt used because they gave a sort of an ""authentic"" feel to the game by introducing some Slavic melodies and Slavic lyrics. However, it's the choice of those particular songs that draws my attention.  I'm fairly sure they weren't chosen for their melodies (i.e. the tunes were composed for the game), but I also can't see why they would be chosen based on their lyrics. Except for ""Fear a' Bhàta"", which is featured in locations associated with the sea in the game (the Skellige isles), the song lyrics do not match the situations the songs are featured in - most of the tracks inspired by songs I list here are played during fighting sequences, while their lyrics sing of peace, prosperity, harvest, and so forth.  How do those songs' lyrics fit in the context of the game? Was the choice of those lyrics intentional, or was it purely for ""the feel""? "
1405,"Is there really a nuclear war in the world of ""The Lord of the Flies""?","In The Lord of the Flies, it is pretty clear that there is some sort of war going on outside of the island (the dogfight that leads to the dead pilot, the naval ship that rescues the boys at the end, the evacuation of the boys). The vibe I got was that it was WW2. It wasn't explicit, but the book was published not long after the war (1954) and Golding fought in that war and just the overall tone seemed to fit.  Recently I have repeatedly come across the suggestion that the war was, in fact, nuclear. Both a Wikipedia article and a YouTube video repeated this claim. Am I missing something?  This seems unlikely to me because the boys are being evacuated. Nuclear war, as we now know, is either very sudden, making evacuation impractical; or very cold, making evacuation unlikely. "
1406,What is the Myth of Fingerprints?,"In Paul Simon's album Graceland there is a song All Around the World.  This song has a repeating theme in the verses:  This is always some variation of:  There was no doubt about it,  It was the myth of fingerprints  The three instances are:     He says there's no doubt about it,      It was the myth of fingerprints   and     And there's no doubt about it      It was the myth of fingerprints   and     He said there's no doubt about it      It was the myth of fingerprints   (Full lyrics here)  Does anyone know what the myth of fingerprints is?

1407,What do these lines in Edward Thomas's 'This is No Case of Petty Right or Wrong' mean?,"   Than in the storm smoking along the wind      Athwart the wood. Two witches' cauldrons roar.      From one the weather shall rise clear and gay;      Out of the other an England beautiful      And like her mother that died yesterday.    Full poem    I am just getting to know this poem; I think I understand the emotional turns, but these lines are confusing me. He has just said that the choices are not between ""justice and injustice"" -- so the image in these lines seems to represent the true choices.  Are they supposed to sound indistinguishable? One one hand we have ""clear and gay"" weather, and on the other we have ""an England beautiful"". Is Thomas trying to say that it doesn't matter?  And who is England's mother, and why did she die yesterday? (Would this be a reference that was clear to readers at the time?) "
1408,What is the metrical style of Hungarian poetry?,"While reading about Hungarian poetry, I came across the claim that:     pure syllabic/quantitative metre is very rare = Hungarian, Greco-Roman ‘időmértékes’ metre   I don't know what ""pure syllabic/quantitative metre"" means - I found a good source about it, but far too technical for me to understand - but it sounds like Hungarian poetry has something in common with ancient Greco-Roman poetry and not many other languages/styles, which is interesting. I also tried looking up ""időmértékes"", but only found some pages in Hungarian, which don't tell me much since machine translation seems very bad at Hungarian-to-English.  What is the standard meter (if any) of Hungarian poetry? Is there a special metrical style in this language? "
1409,"In what literature does Rumi say ""You are the Soul of the Soul of the Universe. And your name is Love?""","In what literature does Rumi say, ""You are the Soul of the Soul of the Universe. And your name is Love?""  Any slight modification of the verse, e.g. ""The soul of the soul of the universe is love"" can also be equivalently considered for this question.  That is, what is the name of the poem/story/essay/etc. that Rumi wrote that the verse first appears in? If there is no definite answer, where does the verse above appear first (i.e. where is it first mentioned or referenced)? Any other relevant information would be appreciated. "
1410,Why is the painful deflowering of a virgin motif in romance novels so common?,"While experiencing pain during the first sexual encounter is a common concern among women, I have read that a woman's first sexual encounter is actually not painful at all, if she is experiencing intense sexual pleasure during love-making, because the hymen will just stretch to accommodate a penis. So, my understanding is that the painful deflowering in romance novels is actually an inaccurate depiction of sex, serving as titillation for the reader.   Why do romance novelists insist on realizing this myth of sex? If actual sex is meant to be pleasurable without any pain, then why can't sex be depicted accurately in fiction? Or is the typical reader's own sexual excitement based on seeing the realization of these sex myths? "
1411,What does Dante mean here?,"When touring Limbo with Virgil, Virgil tells Dante that he and the rest of the virtuous pagans are condemned in Limbo to live eternally without hope. Dante asks his guide,     […] ""Dear sir, my master,""        I began, wanting to be reassured      In the faith that conquers every error, ""Did ever        Anyone go forth from here—by his own good        Or perhaps another's—to join the blessed, after?""      (Inferno 4.35–39, translated by Robert Pinsky, New England Review 15:4, p. 58.)   Is Dante saying that that he wants his (religious) faith to be reassured, or does he want to be reassured with faith? Is this faith in God/Christianity or in Virgil? Does ""error"" refer to mistakes in general, or is Dante saying that he perceives the punishment of the virtuous pagans as a mistake?  Just in general: What exactly does ""wanting to be reassured / In the faith that conquers every error"" mean?  "
1412,Why don't Mr. Bennet's daughters get to inherit the Longbourn estate?,"In the book Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Collins comments that Lady Catherine de Bourgh's daughter will one day inherit the de Bourgh fortune. From previous chapters, we know that the five daughters of Bennet will not inherit their estate (which is now to be given to Mr. Collins).   Why is this the case? Is it because women were not allowed to inherit the family fortune upon their parents' death? If that is the case, how does Lady Catherine's daughter get to inherit the de Bourgh fortune? "
1413,How do I tie the different parts of this question together?,   Compare Tom and George (Wilson). What attributes does each possess?   Would George have been able to transcend his class circumstances to   rise above the ashes? What is class structure like in America today?   Can the poorest of the working poor leave their circumstances   surrounding their situation? Why or why not? Give specific data as it   relates to class structures today - you must research this question   and provide statistics to support your analysis.   This was a question from my little sisters homework on The Great Gatsby. To be honest I have no idea how to tie all the parts of this question together and neither does my sister.  She asked her friends who are also a bit confused. Any help would be nice. 
1414,Oldish (at least 15 years) children's book about a little creepy girl going to normal school for the first time?,"I only vaguely remember this but I know it wasn't a dream because my mom helped me read out loud with it. I only remember some details but I know it had some art in it, it had an Addams family vibe to it, the little girl was raised by spiders? or ghosts? or something similar? And one of the books was about her first day at a real school with normal kids?  And all I remember is that since she was raised like ""goth"" and creepy she didn't interact with anyone very well because everyone thought she was scary but I think she also thought they were scary? and I know there were lots of ""scary"" puns like ""scream cheese"". I'm so sorry I know this isn't a lot of detail but that was a long time ago when I read it.  Also I vaguely remember most of the color used only being grey and purple. "
1415,What does the riddle at the end of Plato's Republic book 5 mean?,"In the latter half of The Republic, book 5, Socrates and Glaucon are discussing the difference between knowledge of things things that exist and ignorance about things that don't exist. They suppose that opinions, being different from both ignorance and knowledge, must pertain to things neither existing nor nonexistent. The following excerpt from the conversation ensues:     Socrates: Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes   equally of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be   termed either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we   may truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper   faculty,—the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to   the faculty of the mean.      Glaucon: True.      This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that   there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty—in whose opinion   the beautiful is the manifold—he, I say, your lover of beautiful   sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the   just is one, or that anything is one—to him I would appeal, saying,   Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these   beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the   just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not   also be unholy?      No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found   ugly; and the same is true of the rest.      And may not the many which are doubles be also halves?—doubles, that   is, of one thing, and halves of another?      Quite true.      And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will   not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?      True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of   them.      And can any one of those many things which are called by particular   names be said to be this rather than not to be this?      He replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at   feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat,   with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat   was sitting. The individual objects of which I am speaking are also a   riddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,   either as being or not-being, or both, or neither.   Could someone please explain the riddle at the end of that excerpt to me? "
1416,"What does ""entailment"" mean in ""To Kill a Mockingbird""?","From chapter 2 of To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee:     Jem’s nose wrinkled. ‘Are we as poor as the Cunninghams?’      ‘Not exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit them hardest.’      Atticus said the professional people were poor because the the farmers were poor. As Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers. Entailment was only part of Mr Cunningham’s vexations. The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and the little cash he made went to interest.   What does the passage in bold mean? "
1417,Is it reasonable to use the movie version of a book to interpret the book when the same author wrote both?,"Related: How much weight should we give authors&#39; declarations of their intent after the fact?  Just to give a concrete example of what I'm asking about, I'm thinking in particular about The Hunger Games books and movies. Since the book was written entirely from the perspective of Katniss, the movie has a significant amount of detail that the books didn't. For example, in the movies President Snowe explains why they have the Hunger Games in the first place instead of, for example, just rounding up kids at random and executing them on the spot.  Suzanne Collins is, at a minimum, listed as one of the first movie's screenwriters (although she's not listed as a screenwriter for all of them, such as Mockingjay part 1). She was presumably still involved in the creation of all of the movies, though.  That being said, assuming that authorial intent has some bearing on how we interpret the text, is it ""valid"" for us to use the additional information introduced in the movies to interpret the books? "
1418,What prompted Knut Hamsun to write his eulogy for Hitler?,"Knut Hamsun, a Norwegian writer famous for writing Hunger and awarded the Nobel literature prize in the 1920s, sent Goebbels, Hitler's minister for Propaganda, his Nobel medal in 1943 as a gift, wrote a week after Hitler died:     He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet for the gospel of justice for all nations.    What did Knut Hamsun by this and was he aware of the holocaust when he wrote it? And did he write this because of it, or despite it, or from ignorance of it? "
1419,Paradise Lost pagan gods,"In Paradise Lost, Milton depicts the Greek and Egyptian ""gods"" as among the fallen angels. It does not seem to matter whether the individual god had an evil or good character in its original myths. As these gods are depicted as so humanlike in their theologies, I struggle to imagine them as monstrous devils of evil.   Why did the author depict the gods in such a sympathetic manner? And why doesn't their portrayal in Paradise Lost differ based on whether they were good or evil in their original myths? "
1420,"Explain ""field size"" and ""bushel of potatoes"" in ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’","From chapter 3 of To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee:     [Walter Cunningham] ‘Reason I can’t pass the first grade, Mr Finch, is I’ve had to stay over ever’ spring an’ help Papa with the choppin’, but there’s another’n at the house now that’s field size’      ‘Did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him?’ I asked, but Atticus shook his head at me.   What do the sentences in bold mean? "
1421,"Pride and Prejudice: Why did Elizabeth think ""my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me""?","In chapter 43 of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, when Elizabeth visits Pemberley with her aunt Mrs. Gardiner, she looks at the splendour of Pemberley, and thinks:     “And of this place, I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”—recollecting herself—“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”   Why did she think that? Why wouldn't she be able to invite her aunt and uncle over if she married Darcy and became the mistress of Pemberley?  "
1422,"Who inspired Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem ""Mother and Poet""?","""Mother and Poet"" is an emotional and moving poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning about a woman poet who loses both her sons in battles in Italy. The emotions seem so raw that one might assume it describes EBB herself ... but she had only one son, who died at 63 of a heart attack, not as a young man in war. So was there someone else, a particular person whose tragic story inspired EBB's poem? Or was it just a general reflection on the tragedy of war and soldiers' families? "
1423,"Who is the falcon, and who the falconer?","In Yeats' greatest of poems, he writes that ""the falcon cannot hear the falconer.""   Who is the falcon and who is the falconer? Why might Yeats have chosen this metaphor?      The Second Coming      Turning and turning in the widening gyre   The falcon cannot hear the falconer;   Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;   Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,   The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   The ceremony of innocence is drowned;   The best lack all conviction, while the worst   Are full of passionate intensity.      Surely some revelation is at hand;   Surely the Second Coming is at hand.   The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi   Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   The darkness drops again; but now I know   That twenty centuries of stony sleep   Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?      —William Butler Yeats, 1919  "
1424,"Is ""The Most Dangerous Game"" Literature?","Way back in high school, many many years ago, our teacher described to us what made something literature or not.  This lesson always stuck with me for two reasons: 1) I didn't really think it was right; 2) I really enjoyed the short story associated with it.  We read some story that was considered literature, I don't remember what it was anymore.  Then we read ""The Most Dangerous Game"".  This apparently, according to her, was not literature because of the ""too"" coincidental incident of how the MC fell overboard.  If I recall correctly, his cigar was knocked out of his hand by the sail when it was blown in the wind and then he was knocked overboard.  I'm wondering if this is still considered true?  If coincidental incidents discount a piece from becoming literature, and thus ""The Most Dangerous Game"" is not literature? "
1425,"What does the line ""The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them."" mean in The Gifts Of The Magi?","What was not among whom? What did O'Henry want us to know from this line?  The author says this line after Jim hugs Della out of affection after seeing the magnitude of her sacrifice (her hair, which she parts with) for him.  The paragraph is:     Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year - what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.    Full story    I can't interpret this one. "
1426,What was the purpose of Sam Black Crow in American Gods?,"In Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods, many of the characters Shadow encounters turn out to be somehow part of the world of the gods, even those like Low-Key Lyesmith who'd seemed innocuous. Most of those who don't had either been part of his life before prison, such as Audrey, or were people he met in Lakeside, like Chad Mulligan. All of these characters, at some point in the story, help move the plot along; they have some connection with other characters, integrating them into the world.  An exception, as far as I can tell, is Sam Black Crow. She turns up several times through the book, but each appearance feels like a one-off and not really connected to anything else in the story. She could be removed altogether and nothing important would change.  What, then, is her purpose in the novel? What role does she play in the story, and why is she important enough to get so many scenes involving her? "
1427,What is happening in the scene with Coldmoon and the geisha?,"In chapter two of I Am a Cat, we see this scene:      As we turned at Hotan’s corner another geisha appeared. She was slim, well-shaped and her shoulders were most beautifully sloped. The way she wore her mauve kimono gave her a genuine elegance. “Sorry about last night, Gen-chan—I was so busy. . .” She laughed and one glimpsed white teeth. Her voice was so harsh, as harsh as that of a roving crow, that her otherwise fine appearance diminished in enchantment. So much so that I didn’t even bother to turn around to see what sort of person this Gen-chan was, but sauntered on toward Onarimachi with my hands tucked inside the breast-fold of my kimono. Coldmoon, however, seemed to have become a trifle fidgety.   I Am a Cat, chapter 2   I'm a little confused as to what is supposed to be happening in this scene. What was she busy with? What does the rough voice imply? Why does Coldmoon become fidgety? "
1428,How did the cat become well known?,"In the second chapter of I Am a Cat, we see this:     SINCE New Year’s Day I have acquired a certain modest celebrity: so that, though only a cat, I am feeling quietly proud of myself. Which is not unpleasing.   On the morning of New Year’s Day, my master received a picture-postcard...   I Am a Cat, chapter 2   We see that the cat is pretty well known; almost all of the letters and stuff that we see the master receiving mention the cat.  But  don't see any mention of how this cat became well-known. Did I somehow miss it? What happened? "
1429,Do English language poems actually have feet?,"The question Catalectic trochaic tetrameter or acephaleous iambic tetrameter? Scanning &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; describes an interesting case when the placement of feet has no effect on the pronunciation of a line of verse.   The line in question is ""Floated midway on the waves;"" it's ambiguous whether the line should be scanned as /^|/^|/^|/ or /|^/|^/|^/. The important take away is that either scansion sounds exactly the same; how the feet are placed doesn't change the pronunciation.  In my mind, this raises a question: what are feet actually for? Do English language poems actually have feet, or are feet just a convention, or a stand in for another concept? After all, if feet are important, shouldn't there be a difference in how /^|/^|/^|/ and /|^/|^/|^/ sound? "
1430,How does the justice system work in Harry Potter?,"I find the justice system in Harry Potter very interesting. One one hand, it seems similar to the justice system in the real world: there are trials where the accused can call a witness.      'I may be wrong,' said Dumbledore pleasantly, 'but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?' he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.   On the other hand, there are many examples when suspects don't get a trial. For example, both Hagrid and Sirius were sent to Azkaban without a trial.  So how does the justice system in Harry Potter work? And is Rowling trying to make some sort of commentary here? "
1431,What is the meaning of O-san having a blank face?,"When the cat gets his teeth stuck in a rice cake, we see that eventually O-san has to help him:     O-san looks at the mistress as if to say, “Why not make him go on dancing?” The mistress would gladly see my minuet continued, but, since she would not go so far as wanting me to dance myself to death, says nothing. My master turned somewhat sharply to the servant and ordered, “Hurry it up, if you don’t help quickly the cat will be dead.” O-san, with a vacant look on her face, as though she had been roughly wakened from some peculiarly delicious dream, took a firm grip on the rice-cake and yanked it out of my mouth. I am not quite as feeble-fanged as Coldmoon, but I really did think my entire front toothwork was about to break off. The pain was indescribable. The teeth embedded in the rice-cake are being pitilessly wrenched. You can’t imagine what it was like. It was then that the fourth enlightenment burst upon me: that all comfort is achieved through hardship. When at last I came to myself and looked around at a world restored to normality, all the members of the household had disappeared into the inner room.   I Am a Cat, chapter 2 (emphasis mine)   Why does O-san have a 'vacant look on her face, as though she had been roughly wakened from some peculiarly delicious dream'? What does this imply? "
1432,Who wrote a specific poem in the movie 'Dead Poets Society'?,"Who wrote ""Show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams…And I'll show you a happy man."" ?  It was spoken by George McAllister (=the character name of the Latin teacher ""the Realist"" in Dead Poets Society).  Some says that it could be Alfred Lord Tennyson, but can someone confirm this and state the precise publication?  Here is the transcript from the film:     McAllister: You take a big risk by encouraging them to be artists, John. When they realize they're not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts, they'll hate you for it.   Keating: We're not talking artists, George, we're talking freethinkers.   McAllister: Freethinkers at seventeen?   Keating: Funny — I never pegged you as a cynic.   McAllister: Not a cynic, a realist. ""Show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll show you a happy man.""   Keating: ""But only in their dreams can men be truly free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus will be.""   McAllister: Tennyson?   Keating: No, Keating.       Video of the scene: [website]"
1433,"Why are comic books listed under PN (""general literature""), and not under authors' respective categories in Library of Congress system?","After starting university and going to the library for some time, I noticed a peculiar thing: comics seem to be grouped under PN irrespective of their authors' general grouping.   Take The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman, who is an English author: the first volume, Preludes and Nocturnes, has the Library of Congress code PN6728 .S26 G355 2010 (and the others have similar codes). Gaiman's other works seem to all be located in the PR section (English (non-American) literature), e.g. American Gods is listed under PR6057 .A319 A84 2005.  What is the reason for this? At first I thought it was because a comic may be made by a range of authors from different countries (as in the writer, the artist, the letterer, the colourist), but there are comics made by just one person (editors notwithstanding), and they're still listed under PN.   Why? "
1434,"Understanding passage from Scarlet Letter about ""keeping with the scene""?","I am reading this part of the Scarlet Letter in the Custom House:     It would be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise, were we to look about us and discover a form, beloved, but gone hence, now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine, with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar, or had never once stirred from our fireside.   I did not understand the initial part:     It would be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise   I could understand after that, which was saying how we would discover a beloved creature that would be close or really far.  However, I don't understand this the expression of ""It would be too much in  keeping with the scene to excite surprise""?    I've been using Sparknotes ""No Fear Literature"" tool that simplifies passages from The Scarlet Literature. It interprets the quote     An entire class of susceptibilities, and a gift connected with them,—of no great richness or value, but the best I had,—was gone from me.   as this:     My writing gift might not have been very rich or valuable, but it was the best I had, and it was gone   How could that be if writing is not even mentioned? He mentions ""an entire class of susceptibilities.""  "
1435,A book about a night shift clerk in a hotel,"I am looking for a book about a night shift hotel receptionist/clerk who spent all his time reading.  He had some high powered life but after some (tragic?) event he was disillusioned by life and quit his old life. He took a night shift job at a small hotel and spent all his free time sleeping or reading, he also spent most of his job time reading (as it was a very quiet hotel).  His idyllic new life crashes down when a parcel is left at the desk which turns out to be full of money.  If I recall correctly he is faced with the dilemma of what to do with the package when it is never picked up and opens it out of curiosity. His problem is then what to do with the money...  I thought it was called Night Shift but a google search didn't seem to bring anything up... Does anyone know what it could be? "
1436,"What is the name of the writing style in ""Bleak House"" by Charles Dickens? Why is that style used?","In Bleak House by Charles Dickens, the viewpoint frequently changes from Esther Summerson, or first-person, to third person. What is this style known as? Also, why did Dickens place such a important emphasis on Esther Summerson as to relate through her, since he also used an omniscient third person POV? "
1437,What is the distinction between literature and genre? Is such a distinction useful?,"On the inside jacket of my copy of His Master's Voice, there is a short biographical blurb about the author, Stanislaw Lem. The blurb contains the following sentence:     Originally trained in medicine, he began his writing career in the 1940's, rapidly developing into one of Europe's most prolific, brilliant, and admired writers, and elevating science fiction from genre to literature.   Another example of this use of the word genre comes from Larry McCaffery's The 20th Century’s Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction:     Working as he did on the treadmill of genre SF, Dick never wrote a single work which can be termed a ""masterpiece,""   What does the phrase ""elevating science fiction from genre to literature"" mean? What is the distinction between genre and literature, and is such a distinction useful? "
1438,Significance of the Pardoner's hair style,"The General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales spends a lot of time talking about the Pardoner's hair:     This Pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex,       But smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex;       By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde,       And therwith he hise shuldres overspradde;       But thynne it lay by colpons oon and oon.       But hood, for jolitee, wered he noon,       For it was trussed up in his walet.       Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet;       Dischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al bare.   I know nothing about the hair-styles at the time, so what does this particular style say about the Pardoner? The text makes it clear that the Pardoner thinks highly of his hair (""Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet""), with the implication that others most likely think less of the hair-style. But is that all there is to this particular passage? "
1439,Why does Macbeth say ‘throw physic to the dogs’?,"In Act V, Scene III of Macbeth:     Macbeth:    Canst not thou not minister to a mind diseased       Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow      Raze out the written troubles of the brain      And with some sweet oblivious antidote      Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff      That weighs upon the heart?      Doctor:   Therein the patient must minister to himself      Macbeth:      Throw physic to the dogs. I’ll none of it.   Physic obviously refers to medicine (as the physic in physician) , or so I thought. But when I thought more visually, I mean how I would stage it, I thought perhaps it was a command to his soldiers to throw the quack doctor out. It would certainly make for a more arresting dramatic mise on stage! And then again later, I thought it might as well just be a philosophical judgement, throw the whole of medicine to the dogs after all medicine and doctoring did not have, on the whole, a very good reputation then and perhaps Macbeth was simply impatient at the doctors equivocation.  How should one decide between these options?  "

1441,Who wrote the well-known Outline of Chapter Contents in the Penguin edition of Finnegans Wake?,"Who wrote the well-known Outline of Chapter Contents in the Penguin edition of Finnegans Wake?  Wikipedia describes the structure of Finnegans Wake as follows.     Finnegans Wake comprises seventeen chapters, divided into four Parts   or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each   contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The   chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided   possible chapter titles as he had done for Ulysses, he did title   various sections published separately (see Publication history below).   The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman   numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example,   indicates the second chapter of the third part.   The Penguin edition of Finnegans Wake includes an Outline of Chapter Contents, which is reproduced at finnegansweb. It begins      PART I      Chapter I      Introduction - The Willingdone Museum - The finding of the   letter - Pre-history of Ireland - Mutt and Jute - Jarl van Hoother and   the Prankquean - The Fall - Finnegan’s Wake - Introduction to HCE      Chapter II      The naming of HCE - The encounter with the cad - The   spreading of the cad’s story - The Ballad of Persse O’Reilly      Chapter III      Earwicker’s version of the story filmed, televised, and   broadcast - HCE’s wake - Reports of HCE’s crime and flight - Court   inquiries - HCE reviled - HCE remains silent and sleeps - Finn’s   resurrection foreshadowed    Who wrote this outline? Did it appear in the first edition? Did it originate with Joyce?   I am looking for an authoritative answer. "
1442,"In ""Passing by"" by Robert Herrick, how does Cupid ""range her country"" and change the narrator's heart?","I'm looking for an explanation of the first two lines of the third verse (see below) of the poem ""Passing by"" by Robert Herrick.  I assume that ""Cupid is winged"" means that Cupid has wings, but what does ""and doth range her country"" mean (""her"" referring to the lady?) and why does that result in ""my heart doth change""?     There is a lady sweet and kind Was never face so pleased my mind, I did but see her passing by And yet I love her till I die!      Her gestures, motions and her smile Her wit, her voice, my heart beguile; Beguile my heart, I know not why And yet I love her till I die!

1443,Allusion to Plato in Fahrenheit 451?,"I have been told there is an allusion to Plato in Fahrenheit 451. The name ""Plato"" is mentioned once, but I don't think it counts as an allusion.     He dialled the call on a secondary phone. The phone on the far end of the line called Faber's name a dozen times before the professor answered in a faint voice. Montag identified himself and was met with a lengthy silence. ""Yes, Mr. Montag?""      ""Professor Faber, I have a rather odd question to ask. How many copies of the Bible are left in this country?""      ""I don't know what you're talking about!""      ""I want to know if there are any copies left at all.""      ""This is some sort of a trap! I can't talk to just anyone on the phone!""      ""How many copies of Shakespeare and Plato?""      ""None! You know as well as I do. None!""      Faber hung up.

1444,How does Beatty know who has books and who does not in Fahrenheit 451?,"How does Beatty know who has books and who does not in Fahrenheit 451? I presume word of mouth, but who would openly admit to criminal activity? This scene also seems a bit fishy when out of the blue:     One last thing,"" said Beatty. ""At least once in his career, every fireman gets an itch. What do the   books say, he wonders. Oh, to scratch that itch, eh? Well, Montag, take my word for it, I've had   to read a few in my time, to know what I was about, and the books say nothing! Nothing you can   teach or believe. They're about non?existent people, figments of imagination, if they're fiction.   And if they're non?fiction, it's worse, one professor calling another an idiot, one philosopher   screaming down another's gullet. All of them running about, putting out the stars and   extinguishing the sun. You come away lost.""   Beatty seems to know Montag has some books. How exactly is this so if Montag has not told anyone about it?  "
1445,"What does ""speed of hurt” mean in Courtney Summers's ""Sadie""?","I am reading Sadie by Courtney Summers. There is this sentence that I do not understand.      I want to live my life on the internet. Everything is perfect there. I found Kendall Baker on a computer in a library in some forgettable town along the way. She's beautiful. A girl with a glow. Eighteen years old, but the kind of eighteen they write about in books. The kind of eighteen that lives faster than the speed of hurt.     What does the author mean by speed of hurt here?   "
1446,"Does Joyce use interior monologue in ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man""?","Certainly the narrative of A Portrait reflects a developing narrator (in turn reflecting Stephen's development), and so the child-like first paragraph,     Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming   down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the   road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...   merely reflects a child narrator since Stephen is a child.  A reader who had only met Joyce via Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, might mistake this for interior monologue of some kind, but closer reading reveals that is not, or at least that is how it seems to me.   Are there any examples of interior monologue in a A Portrait? Is the example quoted above in fact a stream of consciousness / interior monologue of some sort, as argued (non authoritatively) here?  "
1447,Need of Acts in a Drama,"What's the need of Acts in a drama since scenes are sufficient enough to give the sense of places of action and shift in time. In the evolution of drama it was essentially five-act drama first which was consequently reduced to three-act, and there after to one-act play. Do we inherit the five-act play from the Greeks? What's the reason to divide a drama into five acts in the beginning?   Excuse me for asking so many questions but it seems to me that they are related. "
1448,Why do so many mystery series have prequels at the end of the series?,"Many mystery writers have a prequel as the final book in their series, usually dealing with the detective's first case, how they became a detective. Sometimes these are written many years after the other novels about that detective. Why do the authors choose to do this? Is this a way for the publishers to get the authors to write one more book--appealing to an author's desire to do something different with a character they might feel they've done everything with they could?  Examples: H.R.F. Keating (Inspector Ghote series), Gillian Linscott (Nell Bray), Leonard Tourney (the Elizabethan amateur sleuths Matthew and Joan Stock). "
1449,"Why didn't Faulkner split a 118-word sentence into three, In ""Barn Burning"" when he writes about the boy protagonist?","Prof. Brooks Landon, U. Iowa, Ph.D. U. Texas at Austin. Building Great Sentences: How to Write the Kinds of Sentences You Love to Read (Great Courses) (2013). pp 16-17.     &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;I like Faulkner as well as I like Hemingway, and I’d like to believe that even William Strunk and certainly E. B. White would not have tried to edit Faulkner out of existence. When Hemingway writes “He disliked bars and bodegas,” speaking of an old waiter in “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,” few of us would argue that his sentence is not simple and direct or that it is cluttered with needless words. But when Faulkner writes about the boy who’s the protagonist in “Barn Burning” it’s hard to see how Strunk and White’s admonition might apply:           The boy, crouched on his nail keg at the back of the crowded room, knew he smelled cheese, and more:[.] from [From] where he sat he could see the ranked shelves close-packed with the solid, squat, dynamic shapes of tin cans whose labels his stomach read, not from the lettering which meant nothing to his mind but from the scarlet devils and the silver curve of fish— [.] this [This], the cheese which he knew he smelled and the hermetic meat which his intestines believed he smelled coming in intermittent gusts momentary and brief between the other constant one, the smell and sense just a little of fear because mostly of despair and grief, the old fierce pull of the blood.         &nbsp; &nbsp; Simple and direct it most certainly is not. Both writers, Faulkner and Hemingway, introduce us to the thinking of their characters, but just as the thinking of Hemingway’s old waiter is infinitely more tired and less active than the thinking of Faulkner’s boy, the sentence each writer constructs is intended to hit us in very different ways for very different reasons. Start cutting out words and simplifying the syntax in Faulkner’s sentence and we’ll miss the complex thinking that haunts the boy throughout the story.   Why didn’t Faulkner split the sentence overhead into three, by substituting a period for the:   colon (in the second line)? dash (in the fifth last line)?   I emboldened these edits. Shorter sentences still feel more readable to me.  "
1450,What did Conrad mean by teaching to see is everything?,"Prof. Brooks Landon, U. Iowa, Ph.D. U. Texas at Austin. Building Great Sentences: How to Write the Kinds of Sentences You Love to Read (Great Courses) (2013). pp 16-17.     &nbsp; &nbsp; When I say that Christensen thought that writing really mattered, I mean that he saw sentences as means to a crucial end, much more important than clarity or effectiveness. As he put it:           The end is to enhance life—to give the self (the soul) body by wedding it to the world, to give the world life by wedding it to the self. Or, more simply, to teach to see, for that, as Conrad maintained, is everything.         &nbsp; &nbsp; His second, and more instrumental, belief was that traditional writing instruction had missed the point by advocating the subordinate clause and the complex sentence, and that “we should concentrate instead on the sentence modifiers, or free modifiers.”    What's the source of this Conrad paraphase? Is it Lord Jim? Google yielded this:      My task, which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel--it is, before all, to make you see.?    What did Conrad mean?   "
1451,How can some similes 'make comparisons' without thinking 'of one situation or thing as being something else'?,"Prof. Brooks Landon, U. Iowa, Ph.D. U. Texas at Austin. Building Great Sentences: How to Write the Kinds of Sentences You Love to Read (Great Courses) (2013). p. 121.     &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  First, prompts of comparison—figurative language. Remember the basic distinction between a simile and a metaphor is that a simile explicitly compares two things of different kinds or quality, usually introducing the comparison with like or as, while a metaphor offers a comparison of two things of different kinds or quality, but does not introduce it explicitly with words such as like or as. Thus, “She ran like a gazelle” is a simile, comparing a girl to a famously fast and graceful animal, and introducing the comparison with like. But “She gazelled her way across the field” would be a metaphor, the comparison implicit in a verb that suggests her movement had qualities that might be associated with a gazelle.   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Not every simile is a metaphor, since some similes simply make comparisons and do not ask us to think of one situation or thing as being something else, but every metaphor inherently implies the comparison we find in a simile. Both similes and metaphors make our writing more interesting and more effective. Both quickly and powerfully suggest comparisons that might be impossible to explain in any literal way. Years ago, S. I. Hayakawa noted in his classic textbook Language in Thought and Action that similes don’t actually compare two apparently dissimilar things or situations as much as they compare our feelings toward those two things or situations, thus offering a window into the way we feel, as well as the way we think.   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; As Hayakawa puts it: “The simile . . . is something of a compromise stage between the direct, unreflective expression of feeling and the report, but of course closer to the former than the latter.” He goes on to suggest that “[t]he imaginative process by which phrases such as these [similes] are coined is the same as that by which poets arrive at poetry. In poetry, there is the same love of seeing things in scientifically outrageous but emotionally expressive language.”    How can 'some similes simply make comparisons', if they 'do not ask us to think of one situation or thing as being something else'?  Doesn't the former (comparisons) imply the latter (“think[ing] of one situation or thing as being something else”)? Please help me distinguish 'some similes simply make comparisons' vs. 'think[ing] of one situation or thing as being something else'?  "
1452,What does Machiavelli mean on page 29 of The Prince?,"What does Machiavelli mean when he says the following in The Prince?     he must be a very true friend, or a thoroughly determined enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.   It's on page 29 of this PDF version of the text (in chapter 19).  Particularly I am still unsettled about “to keep faith with you” at the end. What is this adverbial phrase referring to? Because if it is regarding “he must be a very rare friend” then it makes sense. But if it is regarding “a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince” (which is more likely here because that is the phrase comes right before “to keep faith you”) then it just sounds awkward… "
1453,How do Brooks Landon's commas stress cumulative rhythms in Conrad’s “The Secret Sharer”?,"Prof. Brooks Landon, U. Iowa, Ph.D. U. Texas at Austin. Building Great Sentences: How to Write the Kinds of Sentences You Love to Read (Great Courses) (2013). p. 124 Bottom – p. 125 Top.     &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Listen to the striking opening sentence of Joseph Conrad’s story “The Secret Sharer”:           On my right hand there were lines of fishing stakes[,] resembling a mysterious system of half-submerged bamboo fences, incomprehensible in its division of the domain of tropical fishes, and crazy of aspect[,] as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen[,] now gone to the other end of the ocean; for there was no sign of human habitation as far as the eye could reach.         I’ve slightly repunctuated this sentence to emphasize its cumulative rhythms [I emboldened], but I cite it here to note how it is only when we get to the simile “as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen” that we fully understand the extent to which Conrad’s narrator has a very active imagination and loves to use it to make stories out of what he sees. In other words, while mastery of coordinate, subordinate, and mixed cumulative forms is an important goal and may tell us a lot about a writer’s syntactic skill and versatility, it doesn’t do much to distinguish the skill and versatility of one writer who writes great cumulative sentences from the skill and versatility of another writer who also can write great cumulative sentences. However, the similes these two writers will think of, the comparisons they will make, will almost certainly be different, each writer drawing from different knowledge, different experiences, and revealing different interests.    What are the 'cumulative rhythms' here? How did Landon decide where to re-punctuate the sentence? To wit, how did he decide the beginnings and ends of each of the “cumulative rhythms”?    I phoned Landon, but he replied that he doesn't have time to answer my questions.  "
1454,How can prose be musical?,"Prof. Brooks Landon, U. Iowa, Ph.D. U. Texas at Austin. Building Great Sentences: How to Write the Kinds of Sentences You Love to Read (Great Courses) (2013). p. 142     &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  And here are two very different-sounding sentences from two of Thomas Berger’s novels. The first is from his classic Little Big Man and is in the inimitable voice of Jack Crabb:           As I say, none of us understood the situation, but me and Caroline was considerably better off than the chief, because we only looked to him for our upkeep in the foreseeable future, whereas he at last decided we was demons and only waiting for dark to steal the wits from his head; and while riding along he muttered prayers and incantations to bring us bad medicine, but so ran his luck that he never saw any of the animal brothers that assisted his magic—such as Rattlesnake or Prairie Dog—but rather only Jackrabbit, who had a grudge against him of long standing because he once had kept a prairie fire off his camp by exhorting it to burn the hares’ home instead.         &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  The second example is from Berger’s retelling of the “matter of Britain” in his Arthur Rex and sounds more than a bit like Sir Thomas Malory—but like a Malory who has just mastered the cumulative sentence:           Now the abominable Sir Meliagrant took Guinevere to a kingdom that was not very distant from Britain but was cunningly concealed, tucked into a valley amongst mountains, entrance to which could be gained only by one pass not easily found, and before this pass was a rushing river over which was but one      p. 143     bridge, the narrowest in the world, for it was made of one long sword, the weapon of a giant, the which was mounted horizontally, keen edge upwards.   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  I’ve chosen these particular passages to share with you to suggest the range of prose rhythms we can hear in Woolf’s finely architected prose, Berger’s mastery of American vernacular prose rhythms, and Berger’s ability to invoke the sound of Sir Thomas Malory’s prose, but in a book whose prose is also thoroughgoingly modern. Notice that these passages are rhythmical, but not musical or even metrical—the result of the way each proceeds forward in steps rather than the result of syllable count or meter. As Ursula K. Le Guin reminds us in her delightful writing text, Steering the Craft, “The sound of language is where it all begins and what it all comes back to. The basic elements of language are physical; the noise words make and the rhythm of their relationships. This is just as true of written prose as it is of poetry.”   What does Landon mean by ‘musical’? How can prose be 'musical'? "
1455,What's Samuel Johnson truly saying about Dryden and Pope?,"Samuel Johnson wrote the following comparison between Dryden and Pope:     Pope had perhaps the judgment of Dryden; but Dryden certainly wanted the diligence of Pope. In acquired knowledge the superiority must be allowed to Dryden, whose education was more scholastick, and who before he became an author had been allowed more time for study, with better means of information. His mind has a larger range, and he collects his images and illustrations from a more extensive circumference of science. Dryden knew more of man in his general nature, and Pope in his local manners. . . . There is more dignity in the knowledge of Dryden, and more certainty in that of Pope.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The style of Dryden is capricious and varied, that of Pope is cautious and uniform; Dryden obeys the motions of his own mind; Pope constrains his mind to his own rules of composition. Dryden is sometimes vehement and rapid; Pope is always smooth, uniform, and gentle. Dryden’s page is a natural field, rising into inequalities, and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation; Pope’s is a velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe, and levelled by the roller.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of genius, that power which constitutes a poet; that quality without which judgement is cold and knowledge is inert; that energy which collects, combines, amplifies, and animates—the superiority must, with some hesitation, be allowed to Dryden. . . . Dryden’s performances were always hasty, either excited by some external occasion, or extorted by domestick necessity; he composed without consideration, and published without correction. What his mind could supply at call, or gather in one excursion, was all that he sought, and all that he gave. The dilatory caution of Pope enabled him to condense his sentiments, to multiply his images, and to accumulate all that study might produce, or chance might supply. If the flights of Dryden therefore are higher, Pope continues longer on the wing. If of Dryden’s fire the blaze is brighter, of Pope’s the heat is more regular and constant. Dryden often surpasses expectation, and Pope never falls below it. Dryden is read with frequent astonishment, and Pope with perpetual delight.   Can someone please explain or paraphrase Johnson’s writing? I don’t understand his distinctions between Dryden and Pope? They feel like elegant, but platitudinous, hokum. "
1456,What's the meaning of 'English studies of empirical studies' to be antihumanist?,"Prof. Brooks Landon, U. Iowa, Ph.D. U. Texas at Austin. Building Great Sentences: How to Write the Kinds of Sentences You Love to Read (Great Courses) (2013). pp. 245-246.      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what Connors reports has a bit of the feel of a good news/bad news joke. The good news is that he cites a number of empirical studies that seem to validate the assumption that sentence-based writing pedagogies do indeed improve writing—and do so rather dramatically. The bad news is that they have fallen out of fashion, precisely in part because of a larger suspicion in English studies of empirical studies as antihumanist and a suspicion that these teaching techniques stifle creativity, are not themselves located in larger theories of discourse, and might actually be demeaning to students, with exercises, far removed from actual writing situations, that boil down to “mere servile copying.” More bad news is that by the mid-1980s “[t]he result of all these lines of criticism of syntactic methods was that they were stopped almost dead in their tracks as a research program and ceased being a popular teaching project just a little later.” The good news, however, is that Connors concludes, “It really does seem that the current perception that somehow sentence rhetorics ‘don’t work’ exists as a massive piece of wish fulfillment.” As Connors explains (more good news!) in a sentence that is as carefully suspensive as his earlier sentence was balanced: “In other words, if people believe that research has shown that sentence rhetorics don’t work, their belief exists not because the record bears it out but because it is what people want to believe.”   I read Humanism vs. Anti-humanism?, anti-humanism??, The Rise of Antihumanism, but they're too complicated.   "
1457,Why does Browning need to be ‘manned by Manning’?,"In Robert Browning’s The Ring and the Book (1868), the narrator buys an ‘old yellow book’ at a street market in Florence, containing documents from a seventeenth-century murder trial at Rome. He considers writing a poem based on the book, and tries to discover more about the case:     I took my book to Rome first, tried truth’s power   On likely people. ""Have you met such names?   “Is a tradition extant of such facts?”   The response he receives is discouraging:     “Content you with your treasure of a book,   “And waive what’s wanting! Take a friend’s advice!   “It’s not the custom of the country. Mend   “Your ways indeed and we may stretch a point:   “Go get you manned by Manning and new-manned   “By Newman and, mayhap, wise-manned to boot   “By Wiseman, and we’ll see or else we won’t!”   What exactly are the ‘likely people’ saying here? The named individuals are English and Irish Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, that is, Henry Edward Manning, John Henry Newman, and Nicholas Wiseman. Is the suggestion that the narrator needs to convert to Catholicism before he can expect anyone to help him? "
1458,What are genres? Are they a useful concept?,"We all have an intuitive idea of what a genre is. Science Fiction, Fantasy, Mystery... these are all examples of genres. But this intuitive understanding doesn't seem to easily translate into coherent definitions. It's easy to list books that qualify as Science Fiction; it's harder to explain why, and it's even harder to find a coherent definition of Science Fiction that everyone can agree on.  So what are genres? Are they a useful concept for understanding literature? "
1459,"What is the origin of Endless' lettering styles in ""The Sandman""?","In the prologue of Season of Mists (the fifth volume), a family reunion occurs and the six Endless siblings are formally introduced, and have speaking roles:    As shown, each has a unique lettering style, which encompasses not only the letters but also the shape and colour of the speech baloons.   Todd Klein famously did the lettering for the whole run of The Sandman 1 , so I assume the lettering styles originated with him. What motivated his artistic choices? What do the lettering styles tell us about the Endless? Were the styles a collaborative effort between him, Gaiman, and the artists?   1: Except some 3 issues, where John Constanza replaced him.  "
1460,What happens at the end of The Scar by China Mieville?,"Specifically I'm trying to reconstruct in words what goes on with/in the Scar itself, as in between Hedrigall's departure and then his return on the airship. It's something to do with the whole possibility trope (like with Doul's sword), but I'm not quite sure I understand what actually goes down. Does Hedrigall just freak the Armadans out so much that they decide it's not worth it and to turn around? Also I'm sure it intersects with the decline/death of the avanc somehow?   Hopefully that's not too much of a mess. I don't need a play-by-play, I think, but if someone could reconstruct basically the impetus, the action, the crisis, and the outcome, I should be able to make sense of it. At least, as much sense as Mieville allows. I'm sure the answer to ""what happened"" is fundamentally uncertain, but I'm not sure that I even know what exactly to be uncertain about.  Thanks, and I'm happy to clarify if needed. "
1461,Complicated name features in Wuthering Heights,"In Wuthering Heights, Catherine Earnshaw and her daughter Catherine Linton constantly change their names and created confusion as to who is who. And you would all have read the part where Lockwood discovers carved variation of their names (Catherine). And the Catherines of this book change their names, such as 'Catherine Earnshaw' to 'Catherine Linton', and 'Catherine Linton' to 'Catherine Heathcliff' - soon-to-be Catherine Earnshaw.  By changing the female protagonists' names, what can be expected of its effect to our readers or the character's status in the story? Isn't this quite an uncanny aspect of the book? "
1462,Shakespeare and Iambic pentameter,"My question is, 'Is Iambic pentameter just an illusion?'  When I learned Shakespeare in school, my teacher emphasized on the thing called 'iambic pentameter'. That goes like 'du Dum du Dum......' But when I looked up at the famous 'tomorrow speech' from Macbeth, I really didn't think this isn't on Iambic pentameter. Only Iambic pentameter I can name was the line 'That strets and frets his hour upon the stage.'  So I posted a question in the other site and the answer I was given was that there is no strict iambic pentameter. No-one writes poems in strict iambic pentameter and that shakespeare isn't much of it. They said it is even debatable whether Shakespeare 'knew' what is iambic pentameter or he just followed what other people in his period wrote. I was... deeply confused?  And they say the poem I gave as an example of Iambic trimeter isn't much of Iambic either. It goes like this.  'Although the sun and moon were gone And the universe ceased to be And thou art left alone Every existence would exist in thee.'  Is my perception of Iambic completely wrong? I've  always thought that poems are to be written in iambic. I don't know why my teacher so much gave an emphasis on it. "
1463,Why is it important that 'Nowadays it's the girl who takes the initiative'?,"In Sophie's World, we have one scene that can be described as a sex scene. It's in the chapter 'The Garden Party'; page 478 in my edition. Here's the relevant part:     The guests applauded, and one of the boys threw a firecracker up in the pear tree. Joanna left the table and pulled Jeremy up off his chair. They lay down on the grass and started kissing each other again. After a while they rolled in under the red-currant bushes.   ""Nowadays it's the girl who takes the initiative,"" said Mr. Ingebrigsten.   Having said that, he got up and went over to the red-currant bushes where he stood observing the phenomenon at close quarters. The rest of the guests followed suit. Only Sophie and Alberto remained sitting at the table. The other guests now stood in a semicircle around Joanna and Jeremy.   [...]   ...fumbling with his belt.   ""Don't catch cold!"" said Mrs. Ingebrigsten.   Sophie looked despairingly at Alberto.   ""It's happening more quickly than I thought,"" he said.   What is going on in this scene? Why is it important that the girl is taking the initiative? Why does everyone go watch? What is Alberto talking about - what's happening here? "
1464,Terms for structural analysis of a non-linear narrative,"I'm struggling to identify established terms for analyzing non-linear narratives.  If the narrative chronology is the order in which events are narrated, what is the standard term for the ""internal"" chronology of the fiction itself?  And to which of the two ""chronologies"" should we seek to apply the standard structural patterns like e.g. Freytag's pyramid?  For example, in Hamlet, the event that arguably kicks off the whole sordid tale is when Claudius murders the king, but the actual narrative starts in media res with the appearance of the king's ghost. Sources disagree on which of the two events is the ""inciting incident"".  Non-linear narratives date back millennia, can it really be true that we're still struggling with the terminology? "
1465,Analysing a quote from Much Ado About Nothing,"I have analyzed a quote from the play Much Ado About Nothing with the question, ""How is reputation shown in the play?""  Leonato is a king and does not want his reputation to be ruined due to the awful acts of Hero. This is shown through the quote, ""here point a dagger into me"". Shakespeare uses ""dagger"" to show how he wanted to kill himself when his reputation was ruined. This is because if a king had a bad reputation people would hate him and no one would follow him. The audience understands how reputation was important to Leonato as a king.  Can someone please give me feedback on this analysis? Thank you. "
1466,"In what sense will ""nothing come of"" Geralt and Yennefer's relationship?","At the end of ""The Bounds of Reason"", the first story in the collection Sword of Destiny, the second of the first two Witcher short story collections, we see the following exchange between Yennefer and the dragon Villentretenmerth:     ""Forgive me my frankness and forthrightness, Yennefer. It is written all over your faces, I don't even have to try to read your thoughts. You were made for each other, you and the Witcher. But nothing will come of it. Nothing. I'm sorry.""      ""I know,"" Yennefer blanched slightly. ""I know, Villentretenmerth. But I would also like to believe there are not limits of possibility. Or at least I would like to believe that they are still very far away.""   What exactly does he mean by ""nothing will come of it""? Does it just mean that they will have no children together (due to Yennefer's barrenness), or that their relationship will not last (as it didn't last last time - indeed, they've only just got back together again)?  Is the meaning of this phrase more clear in the original Polish text? "
1467,"Why are the magicians who captured Morpheus ""rubbish""?","Neil Gaiman is on record saying the people who captured Morpheus in issue #1 (i.e. Roderick Burgess and the Order of the Ancient Mysteries) are      completely rubbish, English, sort of Crowley-esque, hedge magicians   Do they deserve this evaluation, though? For one thing, the were able to capture Morpheus. Granted, he was very weak, but then it did require some preparation on their part to do so.  Roderick Burgess was also called the Daemon King; Alex Burgess states that he had seen things that were supposedly real magic; it's mentioned once (in Kindly Ones, if memory serves) that Aleister Crowley had admitted Roderick Burgess was the best of them. It's also postulated that he was able to summon the four winds to do his bidding (and that Alex was nothing like his father in that regard). Not to mention, of course, that Roderick was able to kill Sykes once he'd lost his protection amulet.  My point is, although we don't know any of their achievements, evidence points that they were real, qualified magicians, not to the opposite. What makes Neil Gaiman say so? "
1468,Where did the Fables get all those weapons in the first place?,"In the second volume of Fables, Animal Farm, we see that the Fables possess an enormous amount of various firearms:    Where did they come from? Snow White states in the first volume that Fables are on a tight budget. She also states most of them couldn't save their wealths from Fable Land when they ran away.  Even past that, had they had those they'd use them to fight the adversary. This all leads me to believe the Animal Farm acquired those weapons after they escaped, and did so in secret, so that the Fabletown didn't know.  Is it ever explained, maybe in the future volumes (I'm only on volume II), where they got the weapons from? "
1469,When did Sophie and Alberto become real?,"At what point did Sophie and Alberto become real? When did they become more than a character in a book? Or were they always 'real', and they only needed the book to be written for things to happen and so that they could escape? We know that Sophie has memories from before the events of the book, but did those events actually happen or was she 'created' at that moment and the memories implanted by the major? "
1470,How much of the original verse is lost in Fitzgerald's translation of The Aeneid?,"I checked out The Aeneid from the library and read it today. I found it a bit easier to read than I'd expected (I guess I expected worse-than-Shakespearean language/turns of phrase) and then I realized that of course, it had been translated from Latin.  As I read through, I found kind of odd phrasing here and there, that made me wonder how different it was from the original text. I also found it really hard to discern the meter (apparently, it's written in dactylic hexameter) but would it have been easier to hear in the original language, and perhaps there was also more rhyme in the original?   Could there also have been ""clever"" pieces of writing, like puns and such, that you can't pick up in the language?  In short: how much was lost in translation? (My copy was the translation by Robert Fitzgerald.) "
1471,Why does only one of R. S. Thomas' poems conform to traditional poetic devices?,"R.S. Thomas was a Welsh poet who worked between 1942 until his death in 2000. His poems are almost exclusively modern in structure, in the sense that they eschew meter and rhyme in favour of a more prose-like structure. Here's a short example:     Looking upon this tree with its quaint pretension   Of holding the earth, a leveret, in its claws,   Or marking the texture of its living bark,   A grey sea wrinkled by the winds of years,   I understand whence this man's body comes,   In veins and fibres, the bare boughs of bone,   The trellised thicket, where the heart, that robin,   Greets with a song the seasons of the blood.          But where in meadow or mountain shall I match   The individual accent of the speech   That is the ear's familiar? To what sun attribute   The honeyed warmness of his smile?   To which of the deciduous brood is germane   The angel peeping from the latticed eye?       One of his poems, however, is quite different in structure:     One night of tempest I arose and went   Along the Menai shore on dreaming bent;   The wind was strong, and savage swung the tide,   And the waves blustered on Caernarvon side.        But in the morrow, when I passed that way,   On Menai’s shore the hush of heaven lay;   The wind was gentle and the sea a flower,   And the sun slumbered on Caernavon tower.     Why does this - and, as far as I can tell only this - poem, entitled Night and Morning, among his work conform to traditional poetic structures? "
1472,Benvolio and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet,"What do the characters of Benvolio and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet symbolize, if anything? Mercutio's character mainly provides jokes, and then, in his hot-headedness, is slain by Tybalt.   Benvolio at first tries to take Romeo's mind of Rosaline, and then tries to stop the violence between first Tybalt and Mercutio with Romeo, and then between Romeo and Tybalt. He then, after Romeo kills Tybalt, reports to the Prince of Venice what happened.  Do these two characters have any special meaning, represent any quality in particular, or represent some person from Shakespeare's time that members of the audience would have recognized? "
1473,Should I read 'A Scandal in Bohemia' before I read 'A Study in Scarlet'?,"Is it important to read 'A Study in Scarlet' before 'A Scandal in Bohemia'? I have heard that the former is the first book by Sir Arthur Connal Doyle. And it gives initial insights into the character of the protagonists. However, I found the prose of 'A Scandal in Bohemia' more appealing as per my tastes after flipping through the first few pages of a reading app. Hence, I want to pick up this book first. So, would it be a problem if I study 'A Scandal in Bohemia' before I read 'A Study in Scarlet'? "
1474,Children's book about an evil wizard and a giant,"I remember reading a short book as a child about an evil wizard and a giant. I don't remember all the details, but I do remember that the story ends with the wizard attempting to turn either the giant or the local town to stone, and his spell his reflected back at him (I think by a mirror owned by the giant?), which turns the wizard to stone instead.  Does anyone know what this story might be? It had a really distinctive art style, if I remember correctly. I think the latest it could've possibly been published would be the late 90's, but I suspect it might be a bit older than that. "
1475,Why did the Looters meet with Hank Reardon in the same suite that Francisco D'Anconia used to lease?,"When Hank Reardon met with the Looters to discuss the Steel Unification Plan, he noted with some consternation that they were meeting in the same suite at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel that Francisco d'Anconia used to lease before he disappeared completely.  Why did they meet there? Was this due to its personal effect on Hank Reardon, or was Ayn Rand going for symbolism here (i.e. the Looters were, in some sense, trying to replace talented people like Francisco)? Or did Ayn Rand do this mostly for the irony? "
1476,Why is 'Hamlet' considered one of the very best plays ever?,"When an intellectual work (philosophy book, literary book, painting etc) is studied there are (at least) two principal questions to be addressed:   What is this work about? Why is this work important?   These questions are very intimately interrelated.  For example, if you know more precisely what is this work about then you can answer more convincingly why this may be important.  Also, if you know why this work is important then this may shed light on some cardinal aspects of the work and it may make you understand it better.  But these two questions are (probably) not identical because to start with the latter question needs significantly more the historical context of the intellectual work to be addressed and also perhaps some comparative analysis in general so that the question is more precisely answered.  In a quite interesting way, although many people can answer the former question about an intellectual work they usually are not so confident or convincing when answering the latter question. (See also here when I asked the same question about the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus - nobody really gave an inclusive answer)  In any case, I want to ask the latter question about 'Hamlet': Why is 'Hamlet' considered one of the very best plays ever?  It may be that the existential monologue of Hamlet is a quite strong advocate of why this play should be considered so important as it addresses the topic about what is the meaning of life and when life loses to such extent its meaning that death is almost mandatory.  But still, in my opinion, this is only a part of the play and it is not exactly its overarching theme and in this regard the play should not be evaluated only on this.  Another factor which may make the play (considered as) great is the unique alternation of extreme emotions and behaviors which certainly makes the play rich as a kaleidoscope of human psychology.   Just to make clear that I am not saying that Hamlet is not or should not be considered as a great theatrical play but I just want to see some compelling arguments/evidence from people who has seriously read it.  I would strongly prefer a comprehensive answer and not a too brief one. "
1477,"Meaning of a passage in ""Persuasion"" by Jane Austen","Please refer to this extract from chapter 14 of Jane Austen's Persuasion:     Elizabeth’s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some   interest. Mr Elliot was in Bath. He had called in Camden Place; had   called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive: if   Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking   as much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the   connexion, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect. This was   very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of   very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already   recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his   being ‘a man whom she had no wish to see.’ She had a great wish to see   him. If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch,   he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal   tree. Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance; but   she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was   more than she could say for many other persons in Bath. She was put   down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings,   in Rivers Street.   Questions:   The above extract says that Mr. Elliot, Anne's cousin, was in Bath. Then I can't understand the following line: ""He had called in Camden Place; had called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive"". What does the phrase ""called in"" mean? ""if Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves"". Why would Elizabeth and her father deceive themselves?  Why does Lady Russell hold negative opinions about Mr. Elliot? Who thinks: ""If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.""?  "
1478,How does it improve the book to show the major's power?,"In Sophie's World, as the end of the book approaches, crazier and crazier things begin to happen - dramatic storms, fairy tale characters in the forest, geese that carry people around, strange garden parties, and so forth. The purpose seems to be that it shows the power the author (well, not really the author, the in-book author, the major) has over the world.   But why is this shown through such fantastic events? I can understand inserting some irony (""breaking the fourth wall"" so to speak) and lots of birthday references, but the fairy tale characters for the most part seem kind of random, and the whole party is just weird (though Alberto does suspect the crashing of the white Mercedes distracted the major so they could escape).  What was the purpose in making the ending so fantastic and wildly different from the rest of the book? "
1479,"What exactly is the ""No Ordinary Sun""?","The poem ""No Ordinary Sun"" by the Maori poet Hone Tuwhare is about a tree's reaction to some kind of deadly threat, the titular ""no ordinary sun"". Addressing the tree in the second person, the poem warns that it will no longer live happily as before and that there's no point in resisting its fate.  You can read the poem in full e.g. here; it's only five verses long.  Can we tell for sure what is the catastrophe threatening the tree? My immediate thought when reading the poem was that it could be a nuclear weapon, but is this the only sensible interpretation? Could it also be a more conventional bomb or explosion? Could it even be the actual sun itself, just having become much hotter and more uncomfortable due to climate change? "
